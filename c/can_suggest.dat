5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E

5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Location {{and time}} of day: Establishing or {{altering}} position in time and space. Blues <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> night time while orange and red <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> a sunrise or sunset. Use of mechanical filters ("gobos") to project sky scenes, the Moon, etc.|$|E

25|$|Colorless urine {{indicates}} over-hydration, generally {{preferable to}} dehydration (though it can remove essential salts from the body). Colorless urine in drug tests <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> {{an attempt to}} avoid detection of illicit drugs in the bloodstream through over-hydration.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{regulate}} the marketing {{and sale of}} Beef by observing criteria post slaughter and classifying the observed quality of the meat. This classification, sometimes optional, <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> a market demand for a particular animal's attributes and therefore the price owed to the producer.|$|E
25|$|Tells on {{the second}} deal include changes in pace when a second is made, {{variations}} in the dealing card noise on a second, strange deck movements when dealing a second, or odd finger movements. Odd grips are sometimes employed, which <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> someone is not dealing honestly.|$|E

25|$|Reduplication {{of verbal}} roots {{suggests}} a process lacking a focus or decisive goal. The following examples describe events which have no apparent end, {{in the sense}} of lacking purpose or completion. A lack of seriousness may also be implied. Similarly, reduplication <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> a background process {{in the midst of a}} foreground activity, as shown in (5).|$|E
25|$|Upselling {{and cross}} selling are {{sometimes}} known as suggestive selling. When the consumer has selected their main purchase, sales assistants {{can try to}} sell the customer on a premium brand or higher quality item (up-selling) or <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> complementary purchases (cross-selling). For instance, if a customer purchases a non-stick frypan, the sales assistant might suggest plastic slicers that do not damage the non-stick surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{usually is}} made serologically (through complement fixation) and by exclusion of other causes of inguinal lymphadenopathy or genital ulcers. Serologic testing has a sensitivity of 80% after 2 weeks. Serologic testing {{may not be}} specific for serotype (has some cross reactivity with other chlamydia species) and <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> LGV from other forms because of their difference in dilution, 1:64 {{more likely to be}} LGV and lower than 1:16 is likely to be other chlamydia forms (emedicine).|$|E

25|$|For the consumer, channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E
25|$|While {{many factors}} can {{increase}} risk for ISP or RISP, {{they can be}} avoided with minor lifestyle changes. By maintaining a regular sleep schedule and observing good sleep hygiene, one can reduce chances of sleep paralysis. It helps subjects to reduce the intake of stimulants and stress in daily life by taking up a hobby or seeing a trained psychologist who <b>can</b> <b>suggest</b> coping mechanisms for stress. However, some cases of ISP and RISP involve a genetic factor—which means some people may find sleep paralysis unavoidable. Practicing meditation regularly might also be helpful in preventing fragmented sleep, and thus the occurrence of sleep paralysis. Research has shown that long-term meditation practitioners {{spend more time in}} slow wave sleep, and as such regular meditation practice could reduce nocturnal arousal and thus possibly sleep paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{dwelling}} {{is designed}} in the Federation Bungalow style and built predominantly of jarrah. In 1914 Dr James Battye in his Cyclopedia of Western Australia described the dwelling as follows:From the substantial foundation to the shingle roof {{every part of the}} structure is of jarrah, and after nearly twenty years - the house having been built in 1894 – every plank and beam and joist remain in as sound condition as when first they were cut to the contractor's design. Over twenty rooms are roofed beneath these jarrah shingles, and the interior is fitted up with all that art and comfort <b>can</b> <b>suggest,</b> while surrounding the house is a park of ten acres, tastefully laid out with lawns and flower-beds, and further beautified by the introduction of decorative statuary in bronze, collected by Mr McNeil on various trips to England and the Continent.|$|E
