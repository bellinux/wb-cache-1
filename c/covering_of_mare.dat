40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was made of}} the reproductive utilization <b>of</b> <b>mares</b> from the Purebred Arabian and Shagya-Arabian breed in the only National State Stud Farm Kabiyuk near Shumen. Stud book records and the breeding registers for a 32 -year period (1980 - 2012) were used for the analysis. Thirty-nine Purebred Arabian mares and 52 mares from the Shagya-Arabian breed were included in the study. It was established that the average (LS) age at first <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mares</b> <b>of</b> Purebred Arabian breed was 1584, 2 ± 29, 5 days (4, 34 years), the average age at first fertilization was 1682, 9 ± 24, 1 days (4, 61 years) and the average age at first foaling was 2117, 7 ± 69, 9 days (5, 80 years). For the mares from the Shagya-Arabian breed, the average values of those traits were 1617, 1 ± 18, 1 (4, 43 years), 1673, 9 ± 18, 8 (4, 59 years) and 2202, 4 ± 53, 9 days (6, 03 years), respectively. The mares from the Purebred Arabian breed were used for breeding for 11, 0 ± 1, 04 years in average, to the age of 15, 3 ± 1, 06 years, and those of Shagya-Arabian breed for 12, 2 ± 1, 01 years to the age of 16, 4 ± 1, 19 years, respectively.

40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{socio-economic}} status, horse feeding and management adopted by horse owners of Rajasthan. Materials and Methods: Primary {{data was collected}} through specially structured proforma by personal interview method from the horse owners of Hanumangarh (50), Churu (42), Jhunjhunu (30) and Jalore (40) districts of Rajasthan, India. Results: The district (Churu and Jhunjhunu) is mostly rain fed, Hanumangarh is canal-irrigated whereas Jalore is tube well irrigated. Majority of respondents engaged in horse rearing were of other backward class (OBC) & general category. Literacy (%) among the horse owners was more than 80 % in Hanumangarh and Jhunjhunu districts, whereas {{it was less than}} 50 % in Churu and Jalore districts. Majority of the respondents were maintaining other livestock along with the horses. The average dry roughages provided were 4. 82 ± 0. 22, 8. 143 ± 0. 348, 5. 267 ± 0. 69 and 6. 105 ± 0. 196 kg per horse in Hanumangarh, Churu, Jhunjhunu and Jalore, respectively. The average concentrate offered was 2. 81 ± 0. 138, 2. 452 ± 0. 145, 2. 933 ± 0. 160 and 1. 950 ± 0. 200 kg per horse in Hanumangarh, Churu, Jhunjhunu and Jalore, respectively. It was observed that horse owners were providing green fodder, dry roughages and concentrate depending up on the availability/production of these items in that region. Majority of horse owners were allowing <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> estrus <b>mares</b> between 3 rd and 5 th day of estrus. Paucity of quality stallions for covering the mares was observed throughout the area surveyed. The respondents had to pay between Rs. 1100 /- to 5100 /- as covering fee with no guarantee of conception. Most <b>of</b> <b>mares</b> were rebred during foal heat and majority of the respondents were not aware about the symptoms <b>of</b> estrus <b>mare.</b> Vaccination, insurance and use of disinfectants were not adopted in the study indicating the least awareness among the horse owners about the importance of vaccination, insurance and disinfectants. Conclusion: Horses were being maintained for ceremonial purposes and breeding, their feeding in terms of fodder (green & dry) and concentrate were observed area specific and were fulfilling the minimum nutrient requirements. There was paucity of true to breed stallions in the areas studied. [Vet World 2013; 6 (8. 000) : 470 - 475...|$|R

5000|$|Expected {{to follow}} in the {{footsteps}} of Shadai's great sires Northern Taste and Sunday Silence, War Emblem had problems in the breeding shed. [...] "We know he is fertile, but he has no interest in mares," [...] said Dr. Nubuo Tsunoda, the farm's director. For his first year at stud in 2003, only four foals were produced in 2004. His second year was more successful, resulting in nineteen colts and fifteen fillies born in 2005. However, his third crop born in 2006 consisted of only four colts and one filly. In the next two years, War Emblem rejected nearly every mare presented to him so no foals were produced in 2007 and 2008. On June 8, 2008, War Emblem was evaluated by a stallion behavior team from the University of Pennsylvania. They suggested that he should be separated from other stallions to help improve his confidence. The measures seemed to help War Emblem in the 2009 breeding season, with a career record of 43 foals born in 2010. However, War Emblem reverted to his old habits in 2010, only <b>covering</b> 5 <b>of</b> 300 <b>mares</b> presented to him in the season. In 2012, he covered only three <b>mares,</b> none <b>of</b> which became pregnant. In total, he sired only 106 registered foals between 2004 and 2011.|$|R
