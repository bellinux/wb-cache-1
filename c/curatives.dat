2500|$|Vulcanization {{refers to}} a {{specific}} curing process of rubber involving high heat {{and the addition of}} sulfur or other equivalent <b>curatives.</b> It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of sulfur atoms or carbon-to-carbon bonds. A vast array of products are made with vulcanized rubber including ice hockey pucks, tires, shoe soles, hoses and many more. When [...] "rubber fever" [...] struck Boston in the 1830s, there was a large consumer demand for products made of rubber- aprons, life preservers, hats, carriage tops, and, by 1836, waterproof shoes. But in the heat of summer, rubber goods turned into a gooey, foul-smelling mess; in the winter, they froze stiff. In 1839, Charles Goodyear had a breakthrough when he mixed liquid latex with sulfur and heating it in the sun or over a stove top. The leather-like form of the stretchable substance resulted in the first vulcanized rubber. Goodyear received a patent on June 15, 1844.|$|E

Yalom (1975) writes extensively on <b>curative</b> factors in his well-known text. Corsini and Rosenberg (1955), {{in their study of}} 300 pre- 1955 articles, identified 175 statements which they subsumed under nine categories, or <b>curative</b> factors. Yalom and his colleagues (Liebermann et al., 1972; Yalom et al., 1967, 1975) researched the relative importance of <b>curative</b> factors as perceived by group members.

Subjects in the Yalom et al. study (1975) were well-educated, middle-socioeconomic-class outpatients in long-term therapy. Using the 60 items and a Q-sort method, group members ranked interpersonal learning (input), catharsis, and cohesiveness as the three important <b>curative</b> factors, and family reenactment, guidance, and identification as least important.

The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate the results of resecting the local recurrence of rectal cancer and to analyze factors that might predict <b>curative</b> re-resection and those that affect survival. Forty-seven patients who underwent resection for locally recurrent rectal cancer formed the basis of the study. Twenty- four were <b>curative</b> in nature, and the others were palliative. There was no operative mortality, and the complication rate was 38 %. The median survival of the whole group was 16. 5 months. The ability to perform <b>curative</b> resection was found to be the only independent factor associated with improved survival. Female gender is a significant factor associated with <b>curative</b> resection of local recurrence. In patients with <b>curative</b> re-resection, local control is up to 87 %.

5000|$|Epoxy {{is either}} {{any of the}} basic {{components}} or the cured end products of epoxy resins, {{as well as a}} colloquial name for the epoxide functional group. [...] Epoxy resins, also known as polyepoxides, are a class of reactive prepolymers and polymers which contain epoxide groups. Epoxy resins may be reacted (cross-linked) either with themselves through catalytic homopolymerisation, or {{with a wide range of}} co-reactants including polyfunctional amines, acids (and acid anhydrides), phenols, alcohols and thiols. These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or <b>curatives,</b> and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing. Reaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a thermosetting polymer, often with high mechanical properties, temperature and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics / electrical components/LED, high tension electrical insulators, paint brushes manufacturing, fiber-reinforced plastic materials and structural adhesives.|$|E

While survival after <b>curative</b> resection seems not worse than in older patients, few {{data are available}} about the overall survival of younger patient with {{colorectal cancer}} irrespective of receiving a <b>curative</b> treatment or not. In this study we have reviewed our experience with patients under 45 years of age affected by colorectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 358 patients with colorectal cancer were operated on between 2001 and 2005. Nineteen patients were younger than 45. Schedules were reviewed as to palliative vs <b>curative</b> resection, Duke's classification, tumor grading, and compared with data from patients older than 45. RESULTS: Though {{no significant difference in}} survival can be detected after <b>curative</b> resection, fewer patients less than 45 years are eligible to be treated curatively. Significantly worse tumor grading and rates of <b>curative</b> resection make for a poorer prognosis in younger patients when compared with older ones.
