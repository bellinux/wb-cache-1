50|$|The late 1960s {{and early}} 1970s brought several {{challenges}} to General Host. First, in March 1968, {{a federal grand}} jury indicted seven baking concerns and eight of their officials on charges of illegally conspiring to fix bread prices in the Philadelphia area. Among these companies and officials were General Host, its president, and the regional manager of Bond Baking. As a result, General Host and the other bakeries agreed in 1971 to certify that each sealed bid for the sale of bakery products in the Philadelphia area had not involved <b>collusive</b> <b>activity.</b> In a similar case, four companies, including General Host, pleaded no contest in 1972 to a charge of fixing bread prices in the New York metropolitan region. Three of the four, including General Host, were fined $50,000 each.|$|E
40|$|Hard Core Cartels aim to design, {{being aware}} of the {{presence}} of an antitrust authority, market practices granting avoidance of antitrust investigations. We show, in a dynamic game, that they can reach this goal and get extra [...] normal profits. However, the bulk of this opportunity does not lay, here, in limiting price changes across periods (as in Harrington [2004 b]), but rather in sending a signal to the authority which has a twofold effect: (1) it does make evident that cartel's members are currently not engaged in an ``excessive'' degree of collusion, (2) it credibly shows that this moderate <b>collusive</b> <b>activity</b> has a persistence effect, i. e. it will be maintained also in future periods. We also show that antitrust remedies (e. g. behavioral constraints or injunction reliefs) are more powerful, in limiting the <b>collusive</b> <b>activity,</b> than fines. Last, we show that social welfare is higher if Hard Core Cartels have limited information about the type of authority (i. e. tough or accommodating) they are facing. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} firm owners' {{incentives to}} implement Competition Law Compliance Programs as imperfect monitoring devices in a principal-agent setup {{and the interaction}} effects with bonus contracts. The manager chooses working effort and has the option to cartelize. The model reveals a non-monotonic relationship between profit targets and incentives to collude. Contrary to intuition, {{it might be the}} case that low instead of high profit targets facilitate collusion. This result is driven by the threat of detection and punishment. A Compliance Program deters the agent from misbehavior and enhances effort as long as the agent did not engage in <b>collusive</b> <b>activity.</b> Additionally, the owner can use the Program as an insurance against fines...|$|E

This paper reveals the profits made by firms in the trucking industry were because of greater efficiencies than their competitors and not because of <b>collusive</b> <b>activities.</b> Public Economics,...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{powerful}} and user-friendly program for numerically solving first price auction problems where an arbitrary number of bidders draw independent valuations from heterogenous distributions and the auctioneer imposes a reserve price for the object. The heterogeneity in this model arises both from the specification of ex-ante heterogenous, non-uniform distributions of private values for bidders, {{as well as the}} possibility of subsets of these bidders colluding. The technique extends the work of Marshall, Meurer, Richard, and Stromquist (1994), where they applied backward recursive Taylor series expansion techniques to solve two-player asymmetric first price auctions under uniform distribu-tions. The algorithm is also used to numerically investigate whether revenue equivalence between first price and second price auctions in symmetric models extend to the asym-metric case. In particular, we simulate the model under various environments and find evidence that under the assumption of first order stochastic dominance, the first price auction generates higher expected revenue to the seller, while the second price auction is more susceptible to <b>collusive</b> <b>activities.</b> However, when the assumption of first order stochastic dominance is relaxed, and the distributions of private values cross once, the ev-idence suggests that the second price auction may in some cases generate higher expected revenue to the seller...|$|R
40|$|This paper makes a {{preliminary}} attempt to model {{a phenomenon of}} collaborative tax evasion between a seller and his customer and incorporates the social norm into such <b>collusive</b> tax-evading <b>activities.</b> It is found that, due {{to the existence of}} the social norm, more prevalent collaborative tax evasion at the status quo tends to intensify the extent of the tax evasion itself; this thus furnishes a self-fulfilling equilibrium and it may also give rise to multiple equilibria. More importantly, we find that the snowballing effect stemming from social norm has a decisive influence not only in determining the conformity of consumers to the tax code, but also the deterrent effect of the authority's tax enforcement. If collaborative tax evasion is initially rampant, raising fines for tax evasion will give rise to a strong venal effect that will increase tax evasion. Once this perverse effect outweighs the usual deterrent effect associated with raising fines for tax evasion, a more severe fine may result in higher rather than lower tax evasion.

40|$|If {{there is}} a cartel {{agreement}} among a subset of firms in an industry, it should be predicted that all firms in that industry will increase prices. Nevertheless, industry prices alone should not indicate that a particular firm is guilty of that conspiracy. According to the output test and its market share variant if the output or the market share of the firm that claims to be innocent in the <b>collusive</b> <b>activity</b> rises {{in response to the}} price increase, that firm's claim should be accepted as true. Using a collusive variant of the dominant firm model, this paper shows that these are not robust tests to reveal innocence or guilt, and characterizes cases where they may pardon a guilty firm (Type I error) or indict an innocent firm (Type II error). This paper also shows that a market share test {{can not be used to}} prove a dominant firm's intent for predatory pricing JEL Classification: G 18, L 41, K 4...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} on collusion in procurement markets uses static mechanism design theory {{to address the}} limitations on <b>collusive</b> <b>activity</b> imposed by asymmetric information, but in most instances it does not address how to enforce the proposed mechanisms. This paper uses repeated game theory to examine the sustainability of two commonly reported collusive schemes that {{have been identified as}} optimal static mechanisms. If a buyer does not select its reserve price strategically, or if its value is large relative to the sellers' costs, then collusion may be sustainable {{for a wide range of}} plausible discount factors. However, even mildly sophisticated reserve price selection can dramatically shrink the set of discount factors for which collusion can be sustained. These ndings provide a rationale for existing arguments that buyers are vulnerable to collusion, but suggest that buyers possess tools that may protably induce sellers to act competitively. The analysis also reveals that collusion tends to be more easily sustained if the sellers' costs have a low mean or a high variance, or, in some instances, if the number of sellers increases...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to create more {{consistently}} pro-competitive antitrust policies, many countries have eliminated or restricted antitrust exemptions for firms engaged in export activity. Of the fifty-six countries surveyed, we find only seventeen which offer exporters an exemption from domestic antitrust laws. Thirty-three countries provide no exemption from antitrust laws for export activity, but exempt such activity implicitly: their competition laws are silent on restrictive activities that affect foreign markets. Within the last decade, at least ten countries have rewritten their laws, moving from explicit exemptions to this more passive policy of speaking only to the domestic market. However, the construction of national antitrust laws that ban only activity that harms domestic competition leaves a vacuum in which export cartels can operate with no obvious institution to restrict their activities or limit adverse effects on competition. The elimination of reporting requirements has reduced {{the information that we}} have about their activities. International cooperation to regulate and prosecute <b>collusive</b> <b>activity</b> affecting international markets could rationalize these policies and promote competition more effectively than the current haphazard set of national laws...|$|E
40|$|Community Question Answering (CQA) portals provide rich {{sources of}} {{information}} {{on a variety of}} topics. However, the authenticity and quality of questions and answers (Q&As) has proven hard to control. In a troubling direction, the widespread growth of crowdsourcing websites has created a large-scale, potentially difficult-to-detect workforce to manipulate malicious contents in CQA. The crowd workers who join the same crowdsourcing task about promotion campaigns in CQA collusively manipulate deceptive Q&As for promoting a target (product or service). The collusive spamming group can fully control the sentiment of the target. How to utilize the structure and the attributes for detecting manipulated Q&As? How to detect the collusive group and leverage the group information for the detection task? To shed light on these research questions, we propose a unified framework to tackle the challenge of detecting <b>collusive</b> spamming <b>activities</b> of CQA. First, we interpret the questions and answers in CQA as two independent networks. Second, we detect collusive question groups and answer groups from these two networks respectively by measuring the similarity of the contents posted within a short duration. Third, using attributes (individual-level and group-level) and correlations (user-based and content-based), we proposed a combined factor graph model to detect deceptive Q&As simultaneously by combining two independent factor graphs. With a large-scale practical data set, we find that the proposed framework can detect deceptive contents at early stage, and outperforms a number of competitive baselines...|$|R
40|$|In their article, Sources of the Crisis in Liability Insurance: An Economic Analysis, Richard Clarke, Frederick Warren-Boulton, David Smith, and Marilyn Simon (2 ̆ 2 {{the authors}} 2 ̆ 2) of the Justice Department 2 ̆ 7 s Antitrust Division confirm the {{insurance}} industry 2 ̆ 7 s view that the limited federal antitrust exemption accorded to the industry under the McCarran- Ferguson Act did {{not contribute to the}} crisis in property-casualty insurance which occurred in 1985 and 1986. Indeed, their report dispels some of the myths that have been perpetuated by industry critics, who have attributed the blame for the liability crisis to (1) <b>collusive</b> <b>activity</b> by insurers, (2) price increases by inefficient and inept insurance companies damaged by their investment losses in the early 1980 s, and (3) inadequate state insurance regulation. The authors substantiate the views of the Justice Department 2 ̆ 7 s Tort Policy Working Group, which in two earlier analyses concluded that these factors were unlikely to have caused the crisis. The Working Group concluded that changing patterns in our civil justice system are the principal cause of the liability crisis...|$|E
40|$|The {{implications}} of the intricate pattern of relationships formed by company directors holding positions on multiple corporate boards, or 'interlocking', have long {{been the subject of}} speculation and investigation. While this web of inter-firm relationships is no longer regarded as prime facia evidence of <b>collusive</b> <b>activity,</b> {{a growing body of research}} on US firms has identified a range of performance effects on firms associated with information flows in these networks. Yet research on the role of director networks and firm performance is far from comprehensive and has largely been limited to the largest US corporates. This paper extends the existing research in this field by drawing together the principal findings to date and testing these in a different national context and with a much larger dataset than used previously. The relationship between director interlocks and corporate performance is examined among 6428 UK firms, those with annual turnover of £ 100 million or more. Social network and regression analysis is used to detect significant relationships between the pattern of director interlinking and corporate performance. A number of significant relationships are identified, broadly consistent with the US research but some phenomena distinctive to the UK is found, reflecting differences in the structure and sociology of capital markets in the two countries. In particular the role of executive directors is much less significant to the general financial performance of UK firms than to US firms and is more focused on reputational concerns in capital markets...|$|E
