In this paper, numerical computations are carried out for Mach 6 flows over a 7 -degree half-angle cone with two different flow incidence angles and a <b>compression</b> <b>cone</b> with a large concave curvature. Instability wave and transition-related flow physics are investigated using a series of advanced stability methods ranging from conventional linear stability theory (LST) and a higher-fidelity linear and nonlinear parabolized stability equations (PSE), to the 2 D eigenvalue analysis based on partial differential equations. Computed N factor distribution pertinent to various instability mechanisms over the cone surface provides initial assessments of possible transition fronts and a guide to corresponding disturbance characteristics such as frequency and azimuthal wave numbers.

An injected CT relaxes to a minimum magnetic energy equilibrium, moves into a <b>compression</b> <b>cone,</b> and enters a conducting cylinder where the plasma is heated to fusion-producing temperature. The CT then passes into a blanketed region where fusion energy is produced and, on emergence from the fusion region, the CT undergoes controlled expansion in an exit cone where an alternating poloidal field opens the flux surfaces to directly recover the CT magnetic energy as current which is returned to the formation gun. The CT String Reactor (CTSTR) reactor satisfies all the necessary MHD stability requirements {{and is based on}} extrapolation of experimentally achieved formation, stability, and plasma confinement.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{development of}} G rtler instability over a concave surface {{gives rise to}} a highly distorted stationary flow in the boundary layer that has strong velocity gradients in both spanwise and wall-normal directions. This distorted flow is susceptible to strong, high frequency secondary instability that leads to the onset of transition. For high Mach number flows, the boundary layer is also subject to the second mode instability. The nonlinear development of G rtler vortices and the ensuing growth and breakdown of secondary instability, the G rtler vortex interactions with second mode instabilities as well as oblique second mode interactions are examined in the context of both internal and external hypersonic configurations using nonlinear parabolized stability equations, 2 -D eigenvalue analysis and direct numerical simulation. For G rtler vortex development inside the Purdue Mach 6 Ludwieg tube wind tunnel, multiple families of unstable secondary eigenmodes are identified and their linear and nonlinear evolution is examined. The computation of secondary instability is continued past the onset of transition to elucidate the physical mechanisms underlying the laminar breakdown process.

40|$|Second mode {{disturbances}} {{dominate the}} primary instability stage of transition {{in a number}} of hypersonic flow configurations. The highest amplification rates of second mode disturbances are usually associated with 2 D (or axisymmetric) perturbations and, therefore, a likely scenario for the onset of the three-dimensionality required for laminar-turbulent transition corresponds to the parametric amplification of 3 D secondary instabilities in the presence of 2 D, finite amplitude second mode disturbances. The secondary instability of second mode disturbances is studied for selected canonical flow configurations. The basic state for the secondary instability analysis is obtained by tracking the linear and nonlinear evolution of 2 D, second mode disturbances using nonlinear parabolized stability equations. Unlike in previous studies, the selection of primary disturbances used for the secondary instability analysis was based on their potential relevance to transition in a low disturbance environment and the effects of nonlinearity on the evolution of primary disturbances was accounted for. Strongly nonlinear effects related to the self-interaction of second mode disturbances lead to an upstream shift in the upper branch neutral location. Secondary instability computations confirm the previously known dominance of subharmonic modes at relatively small primary amplitudes. However, for the Purdue Mach 6 <b>compression</b> <b>cone</b> configuration, it was shown that a strong fundamental secondary instability can exist for a range of initial amplitudes of the most amplified second mode disturbance, indicating that the exclusive focus on subharmonic modes in the previous applications of secondary instability theory to second mode primary instability may not have been fully justified...|$|E

40|$|The Purdue laser {{perturber}} was refurbished {{and prepared}} {{for use in the}} Boeing/AFOSR Mach- 6 Quiet Tunnel (BAM 6 QT). The laser perturber is to create controlled perturbations in the freestream flow for receptivity studies. Measurements were similar to those by McGuire, Schmisseur and Salyer. Pressure and time-of-arrival measurements of the perturbations created by the laser agree well with theory, except when taken close to the perturbation. This could be due to shortcomings of the theory or to attenuation in the sensors, due to their low frequency response. An optical system for the BAM 6 QT was also designed. ^ Natural transition in fully quiet flow is difficult to produce and it has likely not been seen before. Thus, a flared cone was designed to produce large second-mode waves which might lead to transition in quiet flow. Pressure fluctuations were measured with PCB fast pressure sensors, and temperature-sensitive paints (TSP) were used to visualize heat transfer {{on the surface of the}} <b>compression</b> <b>cone.</b> PCB measurements show that growth of the second-mode waves occurs under noisy flow, but not always as expected under quiet flow. The TSP measurements revealed streamwise streaks under quiet flow that were not present under noisy flow. These streaks had not been seen before. Small roughness dots were used to change the spacing of the streaks; these also then affected the location of transition. Surprisingly high computed N-factors at transition were found for this cone. In noisy flow, the computed N-factor at transition onset is 9. It is unclear if transition is seen in quiet flow on a smooth flared cone.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} numerical simulation study of linear hypersonic boundary-layer receptivity and stability over blunt <b>compression</b> <b>cones</b> with freestream hotspot perturbations. This study is conducted for freestream disturbances with broad, continuous frequency spectra over cones that have nose radii of 1, 0. 5 and 0. 1 mm under freestream conditions of Mach 6, 10 and 15. The simulations {{are carried out}} using the high-order shock-fitting finite-difference scheme developed by Zhong (1998), the results of which are shown to agree well with linear stability theory (LST) and experiments. The general receptivity mechanism is then studied by the simulation-LST comparisons under two parametric effects: nose bluntness and freestream Mach number. Among the new findings of the current study, the mechanisms of the receptivity process {{are found to be}} mainly caused by the fast acoustic waves that are generated behind the bow shock from the hotspot/shock interaction in the nose region. It is these fast acoustic waves that substantially enter the boundary layer and generate mode F through the synchronization of fast acoustic waves and mode F in the upstream part of the cone. Subsequently, the synchronization of modes F and S generates mode S, or the second mode, which eventually grows into a dominant level at the downstream part of the cone. Additionally, we have obtained the receptivity coefficients of mode S along the Branch-I neutral stability curve using a method that combines LST predicted N-factors and simulated disturbance amplitudes. These receptivity coefficients agree well with those obtained from the theoretical modal decomposition method. In addition to obtaining the general receptivity mechanism and receptivity coefficients, we have also studied the parametric effects of nose bluntness and freestream Mach number on boundary-layer receptivity and stability over cones. Specifically, our results have shown that nose bluntness reduces the boundary-layer receptivity to freestream entropy perturbations and stabilizes the perturbed boundary layer over a cone. The boundary layer is more receptive to freestream entropy perturbations at higher freestream Mach numbers, while the perturbed boundary layer is stabilized at higher freestream Mach numbers. The current receptivity and stability study has not only shed new light on the receptivity mechanism to freestream entropy spots over blunt cones, but also advanced the understanding of nose bluntness and freestream Mach number effects on the receptivity and stability over blunt cones. Furthermore, the currently-obtained broad, continuous spectra of unstable-second-mode receptivity coefficients could potentially provide the initial amplitudes for future amplitude-based transition predicting methods...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} study was to analyse the performance of the impact test methods for non-destructive firmness evaluation. A bench top low-mass impact firmness tester pro-duced by Sinclair International (SIQ-FT) was used to perform the impact tests, and a piezoelectric-film transducer was applied in the acoustic tests. The Sinclair internal quality index (IQ) and a firm-ness index (FI) were calculated from the output signals.

Detailed implosion hydrodynamics, FI heating and core plasma formation of plastic (CD) shell target with gold cone have been clarified by observing those with fast imaging x-ray spectroscopy and neutron diagnostics. A new OneDimensional and Multi-channel Multi-Imaging X-Ray Streak Camera (1 D+McMIXS) was developed for observation of time-resolved two-dimensional x-ray images and time-resolved two dimensional temperature distributions. Also, a monochromatic x-ray imager coupled with 2 D-SIXS (Two-Dimensional Sampling Image X-ray Streak camera) was developed for time resolved x-ray line-emission imaging. Synchronization of the heating beam injection to the implosion dynamics has been monitored with an x-ray framing camera. With these instruments, one can observe heating properties of the imploded core such as spatial distribution of the heated region and its temporal evolution. It was found that the shape of the core is neither spherical nor uniform mainly because of the existence of the cone and moving toward the tip of the cone and interacting with it. Experimental results are compared with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Target design taking into account of these phenomena is quite important because such core movement and jet formation can affect the condition of the cone. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimate}} of secondary compression behaviour of sandy and silty deposits is not routinely {{taken into account}} in the classical settlement calculation, due to its generally limited contribution to the total amount of strains. However, such soils exhibit a non-negligible time-dependent behaviour and the prediction of their long-term response may sometimes be important. This paper explores the capability of the piezocone test as an effective tool to estimate the one-dimensional secondary compression characteristics of sands and silts. The approach is mainly based on the observation that frictional response essentially governs both secondary compression of granular soils and cone resistance, hence it seems reasonable to establish a valid correlation among them. The study uses part of the field data assembled over the last years at the Treporti Test Site (Venice, Italy), within an extensive research project aimed at analysing the stress-strain-time response of the predominantly silty sediments forming the Venetian lagoon subsoil. Empirical, site-specific correlations for estimating the secondary <b>compression</b> coefficient from <b>cone</b> resistance are proposed.

40|$|We {{assessed}} the mechanical properties of PC- 12 neurites by applying a force with calibrated glass needles and measured resulting changes in neurite length and deflection of the needle. We observed a linear relationship between force and length change {{that was not}} affected by multiple distensions and were thus able to determine neurite spring constants and initial, nondistended, rest tensions. 81 out of 82 neurites showed positive rest tensions ranging over three orders of magnitude with most values clustering around 30 - 40 mu dynes. Treatment with cytochalasin D significantly reduced neurite rest tensions to an average compression equal to 14 % of the former tension and spring constants {{to an average of}} 17 % of resting values. Treatment with nocodazole increased neurite rest tensions to an average of 282 % of resting values but produced no change in spring constant. These observations suggest a particular type of complementary force interaction underlying axonal shape; the neurite actin network under tension and neurite microtubules under compression. Thermodynamics suggests that microtubule (MT) assembly may be regulated by changes in compressive load. We tested this effect by releasing neurite attachment to a polylysine-coated surface with polyaspartate, thus shifting external compressive support onto internal elements, and measuring the relative change in MT polymerization using quantitative Western blotting. Neurons grown on polylysine or collagen without further treatment had a 1 : 2 ratio of soluble to polymerized tubulin. When neurites grown on polylysine were treated with 1 % polyaspartate for 15 - 30 min, 80 % of neurites retracted, shifting the soluble: polymerized tubulin ratio to 1 : 1. Polyaspartate treatment of cells grown on collagen, or grown on polylysine but treated with cytochalasin to reduce tension, caused neither retraction nor a change in the soluble:polymerized tubulin ratio. We suggest that the release of adhesion to the dish shifted the compressive load formerly borne by the dish onto Mts causing their partial depolymerization. Our observations are consistent with the possibility that alterations in MT <b>compression</b> during growth <b>cone</b> advance integrates MT assembly with the advance...|$|R

It was found that the concrete used in the pilot house is of acceptable quality, but there is room for improvement by following clear guidelines and technical assistance. Subsequently, static calculations were executed, regarding the roof, the load bearing structure and the foundation. It was found that these different components, perform safely under static conditions, with the applied loads, separately and combined. The load bearing structure has turned out to be a wall-bearing structure. This was not assumed at first. Furthermore, after calculations, it was found that the roof and foundation were largely over dimensioned. This is, however, determined considering many assumptions, such as the soil properties. Regarding an earthquake situation, the walls and bearing capacity were researched and calculated following quasi-static conditions. The earthquake conditions were derived from the Peak Ground Acceleration. Primarily the walls were researched. Two scenarios were considered, a 3 -point collapse failure mechanism and punctual overturning collapse failure mechanism. Both mechanisms were tested for different wall compartments. These calculations give a small insight in the actual situation, because dynamic loads are applied statically, non-linear or dynamic calculations should be conducted as well as FEM modelling, for more thorough understanding. It must be said that the rebar and resonance effects were not considered. Regarding the bearing capacity, a PGA of 0. 6 was used and from calculations, partly considering the soil and superstructure inertial effects, the bearing capacity would not fail. However, superstructure resonance was not considered. Larger PGA’s were not investigated, which means that it is not determined under which conditions failure would occur. From these analyses the Structural optimisations are made to the design. This includes improving the joints between different elements of the house. Regarding the materials used the optimisations include 5 protecting the CSEB bricks from weather as they are load-bearing. Guidelines are given on the placement of the house regarding the foundation and the slope. According to the calculations the foundation is over- dimensioned. For the stakeholder analysis, extensive research was done through interviews which was combined with literary information available. This was then used to create a power interest grid and a network analysis, which shows the links between different categories of stakeholders and different specific stakeholders. This analysis also gave insight in the sheer number of stakeholders involved in rebuilding Nepal and the importance of defining the role of SSN further. The external factors that are important in working in Nepal were analysed, this was done regarding social, technical, economic, environmental, political, legal and ethical aspects and based on literature research, field research and interviews. Implementation methods of different types of organisations in Nepal were analysed. These findings were concluded in a SWOT analysis of the organisations. Defining the strengths, weaknesses, Opportunities and threats of other organisation help to define the direction that SSN should move in and those aspects of building in Nepal that can also be defined as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to SSN or make SSN different to other organisations. The risks of building in Nepal must be considered to create a realistic and feasible long-term plan and need to be mitigated a risk analysis is done. The findings in the risk assessment are found in external risks, design risks and construction risks. A plan is then set up to mitigate external risks and construction risks are the. The findings of the long-term plan are organised into a strategy for SSN, an engagement plan and an implementation pathway. The strategy is concluded in a SWOT analysis which is then used to create a TOWS analysis. This TOWS analysis combined the internal and external strengths and weaknesses to bring new creative ways of maximising strengths and opportunities and minimising the weaknesses and threats. The Implementation pathway contains long- term goals for SSN, that are structured into regulatory, implementation, technical and organisational goals and that can be added onto by future teams. This research is to be a logical step in a series of research projects which will contribute to the reconstruction of an earthquake safe environment in Nepal. It can be used as consultation advice, guideline or as a base for in-depth follow up research on one of the included topics. Shock Safe NepalCIE 4061 - 09 Multidisciplinary Projec...|$|R
