40|$|This {{proposed}} {{thesis is}} essentially a methodology for producing and assembling the graphic photo/documentation package of {{a large group of}} structures distributed over a broad geographic area. During the 1984 / 85 Indiana State Hospital Documentation Project, Department of Architecture, College of Architecture and Planning, it became evident that neither standards nor precedent existed within the State of Indiana for establishing appropriate levels of documentation for individuals, firms and/or agencies applying to the State Review Board/Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology for <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Approval</b> for demolition <b>of</b> historic structures. This thesis will begin with brief discussions of: 1) various levels of documentation, including identifying one (or several) levels appropriate for this project; 2) preliminary field survey of the sites and structures, including photography, field notes and the acquisition of historic architectural drawings; and, 3) planning and contract development stages. Following this introduction the thesis will treat, in detail, the development of graphic materials (photo and line) utilized i n both the printed text and its accompanying photo/data package. Of note will be sections pertaining to: 1) the development of a sequential format, treating the project as both a written document and a graphic product; 2) field photographic techniques; 3) acquiring/developing/utilizing maps/site plans; 4) obtaining historic architectural drawings; 5) producing H. A. B. S. drawings; 6) reducing for reproduction and subsequent archiving of historic and H. A. B. S. drawings; 7) completing approved survey cards; and, 8) developing a comprehensive indexing system for all graphic materials. A summary will include, but not be limited to: 1) an assessment of the project's immediate ability to satisfy contractual requirements; 2) the project's long term value as both a written and graphic thematic study; 3) suggestions {{for the establishment of a}} hierarchy of levels of documentation for structures of recognized or potential historic significance facing certain demolition; and, 4) recommendations for the establishment of minimum state standards of graphic documentation for each specific level identified in 3).
