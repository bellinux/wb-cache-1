40|$|Aggregate {{resources}} in Jamaica are {{sand and gravel}} found in active river systems, and limestone. Other rocks in Cretaceous inliers and elsewhere are generally too weathered at the surface or too remote from centres of population to be considered suitable as significant sources of aggregates. Sand and gravel generally supplies {{the south of the}} country with limestone production and markets being concentrated along the northern coastal areas. Limestone aggregates are produced by ripping and crushing, blasting being uncommon. Sand and gravel are often simply processed using a single screen, although fixed <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> are used in some operations. The aggregate industry operates inefficiently, generally utilizing old plant, although an economic assessment shows it to be very profitable. Substitution of sand and gravel by limestone would help mitigate the negative environmental impact of extraction of aggregates from active river systems, but would considerably distort the supply of aggregates throughout the country...|$|E

40|$|Accurate <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> {{models are}} {{essential}} for the meaningful simulation of ore dressing plants such as the iron ore beneficiation plant studies in this work. <b>Crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> models were studies, developed and enhanced. The basic simulator used was Microsim, which was subsequently expanded to incorporate these new models. The models were then evaluated individually. The Whiten crushing model was modified for haematite, as this is a particularly hard ore. A new model was developed for the gyradisc crushing of haematite, with two interparticle breakage mechanisms {{taking place in the}} crushing chamber. The gyradisc model has only the crusher closed side setting as parameter. Both models showed good agreement with experimental data. The Karra screen model was enhanced to include the use of ‘poly’ decks <b>and</b> non-square <b>screen</b> apertures, as used on the plant. The Rose efficiency model was developed to use efficiencies from plant data or experiments. The Rose model showed a better relative accuracy than the entirely empirical enhanced Karra model. The screen models developed can be used for different ores but the crushing models are not transferable. Thereafter simulation was done for the quaternary sub-plant manufacturing two or three products respectively. The product ratios obtained by simulation were accurate in both cases. The optimization routine was then used to calculate an improved fine to lumpy ore ratio. It was found that only a small improvement could be achieved in the quaternary plant. Simulation of the preliminary comminution plant, however, failed to give accurate results. This plant does not operate in steady state, therefore the error could be ascribed to this. The accuracy of the Nordberg gyratory crushing model used in this sub-plant could not be established. The washing <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> was successfully simulated with the new screening models. The choice of size classes was found to be very important in the simulation of <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> circuits. The maximum number must be used and should coincide with screen apertures. Microsim {{has proved to be a}} powerful simulator subject, to the quality of input data and evaluative skills of the user.

40|$|In this work, {{a steady}} state {{simulation}} of a fertilizer granulation circuit is developed {{in order to}} study strategies for reducing the recycle ratio and improving circuit control. A two-stage population balance model for the continuous granulation drum is developed. This {{is based on an}} experimentally observed mechanism of granulation. Models developed for the <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> <b>crusher</b> units are validated against data from an operating granulation plant. Unit models are then used to develop a steady state simulation of the entire granulation circuit. Several case studies are performed to illustrate the effect of changing granulation model parameters, <b>crusher</b> <b>and</b> <b>screen</b> operating characteristics on circuit performance. Recycle ratio goes through a minimum as liquid content in the granulation drum increases. Operation is very sensitive near the liquid content where a second stage of granulation, which broadens the granule size distribution, begins. Multiple steady states are observed under some conditions, these are related to variations in granule porosity with recycle granule size distribution. A reduction in binder viscosity or granulation drum residence time improves circuit stability. Circuit operation is very sensitive to the efficiency of the <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> station. Efficient <b>crushing</b> reduces recycle ratios at high liquid content and also improves circuit stability.
