40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{qualitative}} frame analysis approach investigating gender equality management in UNDP/UNFPA <b>country</b> <b>offices</b> in Jordan and Egypt. Moreover, this thesis conducted Nvivo (8) as an assisting {{approach in the}} analysis. Unlike other gender equality studies, this thesis is taking gender equality further than gender mainstreaming and equal opportunities and diversity. The systematic approach of the thesis is based on analyzing three sets of data, gender equality country analysis of Jordan and Egypt, UNDP/UNFPA perspectives of managing gender equality through selected policy reports, and finally the perspectives of the participants working within these offices towards managing gender equality.

Alongside producing academic literature, this thesis suggested a systematic understanding to managing gender equality in UNDP/UNFPA selected <b>country</b> <b>offices...</b>|$|R
