5|$|Although still {{billed as}} having been the most {{extensive}} television <b>coverage</b> of the Pan American Games ever broadcast in the country, the CBC faced criticism {{for the amount of}} <b>coverage</b> it produced and broadcast from the 2015 Pan American Games. Only condensed, tape-delayed highlights of events aired on CBC Television, drawing comparisons to the similar practices imposed by NBC's <b>coverage</b> of the Olympics. Most events were streamed online, and pay television channel Sportsnet aired the soccer tournaments on TV, but events in some sports received only limited online <b>coverage,</b> or were not broadcast at all. Part-way through the Games, the CBC expanded its primetime <b>coverage</b> block, while broadcasts of a semi-final game in men's basketball on Sportsnet and the baseball finals online were added at the last minute. Critics perceived these last-minute changes as signs that the CBC had underestimated viewer interest in the Pan-Am Games.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, live <b>coverage</b> of {{the rodeo}} and Rangeland Derby {{competitions}} are broadcast by the CBC Sports website and Sportsnet One.

5|$|Channel 4's <b>coverage</b> of the Games {{was billed}} as the most {{extensive}} Paralympic <b>coverage</b> ever broadcast in the United Kingdom; it promised over 150 hours of live <b>coverage</b> throughout the Games on Channel 4 and sister channel More4, and additional <b>coverage</b> online and through special channels carried by Freesat, Sky and Virgin TV (in both standard and high definition). The broadcaster also invested around £600,000 towards training new on-air personalities with expertise in disability sports for the Games, {{many of whom were}} disabled themselves—they would also be joined by Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow, and BBC Sport personality Clare Balding. Channel 4 also broadcast supplemental programming to lead towards the Games, such as Paralympic-focused documentaries, other IPC championships, and That Paralympic Show, a weekly program focusing on disability sports. During the Games, comedian Adam Hills (who himself was born without a right leg, and hosted the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's <b>coverage</b> of the Beijing Paralympics) would host The Last Leg, a Paralympic-themed late night talk show that followed the conclusion of each night's <b>coverage.</b> Channel 4's <b>coverage</b> of the Games drew relatively high viewership; its <b>coverage</b> of the opening ceremony was seen by an average of 7.6 million viewers, a 40% share, and peaked at 11.2 million viewers—making it one of Channel 4's most-watched programmes in network history. Primetime <b>coverage</b> saw an average of 3.3 million viewers nightly, while viewership peaked at 4.5 million viewers during the men's T44 200m final where Alan Oliveira beat Oscar Pistorius for the gold medal. Its <b>coverage</b> of the closing ceremony peaked at 7.7 million viewers.|$|E

5|$|In Canada, {{broadcast}} {{rights to}} the Masters are held by Bell Media, with <b>coverage</b> divided between TSN (cable), which carries live simulcasts and primetime encores of CBS and ESPN <b>coverage</b> for all four rounds, CTV (broadcast), which simulcasts CBS's <b>coverage</b> of the weekend rounds, and RDS, which carries French-language <b>coverage.</b> Prior to 2013, Canadian broadcast rights were held by a marketing company, Graham Sanborn Media, which in turn bought time on the Global Television Network, TSN, and RDS (except for 2012 when French-language <b>coverage</b> aired on TVA and TVA Sports) to air the broadcasts, also selling all of the advertising for the Canadian broadcasts. This was an unusual arrangement in Canadian sports broadcasting, as in most cases broadcasters acquire their rights directly from the event organizers or through partnerships with international rightsholders, such as ESPN International (ESPN owns a minority stake in TSN). In 2013, Global and TSN began selling advertising directly, and jointly produced their own preview and highlights shows for Canadian audiences (while still carrying ESPN/CBS <b>coverage</b> for the tournament itself).|$|E

40|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} {{is applied}} to probe qualitative structural features of the adlayers formed by CO at step sites and on terrace planes of Pt(335) {Pt(S) ‐[4 (111) ×(100) ]} in the aqueous electrochemical environment. The C–O stretching vibrational features are reported for adlayers formed from 12 CO/ 13 CO isotopic mixtures {{over a wide range}} of CO surface <b>coverages.</b> At saturation, the predominant spectral features are associated with the vibrational modes of terrace‐CO in terminal (atop) coordination environments. The position of the 12 CO and 13 CO spectral features and their relative intensity are examined for several 12 CO/ 13 CO fractions, and they are shown to display the characteristics of a strongly coupled system. In comparison with corresponding mixed isotope spectra for CO at Pt(111) electrodes, intermolecular coupling for terrace‐CO on the (111) surface planes of Pt(335) is observed to be significantly stronger, reflecting the higher CO surface <b>coverages</b> on the edge sites and the terrace sites of the Pt(335) surface plane. At low <b>coverages,</b> spectral features associated with edge‐CO are discerned, and the intermolecular coupling for atop CO is weaker than for corresponding <b>coverages</b> of CO at Pt(111). The weak coupling at low <b>coverages</b> is attributed to the exclusive CO occupation at the step edges, which confines the intermolecular coupling to one dimension, in the direction along the step edges. For all <b>coverages,</b> values are determined for the dynamic dipole–dipole coupling parameter (Δνd) and the chemical (static–dipole) shift parameter (Δνs). Values for Δνs are generally small at all <b>coverages.</b> Values for Δνd are small (< 8 cm− 1) at low <b>coverages,</b> where CO forms one‐dimensional structures along the step edges, and they increase to large values (∼ 42 cm− 1) at <b>coverages</b> that coincide with the growth of two‐dimensional structures on the terrace planes. The majority of measurements were made for the Pt(335) electrode at potentials in the classical double‐layer region, although dipole coupling parameters are also reported for Pt(335) /CO at potentials in the hydrogen adsorption region, where Δνd approaches zero at low <b>coverages...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the United States, NBC Sports {{held the}} {{broadcast}} rights {{to both the}} Olympics and Paralympics in 2012. NBC had been frequently criticised in past years by American athletes and IPC officials for its minimal <b>coverage</b> of past Paralympics, and it was speculated by critics that NBC's history of inadequate <b>coverage</b> may have impacted New York City's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. In 2008, it did not air any <b>coverage</b> while the Games were in progress (neither live or delayed), choosing to air a recap documentary on NBC in November 2008, followed by a week of highlights on Universal Sports. While relatively larger than its Beijing <b>coverage,</b> NBC produced only five-and-a-half hours of specials featuring tape delayed highlights of the Games; most of them aired on pay-TV channel NBCSN, while the last aired on NBC a week following {{the conclusion of the}} Games. No <b>coverage</b> of the opening and closing ceremonies, nor any live <b>coverage,</b> was provided. By contrast, some broadcasters (such as the host broadcasters, and broadcasters in Australia and Spain) planned to air at least 100 hours or more of <b>coverage</b> from London, and NBC itself had provided extensive <b>coverage</b> of the London Olympics, which was heavily viewed.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, NBC Sports {{provided}} five-and-a-half {{hours of}} <b>coverage</b> in total, and no live <b>coverage.</b> Pay TV channel NBC Sports Network aired one-hour highlight shows on 4, 5, 6 and 11 September while NBC broadcast a special recapping the Games on 16 September – a week following their conclusion. The United States Olympic Committee provided additional <b>coverage</b> through its own digital outlets. Critics and American athletes expressed disappointment at NBC for its {{decision not to}} broadcast any live <b>coverage</b> of the Games, continuing the broadcaster's trend of providing minimal <b>coverage</b> for the Paralympics. In Canada, rights were held by Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium; TSN (English) and RDS (French) produced daily hour-long highlight programs (some of which were aired by CTV Television), while tape-delayed airings of the opening ceremony were carried by Sportsnet One, TSN2, RDS, and RDS2. The <b>coverage</b> was simulcast with open audio descriptions by AMI-tv, a network which broadcasts programming with accommodations {{for those who are}} visually or hearing impaired.

5|$|Legislation {{requires}} that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or slates) are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms {{in the media}} (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8hours of news on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis of news <b>coverage</b> indicated evenly-matched <b>coverage</b> of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on one side, and the main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of <b>coverage</b> and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government, while RTL gave more <b>coverage</b> to the SDP. However, the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less <b>coverage.</b> HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the <b>coverage,</b> HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent <b>coverage.</b> The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates.|$|E
