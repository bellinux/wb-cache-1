5|$|The reactor was {{powered up}} successfully, {{but after a}} few hours the power level dropped and the reactor shut down. Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem, rather than a {{radioactive}} poison. However, during the night the operators were able to power the reactor up again only to have it once more die away. The timings now pointed to a radioactive poison. After working through the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators, they determined the Neutron <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poison, {{which turned out to be}} xenon-135. Fortunately, the DuPont engineers had equipped the reactor with 50 per cent more fuel tubes that the physicists had called for, and by loading them up, they managed to get the reactor started.|$|E
5|$|This {{experiment}} practically exhausted {{cold fusion}} {{as a method}} for making new elements, due to the extremely low <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaction (probability of fusion): the value of 20femtobarns obtained for the 209Bi(70Zn,n)278Nh is the lowest among all superheavy fusion reactions that have been successful. Nevertheless, it may still be of use in making new isotopes of already known elements: RIKEN had plans to later investigate light isotopes of the next element 114, flerovium, by fusing a lead-208 target with germanium-76 projectiles in the reaction 208Pb(76Ge,n)283Fl.Bh and its daughter nuclei by using the 248Cm(23Na,5n)266Bh Reaction |last=Morimoto |first=Kouji |date=October 2009 |website=www.kernchemie.uni-mainz.de |publisher=University of Mainz |access-date=28 April 2017}} The cross-section for this reaction of lead and germanium producing flerovium {{is expected to be}} 200fb, greater than the 30fb for the reaction with bismuth and zinc producing nihonium.|$|E

Rigid connections can allow transfer of bending moments leading to development of secondary bending moments in the members.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} of a fusion reaction occurring {{is controlled by the}} <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuel, which is in turn a function of its temperature. The easiest nuclei to fuse are deuterium and tritium. Their fusion occurs when the ions reach 4 keV (kiloelectronvolts), or about 45 million kelvins. The Polywell would achieve this by accelerating an ion with a charge of 1 down a 4,000 volt electric field. The high cost, short half-life and radioactivity of tritium make it difficult to work with.|$|E
25|$|The {{various kinds}} of unconformities are gaps in the {{geologic}} record.

This is the opposite order one would see in an actual <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sediments because newer rock units are deposited on top of older ones per the law of superposition.|$|E

The drawing machine pulls or draws the remaining unreduced section of the bar or coil through the die. The die reduces the <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original bar or coil, shapes the profile of the product and increases the length of the original product.|$|E
25|$|The {{detonation}} {{turned the}} TNT into {{a mass of}} highly pressurized gas and produced a large fireball and mushroom shaped cloud. The resulting crater was 240 feet across and within minutes partially filled with water. Unexpectedly, the crater also had a central updraft similar to moon craters which resulted in much speculation by the scientists. Many target objects were moved and damaged by the overpressure blast, especially the heavy rockets, and two M113 armored personnel carriers were flipped on their side. After the test, a full <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crater was excavated to analyze the effects below ground.|$|E

25|$|The first {{president}} of the Canal, Charles F. Mercer, insisted on perfection since this was a work of national importance. This would cost the company more money to build the canal.

This reduced maintenance expenditures but increased construction costs.
