5|$|Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia's Communist regime became {{severely}} splintered into a liberal-decentralist nationalist faction led by <b>Croatia</b> <b>and</b> Slovenia {{that supported}} a decentralized federation to give greater autonomy to <b>Croatia</b> <b>and</b> Slovenia, versus a conservative-centralist nationalist faction led by Serbia that supported a centralized federation to secure Serbia's and Serbs' interests across Yugoslavia – {{as they were}} the largest ethnic group in {{the country as a}} whole. From 1967 to 1972 in <b>Croatia</b> <b>and</b> 1968 and 1981 protests in Kosovo, nationalist doctrines and actions caused ethnic tensions that destabilized Yugoslavia. The suppression by the state of nationalists is believed to have had the effect of identifying nationalism as the primary alternative to communism itself and made it a strong underground movement.|$|E

5|$|Humanitarian {{workers and}} foreign {{military}} observers had suspicions that the Croats deliberately abandoned Jajce, {{as well as}} territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS {{in exchange for the}} Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though <b>Croatia</b> <b>and</b> several Western diplomats denied this claim, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN to impose sanctions against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also {{been a part of the}} Vance plan, which was accepted by both <b>Croatia</b> <b>and</b> Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Many weekend visitors—particularly from Bosnia-Herzegovina, <b>Croatia</b> <b>and</b> Slovenia—prefer Belgrade nightlife to that {{of their}} own capitals, due to a {{perceived}} friendly atmosphere, plentiful clubs and bars, cheap drinks, the lack of language difficulties, {{and the lack of}} restrictive night life regulation.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October, Galbraith {{informed}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman of {{the plan}} without providing any details. Similarly, Ahrens and Eide informed RSK president Milan Martić. Although early Z-4 Plan negotiations were planned without actually disclosing the plan to <b>Croatia</b> <b>and</b> the RSK, elements {{of the plan}} were leaked to Belgrade and Zagreb newspapers in mid-October. According to Florence Hartmann, in October representatives of Tuđman and those of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević met in Graz, Austria to discuss the proposed reintegration of the RSK into <b>Croatia</b> <b>and</b> {{their opposition to the}} Z-4 Plan. Tuđman disliked the plan because it envisaged a Serb state in Croatia, while Milošević saw it as a dangerous precedent that could be applied to majority non-Serb or ethnically-mixed regions of rump Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, Vojvodina and the Sandžak.|$|E

5|$|Prosecutors of the International Criminal Tribunal for {{the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY), set up in 1993 and based on UN Security Council Resolution 827, indicted Milošević, Strugar, Jokić, the JNA 9th VPS chief of staff Captain Milan Zec and the {{commanding}} officer of the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 472nd Motorized Brigade Captain 1st Class Vladimir Kovačević. The charges included allegations that the offensive against Dubrovnik aimed to detach the area from <b>Croatia</b> <b>and</b> annex it to Serbia or Montenegro. Jokić said that the offensive only aimed to blockade Dubrovnik, but that claim was later refuted by Cokić. Mihailo Crnobrnja, a former Yugoslav ambassador to the European Union, speculated that the siege was intended to force an end to blockades of JNA barracks in <b>Croatia</b> <b>and</b> to claim the Prevlaka Peninsula for Montenego.|$|E
