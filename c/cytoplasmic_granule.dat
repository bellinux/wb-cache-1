5000|$|Control of ERCC1 {{protein level}} {{occurred}} at the translational level. In addition to the wild-type sequence, three splice variants of mRNA ERCC1 exist. [...] ERCC1 mRNA is also found to have either wild-type or three alternative transcription start points. Neither the level of overall mRNA transcription, splice variation nor transcription start point of mRNA correlates with protein level of ERCC1. The rate of ERCC1 protein turnover also does not correlate with ERCC1 protein level. A translational level control of ERCC1, due to a microRNA (miRNA), has been shown during HIV viral infection. A trans-activation response element (TAR) miRNA, coded for by the HIV virus, down-regulates ERCC1 protein expression. TAR miRNA allows ERCC1 mRNA to be transcribed, but acts at the p-body level to prevent translation of ERCC1 protein. (A p-body is a <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>granule</b> “processing body” that interacts with miRNAs to repress translation or trigger degradation of target RNAs.) In breast cancer cell lines, almost one third (55/167) of miRNA promoters were targets for aberrant methylation (epigenetic repression).

We find that cloned mast cells express plasma membrane receptors (Fc epsilon R) that bind mouse IgE with an equilibrium constant (KA) similar to that of normal mouse peritoneal mast cells.

We investigated whether HSPs were present in PMNs from burn patients and whether heat shock contributed to the functional defects observed in burn PMNs. Using both flow cytometry and Western blot techniques {{it was observed that}} inducible HSP 72 (iHSP 72) was present in PMNs and leukocytes from burn patients, especially in patients with inhalation injury. Similar to burn PMNs, and in contrast to normal cells, heat shocked PMNs (43 °C incubation) expressed iHSP 72 and were unable to increase the expression of CD 11 b/CD 18 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Degranulation after pro-inflammatory stimuli was decreased for both burn- and heat-shocked PMNs when compared to normal controls. In burn PMNs these functional abnormalities were mainly due to decreased quantities of proteins (CD 11 b, albumin, B 12 binding protein, �-glucuronidase) present within cytoplasmic granules. However, in heat-shocked PMNs the abnormalities were primarily related to abnormal exocytosis.

Degranulation was induced by goat anti-IgE. At various intervals after stimulation, parallel aliquots of cells were recovered for determination of histamine release or were fixed for transmission electron microscopy. We found that lipid bodies, electron- dense structures that lack unit membranes, were present in both control and stimulated mast cells.

Conversely, activating MCs with anti-IgE increased the time partition between signaling and secretion, which {{was associated with a}} period of sustained elevation of intracellular calcium and formation of larger and more heterogeneously shaped granule structures that underwent prolonged exteriorization. Pharmacological inhibition of IKK-beta during IgE-dependent stimulation strongly reduced the time partition between signaling and secretion, inhibited SNAP 23 /STX 4 complex formation, and switched the degranulation pattern into one that resembled degranulation induced by substance P. IgE-dependent and substance P-dependent activation in vivo also induced different patterns of mouse MC degranulation that were associated with distinct local and systemic pathophysiological responses.

In the first pathway, <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>granule</b> toxins, predominantly a membrane-disrupting protein known as perforin, and a family of structurally related serine C, proteases (granzymes) with various substrate specificities, are secreted by exocytosis and together induce apoptosis of the target cell.

The second pathway involves the engagement of death receptors (e. g. Fas/CD 95) on target cells by their cognate ligands (e. g. FasL on NK cells, resulting in classical caspase-dependent apoptosis. The comparative role of these pathways in the pathophysiology of many diseases is being dissected by analyses of gene-targeted mice that lack these molecules, and humans who have genetic mutations affecting these pathways. We are also now learning that the effector function of NK cells is controlled by interactions involving specific NK cell receptors and their cognate ligands, either on target cells, or other cells of the immune system.
