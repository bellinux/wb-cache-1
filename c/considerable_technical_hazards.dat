50|$|There {{are several}} <b>technical</b> <b>hazards</b> {{one should be}} aware of as they pose a threat humans and their values. These hazards are {{measured}} in terms of the risk they pose to the community using them. <b>Technical</b> <b>hazards</b> are classified by a source, specifically speaking; they can fall under automotive emissions, medical radiation, explosions and air pollution (environmental) hazards. The quality of the hazard determines the safety precautions that are taken. For example, hazards can be a risk to an individual or a risk to the population. If the population is at risk with the hazard, there will be more priorities for the management of the hazardous material. These hazardous materials can cause illness or even death to an individual if they are not address accordingly, so it is crucial for them to inform the public about these <b>technical</b> <b>hazards.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Considerable</b> <b>technical</b> {{analysis}} and {{restoration of the}} sculpture took place in 2006.|$|R

50|$|In contrast, {{there are}} <b>considerable</b> <b>technical,</b> {{organisational}} and commercial {{differences between the}} ENX standard and the American ANX, which was developed back in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Considerable</b> <b>technical</b> {{improvement}} was necessary at the harbours, and quickly. Consideration {{was given to}} installing hydraulic cranes to lift loaded railway wagons on to the deck of steamers.|$|R
5000|$|Jean Christian Kytch (died 1738) was a Dutch Baroque-era oboist. Based on works he {{is known}} to have performed, it is thought that he possessed <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> ability on the oboe.|$|R
50|$|In 1901 he {{completed}} his Symphony No. 1, his first orchestral work. Although he was {{heavily influenced by}} established contemporaries, most notably Brahms, the work displayed <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> skill in its own right.|$|R

5000|$|Variety {{called the}} musical a [...] "blandly generic epic" [...] that [...] "despite its <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> merits and stellar {{performance}} highlights ...seems unlikely {{to enter the}} annals of Australian musical theater as a great discovery".|$|R
25|$|The Portuguese guitar {{now known}} has {{undergone}} <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> modification {{in the last}} century (dimensions, mechanical tuning system, etc.) although it has kept the same number of courses, the string tuning and the finger technique characteristic of this type of instrument.|$|R
50|$|The {{project was}} a <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> {{achievement}} which required {{a high degree}} of manual labour due to the hilly terrain which made it difficult to access with mechanical equipment. Most of the construction was carried out by unemployed men on relief work.|$|R
5000|$|The Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche (1996-2004) is a stealth helicopter; {{the type}} was {{intended}} to be used for reconnaissance missions by the US Army, however the development project was cancelled during the prototype stage due to escalating costs and <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> issues experienced.|$|R
50|$|By 1806 {{the system}} was {{extended}} to Tillicoultry, and an alternative route to the Forth at Clackmannan Pier from Sauchie was opened. The Alloa Railway was represented <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> progress, but the days of horse-drawn wagons on timber rails were coming to an end.|$|R
50|$|At {{its peak}} {{the line was}} {{carrying}} 120 train movements a day. Auxiliary token instruments were provided at the extremity of the loops, and a <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> workload resulted in restoring the unbalanced token extractions. The remote loop points were electrically operated by hand generator at the signalboxes.|$|R
40|$|Mo oxide {{films with}} good {{electrochromic}} properties were produced by single-target and dual-target reactive d. c. magnetron sputtering. Dual-target deposition was shown capable of yielding optically functional films {{at a rate}} ∼ 20 times higher than that for single-target deposition, which {{is a result of}} <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> interest...|$|R
50|$|In 1929 she {{published}} Gold Coast Customs, a {{poem about}} the artificiality of human behaviour and the barbarism that lies beneath the surface. The poem {{was written in the}} rhythms of the tom-tom and of jazz, and shows <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> skill. Her early work reflects the strong influence of the French symbolists.|$|R
50|$|The {{river was}} rediscovered during the {{excavations}} for the Athens Metro subway {{in the late}} 1990s, and its waters caused <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> problems at times. Because of the Metro works, its seasonal flow through the Kerameikos cemetery was disrupted, as the waters were apparently and inadvertently redirected to some new underground path.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{repair of}} {{recurrent}} inguinal hernias after prosthetic mesh repair is usually diffucult due to <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> challenge and complications. There {{is also a}} greater risk of developing further recurrence. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the outcome of preperitoneal repair (open posterior approach) for recurrent inguinal hernias after Lichtenstein tension-free hernioplasty...|$|R
50|$|At {{this date}} Lucienne’s {{textiles}} were characterised by energetic rhythms and a spidery, doodle-like graphic style. Although apparently spontaneous, however, her designs displayed <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> skill, particularly their colourways and repeats. As well as pure abstracts, she often created stylised organic patterns incorporating motifs such as skeletal leaves, spindly stems, feathery seed heads and butterflies.|$|R
50|$|The main {{theme of}} Au bord d’une source {{comprises}} {{a pattern of}} arpeggiated semiquavers in the right hand with short notes in the left, firstly played below the right hand and then played two octaves higher, above the right hand. This constant crossing over of hands places <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> demands on the amateur pianist.|$|R
40|$|In {{this issue}} Ibrahim and co-authors report on <b>technical</b> <b>hazards</b> of off-pump (without heart lung machine) {{coronary}} surgery 1. Their findings {{are in line}} with meta-analyses of randomized trials which indicate that under-grafting and graft-failures are more common after off-pump than after standard operations. The risk that the objectives of coronary bypass surgery are endangered is discussed in relation to evidence based medicine. A moratorium is suggested until conclusive data are available...|$|R
50|$|Compared to the kpsi counts, {{additional}} structural {{information is}} obtained when the {{horizontal and vertical}} knots are counted separately. In Turkmen carpets, the ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1. <b>Considerable</b> <b>technical</b> skill is required to achieve this knot ratio. Rugs which are woven in this manner are very dense and durable.|$|R
50|$|Technical {{communication}} {{is a task}} performed by specialized employees or consultants. For example, a professional writer may work with a company to produce a user manual. Some companies give <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> communication responsibility to other technical professionals—such as programmers, engineers, and scientists. Often, a professional technical writer edits such work {{to bring it up}} to modern technical communication standards.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the water}} works in Israel are {{combined}} with the National Water Carrier, the length of which is about 130 km. The carrier consists {{of a system of}} giant pipes, open canals, tunnels, reservoirs and large scale pumping stations. Building the carrier was a <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> challenge as it traverses a wide variety of terrains and elevations.|$|R
50|$|Knorkator's {{music can}} be largely {{classified}} as industrial metal, somewhat akin to White Zombie and Ministry. Knorkator, however, strongly features a comedic element. Most songs escalate into falsetto vocals and bombastic, over-the-top anthemic choruses, with crushing guitars and subtle samplers. Due to the amusing message, however, the band's <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> and artistic merit is sometimes overlooked.|$|R
30|$|Despite this {{conceptual}} blurriness and {{the difficulties}} in applying resilience and vulnerability, both concepts are used in disaster risk sciences. The EU-funded research project ENSURE, for example, has developed a resilience and vulnerability assessment framework and operational tool for natural and <b>technical</b> <b>hazards</b> (Menoni et al. 2012). The aim was to develop context-specific, indicator-based assessment tools that help the users to identify the strengths and fragilities of a given territory and community with respect to extreme natural events.|$|R
50|$|Illegal {{construction}} or building is construction work (or {{the result of}} such) without a valid construction permit. Besides the potential <b>technical</b> <b>hazards</b> on uncontrolled construction sites and in finished buildings, illegal building activity can be a major environmental violation when the works encroach upon preserve areas like nature reserves. Likewise, illegal building can have serious political implications when it is practiced as landgrabbing or for illegal settling in foreign territories (see e.g. International law and Israeli settlements).|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} scales used to {{categorize}} the impact hazards of asteroids are the Palermo <b>Technical</b> Impact <b>Hazard</b> Scale and the Torino Scale.|$|R
2500|$|The {{decision}} to start {{production of the}} car {{was made by the}} Volkswagen Group in 2001. [...] The first roadworthy prototype was completed in August 2003. [...] It is identical to the later series variant except for a few details. [...] In the transition from development to series production <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> problems had to be addressed, repeatedly delaying production until September 2005.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s Wolseley had been UK's largest motor manufacturer, over-expansion had been the downfall of the owners of the business but Wolseley retained <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> expertise. One result was the very successful overhead camshaft six-cylinder engine sold in this car. Wolseley Aero Engines Limited was formed around 1931 specifically to separate out and capitalise on this expertise.|$|R
50|$|Edlund {{continued}} to work with Dykstra on Battlestar Galactica but was invited back by George Lucas to work on The Empire Strikes Back. Edlund's <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> challenge on this film was to optically composite miniatures against a white back ground resulting in a second Academy Award. Edlund also did distinguished work for Lucas and ILM on Raiders of the Lost Ark and Poltergeist.|$|R
40|$|Mobile, social, real-time: {{the ongoing}} {{revolution}} {{in the way people}} communicate has given rise to a new kind of epidemiology. Digital data sources, when harnessed appropriately, can provide local and timely information about disease and health dynamics in populations around the world. The rapid, unprecedented increase in the availability of relevant data from various digital sources creates <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> and computational challenges...|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} {{vacuum brake}} as described represented a <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> advance in train braking. In practice steam locomotives had two ejectors, a small ejector for running purposes (to exhaust air that had leaked into the train pipe) {{and a large}} ejector to release brake applications. Later Great Western Railway practice was to use a vacuum pump instead of the small ejector.|$|R
5000|$|Differing {{from the}} {{simplicity}} of the first four études, Nos. 5-8 are more virtuosic in their approach to keyboard writing, calling for unconventional hand positions, wide leaps for the fingers and <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> strength from the performer. Also, [...] "the individual mood and passionate character of each piece" [...] pose musical problems that preclude performance from those not possessing a tremendous physical technique.|$|R
50|$|Some {{construction}} has begun in Illinois and Michigan, primarily as testbeds for the upgraded signaling and control systems required for higher-speed rail. In Michigan, this work has already resulted in {{speeds up to}} 95 mph for Amtrak's Wolverine and Blue Water services. Similar work on the Chicago-Saint Louis line in Illinois was met with <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> difficulties in 2005, though work continued.|$|R
50|$|A quick, tenacious, and hardworking player, he {{was well}} known for his versatility, being able to play {{anywhere}} on the left side, and {{was used as a}} full-back as a wing-back and as a winger throughout his career. He was also known for his ability to cross the ball, as well as his <b>considerable</b> <b>technical</b> ability and energetic attacking runs down the left flank.|$|R
