40|$|Worldwide {{growth of}} {{offshore}} renewable energy production will provide marine organisms with new hard substrate for colonization in terms of artificial reefs. The artificial reef effect is important when planning offshore installations since it can create habitat enhancement. Wind power is the most advanced technology within {{offshore renewable energy}} sources {{and there is an}} urgent need to study its impacts on the marine environment. To test the hypothesis that offshore wind power increases the abundance of reef species relative to a reference area, we conduct an experiment on the model species <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> (Carcinus maenas). Overall, 3962 crabs were captured, observed, marked and released in 2011 and 1995 crabs in 2012. Additionally, carapace size, sex distribution, color morphs and body condition was recorded from captured crabs. We observed very low recapture rates at all sites during both years which made evaluating differences in population sizes very difficult. However, we were able to estimate population densities from the capture record for all three sites. There was no obvious artificial reef effect in the Lillgrund wind farm, but a spill-over effect to nearby habitats cannot be excluded. We could not find any effect of the wind farm on either, morphs, sex distribution or condition of the <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab.</b> Our study found no evidence that Lillgrund wind farm has a negative effect on populations of the <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab.</b> This study provides the first quantitative and experimental data on the <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> in relation to offshore wind farms...|$|E

40|$|Numerous studies {{indicate}} that the behavioral responses of prey {{to the presence of}} predators can have an important role in structuring assemblages through trait-mediated indirect interactions. Few studies, however, have addressed how relative susceptibility to predation influences such interactions. Here we examine the effect of chemical cues from the <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Carcinus maenas on the foraging behavior of two common intertidal gastropod molluscs. Of the two model consumers studied, Littorina littorea is morphologically more vulnerable to crab predation than Gibbula umbilicalis, and it exhibited greater competitive ability in the absence of predation threat. However, Littorina demonstrated a greater antipredator response when experimentally exposed to predation cues, resulting in a lower level of foraging. This reversed the competitive interaction, allowing Gibbula substantially increased access to shared resources. Our results demonstrate that the susceptibility of consumers to predation can influence species interactions, and suggest that inter-specific differences in trait-mediated indirect interactions are another mechanism through which non-consumptive predator effects may influence trophic interactions...|$|E

At weekly intervals, {{plankton}} samples were collected below the surface, at mid-water and above the bottom during night and day flood tides, with the use of plankton nets. In order to evaluate the relationship between wind speed and direction and input of megalopae to the estuary, a complex correlation coefficient between megalopae concentration and average daily wind stress was calculated. Maximum values of the correlation coefficient were obtained when the concentration of megalopae was lagged after wind stress by 3 d. The direction of the correlation was 2 Â°, meaning that input of megalopae to the estuary increased as southward wind stress decreased. High densities of megalopae were not associated with strong southward wind stress. Correlation between input of megalopae to the Ria de Aveiro and wind stress improved when a cumulative wind stress vector was used, which was constructed as the sum of the wind stresses for time lags of 2, 3 and 4 days before the input of megalopae.

40|$|Carcinus maenas, the <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> of European coastal waters, has {{recently}} gained notoriety {{due to its}} globally invasive nature associated with drastic ecological and economic effects. The native ubiquity and worldwide importance of C. maenas has resulted in it {{becoming one of the}} best-studied estuarine crustacean species globally. Accordingly, there is significant interest in investigating the population genetic structure of this broadly distributed crab along European and invaded coastlines. Here, we developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for one dinucleotide and two trinucleotide microsatellite loci, resulting from an enrichment process based on Portuguese populations. Combining these three new markers with six existing markers, we examined levels of genetic diversity and population structure of C. maenas in two coastal regions from Northern and Central Portugal. Genotypes showed that locus polymorphism ranged from 10 to 42 alleles (N = 135) and observed heterozygosity per locus ranged from 0. 745 to 0. 987 with expected heterozygosity ranging from 0. 711 to 0. 960; values typical of marine decapods. The markers revealed weak, but significant structuring among populations (global F(ST) = 0. 004) across a 450 km (over-water distance) spatial scale.

40|$|Employing {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} infra-red light actography system, circatidal rhythms of vertical migration {{were recorded in}} first stage zoea larvae of the <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Carcinus maenas (L.), freshly collected from coastal waters. The rhythms persisted in constant conditions in the laboratory for several days, ascent occurring at the times of expected ebb tides at collection sites, and descent during expected flood tides. Timing was identical in larvae sampled at different stage of spring/neap cycle and from sites where different hydrodynamic conditions prevail. These experiments, supported by repeated surface plankton samples which confirmed that zoea- 1 larvae of C. maenas were most abundant at the surface during ebb tides, suggest that the vertical migration behaviour might be linked with avoidance of stranding and offshore dispersal of newly released larvae. The fact that tidal migration rhythm was exhibited by larvae collected from different sites implies that the behaviour is probably widespread for the species. So far, endogenous tidal rhythms of vertical migration in plankton have been demonstrated solely in a few estuarine forms, and have been interpreted only as estuarine retention or reinvasion mechanisms. Present results {{appear to be the}} first to demonstrate that endogenous tidal rhythms also exist in the planktonic larvae of a coastal invertebrate and suggest that these larvae may have an adaptive mechanism to avoid stranding and enhance offshore dispersal in the open sea...|$|E

40|$|Wind-driven {{circulation}} is {{a mechanism}} {{that may be}} involved in the shoreward transport of invertebrate larvae. This study investigated the temporal variability of the supply of crab megalopae to an estuary located in the northwest coast of Portugal, which is affected by seasonal upwelling, and related variations in supply to several upwelling indices. Megalopae of the European <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Carcinus maenas (L.). were collected daily, using artificial settlement substrates, during a 3 -month period, from March 15 to June 15, 2000. Two settlement episodes were detected, which were consistent with the variation in abundance and size of juvenile crabs. Variations in subtidal sea level and sea surface temperature anomaly were correlated with the strength of along-shore wind stress and consistent with upwelling theory. Contingency analyses showed positive significant associations between increasing intensity of southerly winds and megalopal supply, for time lags of 0 â 6 d, indicating that shoreward transport occurred during relaxation or reversal of upwelling favourable winds. Associations between megalopal supply and tidal range or the duration of nocturnal flood were not detected. Compared to other studies of the supply of crab megalopae to coastal habitats that used a similar methodology, very low numbers of megalopae were collected during this study. The paucity of C. maenas megalopae in the Ria de Aveiro is in agreement with the low densities of this larval stage in the plankton, and indicates that maintenance of the population is achieved despite a low supply of megalopae...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed that optimal timing of larval release is of major {{importance}} to offspring survival, but {{the extent to}} which environmental factors entrain synchronous reproductive rhythms in natural populations is not well known. We sampled the broods of ovigerous females of the <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Pachygrapsus transversus at both sheltered and exposed rocky shores interspersed along a so-km coastline, during four different periods, to better assess inter-population differences of larval release timing and to test for the effect of wave action. Shore-specific patterns were consistent through time. Maximum release fell within 1 day around syzygies on all shores, which matched dates of maximum tidal amplitude. Within this very narrow range, populations at exposed shores anticipated hatching compared to those at sheltered areas, possibly due to mechanical stimulation by wave action. Average departures from syzygial release ranged consistently among shores from 2. 4 to 3. 3 days, but in this case we found no evidence for the effect of wave exposure. Therefore, processes varying at the scale of a few kilometres affect the precision of semilunar timing and may produce differences in the survival of recently hatched larvae. Understanding the underlying mechanisms causing departures from presumed optimal release timing is thus important for a more comprehensive evaluation of reproductive success of invertebrate populations.

40|$|Camouflage is {{widespread}} throughout {{the natural world}} and conceals animals from predators in a vast range of habitats. Because successful camouflage usually involves matching aspects of the background environment, species and populations should evolve appearances tuned to their local habitat, termed phenotype-environment associations. However, although this has been studied in various species, little work has objectively quantified the appearances of camouflaged animals from different habitats, or related this to factors such as ontogeny and individual variation. Here, we tested for phenotype-environment associations in the <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> (Carcinus maenas), a species highly variable in appearance and found {{in a wide range}} of habitats. We used field surveys and digital image analysis of the colors and patterns of crabs found in four locations around Cornwall in the UK to quantify how individuals vary with habitat (predominantly rockpool, mussel bed, and mudflat). We find that individuals from sites comprising different backgrounds show substantial differences in several aspects of color and pattern, and that this is also dependent on life stage (adult or juvenile). Furthermore, the level of individual variation is dependent on site and life stage, with juvenile crabs often more variable than adults, and individuals from more homogenous habitats less diverse. Ours is the most comprehensive study to date exploring phenotype-environment associations for camouflage and individual variation in a species, and we discuss the implications of our results in terms of the mechanisms and selection pressures that may drive this...|$|E

40|$|Facilitation cascades {{generated}} by co-occurring foundation species {{can enhance the}} abundance and diversity of associated organisms. However, it remains poorly understood how differences among native and invasive species {{in their ability to}} exploit these positive interactions contribute to emergent patterns of community structure and biotic acceptance. On intertidal shorelines in New England, we examined the patterns of coexistence between the native mud crabs and the invasive Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> {{in and out of a}} facilitation cascade habitat {{generated by}} mid intertidal cordgrass and ribbed mussels. These crab species co-occurred in low intertidal cobbles adjacent to the cordgrassâmussel beds, despite experimental findings that the dominant mud crabs can kill and displace Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> and thereby limit their successful recruitment to their shared habitat. A difference between the native and invasive species in their utilization of the facilitation cascade likely contributes to this pattern. Only the Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> inhabit the cordgrassâmussel beds, despite experimental evidence that both species can similarly benefit from stress amelioration in the beds. Moreover, only Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> settle in the beds, which function as a nursery habitat free of lethal mud crabs, and where their recruitment rates are particularly high (nearly an order of magnitude higher than outside beds). Persistence of invasive adult Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> among the dominant native mud crabs in the low cobble zone is likely enhanced by a spillover effect of the facilitation cascade in which recruitment-limited Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> settle in the mid intertidal cordgrassâmussel beds and subsidize their vulnerable populations in the adjacent low cobble zone. This would explain why the abundances of Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> in cobbles are doubled when adjacent to facilitation cascade habitats.

40|$|Optimal Diet Theory {{suggests}} that individuals make foraging decisions that maximise net energy intake. Many studies provide qualitative support for this, but {{factors such as}} digestive constraints, learning, predation-risk and competition can influence foraging behaviour and lead to departures from quantitative predictions. We {{examined the effects of}} intraspecific competition within a classic model of optimal diet â the <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab,</b> Carcinus maenas, feeding on the mussel, Mytilus edulis. Unexpectedly, we found that breaking time (Tb), eating time (Te), and handling time (Th) all decreased significantly {{in the presence of a}} conspecific. Reduced handling time in the presence of a competitor resulted in an increased rate of energy intake, raising the question of why crabs do not always feed in such a way. We suggest that the costs of decreased shell breaking time may be increased risk of claw damage and that crabs may be trading-off the potential loss of food to a competitor with the potential to damage their claw whilst breaking the shell more rapidly. It is well documented that prey-size selection by crabs is influenced by both the risk of claw damage and competition. However, our results are the first to demonstrate similar effects on prey handling times. We suggest that crabs maximise their long-term rate of energy intake at a scale far greater than individual foraging events and that in order to minimise claw damage, they typically break shells at a rate below their maximum. In the presence of a competitor, crabs appear to become more risk-prone and handle their food more rapidly, minimising the risk of kleptoparasitism...|$|E

Whereas C maenas was the most <b>common</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> in these waters, its numbers have declined on the soft sediment substrates during the last 20 years. As the two exotic crab species were first recorded in the Dutch delta in 1999. {{they could not have}} initiated the decline of the native C. maenas. However, within a few years H. takanoi completely dominated the intertidal hard substrate environments: the same environments on which juvenile C maenas depend. On soft sediment substrate the native and exotic shore crab species are presently more or less equally abundant. H. takanoi might initially have taken advantage of the fact that C maenas numbers were declining. Additionally H. takanoi are thriving in expanding oyster reefs of Crassostrea gigas (Pacific oyster) in the Dutch delta waters, which provide new habitat. Nowadays H. takanoi appears to be a fierce interference competitor or predator for small C. maenas specimens by expelling them from their shelters. These interactions have led to increased mortality of juvenile C mamas. At present the C. maenas populations seem to be maintained by crabs that survive and reproduce on available soft sediment habitats where H. takanoi densities are low...|$|E

Primarily, the ultrastructure and distribution of gill cells in the untreated gill of crabs acclimated to 35 â° seawater were characterised. Gill ultrastructure was subsequently shown to vary markedly at 10 â° compared to 35 â° seawater. Ultrastructural and distributional, rather than gross morphological, change occurred in the gill following exposure to copper at each salinity. Ultrastructural studies showed that as the length of copper exposure increased the gill epithelial layer became highly vacuolated, the number of plasma membrane infoldings and mitochondria became reduced, the microtubular network became disrupted, the endoplasmic reticulum became swollen and the cell cytoplasm contained many free ribosomes. Copper exposure also resulted in {{an increase in the number}} of haemocytes in the gill, some of which became attached to the basal epithelial cell surface or actually infiltrated into the epithelial cell cytoplasm. Ultrastructural change was more extensive when copper was administered at 35 â° rather than 10 â° seawater. These effects are described and correlated with previously documented biochemical and physiological responses to heavy metals in crustaceans. In addition, the elemental composition of the gill granular haemocytes suggested they play an important role in the immobilisation and removal of copper-from the gill.

The prevalence and distribution of the parasite was also investigated. The field studies carried out on the populations of S. carcini on C. maenas in northern France and North Wales, together with {{a review of the}} literature, demonstrated a disparate distribution. The larvae of S. carcini are lecithotrophic and can develop within 5 days to the cyprid and are capable of settlement 2 days later. The highest prevalence for the parasite was observed to correlate with semi-enclosed bodies of water. It is proposed that in this situation, with the short development time, the larvae are retained, thus increasing the probability of successful cypris settlement. Such coastal systems are susceptible to variable conditions, consequently experiments were undertaken to investigate the larval tolerance to temperature and salinity variations. A morphological study was carried out on the naupliar stages of S. carcinl. The typical cirripede limbs were simple and lacked gnathobases. There was also a vestigial ventral thoracic process present in the stage III and stage IV nauplius. These observations supported the argument that the rhizocephalan nauplius fits within the cirripede nauplius form. - ii - The energy budget study, involved the investigation of ash-free dry weights per larva, respirometry for each larval stage and analyses of the biochemical constituents using colorimetric and gravimetric techniques, Finally an equation was developed which demonstrates the energy budget for S. carcini, from the beginning of larval development to settlement on the host and the subsequent metamorphoses to the inoculation stages...|$|E

We found that changes in protein abundance were most notable in the postmolt stages (B and C 1 - 3), where an increase in energy metabolism and the reactive oxygen species stress (ROS) response proteins was observed. An increase in triosephosphate isomerase and transketolase suggest that the postmolt YO is participating in triglycerides storage and is also actively recycling excess ribose sugars manufactured during the YOâs previously activated state. We also propose as mechanism through which ROS-induced release of cyclophilin A may contribute to YO atrophy during postmolt through the remodeling of structural proteins such as collagen. We support the standing observation of YO atrophy during postmolt by drawing attention to hemolymph protein abundances, especially those of cryptocyanin isoforms, which dropped precipitously in intermolt (C 4) and remained at low abundances into early premolt (D 0). Finally, though our evidence is preliminary, we propose that future investigations into the YO proteome address the significance of the protein glutamate dehydrogenase. Glutamate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme involved in the formation of glutamate, represents a potential nutrient-sensing checkpoint that might be involved in YO activation. Historically, most attention has gone to the acute molt stages, where signaling mechanisms involved in the activation of the YO have been the focus. Here, we present data suggesting that other regulatory mechanism may be governing the atrophy the postmolt YO.

Theexposure to <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> resulted in a significantly higher height of the mussels, whencontrolling for mussel length. The mussels exposed to <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> also showed end volumessimilar to control mussels, whereas an exposure to a combination of a crab and a sea starresulted in intermediate end volumes. This supports a phenotypic plasticity in traits related topredator threat. Individuals in all three predatory treatments were harder attached by morebyssus threads {{at the end of the}} experiment. Control mussels and those exposed to a singlecrab and sea star were repeatedly found to be more aggregated (i. e. fewer solitary mussels) over the course of the experiment, whereas the mussels presumably exposed to more olfactorycues from two <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> or two sea stars were more often found solitary and attached bybyssus threads. This study demonstrated inducible defences in how blue mussel allocate their resources todifferent dimensions of growth, shell weight, adductor muscle weight, as well as aggregationand byssus attachment, depending on predatory threat...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the sex-specific differences to feeding responses of the <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Carcinus maenasthroughout the year. Results demonstrate that female <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> exhibit stronger feeding responses than males throughout the year with a significantly reduced feeding response in males during the summer months' reproductive season. We also studied the possible function(s) of the moulting hormone, 20 -hydroxyecdysone (Crustecdysone) that {{has been described as}} a potential female-produced sex pheromone to initiate male reproductive behaviour in a number of crustaceans. We recently presented evidence that for <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> this is not the case and now show that the steroid is instead functioning as a sex-specific feeding deterrent protecting the moulting âsoftâ female <b>crabs.</b> Whilst male <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> were deterred from prey (Mytilus edulis) and synthetic feeding stimulants glycine and taurine when these feeding stimulants were spiked with crustecdysone, intermoult female crabs were significantly less affected and rarely deterred from feeding. This sex specificity of the moulting hormone, in combination with the female sex pheromone, which has no anti-feeding properties, ensures that male crabs mate with soft-shelled, moulted females rather than engage in cannibalism, such as found frequently in cases when soft-shelled females are exposed to intermoult females...|$|R
