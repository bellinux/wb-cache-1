40|$|Nowadays {{cell-based}} {{therapy is}} rarely in clinical practice {{because of the}} availability of appropriate cells. To apply cells therapeutically, they may not cause any immune response wherefore up to now mainly autologous cells were used. The amount of vital cells in patients is limited and under certain circumstances in highly degenerated tissues no vital cells are left. Moreover, the extraction of these cells is connected with additional surgery; also the expansion in vitro is difficult. Other approaches avoid these problems by using allo- or even xenogenic cells. These cells are more stable concerning their therapeutic behavior and can be produced in stock. To prevent an immune response caused by these cells, cell encapsulation (e. g. with alginate) can be performed. <b>Certain</b> <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> that encapsulated allo- and xenogenic cells achieve promising results in treatment of several diseases. At this, stem cells, especially mesenchymal stem cells, are an interesting cell source for cell therapy approaches.

The main search utilized a Pub med Chinese Electronic Periodical Service (CEPS) literature review using keywords 'AD', and 'Prenatal Depression' with searches for 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Taiwan', 'Hong Kong' and Macau'. The rates of AD in East Asia appear to be relatively close {{to those in the}} Western literature, although <b>certain</b> <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> slightly decreased rates. Many of the risk factors for AD were the same in the Eastern and Western literature. These risk factors included demographic factors such as younger age, smoking, low education and income, and unemployment. Other risk factors were physical symptoms such as menstrual pains and nausea. Finally, psychological factors such as a poor response to the pregnancy, poor spousal support, and poor family support were associated with AD. With regard to treatment, there were no studies examining the administration of psychotropic medications for AD. The literature from East Asia both confirmed many Western findings and made unique contributions to the literature on AD. The treatment of AD in East Asia appears to be an entity which, despite its morbidity, has not been adequately studied...|$|E

So here {{is an attempt to}} find out the spectrum of dermatological lesions in HIV infected, their association with the CD 4 + cell count, and to compare the pattern of dermatological lesions between patients on HAART and patients not on HAART. Aims: To conduct a clinical study of mucocutaneous manifestations in HIV-positive patients visiting Skin and STD Dept. of Krishna Rajendra(K. R.) hospital, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute, with special reference to age, gender and risk factors. Methodology: Cross-sectional study with simple random sampling technique was conducted at K. R. Hospital, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute, India between August 2007 and October 2008. The study involved 350 HIV positive patients aged between 16 - 60 y of which 175 were on HAART presenting with some mucocutaneous manifestations and 175 were not on HAART consisting of patients who presented with a symptom of one of the mucocutaneous lesions. They did not know if they were HIV infected. After they were tested they were found to be positive and were included in the study. They were procured from the Anti Retroviral Centre of our hospital. Mean duration of HAART initiated life is 6 months. Before involving the patients in the study,written informed consent was obtained from the patient/legal guardian both in English and local language. Appropriate lab investigations were done i. e. HIV status, base line investigations like Hemoglobin, Peripheral Blood Smear, KOH test, VDRL test, CD 4 cell count etc [...] , The data thus collected was tabulated with reference to some important parameters of the study. It was analysed using the software SPSS 11. 4 version. Results: Among the opportunistic infections and other infectious lesions (HAART and non-HAART put together), highest was viral(56 %) followed by fungal (42 %), bacterial(22 %) and least being infestation. Viral infections were less on HAART initiated(32 %) as compared to non HAART(80 %). But the cases of bacterial and fungal infections were almost equal in both categories. There was significant increase in the cases of non infectious lesions on HAART population(88 % against 40 % in non HAART; p Conclusions: In correlation with CD 4 cell count, mucocutaneous manifestations increased with decreased CD 4 cell count [Regression Coefficient (- 0. 31) with 0. 64 standard error of estimate and p-value When dermatological lesions of patient who are on HAART was compared with that of non-HAART, there was significant reduction in the prevalence of dermatological viral infection in CAT 2 [under HAART-chi square= 5. 134; p <br...|$|E
30|$|Thus, {{few studies}} report {{acceptability}} of reporting GPS based travel data.

This could be an indirect indication of technological acceptance, but might also reflect variations in measure acceptability. One can expect a certain co-variation between technological user acceptance and measure acceptability, and technological acceptance might very well serve as an explanatory variable of measure acceptability. In anticipating the completion and roll-out of the SMiO application, however, this study does not yet have sufficient data for examining such correlations.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{systematic}} review is to investigate the effectiveness of school lunch programs for reducing childhood obesity by examining changes to the Body Mass Index (BMI) as an outcome measure to compare and assess the effectiveness of different school lunch interventions. Background: Childhood obesity has a high likelihood of leading to obesity in adulthood and this negative effect is well documented. School lunches have been widely implemented in this decade for tackling childhood obesity. Many countries are following this trend to align school lunches with national or standard nutrition guidelines {{as part of the}} school policy. Since many schools have only recently started to provide school lunches, the impact of these programs in terms of reducing childhood obesity has yet to be fully explored. Methods: Published literature about school lunch and body mass index from 2008 to 2014 was collected through PubMed and ScienceDirect. Relevant studies, including cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case control studies, and observational studies, were included if they involved interventions that measured BMI as an independent outcome. Results: Nine studies from USA and one from Norway were included in this systematic review. For measuring school lunch participation, 4 were associated with increased BMI after intervention, 1 was associated with decreased BMI and 3 were not statistically significant with BMI. For studies that included consumption or observed energy intake, 3 were associated with lower BMI and 1 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that higher consumption lowered initial BMI but increased BMI over time. Overall, the results were inconsistent, and this may be attributed to confounding factors such as different food environments, meal quality, and availability of school snacks. Conclusion: The implications for school lunch programs as a key factor in lowering childhood obesity are complicated. No solid conclusions can be inferred for the effectiveness of school lunch program for lowering childhood obesity, as <b>certain</b> <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> positive relationships and others show no association. Future research with primary data and longitudinal cohort with years follow up may be considered for studying the relationship of between the school lunch program and the trend of BMI of children change at each level of school. Research on extending observed energy intake should also be applied in order to provide guidance for policy change on the meal quality, food options, competitive foods availability as well as nutrition guidelines. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

The method is formed by considering the different physical meanings of the coefficients in both the low frequency and high frequency bands. The fused results were compared with several existing fusion methods and evaluated by three measures of performance. The experimental results can demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better performance than conventional image fusion methods. 1...|$|R

Two of these studies obtained series solutions using specialized mathematical methods, known as the Adomian decomposition method and the homotopy analysis method. Subsequently it was shown that {{the solution of the}} same particular model could be written in terms of a transcendental function called Gauss’ hypergeometric function.
