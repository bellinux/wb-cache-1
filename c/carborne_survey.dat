40|$|In most {{nuclear and}} {{radiological}} emergencies involving {{the release of}} radioactive materials to environment, {{it is important that}} data on the geographic distribution of potentially hazardous radioactive materials be quickly presented to the authorities. The mobile radiation detection system makes it possible to measure radioactive materials in the environment at random places because of its easy mobility from place to place. The purpose of the work is to develop a mobile radiation detection system to measure gamma exposure rate, radioactive material on the ground and airborne radioactive particulate in the environment quickly. In this work, we have developed a <b>carborne</b> <b>survey</b> equipment system consisting of three gamma ray detectors, one airbome radioactive particulate sampler, a GPS (Global Positioning System), meteorological sensors, a data acquisition system and an operation software. Performance of the <b>carborne</b> <b>survey</b> equipment has been successfully demonstrated to measure iodine and argon release from medical isotope production facility on Serpong in western Java, Indonesia.

40|$|A <b>carborne</b> <b>survey</b> system, {{named as}} KURAMA (Kyoto University RAdiation MApping system), was {{developed}} {{as a response to}} the nuclear accident at TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011. Now the system has evolved into KURAMA-II, characterized by its compactness, autonomous operation, and acquisition of pulse-height spectrum data. A two-year field test of radiation monitoring by KURAMA-II on local buses, performed by Kyoto University, has successfully proceeded to the phase of official operation by the Fukushima prefectural government, supported by Kyoto University and JAEA (Japan Atomic Energy Agency). An outline and the current status of KURAMA-II, including some results of the continuous monitoring by KURAMA-II on local buses in Fukushima, are introduced...|$|E
40|$|The gamma dose {{rates were}} {{calculated}} {{from the results of}} gamma-spectrometric measurements of radionuclide concentrations in soils in the region of the Istrian peninsula, Croatia. Calculated gamma dose rate conversion factors (GDRCF) for external exposure above ground, give external dose rates per unit of natural radionuclide concentration in the soil and bedrock. GDRCF in air at a height of 100 cm above ground are tabulated for 40 K, 232 Th decay series, 238 U - 230 Th subseries and 226 Ra - 210 Pb subseries for various source depths in soil or bedrock up to a maximum depth of 120 cm. The radiometric maps must take into consideration gamma doses from soils as well as from underlying rocks in the first metre of ground profile. This is of crucial importance especially for carbonate terrains, where the differences between natural radionuclide concentrations in carbonate derived soils and carbonate bedrock could be of two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, for soils themselves the role of the drainage network in migration processes is undoubtedly very important. All these dependencies make us believe that gamma-spectrometric measurements and related dose rate conversions in connection with in situ dose measurements could be the best method for radiometric mapping at least for carbonate terrains with numerous rock outcrops, poor drainage and lithological variability on a local scale. Recalculation of natural background dose rate data, collected by airborne or <b>carborne</b> <b>surveys,</b> into radionuclide concentration in the ground in carbonate terrains is possible in two cases only: when soil is completely absent or where soils are well developed (thicknesses of 25 cm or more) ...|$|R

The radiological survey is done by airborne survey, <b>carborne</b> <b>survey</b> and environmental sampling, thereby narrowing the inspected area with each step. Our institute operates a measurement car with highly sensitive neutron and gamma detection systems. We investigated search strategies with the gamma detectors of this system. Of course large area surveys should be done by gross gamma counting. One problem with gamma survey are variations in background which may lead to incorrect identification of relevant spots or, even worse, to a miss of relevant spots due to high background. Therefore, our gamma detectors are equipped with special software, called NBR (natural background reduction). This is a proprietary technique which allows discriminating artificial from natural gamma radiation in a simple way without qualified spectral information and is therefore suitable, e. g., for plastic scintillators. This technique {{has proved to be}} valuable for the detection of artificial radiation for example at border crossing stations. This procedure was investigated for OSI operations where different nuclides are involved (see e. g. the list of relevant nuclides in the On Site Inspection Test Manual). After locating a refined search with hand-held devices can only be done with blinded instruments according to the treaty...|$|E
40|$|The CTBTO {{verification}} {{system comprises an}} On-Site Inspection (OSI) {{to verify}} the suspicion of a forbidden nuclear test. An OSI comprises different methods of verification, one of them being the radiological survey of the inspection area. Specific equipment with high sensitivity is needed for the gamma radiation survey. Airborne and <b>carborne</b> <b>survey</b> should clearly {{be carried out by}} gross gamma counting with devices of high efficiency, whereas the definition of a sampling spot with handheld measuring devices should focus on the relevant isotopes. In fact the treaty only allows measuring some specific nuclides, which limits the inspector's ability to analyze the results and to verify the correct functioning of his measuring equipment. For example, variations in natural background may be misinterpreted easily. Until now most of the equipment used in exercises for OSI was not "blinded". The presentation will address some issues specific to this type of instrument. In recent years high resolution gamma systems with electric cooling have become really portable and reliable. Now these systems are also suitable for search tasks in the field. We carried out measurements comparing the performance of low resolution gamma measuring devices (e. g. identifinder) and high resolution gamma devices (e. g. microDetective) for searching and identifying radioactive isotopes. In an OSI the next step after finding an anomaly in the radioactive survey is to take samples and analyze these samples in the field laboratory which is located close to the base of operations. Sample preparation and sample measurement {{turned out to be a}} bottleneck in OSI performance in the last OSI exercises. Therefore, it would be of great value to the OSI if sampling could be focused to relevant spots only thus avoiding unnecessary sample analysis of non-relevant samples. Portable high resolution gamma measuring equipment may help in that...|$|E
40|$|Quseir-Safaga area, Central Eastern Desert, Egypt, {{includes}} Duwi Formation, {{which contains}} uranium-bearing phosphate beds. The present work used the integrated carborne γ-ray spectrometric data, X-ray analysis and HPGe γ-ray spectrometer data {{to investigate the}} radioactive zones at this area. Carborne γ-ray spectrometric survey revealed an increase of equivalent uranium, up to 182  ppm. Maps were drawn to show {{the results of the}} three radioelements K, eU, eTh and the eU/eTh ratio. The eU and (eU/eTh) maps reveal that there are twelve important anomalies, associated mainly with phosphate mines. The Hamrawein mines at the northwestern part in the study area seem to represent the highest U-anomalies. Twelve phosphate samples were collected from the determined twelve anomalies. They were analyzed with HPGe detector gamma-ray spectrometer. It was found that the results of radioelement concentrations by <b>carborne</b> <b>survey</b> agree well with that obtained by HPGe. Both of them show that phosphate mines effectively contribute to eU anomalies, occurring in the study area. Meanwhile, 40 K, 238 U and 232 Th concentrations in phosphate samples range from 91 to 169, 864 to 3104 and 28. 4 to 106  Bq/kg respectively. The highest concentration of 238 U (3104  Bq/kg) occurs in the north of the studied area, close to Hamrawein city. The average concentration of 238 U in the analyzed samples is 1766  Bq/kg, which is 53 times higher than the worldwide average value reaching 33  Bq/kg. The highest 232 Th concentration value reaching 106  Bq/kg is 2. 4 times higher than the worldwide value attaining 45  Bq/kg. The absorbed dose rate for the phosphate samples shows the highest value reaching 1468  nGy/h. This is more than 25 times the worldwide average value 58  nGy/h. The annual effective absorbed dose is also high and reached 1. 8  mSv/y, which is about twice higher than the permitted value for public exposure of 1. 0  mSv/y. The maximum external hazardous index value of 9. 2 is more than nine times the unity permitted in ICRP, 2000...|$|E
