Although L.deliciosus var. deterrimus qualifies as synonym for L.deterrimus, the families, which had been characterized in North America as Lactarius deliciosus var. deterrimus, are not <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>with</b> the European types. They also seem not to form a monophyletic group.|$|E

5|$|Though {{relationships}} within the Abelisauridae are debated, Carnotaurus is consistently {{shown to be}} one of the most derived members of the family by cladistical analyses. Its nearest relative might have been either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus; this ambiguity is largely due to the incompleteness of the Aucasaurus skull material. A recent review suggests that Carnotaurus was not <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>with</b> either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus, and instead proposed Ilokelesia as its sister taxon.|$|E
5|$|The American robin (Turdus migratorius) is a migratory {{songbird}} of the thrush family. It {{is named}} after the European robin because of its reddish-orange breast, though the two species are not <b>closely</b> <b>related,</b> <b>with</b> the European robin belonging to the Old World flycatcher family. The American robin is widely distributed throughout North America, wintering from southern Canada to central Mexico and along the Pacific Coast. It is the state bird of Connecticut, Michigan, and Wisconsin. According to some sources, the American robin ranks behind only the red-winged blackbird (and {{just ahead of the}} introduced European starling and the not-always-naturally-occurring house finch) as the most abundant extant land bird in North America. It has seven subspecies, but only T. m. confinis of Baja California Sur is particularly distinctive, with pale gray-brown underparts.|$|E

It is the extensive organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing. Industrialization also introduces a form of philosophical change, where people obtain a different attitude towards their perception of nature.|$|E

25|$|Oreostylidium {{remained}} relatively untouched after that until an extensive {{review of the}} morphological details of Stylidiaceae was combined with genetic analysis of the chloroplast DNA genes rbcL and ndhF in 1998. The result of this study revealed that all major cladistic trees generated from the data suggested that the genus Oreostylidium is nested within the genus Stylidium. Based on that data, the authors of that study proposed that O. subulatum be known once again under its very first name, Stylidium subulatum and Oreostylidium should be reduced to synonymy of Stylidium. In 2002, another study based on molecular evidence determined that in the most parsimonious cladistic tree, Stylidium graminifolium and O. subulatum were <b>closely</b> <b>related,</b> <b>with</b> O. subulatum again nested within Stylidium. Based on molecular clock calculations and their data, the researchers concluded that S. graminifolium and O. subulatum shared a common ancestor about 3 million years ago. The researchers responsible for the 2002 study also concluded that Oreostylidium should be transferred to Stylidium and O. subulatum should retake its former name as Stylidium subulatum.|$|E
