5|$|Voluntary markets, also {{referred}} to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.|$|E
5|$|In the Robinson Crusoe economy, {{there is}} only one {{individual}} – Robinson Crusoe himself. He acts both as a producer to maximise profits, as well as <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> maximise his utility. The possibility of trade can be introduced by adding another person to the economy. This person is Crusoe's friend, Man Friday. Although in the novel he plays the role of Crusoe's servant, in the Robinson Crusoe economy he is considered as another actor with equal decision making abilities as Crusoe. Along with this, conditions of Pareto Efficiency can be analysed by bringing in the concept of the Edgeworth box.|$|E

40|$|As co-production {{becomes an}} {{important}} engagement for many consumers-suppliers situations, {{the issue of}} how <b>to</b> encourage <b>consumers</b> <b>to</b> engage in co-production becomes an important question. Marketers need to recognize that co-production is not an automatic consumer situation but a conscious decision by <b>consumers</b> <b>to</b> engage in such activities. This article presents several factors which may enhance the ability of <b>consumers</b> <b>to</b> engage in co-production. <b>To</b> engage <b>consumers,</b> marketers have <b>to</b> ensure that they offer those products and services that can be individually adjusted and modified, and to present them <b>to</b> <b>consumers</b> who have a higher propensity to engage in co-production activities. In order for <b>consumers</b> <b>to</b> agree to such endeavours, marketers must find what kind of benefits targeted consumers seek in such activities. Those usually encompass economic, psychological and social needs. Then, they have to offer them packages which can fulfill such needs...|$|R

25|$|The {{petroleum}} industry in Japan is now proceeding with {{research and development}} of an original alcohol fuel that differs from GAIAX. However, the commercial manufacture and sale of any new fuel may be barred by existing laws that currently exclude GAIAX from the market. Moreover, the strong aversion by the Japanese <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> a high density alcohol fuel of any type may prevent commercial success of any new fuel.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{restrictions}} on the units that consumers can use when asking for goods, {{and the use of}} supplementary indicators and dual-measure weighing scales (provided these have been calibrated in metric) means that it is possible for a <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> see an imperial price, request an imperial quantity and be supplied with the imperial quantity, provided that the seller legally weighs out and sells the metric equivalent.|$|E

The bus model has a completely new design of {{the front and rear}} panels, referring to the Solaris tram Tramino styling. It results from the wishes of the <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> visually resemble a bus tram. The drive system uses a hybrid system of the Allison II Generation.|$|E

25|$|Just {{like the}} supply curves reflect {{marginal}} cost curves, demand curves {{are determined by}} marginal utility curves. Consumers {{will be willing to}} buy a given quantity of a good, at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the opportunity cost determined by the price, that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> purchase a given product in a given frame of time.|$|E
25|$|Expectations {{created for}} the car during the run up to its {{production}} may {{have been out of}} proportion with its realised success. A 2008 study, by Indian rating agency CRISIL, thought the Nano would expand the nation's car market by 65%, but, as of late 2012, news reports have detailed the underwhelming response of the Indian <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> the offering; sales in the first two fiscal years after the car's unveiling remained steady at about 70,000 units although Tata appears intent on maintaining a capacity to produce the car in much larger quantities, some 250,000 per year, should the need arise.|$|E
25|$|Rum {{became an}} {{important}} trade good in the early period of the colony of New South Wales. The value of rum was based upon the lack of coinage among {{the population of the}} colony, and due to the drink's ability to allow its <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> temporarily forget about the lack of creature comforts available in the new colony. The value of rum was such that convict settlers could be induced to work the lands owned by officers of the New South Wales Corps. Due to rum's popularity among the settlers, the colony gained a reputation for drunkenness, though their alcohol consumption was less than levels commonly consumed in England at the time.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of Internet businesses are seeking consumer information in order to target their products or services at the right <b>consumers.</b> <b>To</b> overcome information privacy, or the desire of <b>consumers</b> <b>to</b> control the disclosure and subsequent use of personal information, Internet businesses need <b>to</b> motivate <b>consumers</b> <b>to</b> voluntarily disclose their personal information. This paper focuses {{on the issue of}} information disclosure by consumers. Based on a synthesis of literature from several disciplines, it offers a framework of seven motivators that can induce <b>consumers</b> <b>to</b> disclose their personal information. Through comprehensive conceptual and empirical validation processes, it presents a 32 -question instrument to measure these motivators. This instrument can facilitate future efforts at developing theories on information privacy and can help Internet businesses to better understand how best to solicit personal information fr...|$|R

25|$|In 2006, XM Satellite Radio was sued by the RIAA over XM's new {{portable}} devices the Inno and Helix. The RIAA claims these devices are {{equivalent to a}} downloading service, whereas XM contends the devices are protected under the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act. In July, XM requested that a federal judge dismiss the case. It {{should be noted that}} XM's subscribers can save only songs they hear on the radio and cannot request a specific song to be downloaded or program their radios to record specific artists. XM's {{portable devices}} allow the <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> record a portion of their broadcast much like a VCR, DVR, or cassette player would allow. The content a subscriber records is available only while the subscriber still has an active account with XM Satellite Radio. Once the account is terminated, the recorded content will become inaccessible. Also, If a subscriber fails to listen to a total of 8 hours of programming a month, the recorded content will not be accessible. Recorded content can be accessed only on the portable device; it cannot be transferred to a home computer or separate digital music player.|$|E
25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|E
500|$|Publishers such as Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Majesco Entertainment {{continued}} to release exclusive titles for the console, but the Wii's strongest titles remained within its first-party line-up. Analysts speculated {{that this would}} change in time as the Wii's growing popularity persuaded third-party publishers to focus on it; however, some third party developers expressed frustration at low software sales. Goichi Suda, developer of No More Heroes for the Wii, noted that [...] "only Nintendo titles are doing well. This isn't {{just because of the}} current situation in Japan, as this is happening outside Japan. I am very surprised about the reality about Wii, because before I was making this game, I wasn't expecting that Wii would be a console targeted only for non-gamers. I expected more games for hardcore gamers. The reality is different to what I expected." [...] Conversely, the PAL publisher of No More Heroes Rising Star Games were greatly impressed with the game's sales. Goichi Suda later retracted his comment, saying his [...] "point was that No More Heroes, unlike a lot of Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product that will attract a different kind of <b>consumer</b> <b>to</b> the hardware, i.e. gamers who are looking for a different genre to the products that have been successful on this platform thus far." ...|$|E
