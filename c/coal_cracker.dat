50|$|In 1971, the Firebirds {{merged with}} the Norfolk Neptunes and left Pottstown. (That year, the Seaboard Football League {{established}} the Schuylkill County <b>Coal</b> <b>Crackers</b> as a replacement team; the <b>Coal</b> <b>Crackers</b> moved to Reading after one season, bringing an end to professional football in Pottstown.) After {{the collapse of the}} ACFL a couple of years later, the World Football League sprang up. Many of the Pottstown Firebirds went on to play for the Philadelphia Bell as described in Vince Papale's book Invincible. Ron Waller, former Head Offensive Coach of the Firebirds, served as interim head coach of the San Diego Chargers for the final six games of 1973, then moved on to become head coach of the Philadelphia Bell in 1974.|$|R

50|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>Cracker</b> is {{a classic}} hydroflume ride located at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The ride was {{installed}} by Arrow Development in 1973, making it the oldest water ride at Hersheypark still in daily operation. It has a unique layout, due to the terrain features {{of this part of}} the park.|$|E
50|$|The Lost River was {{replaced}} by the <b>Coal</b> <b>Cracker,</b> built on the hill above Spring Creek, for the 1973 season. The Lost River's space was never truly replaced until the Great Bear steel coaster was built in 1998; its second and largest drop, vertical loop and Immelman element are located in the same location as the Mill Chute.|$|E
50|$|Thrill Ride has one primary table, which {{doubles as}} a region for Fun Zone puzzles, and a {{secondary}} Thrill Zone table to one side. There are two multiball ramps, one a roller coaster (the Wildcat) and one a water ride (the <b>Coal</b> <b>Cracker).</b> Two of the Fun Zone puzzles send you to secondary tables, a River Rafting table and a Lightning Racer Virtual Coaster.|$|E
50|$|One of Hersheypark's most {{significant}} floods occurred in 1972 {{as a result}} of Hurricane Agnes. A number of rides were heavily damaged or destroyed as a result. These rides include the turnpike ride, the Mill Chute and the giant slides. They were eventually replaced (the <b>Coal</b> <b>Cracker</b> (1973) and Twin Turnpike (1975) were put on higher ground in Minetown, and the Merry Derry Dip Fun Slide was put in Midway America twenty five years later in 1997).|$|E
50|$|Riders {{are seated}} in 12 ft boats {{for the three}} and a half minute ride along a water channel over 2000 ft long. Once the {{fiberglass}} boat has ascended the first lift hill, riders are only 55 ft off the ground. A second lift carries riders above the Twin Turnpike ride, preparing them for the final 35-degree, 49 ft drop. Riders' photographs are taken midway through the drop. The <b>Coal</b> <b>Cracker</b> shares space with several newer rides, including the SooperDooperLooper (built in 1977) and the Great Bear (1998).|$|E
50|$|Until {{the start}} of the 2014 season, this area of the park had been called Minetown, which had been officially opened in 1990 with the {{additions}} of Convoy, Red Baron, Flying Falcon and Dinosaur-Go-Round. All except Dinosaur-Go-Round and Flying Falcon are still in the area; Dinosaur-Go-Round was moved to Founder's Circle for the 2007 season so the Frog Hoppers could be moved to its location {{to make room for the}} Boardwalk, and Flying Falcon was removed after the 2016 season to make room for Hershey Triple Tower. The section features many classic Hersheypark attractions, including the Sunoco Twin Turnpike, <b>Coal</b> <b>Cracker</b> log flume, Kissing Tower and Great Bear. It is also home to the Minetown Arcade, Minetown Restaurant, Hersheypark Amphitheater, Hersheypark Aquatheater and the Hersheypark entrance to ZooAmerica. The Minetown Restaurant is a cafeteria style place, and is the only area in the park where alcohol is served.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s this {{movement}} gained new {{expression in the}} United States in response to growing media bias against youth, i.e. the hyper-sensationalization of youth violence ala [...] "superpredators", and continued to grow due to the [...] "Columbine" [...] shootings. The first online, teen-written newspaper, The Tattoo, began in 1994 with a promise of giving voice to teens. This movement features hundreds of individuals and organizations working across the United States to promote the roles {{of young people in}} society and in the media. Demonstrating the wide reach of youth-led media a program in Oakland, California called Youth Radio has been featured across national media outlets in the U.S., including NPR and PBS. Other examples include the Blunt Youth Radio Project, which provides an hour-long, weekly, youth-produced public affairs radio show on WMPG in Portland, Maine. A general interest magazine called Nang! is produced and distributed on a quarterly basis to 14- to 21-year-olds in London. Speak Africa is a Pan-African youth-produced multi-media communication initiative that works in print, radio, TV, the Internet and community theatre, and the Vera Project is an all-ages, non-profit youth music organization in Seattle, Washington. <b>Coal</b> <b>Cracker</b> youth-led news based in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, is a quarterly newspaper and website with content by young journalists from 12-18 years old.|$|E
