40|$|Abstract. Traditional paper-based {{maps are}} still {{superior}} to their digital counterparts used on mobile devices in several ways. They provide high-resolution, large-scale information with zero power consumption. On {{the other hand}} digital maps provide personalized and dynamic information on request, but suffer from small outer scales and low resolutions. In this work we try to combine the advantages of both by using mobile <b>camera</b> <b>devices</b> (such as smartphones ore PDA) as a map-referenced magic lens that displays geo-referenced information {{on top of the}} physical map. We will mainly focus on the interaction schemes that arise from using mobile <b>camera</b> <b>devices</b> with physical maps and briefly explain how the device tracking over existing physical maps can be realized. ...|$|R

50|$|Optical 3D {{measuring}} systems {{use this}} principle {{as well in}} order to determine the spatial dimensions and the geometry of an item. Basically, the configuration consists of two sensors observing the item. One of the sensors is typically a digital <b>camera</b> <b>device,</b> and the other one can also be a camera or a light projector. The projection centers of the sensors and the considered point on the object’s surface define a (spatial) triangle. Within this triangle, the distance between the sensors is the base b and must be known. By determining the angles between the projection rays of the sensors and the basis, the intersection point, and thus the 3D coordinate, is calculated from the triangular relations.|$|E

30|$|This {{equation}} {{indicates that}} the obtained intensities in ordinary <b>camera</b> <b>devices</b> are proportional to input energy I(x,y).

30|$|An obvious {{characteristic}} of this database {{is that some}} <b>camera</b> <b>devices</b> {{belong to the same}} brand. Most of the previous works, including the experiments in ‘Part A’ section, only considered different camera brands. It might lead to a problem that we cannot make a clear division of camera source identification and camera model identification because the extracted SPN might contain part of camera model noises, which could be regarded as fingerprints of a special camera model. These noises play different roles in experiments dependent on the models of tested cameras. So, if all the tested cameras come from different camera brands, the SPN with more camera model noises might give a better performance than the more accurate one which is with less camera model noises in it. And, the results of such experiments are not very reliable when different <b>camera</b> <b>devices</b> of the same camera model are considered.|$|R

5000|$|Rosing's {{invention}} expanded on {{the designs}} of Paul Nipkow and his mechanical system of rotating lenses and mirrors. Accordingly, Rosing's system employed a mechanical <b>camera</b> <b>device,</b> but used very early cathode ray tube (developed in Germany by Karl Ferdinand Braun) as a receiver. Rosing's Braun Tubes consisted of two parallel metal plates {{that were used to}} electrically shift the electron beam itself before it was scanned and reached the screen. These two plates were connected electrically to the photoelectric cell in the camera. Depending on the output of the photoelectric cells, the beam would be deflected up or down before entering the concentrating plate. Since this movement increased or decreased the number of electrons passing between the plates, it had the effect of varying the brightness of the electron beam. The system was primitive, but it was definitely one of the first experimental demonstrations where the cathode ray tube was employed for the purposes of television.|$|E
5000|$|Chameleon {{appeared}} as a recurring villain in the 1990s Spider-Man animated series, having no speaking lines in his true form yet voiced by multiple voice actors via matching whomever he is impersonating. An international hitman and spy, Chameleon wears a belt-mounted <b>camera</b> <b>device,</b> which is capable of capturing {{an image of a}} person, so that he can turn into that person as a form of disguise. This proved to be his undoing in his first appearance: he copied an image of Nick Fury from a Daily Bugle front page which had been inadvertently flipped. Thus, Fury's eyepatch was on the wrong side and Spider-Man pointed out to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents he was an impostor. During all this, Mary Jane Watson met Chameleon, disguised as Peter Parker, and asked him to come to a Shakespeare play. Chameleon kissed Mary Jane on the lips passionately to hide from S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Mary Jane kissed Chameleon back, thinking that he was Peter and thought he promised her to come to the play. Chameleon, disguised as Peter, later attempted to kill two diplomats at a U.N. conference, but was foiled by Spider-Man, easily picking him out from the crowd as he had taken Peter's appearance. Chameleon later becomes a member of the Insidious Six where he took the form of a prison guard to free Shocker, Scorpion, Mysterio, Rhino and Doctor Octopus from the prison cells. During all this, Chameleon impersonated various individuals; the Kingpin only to say one sentence, Hammerhead to help kidnap Silvermane, Silvermane to trick Silvermane's henchmen, and even Aunt May to mess with Spider-Man. In the episodes [...] "Framed" [...] and [...] "The Man Without Fear", Chameleon works for Richard Fisk, framing Peter for getting restricted government information. Chameleon even posed as Spider-Man to abduct Peter from the paddy wagon outside of the courthouse after the first half of Parker's trial. After Parker's name is cleared by Spider-Man and Daredevil, Chameleon as well as Richard and rogue Federal Agent Susan Choi are arrested, put on trial, and sentenced to prison. It is revealed that Chameleon is jailed in a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison and was assigned by the Kingpin to impersonate and release John Hardy, using his newfound ability to take on different forms without his <b>camera</b> <b>device.</b> In the episode [...] "Six Forgotten Warriors", Chameleon was sprung from prison by the Kingpin and the Insidious Six in order to find the keys to the Red Skull's doomsday device. When Red Skull was freed from the time dilation loophole, it was revealed that Chameleon is Red Skull's stepson. In the end, Electro along with Red Skull and Captain America were trapped in a time dilation loophole and Chameleon escaped.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Multi-focus {{portable}} plenoptic <b>camera</b> <b>devices</b> {{provide a}} rea-sonable tradeoff between spatial and angular resolution while enlarging {{the depth of}} field of a standard camera. Many applications using the data captured by these <b>camera</b> <b>devices</b> require or benefit from correspondences established between the single microlens images. In this work we propose a lens-based depth estimation scheme based on a novel adaptive lens se-lection strategy. Coarse depth estimates serve as indicators for suitable target lenses. The selection criterion accounts for lens overlap {{and the amount of}} defocus blur between the reference and possible target lenses. The depth maps are regularized using a semi-global strategy. For in-sufficiently textured scenes, we further incorporate a semi-global coarse regularization with respect to the lens-grid. In contrast to algorithms operating on the complete lightfield, our algorithm has a low memory footprint. The resulting per-lens dense depth maps are well suited for volumetric surface reconstruction techniques. We show that our selec-tion strategy achieves similar error rates as selection strategies with a fixed number of lenses, while being computationally less time consum-ing. Results are presented for synthetic as well as real-world datasets. ...|$|R
