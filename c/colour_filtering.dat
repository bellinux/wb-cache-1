40|$|The pixel size {{imposes a}} {{fundamental}} {{limit on the}} amount of information that can be displayed or recorded on a sensor. Thus, there is strong motivation to reduce the pixel size down to the nanometre scale. Nanometre colour pixels cannot be fabricated by simply downscaling current pixels due to colour cross talk and diffraction caused by dyes or pigments used as <b>colour</b> <b>filters.</b> <b>Colour</b> <b>filters</b> based on plasmonic effects can overcome these difficulties. Although different plasmonic <b>colour</b> <b>filters</b> have been demonstrated at the micron scale, there have been no attempts so far to reduce the filter size to the submicron scale.

An example of this can be observed in Onychophorans where the cuticula of the shell continues to the cornea. The cornea is composed of either one or two cuticular layers depending on how recently the animal has moulted.

25|$|Rows 1–4 of the midband are {{specialised}} for colour vision, from ultraviolet to longer wavelengths. Their UV vision {{can detect}} five different frequency bands {{in the deep}} ultraviolet. To do this they use two photoreceptors in combination with four different <b>colour</b> <b>filters.</b> They are not currently believed {{to be sensitive to}} infrared light. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom (area of eye that absorbs light from a single direction) is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by <b>colour</b> <b>filters</b> (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a <b>colour</b> <b>filter</b> of one class, a tier again, a <b>colour</b> <b>filter</b> of another class, and then a last tier. These <b>colour</b> <b>filters</b> allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490-550nm. Rows 5–6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment (a ninth class) and are specialised for polarisation vision. They can detect different planes of polarised light. A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the upper and lower hemispheres of the eye.|$|R
