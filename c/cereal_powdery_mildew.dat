40|$|Assessments of {{epidemiological}} parameters (e. g. infection efficiency, latent period, spore production) {{are required}} for the prediction of epidemic progress, for the estimation of components of partial resistance for different host plant cultivars and for the estimation of fitness components of pathogen isolates. A critical evaluation of methods of measurement of monocyclic parameters is presented, suggesting improvements by using more accurate techniques and taking into account different biotic and abiotic factors. Examples of influence of lesion density and age, of meteorological factors and of nutrient status of the host on <b>cereal</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> and rust epidemiological parameters are presented. The use of the ratio of mature lesions rather than the latent period for the estimation of the development rate of the fungus is suggested to allow comparison {{of a large number}} of individuals. It is feasible to assess the pathogen biomass by the sterol contents. The need to verify by field experiments epidemiological parameters assessed under controlled conditions is pointed out. Finally, the way to include these monocyclic parameters in epidemiological and forecasting models is discussed using the case of wheat brown rust epidemics...|$|E

A total of five isolates of the contaminant were obtained and identified as Paecilomyces farinosus based on morphological characteristics and rDNA ITS sequence data. To determine whether these P. farinosus isolates {{can be considered}} as biocontrol agents (BCAs) of powdery mildews, we studied the interactions between P. farinosus and the following four powdery mildew species: B. graminis f. sp. hordei infecting barley, Oidium neolycopersici infecting tomato, Golovinomyces orontii infecting tobacco and Podosphaera fusca infecting cucumber. The powdery mildew colonies of all these four powdery mildew species were quickly destroyed by P. farinosus in leaf cultures but neither conidial suspensions nor cell-free culture filtrates of P. farinosus isolates could suppress the spread of powdery mildew infections on diseased barley, tomato, tobacco or cucumber plants in the greenhouse. It is concluded that P. farinosus cannot be considered as a promising BCA of powdery mildew infections although it can destroy powdery mildew colonies in detached leaf cultures and can be a menace during the maintenance of such cultures of cereal, apple, cucurbit and tomato powdery mildew isolates...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a large}} {{diversity}} of genetically defined resistance genes in bread wheat against the <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> pathogen Blumeria graminis (B. g.) f. sp. tritici. Many confer race-specific resistance to this pathogen, but until now only the mildew avirulence gene AvrPm 3 a 2 /f 2 that is recognized by Pm 3 a/f was known molecularly. We performed map-based cloning and genome-wide association studies to isolate {{a candidate for the}} mildew avirulence gene AvrPm 2. We then used transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana to demonstrate specific and strong recognition of AvrPm 2 by Pm 2. The virulent AvrPm 2 allele arose from a conserved 12 kb deletion, while there is no protein sequence diversity in the gene pool of avirulent B. g. tritici isolates. We found one polymorphic AvrPm 2 allele in B. g. triticale and one orthologue in B. g. secalis and both are recognized by Pm 2. AvrPm 2 belongs to a small gene family encoding structurally conserved RNase-like effectors, including Avra 13 from B. g. hordei, the cognate Avr of the barley resistance gene Mla 13.

40|$|Abstract Background Protein effectors of {{pathogenicity}} are {{instrumental in}} modulating host immunity and disease resistance. The powdery mildew pathogen of grasses Blumeria graminis causes {{one of the}} most important diseases of cereal crops. B. graminis is an obligate biotrophic pathogen and as such has an absolute requirement to suppress or avoid host immunity if it is to survive and cause disease. Results Here we characterise a superfamily predicted to be the full complement of Candidates for Secreted Effector Proteins (CSEPs) in the fungal barley powdery mildew parasite B. graminis f. sp. hordei. The 491 genes encoding these proteins constitute over 7 % of this pathogen’s annotated genes and most were grouped into 72 families of up to 59 members. They were predominantly expressed in the intracellular feeding structures called haustoria, and proteins specifically associated with the haustoria were identified by large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics. There are two major types of effector families: one comprises shorter proteins (100 – 150 amino acids), with a high relative expression level in the haustoria and evidence of extensive diversifying selection between paralogs; the second type consists of longer proteins (300 – 400 amino acids), with lower levels of differential expression and evidence of purifying selection between paralogs. An analysis of the predicted protein structures underscores their overall similarity to known fungal effectors, but also highlights unexpected structural affinities to ribonucleases throughout the entire effector super-family. Candidate effector genes belonging to the same family are loosely clustered in the genome and are associated with repetitive DNA derived from retro-transposons. Conclusions We employed the full complement of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses as well as structural prediction methods to identify and characterize the members of the CSEPs superfamily in B. graminis f. sp. hordei. Based on relative intron position and the distribution of CSEPs with a ribonuclease-like domain in the phylogenetic tree we hypothesize that the associated genes originated from an ancestral gene, encoding a secreted ribonuclease, duplicated successively by repetitive DNA-driven processes and diversified during the evolution of the grass and <b>cereal</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> lineage. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ergosterol {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors (EBIs) have {{a remarkably}} {{broad spectrum of}} antifungal activity. They belong to the commercial fungicides which exhibit the highest activity known to date. Resistance to EBIs was found in vitro, but the level of resistance and the decreased fitness of resistant strains led to the hypothesis that resistance to EBIs was rather unlikely to develop in practice. Despite the fact that EBIs were introduced as early as 1972, up to 1980 only data on EBI-resistant laboratory strains were available. However, gradually there appeared reports on decreased sensitivity to EBIs in practice. This made it of interest to investigate the potential development of resistance to EBIs in vivo. In this study the pathogen used to gather the desired information was Sphaerotheca fuliginea, as this fungus is widespread in cucumber glasshouses in the Netherlands, intensively controlled with fungicides and resistance-prone. This thesis contains five papers describing several aspects of resistance to fungicides in S. fuliginea. In the first paper {{it has been shown}} that S. fuliginea is present on cucumber plants all year round. A gradual increase in the number of infected crops, in the form of S-shaped curves, was observed from planting until May. In the districts with the highest crop density (Pijnacker), mildew was generally observed early in the growing season, while the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was higher than in other districts. In the district with the lowest crop density (Northern Netherlands), mildew was observed late in the growing season and the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was low. Early in the growing season the pathogen is probably dispersed by transportation of infected planting stock and by man. When the disease pressure increases, inoculum is probably dispersed by wind. This implies that inoculum is highly mobile and that, in the case of development of resistance to fungicides, the resistant strains will disperse to crops where the spray regime did not cause resistance to develop. As S. fuliginea developed resistance to dimethirimol, benzimidazoles and pyrazophos in 1971, 1972 and 1979, respectively, it was thought that presence of strains resistant to these fungicides might provide information on the long-term fitness of these strains. The results of an investigation are presented in the second paper. Strains resistant to these fungicides still persisted in the pathogen population. Although this finding may indicate that the long-term fitness of these strains is equal to that of wild-type strains, several other factors might be involved in the persistence of resistance. From 1981 to 1984, S. fuliginea in the Netherlands was primarily controlled with EBIs. The short-term fitness of isolates of S. fuliginea resistant to EBIs and their behaviour under practical conditions are described in the third, fourth and fifth paper. Several fitness parameters of EBI-resistant isolates collected from commercial glasshouses were compared to those of isolates with a wild-type sensitivity to EBIs. Fitness parameters studied were germination of conidia, growth of germ tubes and mycelium, penetration, sporulation and competitive ability. The results are described in the third paper. One or more values of fitness parameters for EBI-resistant isolates were significantly lower than those for the wild-type isolates. However, in general it was concluded that the fitness of EBI-resistant S. fuliginea isolates, collected in commercial glasshouses, was hardly reduced. Within the group of EBI-resistant isolates tested no significant relation was observed between the degree of resistance to EBIs and the degree of fitness. In the fourth and fifth paper the resistance to EBIs of S. fuliginea over a three-year period has been described. In 1981 the sensitivity of glasshouse isolates to EBIs was lower than that of the wild-type isolates. In 1982 and 1983 the sensitivity decreased further. In 1984, no significant differences in sensitivity with the 1983 level were apparent. Per district, the degree of resistance appeared to be positively correlated to the frequency of application of EBIs. Isolates collected in the district of Limburg, where EBIs were applied less frequently than in the district of Pijnacker, showed a significantly higher sensitivity to EBIs than isolates collected in Pijnacker. Triforine showed a very low efficacy in controlling glasshouse isolates. This is in accordance with the experience of growers who, therefore, only use triforine when the disease pressure is low. It is concluded that the decreased sensitivity to triforine can be regarded as resistance. In the case of bitertanol, fenarimol and imazalil, a change to shorter spray intervals has up till now been sufficient to achieve proper control. Contrary to earlier presumptions that development of resistance to EBIs seemed rather unlikely, it gradually developed in normal commercial practice. The slowly decreasing sensitivity to EBIs of <b>cereal</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> is in line with the results described in this thesis. Strategies to delay resistance to EBIs are necessary. Alternation with other site-specific and multi-site fungicides must be advised and can be applied immediately. Non-EBI fungicides are registered for control of cucumber powdery mildew in the Netherlands. Appropriate information and guidance by extension officers and fungicide manufacturers may lower the reluctance of growers to use these strategies. In the long run, control of S. fuliginea might only be maintained by a form of integrated control, which accepts less than perfect disease control. Biological and chemical control, induced resistance of cucumber plants, epidermal coating and mildew-tolerant cucumber cultivars are elements that may fit into a strategy for integrated control of cucumber powdery mildew...|$|E

In this research, we identify Pm 21 as a typical coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat gene by an integrated strategy of resistance gene analog (RGA) -based cloning via comparative genomics, physical and genetic mapping, BSMV-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS), large-scale mutagenesis and genetic transformation...|$|R
40|$|Conidia of the obligate biotrophic fungal {{pathogen}} Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) play a {{vital role}} in its survival and rapid dispersal. However, little is known about the genetic basis for its asexual reproduction. To uncover the primary metabolic and regulatory events during conidiation, we sequenced the transcriptome of Bgt epiphytic structures at 3 (vegetative hyphae growth), 4 (foot cells initiation), and 5 (conidiophore erection) days post-inoculation (dpi). RNA-seq analyses identified 556 and 404 (combined 685) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 4 and 5 dpi compared with their expression levels at 3 dpi, respectively. We found that several genes involved in the conversion from a variety of sugars to glucose, glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TAC), the electron transport chain (ETC), and unsaturated fatty acid oxidation were activated during conidiation, suggesting that more energy supply is required during this process. Moreover, we found that glucose was converted into glycogen, which was accumulated in developing conidiophores, indicating that it could be the primary energy storage molecule in Bgt conidia. Clustering for the expression profiles of 91 regulatory genes showed that calcium (Ca 2 +), H 2 O 2, and phosphoinositide (PIP) signaling were involved in Bgt conidiation. Furthermore, a strong accumulation of H 2 O 2 in developing conidiophores was detected. Application of EGTA, a Ca 2 + chelator, and trifluoperazine dihydrochloride (TFP), a calmodulin (CaM) antagonist, markedly suppressed the generation of H 2 O 2, affected foot cell and conidiophore development and reduced conidia production significantly. These results suggest that Ca 2 + and H 2 O 2 signaling play important roles in conidiogenesis and a crosslink between them is present. In addition to some conidiation-related orthologs known in other fungi, such as the velvet complex components, we identified several other novel B. graminis-specific genes that have not been previously found to be implicated in fungal conidiation, reflecting a unique molecular mechanism underlying asexual development of <b>cereal</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews...</b>|$|R

The section on ?Host-Parasite Interactions? covers the dynamic recent developments in <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> research and provides insight into how the new information may be exploited to limit the devastating worldwide impact of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews.</b> These chapters focus on disease resistance with detailed discussions of both inherent and induced resistance in host plants, the chain of host defense responses leading to resistance, and the genetic, molecular, biological, and physiological bases of resistant interactions. Chapters within the ?Populations? section present information on epidemiology and population genetics of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> in both agricultural and natural plant pathosystems. These chapters detail complexities of genetic interactions between host resistance and parasite virulence. In ?Control Methods?, chapters cover breeding for resistance in the face of rapidly emerging virulent mildew races, the development and use of fungicides with strategies to minimize mildew resistance, alternative controls employing biological agents and other environmental manipulations, and the potential for developing transgenic plants with built-in resistance.

Cool and moist environmental conditions favor development of downy mildew, while warmer and dry weather is conducive for development of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> Potential new fungicides were evaluated for control of these diseases during 1994 and 1995. In 1994, downy mildew did not occur in the test plots; however, <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> was severe and was controlled most effectively by Microthiol. In the 1995 study, both downy and <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> developed in the test plots. The highest level of downy mildew control was achieved with three experimental compounds, Fluazinam, Dimethomorph, and BAS- 490. The most effective fungicides for control of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> in 1995 were BAS- 490 and Microthiol...|$|R
40|$|Pepper <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> causes {{increasingly}} economical damage due {{to increased}} cultivation of pepper ingreenhouses. To assess resistance of pepper resources against pepper <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew,</b> we developed a novelevaluation formula for pepper resistance against <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> The evaluation formula named S index isas follows; (number of the highest disease leaf/top leaf number) -(number of the lowest disease leaf/top leafnumber). Positive correlation (81 %, P = 0. 01) between S index and authentic disease leaf rate was observedfrom the pepper plants infected by <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> Various pepper species from our genetic resources wereevaluated to identify pepper varieties conferring resistance against powdery mild using S-index. Capsicumfrutescens accessions 3 CA 131 and C. baccatum accessions 3 CA 0162, 3 CA 174, 3 CA 176 showed high resistanceto <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew,</b> but none of C. annuum was resistant.

40|$|<b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on lettuce {{is caused}} by the fungus Golovinomyces cichoracearum (Erysiphe cichoracearum). This disease is favored by {{moderate}} to warm temperatures and dry weather conditions. Several potential new fungicides were evaluated for control of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on lettuce in 2003. <b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> appeared in our plots by Jan 9 and reached high levels by plant maturity on Feb 19. Compared to non-treated plants, all treatments significantly reduced the final severity of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on lettuce statistically. However, {{only a limited number of}} compounds, such as Rally, Microthiol Disperss, Quinoxyfen, Flint, Zoxamide, Maneb, Pristine and Cabrio, provided the degree of disease control that would be of value to growers. The trial was intended to be a downy and <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> trial; therefore, some of the treatments within this study were specifically included for downy mildew. No downy mildew developed; however, the downy mildew test products did offer some protection against <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew...</b>|$|R
40|$|Challenge by a nonadapted <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> fungal {{pathogen}} {{leads to}} the formation of a local cell-wall apposition (papilla) beneath the point of attempted penetration. Several plasma membrane (PM) proteins with opposing roles in <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> infection, including Arabidopsis thaliana PENETRATION 1 (PEN 1) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O (MLO), are localized to the site of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> attack. PEN 1 contributes to penetration resistance to nonadapted <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews,</b> whereas MLO is a susceptibility factor required by adapted <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> pathogens for host cell entry. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the vesicle and endosomal trafficking inhibitors, brefeldin A and wortmannin, have opposite effects on the penetration rates of adapted and nonadapted <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> on grapevine. These findings prompted us to study the pathogen-induced intracellular trafficking of grapevine variants of MLO and PEN 1. We first identified grapevine (Vitis vinifera) VvPEN 1 and VvMLO orthologs that rescue Arabidopsis Atpen 1 and Atmlo 2 mlo 6 mlo 12 null mutants, respectively. By using endomembrane trafficking inhibitors in combination with fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that VvMLO 3 /VvMLO 4 and VvPEN 1 are co-trafficked together from the PM to the site of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> challenge. This focal accumulation of VvMLO 3 /VvMLO 4 and VvPEN 1 to the site of attack seems to be required for their opposing functions during <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> attack, because their subcellular localization is correlated with the outcome of attempted <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> penetration.

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the Integrated Production {{approach}} is an overall reduction of pesticide use, including the application of fungicides for disease control. <b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> is the most frequently sprayed disease in Oregon vineyards. Losses to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> vary from year to year, but may be substantial. Because little or no tolerance exists at the winery for fruit affected by <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew,</b> reduced fungicide application without increased disease incidence must be based on a reliable forecasting system. A <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> forecasting system adapted to Oregon conditions would allow growers to time spray applications with greater confidence, and consequently, could result in reduced fungicide applications. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> forecasting model developed by Doug Gubler for California vineyards under Oregon conditions...|$|R

This study wasconducted to evaluate the resistance of commercial cucurbit cultivars (21 cultivars of cucumber, 9 cultivars ofwatermelon, 7 cultivars of oriental melon, and 2 cultivars of melon) to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> and root-knotnematode. At 60 days after transplanting, disease severity of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> of commercial cucurbitcultivars was investigated. Two cucumber cultivars, ‘Gangryeogsamcheok’ and ‘Sunhobaegchimdadagi’were moderately resistant {{but the rest of}} cucumber cultivars were susceptible to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> Allexamined watermelon and oriental melon cultivars were susceptible to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew,</b> while two meloncultivars (‘PMR Turbo’ and ‘PMR Victory’) were resistant. At 45 days after inoculation of seedlings, diseaseseverity of root-knot nematode of commercial cucurbit cultivars were investigated. One cucumber cultivars,‘Baegbongdadagi’ was moderately resistant and the others were susceptible to root-knot nematode. In case ofwatermelon, ‘Dalgonakkul’ was resistant and the others were moderately resistant or susceptible to root-knotnematode. All examined oriental melon and melon cultivars were susceptible to root- not nematode. On theseresults, we recommend that resistant cultivars to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> and/or root-knot nematode will be moresuitable in cultivation of cucurbits for organic farming...|$|R
40|$|<b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> occurs {{annually}} on melons in Arizona. Podosphaera xanthii (Sphaerotheca fuliginea) is the plant pathogenic fungus that causes <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on cucurbits, such as cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, cucumber and squash. Development of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on melons is favored by moderate temperatures and relative humidity, succulent plant growth and reduced light intensity {{brought about by}} a dense plant canopy. Existing products as well as materials under development were evaluated and compared for efficacy in management of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on cantaloupe in a field trial conducted {{during the spring of}} 2006 at the Yuma Valley Agricultural Center. A high level of disease had developed when disease severity data was recorded at crop maturity (Jun 15). Among treatments, the degree of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> control ranged from 0 to 100 %. Among tested products, several are registered for use in Arizona for control of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on melons.

40|$|<b>Powdery</b> <b>Mildew</b> is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and more destructive disease in nature. Chemical control of fungal pathogens is a routine method for management of this disease. One cannot rely on chemical control permanently as it is not ecofriendly. Nature has solved this problem by providing biocontrol agents. During routine survey of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> disease from a World Heritage Site – Kas Plateau, (Dist-Satara, M.

The bionomics of Illeis cincta with <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> has been discussed in this paper. Larval stages of I. cinacta are voracious feeders of anamorphs of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> disease than that of adults. Increase in natural population of mycophagous insect may help in reduction of anamorphs of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> This will definitely lower down further spread of disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A Bacillus sp. BS 061 {{significantly}} reduced disease incidence of gray mold and <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> To identify the active principle, the culture filtrate was partitioned between butanol and water. The antifungal activity against B. cinerea {{was evident in}} the butanol-soluble portion, and active substances were identified as cyclic lipopeptides, iturin A series, by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) and mass analysis. Interestingly, antifungal activity against <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> was observed in the water-soluble portion, suggesting that cyclic lipopeptides have no responsibility to suppress <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> This finding reveals that biocontrol agents of Bacillus origin suppress gray mold and <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> through the secretion of different bioactive substances...|$|R
40|$|The most {{frequent}} fungus species known as <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews,</b> causing the diseases of forest trees, were studied. Among forest woody species, oaks are especially susceptible to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> attack, and among them pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L) is highly endangered. This paper reports 49 species of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews.</b> However, Microsphaera alphitoides {{has the greatest}} significance in forest economy, causing the decline of seedlings in nurseries and also aggravating the natural regeneration of pedunculate oak. This fungus, together with gypsy moth and honey fungus (Armillaria mellea) participates in the dying of old oak trees. <b>Powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> can be successfully controlled by fungicides, and sulphur fungicides Karatan and Rubigan are especially effective...|$|R
