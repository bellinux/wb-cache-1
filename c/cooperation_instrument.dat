One centres on an integrated and free trade ASEAN with each of four major Asian partners: China, Japan, Korea and India; the other, clearly more ambitious, consists of a complete free trade area amongst these fourteen countries. Simulations with the Mirage model show that Japan and Korea would have greater interest in the creation of a completely integrated area, whereas the ASEAN would derive greater benefits from bilateral agreements.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the main characteristics of international cooperation in the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) {{within the framework of}} the EU macroregional strategy. The analysis of the key directions, structure, and the Strategy implementation mechanisms demonstrates its experimental and innovative nature. At the same time, the authors identify problems and contradictions in the very idea of the Strategy, as well as its actual implementation in intergovernmental relations of the BSR countries. The main factor hampering the Strategy activities is ignoring the key role of Russia the BSR. At the same time, Russia and some non-BSR countries are already members of all significant BSR <b>cooperation</b> <b>instruments.</b> Therefore, there is a need to supplement the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region with the Northern Dimension project. The innovative nature of macroregional cooperation in the Baltic Sea region is manifested in interpreting the region as an indivisible whole rather than an administrative unite serving as a pla tform for various cooperation programmes implemented in its different parts. From this point of view, the Strategy for the Baltic Sea region, apparently inspired by "rational functionalism", can assign a new meaning to the concept of the region...|$|R

During this period, many changes have taken place, both within each of the regions and in the international context, and these have affected different areas of the Association. There is awareness of the need to cooperate and develop the bi-regional association, but the expectations and incentives of the various countries and sub-regions are different. In the time that remains until the next EU-LAC summit, priority attention will be focused on the progress of the ongoing negotiations with the three blocs: Central America, the countries of CAN (Andean Community) and MERCOSUR (Mercado Común del Sur, or Southern Common Market). With respect to the two cooperation priorities, support for regional integration and social cohesion should be made integral components of the policies devised for the region.

With the loss of development policy’s independent status, the underlying hypothesis of many representatives of the development community is that the poverty focus of EU development cooperation will be undermined by the emergence of a dominant and unchecked EEAS in the programming and management cycle of development <b>cooperation</b> <b>instruments.</b> This paper, however, shows that the loss of development policy’s independent status does not necessarily lead to a weakening of the EU’s commitment to poverty eradication. It is argued that if an institutional capacity is put in place to maintain the system of checks and balances in the programming cycle alive and, by consequence, to ensure that aid regulations reflect a clear focus on poverty eradication, development cooperation could in fact even benefit from the Lisbon reforms. To this end, the paper offers a set of policy recommendations for the institutional architecture of the EEAS...|$|R

30|$|To {{enhance their}} {{attractiveness}} as investment recipients, the EU seeks to advance Central Asian states’ financial stability and economic reforms {{as well as}} their further integration in the world economic and financial systems (Kuzmina, 2014 : p. 7). Accordingly, in its policies toward Central Asia, the bloc, as the indicative programmes of its Development <b>Cooperation</b> <b>Instrument</b> suggest (European Commission, 2007, 2011, 2014), primarily concentrates on the furtherance of regional collaboration and good neighbourly relations, improvement of living standards and lessening of poverty as well as energy, environmental and water projects. Incidentally, the 2007 Strategy also mentions human rights and democratisation as dimensions of the EU’s activities, but they are coupled with good governance (Council of the EU, 2007 : pp. 7 – 9), to which the EU, as some researchers argue, tends to give priority. Meden (2012 : p. 59), for instance, points out that Brussels is shifting its focus from democracy promotion to fight against corruption, on paper, however, continuing to demand democratisation.

40|$|France, {{one of the}} {{founding}} members of the European Union, is a unitary state from the administrativeterritorial point of view, based on deep centralism. Having territorial collectivities with highly complex structure (communes, departments, regions, sui-generis collectivities and overseas collectivities), France committed itself to cooperation not only between its own administrative structures, but also to cross-border cooperation within the European Union. After showing reluctance to external actions underwent by territorial collectivities, France ended up with acknowledging this right of its territorial collectivities within the «decentralized cooperation», expressly brought under regulation by the Law of 6 February 1992. According to the law, {{there is no need for}} any ratification on behalf of the State to allow cooperation between territorial collectivities, within the boundaries of their competence. The Law of 1992 thus authorized the territorial collectivities to close agreements with other collectivities from abroad. Furthermore, the Law of 4 February 1995 allowed several treaties with the border states to be signed, thus creating the SAAR-LOR-LUX region (an European cross-border region that made way for cooperation between Germany, France and Luxembourg). The French legislation also allowed several European districts to be created, acting as local groups for cross-border cooperation, created on the initiative of territorial collectivities. The aim of our study is to identify the main relationship between territorial collectivities in France and EU and to analyze the <b>cooperation</b> <b>instruments</b> used by the French collectivities in order to foster the cross-border cooperation...|$|R

Situation in European Union (hereinafter EU) is specific. EU is not country or classic international organization. By the reason of its successful functioning, EU has need for tax cooperation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{from a legal}} perspective {{the modes}} in which EU agencies partake in the enlargement process. In so doing, first the main forms in which agencies become involved in EU enlargement are explored. Next, EU agencies’ forms {{of participation in the}} enlargement process are subjected to a legal assessment taking the principle of institutional balance and the delegation of powers within the EU as the main yardsticks. In this context, the legal nature of such forms of participation and related instruments are discussed, as are some of the relevant legal problems they might raise. The paper examines these issues both with regard to the wider category of EU agencies and by focusing on the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), an agency actively involved in the enlargement process, in order to provide a concrete illustration of how agencies’ involvement works in practice. It is argued that, apart from the formalised <b>cooperation</b> <b>instruments</b> that could result in legally binding agreements under international law, the forms in which EU agencies take part in the enlargement process do not create insurmountable legal and practical problems. As for the more controversial category of ‘binding agreements’ concluded by EU agencies, objections can be raised in view of the rather conventional reading by the CJEU of the balance of powers between the EU institutions, in particular with regard to the Union’s treaty-making. Arguments are advanced for an alternative route based on a dynamic interpretation of the institutional balance and of the delegation of powers within the EU...|$|R
40|$|Because mutual {{recognition}} is now {{enshrined in the}} Lisbon Treaty as a basic principle for judicial cooperation in criminal matters, a consistent interpretation and application becomes all the more important. Nevertheless, no legally binding definition of {{mutual recognition}} is provided and a quick scan of the relevant instruments cannot but lead {{to the conclusion that}} mutual recognition appears in as many shapes and sizes as there are instruments referring to it. There seems to be no common understanding of what mutual recognition is, can and cannot be and how consistency is to be guaranteed. Therefore this article critically reviews mutual recognition as a principle and assesses the inconsistencies in the application thereof. The analysis is based on two hypotheses that could clarify the divergent evolution of the principle. The first hypothesis to explain the divergent evolutions is linked to the action radius and the proposition that mutual recognition is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation only. The second hypothesis suggests that the reason for these divergent evolutions is the lack of a common understanding of what mutual recognition entails, what it means or should mean in practice. Based on a thorough analysis of the relevant policy documents, treaties and judicial <b>cooperation</b> <b>instruments</b> (including their preparatory documentation and transcripts from debates in various fora) it is recommended to no longer distinguish between police, customs and judicial cooperation and move ahead with the introduction of mutual recognition as a basic principle for international cooperation in criminal matters in its entirety. Furthermore, the suggestion is made to introduce a lex mitior principle as a new automatic correcting mechanism to temper the effect of mutual recognition {{from the perspective of the}} persons involved...|$|R
