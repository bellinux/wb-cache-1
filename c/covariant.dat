5|$|While {{developing}} general relativity, Einstein became {{confused about}} the gauge invariance in the theory. He formulated {{an argument that}} led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally <b>covariant</b> tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.|$|E
5|$|For his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{turned to}} a question that was to shape his lifetime research. He sought exact solutions of Einstein's equations: model universes consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions. These exact solutions {{play a key role}} when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully <b>covariant</b> theory – its laws are the same, independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a given situation. One direct consequence is that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ only in their coordinates. Ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing exact solutions invariantly, that is, in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice. In order to do so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known exact solutions.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of the <b>covariant</b> derivative does not use the metric in space. However, for each metric there is a unique torsion-free <b>covariant</b> derivative called the Levi-Civita connection such that the <b>covariant</b> derivative of the metric is zero.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} {{approach}} {{is probably the}} definition motivated by <b>covariant</b> derivatives. On the one hand, the ideas of Weyl were taken up by physicists {{in the form of}} gauge theory and gauge <b>covariant</b> derivatives. On the other hand, the notion of <b>covariant</b> differentiation was abstracted by Jean-Louis Koszul, who defined (linear or Koszul) connections on vector bundles. In this language, an affine connection is simply a <b>covariant</b> derivative or (linear) connection on the tangent bundle.|$|E

The main {{result is the}} construction of a minimal system of generators of the algebra of affine <b>covariants</b> of quadratic bivariate differential systems which is helpful in qualitative and numerical study. To this end, we establish a theorem (true for general systems of dimension n and degree m) which provides a procedure of construction of systems of generators for affine <b>covariants</b> from those of center-affine invariants. After applying this theorem to the case n=m= 2 we give the expansions of the obtained affine <b>covariants</b> in terms of center-affine <b>covariants.</b> All algorithms constitute the package SIB...|$|R

25|$|In {{the field}} of physics, the {{adjective}} <b>covariant</b> is often used informally as a synonym for invariant. For example, the Schrödinger equation does not keep its written form under the coordinate transformations of special relativity. Thus, a physicist might say that the Schrödinger equation is not <b>covariant.</b> In contrast, the Klein–Gordon equation and the Dirac equation do keep their written form under these coordinate transformations. Thus, a physicist might say that these equations are <b>covariant.</b>|$|E

25|$|A vector may be {{described}} as a list of numbers in terms of a basis, but as a geometrical object a vector retains its own identity regardless of how one chooses to describe it in a basis. This persistence of identity is reflected in the fact that when a vector is written in one basis, and then the basis is changed, the components of the vector transform according to a change of basis formula. Such a transformation law is known as a <b>covariant</b> transformation. The <b>covariant</b> derivative is required to transform, under a change in coordinates, {{in the same way as}} a basis does: the <b>covariant</b> derivative must change by a <b>covariant</b> transformation (hence the name).|$|E
25|$|This article {{presents}} {{an introduction to}} the <b>covariant</b> derivative of a vector field with respect to a vector field, both in a coordinate free language and using a local coordinate system and the traditional index notation.

25|$|Contravariant and <b>covariant</b> vectors are geometrically very {{different}} objects. The first {{can and should}} be thought of as arrows. A linear functional can be characterized by two objects: its kernel, which is a hyperplane passing through the origin, and its norm. Geometrically thus <b>covariant</b> vectors should viewed as a set of hyperplanes, with spacing depending on the norm (bigger = smaller spacing), with one of them (the kernel) passing through the origin. The mathematical term for a <b>covariant</b> vector is 1-covector or 1-form (though the latter is usually reserved for covector fields).|$|E
25|$|It {{was soon}} noted by other mathematicians, {{prominent}} among these being Hermann Weyl, Jan Arnoldus Schouten, and Élie Cartan, that a <b>covariant</b> derivative could be defined abstractly without {{the presence of}} a metric. The crucial feature was not a particular dependence on the metric, but that the Christoffel symbols satisfied a certain precise second order transformation law. This transformation law could serve {{as a starting point for}} defining the derivative in a <b>covariant</b> manner. Thus the theory of <b>covariant</b> differentiation forked off from the strictly Riemannian context to include a wider range of possible geometries.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} on the neighborhood of a point p in the <b>covariant</b> derivative {{can be used to}} define parallel transport of a vector.
