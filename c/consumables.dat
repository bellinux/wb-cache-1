5|$|The {{aviation}} industry {{had been studying}} this problem for some time. From the mid-1940s, there was much interest in using nuclear-powered aircraft in the bomber role. In a conventional jet engine, thrust is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out a nozzle. In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose <b>consumables</b> last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried {{a small amount of}} jet fuel for use during high-power portions of flight—take-off and high-speed dashes.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the corners}} of the maze are four larger, {{flashing}} <b>consumables</b> known as Power Pills that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. When a Power Pill is in effect the enemies turn blue and try to evade Pac-Man. When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the nest (center box) to respawn. The blue ghosts turn reddish during the last moments of a Power Pill’s effect, signaling that they are about to become dangerous again, and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one level to the next, becoming shorter as the game progresses. The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{assembly}} {{marked the}} beginning of the third generation of space station design, being the first to consist of more than one primary spacecraft (thus opening a new era in space architecture). First generation stations such as Salyut 1 and Skylab had monolithic designs, consisting of one module with no resupply capability; the second generation stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 comprised a monolithic station with two ports to allow <b>consumables</b> to be replenished by cargo spacecraft such as Progress. The capability of Mir to be expanded with add-on modules meant that each could be designed with a specific purpose in mind (for instance, the core module functioned largely as living quarters), thus eliminating the need to install all the station's equipment in one module.|$|E
5000|$|Thus {{in order}} that the {{economic}} system should keep working {{it is essential that}} capital goods should be produced in ever increasing quantity relatively to <b>consumable</b> goods. As soon as the ratio of capital goods to <b>consumable</b> goods slackens, costs exceed money distributed, i.e. the consumer is unable to purchase the <b>consumable</b> goods coming on the market." ...|$|R

40|$|A {{preference}} for greater variety when selecting <b>consumable</b> goods as bundles in simultaneous choice {{rather than as}} a sequential series of individual decisions is a consistent result in prior literature. However, digital goods (e. g., music) have a number of important differences from <b>consumable</b> goods (e. g., candy). We address two general research questions. First, we disentangle the role of selecting bundles from the role of simultaneity vs. sequential choice as factors in variety seeking with <b>consumable</b> goods. Second, we discuss the differences between digital and <b>consumable</b> goods and investigate whether variety seeking diminishes for choices of digital goods as hypothesized. Results both clarify the conditions for variety seeking for <b>consumable</b> goods and identify reductions in the behavior with digital goods...|$|R
5|$|While {{the weather}} in Florida {{continued}} to look grim for a landing Friday, managers on the ground advised the crew that they would proceed with deorbit preparations as planned, {{and see if the}} weather cleared up in the morning. NASA managers stated that for Friday, they would focus on a KSC landing for Friday, not activating any of the backup sites, but if the weather was not favorable for a Friday landing, Edwards Air Force Base could be activated on Saturday. Atlantis has enough <b>consumables</b> to stay in orbit until Monday.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an Apollo mission. It would have landed close to the planned Apollo landing site, and if the Apollo Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter was not designed to take off again after landing, so an LSRS or another Apollo mission would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original Apollo mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, <b>consumables,</b> and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored 2 is an action-adventure stealth {{game played}} from a first-person perspective. After playing as Empress Emily Kaldwin during the prologue, players {{may decide to}} play either as Emily or as Corvo Attano (the protagonist from the {{previous}} game). Side missions unlock alternate methods of assassination, non-lethal approaches and paths to navigate the main mission. Both characters wield swords, pistols, crossbows, a retractable blade, grenades and mines—all of which are upgradable. Upgrades may be purchased at black market shops found throughout the levels, and blueprints scattered across levels unlock new potential upgrades. Coin is required to buy these upgrades, which again may be found throughout a level or gained from other collectibles, like stealing paintings. Players can choose whether to play stealthily or not, and can finish the game without taking a life. Health elixirs and food <b>consumables</b> will restore health, while mana elixirs replenish mana.|$|E
50|$|The {{powers of}} magic items {{are divided into}} at-will, encounter, daily, healing surge and <b>consumable</b> powers. The first three classes {{function}} like their class power counterparts, being limited in usage by the character's level. Healing Surge powers function like daily powers; however, they can be recharged by expending a healing surge. <b>Consumable</b> powers are generally found on <b>consumable</b> items, a class which includes potions, elixirs, reagents, and whetstones.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA Large-scale {{emergency}} {{has a long}} duration, {{which needs}} huge fast <b>consumable</b> goods, and its supply quantities will gradually increase with the widening of its supply channels. Therefore, in the factual dispatch process of emergency, there are three kinds of relation between supply and demand of fast <b>consumable</b> goods. Firstly, demand exceeds supply. Secondly, supply equals demand. Finally, supply exceeds demand. This paper analyses the features of fast <b>consumable</b> goods in large-scale emergencies and establishes the dispatch model of fast <b>consumable</b> goods under three kinds of relation between supply and demand. They will provide theoretical guidance for large-scale emergencies and have very important practical significance in nowday society {{with more and more}} emergencies...|$|R

5|$|The Lunar Module (LM) was {{designed}} to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage {{was designed}} totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, {{each with its own}} engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay <b>consumables,</b> and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended Lunar Module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} with seating the second RSU set the spacewalkers {{back in the}} timeline by approximately two hours, but after Altman asked Massimino and Good how they felt, they replied they were doing well and felt fine to continue. Flight controllers on the ground evaluated the <b>consumables</b> for the two spacesuits, and decided that if Massimino recharged his suit's oxygen in the airlock, the pair could safely continue with the battery installation. After moving to the battery unit site, Good and Massimino removed {{one of the original}} battery modules from Bay 2 of the telescope, and replaced it with a new unit. The batteries provide power to the telescope when it passes into the Earth's shadow and its solar arrays are not exposed to the sun. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:45 UTC, for a time of seven hours, fifty-six minutes. It was the twentieth spacewalk to service Hubble, bringing the total time in EVA servicing the telescope to one hundred forty-four hours and twenty-six minutes.|$|E

40|$|During human {{exploration}} of the lunar surface, a suited crewmember needs effective and accurate information about <b>consumable</b> levels remaining in their life support system. The information must be presented {{in a manner that}} supports real-time <b>consumable</b> monitoring and route planning. Since <b>consumable</b> usage is closely tied to metabolic rate, the lunar suit must estimate metabolic rate from life support sensors, such as oxygen tank pressures, carbon dioxide partial pressure, and cooling water inlet and outlet temperatures. To provide adequate warnings that account for traverse time for a crewmember to return to a safe haven, accurate forecasts of <b>consumable</b> depletion rates are required. The forecasts must be presented to the crewmember in a straightforward, effective manner. In order to evaluate methods for displaying <b>consumable</b> forecasts, a desktop-based simulation of a lunar Extravehicular Activity (EVA) has been developed for the Constellation lunar suite s life-support system. The program was used to compare the effectiveness of several different data presentation methods...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWe develop a classification system for U. S. Navy <b>consumable</b> items {{to give the}} Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) a better position for advocacy regarding these assets. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) {{is responsible for the}} procurement, storage, and distribution of the Navy's <b>consumable</b> assets. Its inventory system is highly dynamic, and items may be requisitioned for long periods without undue delay followed by sudden, unexpected shortages that directly affect Navy combat readiness. We propose a new metric, customer time limit (CTL), which normalizes the requisition fulfillment time according to priority level and the physical location of the customer. Using this metric, we essentially classify inventory items as problematical with respect to two different criteria: whether the median CTL exceeds a nominal threshold, and whether CTL exhibits an increasing trend. To apply this classification, nonparametric statistical methods are used based on <b>consumable</b> requisition data for calendar years 2013 through 2015, resulting in three categories: NSNs at Risk, Bad Actors, or Bad Actors with Trend. Collectively, we find that NSNs at Risk and Bad Actors with Trend constitute approximately 1 % in both U. S. Navy <b>consumable</b> item population and annual <b>consumable</b> expenditure ($ 19 million out of $ 1. 9 billion purchased), and that Bad Actors comprise approximately 2 % of U. S. Navy <b>consumable</b> item population and 7 % of annual <b>consumable</b> expenditure ($ 140 million out of $ 1. 9 billion purchased). Lieutenant Commander, Supply Corps, United States Nav...|$|R

50|$|Another {{argument}} used by Aquinas {{was that}} of the Roman distinction between <b>consumable</b> goods and non-consumable goods.

Money as defined by Aquinas is a <b>consumable.</b> To put it out for profit betrays its purpose in natural law. This is the view that prevailed for the next three centuries following St. Thomas' death.|$|R

25|$|The CAIB {{determined}} that a rescue mission, though risky, might have been possible provided NASA management had taken action soon enough. Normally, a rescue mission is not possible, due to {{the time required to}} prepare a shuttle for launch, and the limited <b>consumables</b> (power, water, air) of an orbiting shuttle. However, Atlantis was well along in processing for a planned March 1 launch on STS-114, and Columbia carried an unusually large quantity of <b>consumables</b> due to an Extended Duration Orbiter package. The CAIB {{determined that}} this would have allowed Columbia to stay in orbit until flight day 30 (February 15). NASA investigators determined that Atlantis processing could have been expedited with no skipped safety checks for a February 10 launch. Hence, if nothing went wrong, there was a five-day overlap for a possible rescue. As mission control could deorbit an empty shuttle, but could not control the orbiter's reentry and landing, it would likely have sent Columbia into the Pacific Ocean; NASA later developed the Remote Control Orbiter system to permit mission control to land a shuttle.|$|E
