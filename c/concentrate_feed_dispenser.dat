Feed was collected and weighed at feeder settings of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 lb for the Econo- Drop and Accu-Drop <b>feed</b> <b>dispensers.</b> Samples were taken at 2, 4, 6, and 8 lb for the Ultra- Drop <b>feed</b> <b>dispenser</b> due to a smaller storage capacity for feed with this feed drop. There were five replications (five drops of each type) at each feed setting. There was a drop type by angle interaction (P< 0. 01) for the <b>feed</b> <b>dispenser</b> settings versus the actual pounds of feed dropped. At angles of 90 or 60 degrees, the Accu-Drop and the Ultra-Drop <b>feed</b> <b>dispensers</b> more (P< 0. 10) accurately dropped the correct amount of feed at the respective feeder settings. The amount of feed dropped at each dispenser setting was influenced more by angle to the feed line with the Econo-Drop than with the Accu-Drop or Ultra- Drop <b>feed</b> <b>dispensers.</b> This study demonstrated that the Accu-Drop and the Ultra-Drop <b>feed</b> <b>dispensers</b> are more accurate than the Econo-Drop <b>feed</b> <b>dispenser.</b> Therefore, producers should consider the additional feed cost over the lifetime of the feed drops and not rely solely on initial price...|$|R

Highly energetic diets ingested in a short time {{are one of the most}} relevant risk factors for the development of cribbing. The aim of this study was to verify whether feeding cribbing horses through a dispenser that delivers small quantities of concentrate when activated by the animal decreases cribbing behaviour, modifies feeding behaviour, or induces frustration. Ten horses (mean age 14 [*]y), balanced for sex, breed, and size (mean height 162 [*]cm), were divided into two groups of 5 horses each: Cribbing and Control. Animals were trained to use the dispenser and videorecorded continuously for 15 consecutive days from 1 [*]h prior to feeding to 2 [*]h after feeding in order to measure their behaviours. The <b>feed</b> <b>dispenser,</b> Quaryka®, induced an increase in time necessary to finish the ration in both groups of horses (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Short-chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFAs) and lactate are endproducts of rumen {{fermentation}} and important energy {{sources for the}} host ruminant. Because their rapid accumulation results in ruminal acidosis, enhancement of the absorption of SCFA and lactate across reticuloruminal wall is instrumental in increasing energy supply and preventing ruminal acidosis in cattle. This study investigated whether the reticuloruminal absorption of SCFAs and lactate was altered by different strategies of high <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding.</b> Eight rumen-cannulated, non-lactating Holstein cows were fed a forage-only diet (baseline) and then gradually adapted over 6 d to a 60 % concentrate level. Thereafter, this concentrate-rich diet was fed for 4 wk either continuously (Con; n = 8) or interruptedly (Int; n = 8). Absorption of SCFAs and lactate was determined in vivo from the experimental buffer introduced into the washed reticulorumen. The buffer contained acetate, propionate, butyrate and lactate at a concentration of 60, 30, 10 and 5 mmol/L, respectively and Cr-EDTA as a marker for correcting ruminal water fluxes. The reticuloruminal absorption after 35 and 65 min of buffer incubation was measured at the baseline, after 1 wk of 60 % <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding</b> in the interrupted model (Int- 1) and after 4 wk of <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding</b> in both feeding models (Int- 4 and Con- 4). Data showed that the absorption rates of individual and total SCFAs during the first 35 min of incubation of Con- 4 were highest (~ 1. 7 times compared to baseline), while Int- 1 and Int- 4 were similar to respective baseline. Lactate was not absorbed during forage-only baseline and 1 -wk <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding,</b> but after 4 -wk <b>feeding</b> of <b>concentrates</b> in both models. In conclusion, SCFAs absorption across the reticulorumen of non-lactating cattle was enhanced by the 4 -wk continuous <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding,</b> {{which seems to be}} more advantageous in terms of rumen acidosis prevention compared to the interrupted feeding model. The study provides evidence of lactate absorption across the reticulorumen of non-lactating cattle after both continuous and interrupted 4 -wk <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding...</b>|$|R

An empiric model was developed and validated for application of the methodology using a database composed of 62 means of treatments from 32 studies in which milk production was evaluated regarded to the levels of <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding.</b> Milk production (MP) showed quadratic behavior in response to concentrate intake (CI) : MP (kg/cow/day) = 10. 554 + 1. 5855 CI - 0. 0552 CI². Evaluation of the MP values observed over the predicted ones pointed the non-rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating that the model can be applied on the prediction of milk production, and consequently, on the optimal level of supplementation. However, evaluation of the partition of mean square error of prediction indicated the need for adjustments. The marginal production response (MPR) presented decreasing linear effect at CI level: MPR (kg milk/kg concentrate added) = 1. 5855 - 0. 1104 CI. The intake of concentrate that maximizes profit per animal (CIoptimum) is estimated by the following equation: CIoptimum (kg/cow/day, as fed basis) = (1. 5855 - (Px/Py)) / 0. 1104; in which Px and Py are, respectively, the prices of <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeds</b> ($/kg, as fed basis) and of the milk at farmgate ($/kg).

The key aim of the first system was to increase the levels of both self-sufficiency and sustainability of the system by establishing a balanced crop rotation and minimizing the imports of nutrients. The second system was based on increasing the output and flexibility of the system by establishing a forage-only cropping strategy and importing purchased <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeds</b> into the system. The results showed that increasing the level of self sufficiency led to an improved nutrient input/output balance and improved efficiency of milk production from forage but not an increased efficiency of total feed utilization.
