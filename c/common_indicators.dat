500|$|The 1998 {{eruption}} of Axial Seamount {{was preceded by}} several large earthquake swarms, <b>common</b> <b>indicators</b> of volcanic activity. The swarms correlated to magma movements in the volcano; bottom pressure recorders deployed on the volcano between 1987 and 1992 recorded five instances of deflation in the summit surface (caused by lava movement), ranging from [...] In 1991, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was granted access to the United States Navy's SOSUS system, a chain of submerged hydrophones in the North Pacific originally used by the Navy to detect Russian submarines during the Cold War. Since 1993, the NOAA has maintained a real-time monitoring system that alerts the organization whenever an event occurs. The hydrophones are able to detect even very small earthquakes (~ magnitude 1.8) by listening for the acoustic waves generated by T-waves. These waves can propagate over large distances with minimal loss in power, making them an ideal way to record otherwise unnoticeable submarine earthquakes; {{over the course of}} the eruption, only 3 earthquakes were strong enough to register on land-based systems. However, they cannot interpret earthquake depth or what caused them.|$|E

2500|$|Gender {{equality}} in the workplace {{is a major concern}} of many social activists, public officials, and academics, among others. Even in Developed Countries and wealthy democracies such as the United States there is concern of gender inequities in economic mobility for women. American President Barack Obama's Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was passed in response to concerns among Americans that women were receiving lower wages for equal work. Wages and wage equality with men are two <b>common</b> <b>indicators</b> of gender equality and opportunity within a formal market. Higher aggregate wages indicate that females are holding more productive, valued jobs which is considered indicative of social progress. Equal pay with men demonstrates a neutrality to gender within the workplace and may suggest functional fairness between female workers [...] and their male counterparts. Given these two indicators, wage statistics suggest that gender {{equality in}} terms of economic participation and the quality of formal economic opportunities are not high in many predominantly Muslim nations. In 2011, the World Economic Forum gathered information about the estimated earned income of women in 135 countries. Of these countries, Syria placed 134th in terms of earned annual income for women.|$|E

40|$|Image {{quality is}} {{important}} for taking full advantage of satellite data. As a <b>common</b> <b>indicator,</b> the National Imagery Interpretability Scale (NIIRS) is widely used for image quality assessment and provides a comprehensive representation of image quality {{from the perspective of}} interpretability. The ZY- 3 (Ziyuan- 3) satellite is the first civil high resolution mapping satellite in China, which was established in 2012. So far, there has been no reports on adopting NIIRS as the <b>common</b> <b>indicator</b> for the quality assessment of that satellite image data. This lack of a <b>common</b> quality <b>indicator</b> results in a gap between satellite data users around the world and those in China regarding the understanding of the quality and usability of ZY- 3 data. To overcome the gap, using the general image-quality equation (GIQE), this study evaluates the ZY- 3 sensor-corrected (SC) panchromatic nadir (NAD) data in terms of the NIIRS. In order to solve the uncertainty resulting from the exceeding of the ground sample distance (GSD) of ZY- 3 data (2. 1 m) in GIQE (less than 2. 03 m), eight images are used to establish the relationship between the manually obtained NIIRS and the GIQE predicted NIIRS. An adjusted GIQE is based on the relationship and verified by another five images. Our study demonstrates that the method of using adjusted GIQE for calculating NIIRS can be used for the quality assessment of ZY- 3 satellite images and reveals that the NIIRS value of ZY- 3 SC NAD data is about 2. 79...|$|R
