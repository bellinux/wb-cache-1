40|$|The multiaxis {{machining}} technology using a non-rotating cutting tool {{can produce a}} well-finished surface with little machining damage or roughness, {{and can be used}} to remove the remaining material in a concavity formed by the ball nosed end mill. This technique will extend the machining limits beyond the processing capability of the rotating tool. However, the single-blade non-rotating tool does not have a long life nor a flexibility for cutting various shapes. Therefore, a cylindrical non-rotating tool with long life and multiusability has been developed. This tool machines using a sharp blade having a wide curvature which gets shape by its inclination toward the feed direction. The cylindrical non-rotating tool can precisely machine a wide surface always with a sharp portion of the blade, because it can perform cutting at an arbitrary position on the blade due to spindle axis turn positioning. On the other hand, non-rotating machining with μm-scale cutting depth requires more precise <b>CL</b> <b>data</b> than is necessary with a rotating tool. If such <b>CL</b> <b>data</b> are generated by existing methods, a greatly increased quantity of data results, and more time is required to generate an offset surface. However, the copy simulation CAM method for multiaxis machining has been developed, which makes it possible to calculate highly precise <b>CL</b> <b>data</b> without offset processing. The imaginary stylus of this copy simulation CAM method traces on a surface of the defined shape while it self-determines the distance and course to the defined shape. Therefore, it is easy to determine the necessary tool axis vector for multiaxis machining, and the present method can generate highly precise <b>CL</b> <b>data</b> for non-rotating cutting. Results of machining experiments with this CAM method and the cylindrical non-rotating tool show that (1) it was able to get a good surface with approximate roughness of 2 μmRy by smoothing machining, (2) it was able to completely removed material remaining in the concavity formed by a ball-nosed end mill, (3) the non-rotating tool and copy simulation CAM method for multiaxis machining can significantly extend the machining limits...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} a new {{planning}} method for fixture conditions of workpiece in the continuous multi-axis controlled machining process. Generally, the motion of translational axes on machine tools with a trunnion table is significantly effected by the machine tool structure, tool posture in <b>CL</b> <b>data,</b> and position/posture of the workpiece on the trunnion table. In some cases, rapid changes in the tool posture at cutter locations away {{from the center of}} the rotational axis, significantly shifts the translational axes. However, in conventional CAM schemes, tool posture changes in <b>CL</b> <b>data</b> are determined without considering the machine tool structure and fixture conditions. And, a planning method for determining the fixture conditions, which prevent the rapid motion of translational axes and reduce the energy consumption for planned <b>CL</b> <b>data</b> by CAM systems, has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we therefore propose a new planning method for determining the workpiece position and posture on the trunnion table of a multi-axis-controlled machine tool. The proposed method consists of two different steps. In the first step, a large number of potential fixture conditions are assumed automatically. Second, the distribution of features about the movement on translation axes is estimated by coordinate transformation and collision detection. To deal with a large number of potential fixture conditions and significantly reduce the computation time for repetition of post processing, an ultra parallel computing technology known as GPGPU is introduced into the planning algorithms. The developed system can estimate the total energy consumption on the translational axes and the total machining time for each potential workpiece fixture. Therefore, the developed system can assist an NC operator to select optimum fixture conditions in a short time...|$|E

40|$|Several {{series of}} {{polyethylene}} (PE) blends were prepared where one component is a conventional PE {{and the second}} is a conventional linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) or a metallocene-catalyzed LLDPE. A two-step isothermal annealing (TSIA) procedure is developed enabling the satisfactorily resolution of endothermic peaks of blends of low-density polyethylene with LLDPE using standard thermoanalytical techniques. The TSIA procedure enables the quantification of components in an unknown, previously calibrated blend. The quantitative analysis of PE blends by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy is explored and achieved by the development of a linear relationship based on the ratio of two absorbances in an FT-IR spectrum. The method exhibits potential for routine analyses of PE blends that have been previously calibrated.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate uncertainties in water flux and age on the basis of data from environmental tracers, including meteoric Cl, 36 Cl, 3 H, d 2 H, and d 18 O in porous media. Representative profiles of environmental tracers from drainage and interdrainage areas at a site in the Chihuahuan Desert of Texas were evaluated. The chloride mass balance approach (CMB) was used to evaluate water fluxes and ages. The long residence times indicated by the <b>Cl</b> <b>data</b> in interdrainage areas (55, 000 to 105, 000 years to 25 m depth) were generally corroborated by residence times estimated from radioactive decay of 36 Cl (39, 000 6 13, 000 to 59, 000 6 14, 400 years).

The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the feasibility of extrapolating human drug clearance (CL) from a single animal species using simple allometry with a fi xed body-weight exponent. Methods: CL values from rat, monkey, dog and human for 109 compounds were obtained from the literature. A normalization procedure based on the concept of a characteristic CL value was fi rst introduced to homogenize and pool the <b>CL</b> <b>data</b> for a regression analysis. The al-lometric exponent from the regression analysis was then used as the exponent for CL extrapolation. The prediction per-formance of the proposed method was compared with methods that incorporate liver blood fl ow (LBF) or maximum life-span potential (MLP). Results: An allometric exponent of 0. 67 (95 % CI, 0. 64 to 0. 71) adequately described the pooled <b>CL</b> <b>data.</b> A fi xed value of 0. 67 as the body-weight scaling exponent and monkey CL provided the best estimate of human CL, followed by rat and dog.
