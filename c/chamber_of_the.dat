5|$|The debating <b>chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Parliament has seating {{arranged}} in a hemicycle, a design which is common across European legislatures, intended to encourage consensus and compromise. There are 131 seats in the debating <b>chamber.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> total 131 seats, 129 are occupied by the Parliament's elected MSPs and two are seats for the Scottish Law Officers—the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, who are not elected members of the Parliament but {{are members of the}} Scottish Government. As such, the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote.|$|E

5|$|Burial 6 was a cist located {{under the}} first <b>chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49).

The bones belonged to two children and two young adult females and fragments of ceramic offerings were also identified.|$|E
5|$|Despairing of any siege {{operation}} {{against the}} Temple's massive walls, Titus had the gates burnt down. At the ensuing council of war, {{when it was}} debated whether to destroy the entire Temple, Alexander voted with the majority who favored preservation. In the event, this made no difference; as the fighting raged on the following day, a Roman soldier hurled a burning brand into a <b>chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple itself. The Temple was consumed by the flames.|$|E

From its balcony he was able to minimally restore order, promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit body}} remains closed until shortly before spore discharge; {{dehiscence}} (fruit body opening) {{is caused by}} the pressure exerted by swollen paraphyses—sterile (i.e., non-reproductive) cells that are interspersed between the ascospores. Dehiscence is accompanied by the release of clouds of spores, resembling smoke. The spore puffing upon rupture is thought to be caused by the sudden change in relative humidity between the interior <b>chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruit body and the outside environment. Dehiscence is accompanied by a hissing sound, an auditory phenomenon known to occur in about fifteen other fungal species.|$|E
5|$|The party then {{undertakes}} {{a number}} of quests, which vary depending on which faction the PC sides with. As the quests are completed, more is revealed about the cursed mask {{and how to get}} rid of it. The party eventually learns that the Night Masks are led by vampires, and additional clues lead them to the vampires' catacombs. After defeating the vampire Latasha, the PC travels through a portal to reach the <b>chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Night Masks' leader, Orbakh. Orbakh gives the PC the choice to either become a vampire or keep the cursed mask.|$|E

During excavations in 1954–1957 at Hole Ground, just outside {{the entrance to the}} cave, the foundations of a 1st-century hut and Iron Age pottery were seen. These were covered by the foundations of Roman buildings, dating from the 1st to the late 4th century.|$|E
