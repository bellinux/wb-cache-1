25|$|The $100 bill {{comprises}} 77% of all US <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation,</b> although {{according to}} former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, {{more than two-thirds of}} all $100 notes are held outside the United States.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1950s, {{production}} of $2 bills began to decrease. The relative scarcity {{of the bills}} lead some to start saving any they found, with the inevitable result that the notes became rarer in circulation. Currently, the circulation of $2 bills accounts for around 1% of the U.S. <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{the last}} Ottoman garrisons were {{withdrawn}} in 1867, Serbia {{was faced with}} multiple <b>currencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b> Thus, prince Mihailo Obrenović ordered a national currency be minted.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{there are}} over four {{thousand}} privately issued <b>currencies</b> <b>in</b> more than 35 countries. These include commercial trade exchanges that use barter credits as units of exchange, private gold and silver exchanges, local paper money, computerized systems of credits and debits, and digital <b>currencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation,</b> such as digital gold currency.|$|R
5000|$|No special {{postage stamps}} were ever issued for Weihaiwei. Just {{as in the}} treaty ports, Hong Kong stamps were used. From 1917, these were overprinted with the word [...] "CHINA". Revenue stamps of Weihaiwei were issued from 1921. There were never any special coins or {{banknotes}} issued for <b>circulation</b> <b>in</b> Weihaiwei. The various <b>currencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>in</b> China {{at the time were}} used; the Hong Kong dollar was also used as well. The nickname British sailors gave to this port was [...] "Way High"; it was also referred to as Port Edward in English.|$|R
25|$|After {{the communists}} {{captured}} Beijing in January 1949, the Nationalists began {{to retreat to}} Taiwan. China's gold reserve was moved to Taiwan in February. The government then declared in the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion that dollars issued by the Bank of Taiwan would become the new <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{money supply}} {{of a country}} is usually held to be {{the total amount of}} <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> plus the total value of {{checking}} and savings deposits in the commercial banks in the country. In modern economies, relatively little of the money supply is in physical currency. For example, in December 2010 in the U.S., of the $8853.4 billion in broad money supply (M2), only $915.7 billion (about 10%) consisted of physical coins and paper money.|$|E
25|$|Higher-value {{notes are}} used within the banks – {{particularly}} the £1million and £100million notes used to maintain parity with Scottish and Northern Irish notes. Banknotes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish banks {{have to be}} backed pound for pound by Bank of England notes (other than a small amount representing the <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> in 1845), and special million pound notes are used for this purpose. Their design {{is based on the}} old Series A notes.|$|E
50|$|Coins in {{denominations}} of 1, 5, 10, 25, 100 and 250 cents {{from the}} previous <b>currency</b> are <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b>|$|R

50|$|QNB {{was founded}} on 6 June 1964 as the country's first domestically-owned {{commercial}} bank. It had 35 employees {{in its first year}} and was initially headquartered in a government-owned building in Qatar's capital city, Doha. The two <b>currencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> at the time were the Indian rupee and British pound. As Qatar's population continued increasing throughout the century, QNB started establishing branches {{in other parts of the}} country.|$|R
25|$|The {{currency}} of China was initially silver-backed, but the nationalist government {{seized control of}} private banks in the notorious banking coup of 1935 and replaced the currency with the Fabi, a fiat currency issued by the ROC. Particular effort {{was made by the}} ROC government to instill this currency as the monopoly {{currency of}} China, stamping out earlier Silver and gold-backed notes that had made up China's currency. Unfortunately, the ROC government used this privilege to issue currency en masse; a total of 1.4 billion Chinese yuan was issued in 1936, {{but by the end of}} the second Sino-Japanese war some 1.031 trillion in notes was issued. This trend worsened with the outbreak of the Chinese Civil war in 1946. By 1947, some 33.2 trillion of currency was issued as a result of massive budget deficits resulting from war (taxation revenue was just 0.25 billion, compared with 2500 billion in war expenses). By 1949, the total <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> was 120 billion times more than in 1936.|$|E
2500|$|Bryan had {{an innate}} talent in oratory. He gave speeches, {{organized}} meetings, and adopted resounding resolutions that eventually {{culminated in the}} founding of the American Bimetallic League, which then evolved into the National Bimetallic Union, and finally the National Silver Committee. [...] At the time many farmers' groups believed that by increasing the amount of <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation,</b> commodities would receive higher prices. They were opposed by banks and bond holders who feared the effects of inflation. The ultimate goal of the league was to garner support on a national level for the reinstatement of the coinage of silver.|$|E
2500|$|American {{currency}} {{has been}} circulating globally {{for most of}} the 20th century. Certainly in World War II, the amount of <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> was increased several fold. However, the modern era of huge printings of the United States one hundred-dollar bill started with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Production was quadrupled with the first ever trillion dollar printing of this bill. As of the end of 2008, U.S. <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> with the public amounted to $824 billion and 76% of the currency supply was in the form of $100 denomination banknotes, amounting to twenty $100 bills per U.S. citizen. Over the past decade there has been considerable controversy concerning the amount of U.S. currency circulating abroad. Porter and Judson have claimed that in the mid nineties between 53 and 67 percent of U.S. currency was overseas, whereas Feige’s estimates suggested a figure closer to 40 percent abroad. Most recently, Goldberg writing in a New York Federal Reserve publication asserted that “about 65 percent ($580 billion) of all banknotes are in circulation outside of the country. However, these assertions are contradicted by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Flow of Funds statistics which show {{that at the end of}} March 2009, only $313 billion (36.7 percent) of U.S. currency was held abroad. Feige calculates that since 1964, [...] "the cumulative seigniorage earnings accruing to the U.S. by virtue of the currency held by foreigners amounted to $167–$185 billion and over the past two decades seigniorage revenues from foreigners have averaged $6–$7 billion dollars per year".|$|E
50|$|After {{the last}} Ottoman garrisons were {{withdrawn}} in 1867, Serbia {{was faced with}} multiple <b>currencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b> Thus, prince Mihailo Obrenović ordered a national currency be minted. The first bronze coins were introduced in 1868, followed by silver in 1875 and gold in 1879. The first banknotes were issued in 1876. Between 1873 and 1894, the dinar was pegged at par to the French franc. The Kingdom of Serbia also joined the Latin Monetary Union.|$|R
50|$|With {{each member}} of the Eurozone comes a set of {{individual}} coin designs. Included in the individuality of the national obverse face of the euro coins, whose design is left to the member states, is the edge of the €2 coin. Each member was allowed to design a unique inscription that would appear on the €2 coin's edge. Some of these edge inscriptions are carried over from the coins of the yielded <b>currencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> prior to the introduction of the euro.|$|R
50|$|Malaysian at {{that time}} had two <b>currencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b> One was the old Malayan dollar {{and the other was}} the new Malaysian dollar. Both were trading at par and valued at 8.57 dollar per pound. The pegging of the local {{currency}} to the pound was part of Malaysia's membership in the Sterling area. The new Malaysian dollar was introduced on June 12, 1967 as the currency union between Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei came to an end. Singapore was expelled out of Malaysia on August 8, 1965.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the breakup of the supply chain in the former Soviet enterprises, goods started to be bought and sold in the market, often {{requiring}} cash settlement. The Belarusian unit of the USSR State Bank had neither the capacity nor the licence to print Soviet banknotes, so the government decided to introduce its own national currency to ease the cash situation. The German word Taler (...) , divided into 100 hrosh (...) was suggested as the name for a Belarusian currency; but the Communist majority in the Supreme Soviet of Belarus rejected the proposal and stuck to the word ruble that was usual for Belarus from the times of the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire. In the medieval Grand Duchy of Lithuania of which Belarus was a major part, the word ruble has also been used as a name for a <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> (see Lithuanian long currency).|$|E
2500|$|With a {{reported}} {{one third of}} the <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> being counterfeit at the time, the Secret Service was created on July 5, 1865 in Washington, D.C., to suppress counterfeit currency. Chief William P. Wood was sworn in by Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch. It was commissioned in Washington, D.C. as the [...] "Secret Service Division" [...] of the Department of the Treasury with the mission of suppressing counterfeiting. The legislation creating the agency was on Abraham Lincoln's desk the night he was assassinated. At the time, the only other federal law enforcement agencies were the United States Park Police, the U.S. Post Office Department's Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations (now known as the United States Postal Inspection Service), and the U.S. Marshals Service. The Marshals did not have the manpower to investigate all crime under federal jurisdiction, so the Secret Service began to investigate everything from murder to bank robbery to illegal gambling. After the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, Congress informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection. In 1902, William Craig became the first Secret Service agent to die while serving, in a road accident while riding in the presidential carriage.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} many {{attempts}} to produce effective outcomes, the dramatic high rise in suicide, corruption, national security, high unemployment, {{and without the}} sustainable economic policies along with compilation of other factors, the country's economy re-entered in the [...] "era of stagflation" [...] (a virtual period that country had seen in 1990s earlier). The Pakistan economy slowed down dramatically to ~4.09% as compared to 8.96%—9.0% presided under his predecessor, Shaukat Aziz in 2004–08; while the yearly growth rate has come down from a long-term average of 5.0% to ~2.0%, though it did not reached to negative level. Calculation performed by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, it {{pointed out that the}} [...] "nation's <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> as a percentage of total deposits is 31%, which is very high as compared to India", where 40.0% of the population fell under the line of poverty, with 16.0% rise in the inflation during his four years of presiding over the country. The new strict and tight monetary policy could not tame the soaring inflation, it did stagnate the economic growth. One economist maintained that stagflation took place when the tight monetary policy did not encourage the strong private sector to play a key part in growth. Analyzing the stagflation problem, the PIDE observed that a major cause of continuous era of stagflation in Pakistan was lack of co-ordination between fiscal and monetary authorities.|$|E
25|$|Currency and {{exchange}} were {{important elements of}} trade in the ancient world, enabling people {{to buy and sell}} items like food, pottery and raw materials. If a Greek coin held more gold than an Egyptian coin due to its size or content, then a merchant could barter fewer Greek gold coins for more Egyptian ones, or for more material goods. This is why, {{at some point in their}} history, most world <b>currencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> today had a value fixed to a specific quantity of a recognized standard like silver and gold.|$|R
50|$|After the {{proclamation}} of the Republic of Latvia in 1918, a large {{variety of different}} <b>currencies</b> were <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> - ostrubles, ostmarks, German Papiermark, the so-called Tsar rubles, kopecks, the so-called Money of Duma and kerenkas, as well as promissory notes of several town municipalities.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the roles}} of the Bank of Albania is that it acts as manager of the county’s {{currency}} by balancing the <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> and credit within the economy. This role is important because allowing too much currency into circulation will end up leading to inflation and allowing less <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> will prevent the economy to grow. As acting currency manager, the Bank of Albania pursues to reach equilibrium between two extremes, which is to promote economic growth by maintaining price stability.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the absence}} of a {{national}} currency, the bank faced difficulties in fulfilling financial and monetary-credit policy in the first 18 months, and foreign <b>currencies</b> were used <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of inflationary trends, {{which has been}} a macroeconomic concern in Nigeria over the last decade, is considered to be very hazardous to the aggregate economic activity of any country. In order to determine the practical effect of higher currency note introduction on the Nigerian economy, an empirical investigation on the casualty between inflation, currency denomination, fiscal deficit and broad money supply was carried out using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model (Forecast Variance and Impulse Response) model. Time series data of 1980 to 2014 were employed and the results confirm {{that in the long run}} there is a relationship between inflation, currency denomination, fiscal deficit and broad money supply. The Cholesky ordering (currency denomination, inflation, fiscal deficit and broad money supply) is used in the VAR estimates, which indicates that the shocks <b>in</b> <b>currency</b> denomination affect the other variables and result to inflation. It is therefore recommended that the Nigerian government should implement inflation management policies and also ensure that lower <b>currency</b> notes <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> are more than higher <b>currency</b> notes <b>in</b> <b>circulation...</b>|$|R
50|$|However, the {{tax policy}} {{director}} of the Chartered Institute of Taxation expressed skepticism over {{the accuracy of the}} figures. If true, those sums would amount to approximately 5 to 8 times the total amount of <b>currency</b> presently <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>in</b> the world. Daniel J. Mitchell of the Cato Institute says that the report also assumes, when considering notional lost tax revenue, that 100% money deposited offshore is evading payment of tax.|$|R
50|$|The Act also {{encouraged}} {{the government to}} develop a sound monetary policy, to minimize inflation, and to push toward full employment by managing the amount and liquidity of <b>currency</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b>|$|E

2500|$|No <b>currency</b> {{currently}} <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> {{is named}} thaler. Several, however, acknowledge its legacy with their names: twenty-three currencies named [...] "dollar", used in countries including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the United States of America, {{as well as}} tolar (Slovene for thaler), used in Slovenia {{until the end of}} 2006. Between 1992 and 1995, Belarus planned to introduce Belarusian taler as a national currency.|$|R
5000|$|In 1816, coins <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> {{from the}} {{previous}} <b>currency</b> remained <b>in</b> <b>circulation,</b> with only 1 skilling coins being minted.
