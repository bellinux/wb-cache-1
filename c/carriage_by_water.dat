For example, the European goods, or suppose English goods in particular, {{with which they were}} loaden, went first from England to Cadiz, from Cadiz by the galleons to Porto Bello, from Porto Bello, to Panama, from Panama to Acapulco; in all which places the merchants had their several commissions and other profits upon the sale; besides the extravagant charges of so many several ways of <b>carriage,</b> some <b>by</b> <b>water,</b> some <b>by</b> land, and besides the king's customs in all those places; and that, after all this, they were brought by sea from Acapulco to the Philippine Islands, which was a prodigious voyage, and were then generally sold in the Philippine Islands at three hundred per cent. advance.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to offer an {{overview}} of current legislative situation in international carriage of goods. Special attention is dedicated to carrier's liability in international transport of goods. In a global world, {{it is vital to}} keep balance between the rights and duties of both the carrier and the shipper. Otherwise, international trade would become next to impossible to perform. Therefore, dealing with the topic of carrier's liability might clarify certain aspects and possibly bring benefits to both contracting parties. This thesis consists of nine chapters. The three initial chapters present private international law and its methods. Next, the question of liability is briefly introduced. Finally, basic terms such as the carrier and the shipper are defined. In one of its subdivisions, the third chapter also mentions national regulations relevant to the topic discussed. On the contrary, the thesis as a whole addresses rules contained in international treaties. The following chapters are targeted on individual modes of transport, in order of appearance: <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> rail, <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> road, <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> air, <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> sea, <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> inland waterways. However, not all of them are granted equal attention. The chapters covering <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> road and by sea are essential. The reason for [...] ...|$|R
