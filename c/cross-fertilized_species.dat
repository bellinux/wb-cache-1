40|$|Recycling of F 1 maize hybrid Lorena was {{conducted}} in two breeding cycles. The breeding scheme was based on inbred line method for improving yielding performance of lines per se. The line development {{was based on a}} pedigree selection scheme with selfing and evaluation under favourable field conditions. Early evaluation included honeycomb designs and wide spacing. After two cycles of recycling, heterosis and heterobeltiosis level was found very low or negative and inbred line yielding performance per se was high reaching the original hybrid`s yield. This indicated excessive exploitation of favourable additive gene action, which leads to homozygote advantage. Final crosses were similar or sometimes better than original hybrid. Several criteria were used for the breeding procedure. The choice of starting material was based on inbreeding depression, general combining ability and specific combining ability estimation conducted previously. The breeding procedure was based on additive gene action. Breeding scheme was based on a new approach of the inbred line method on <b>cross-fertilized</b> <b>species</b> and the final target was focused on maximizing yielding performance and not heterosis. Evaluation during early stages was based in favourable experimental conditions, incorporating honeycomb field designs...|$|E
40|$|Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a promising cellulosic biofuel crop in the United States. Construction of a genetic linkage map is fundamental for switchgrass molecular breeding and the elucidation of its genetic mechanisms for economically important traits. In this study, a novel population consisting of 139 selfed progeny of a northern lowland genotype, NL 94 LYE 16 X 13, was used to construct a linkage map. A total of 2493 simple sequence repeat markers were screened for polymorphism. Of 506 polymorphic loci, 80. 8 % showed a goodness-of-fit of 1 : 2 : 1 segregation ratio. Among 469 linked loci on the framework map, 241 coupling vs. 228 repulsion phase linkages were detected that conformed to a 1 : 1 ratio, confirming disomic inheritance. A total of 499 loci were mapped to 18 linkage groups (LG), of which the cumulative length was 2085. 2 cM, with an average marker interval of 4. 2 cM. Nine homeologous LG pairs were identified based on multi-allele markers and comparative genomic analysis. Two clusters of segregation-distorted loci were identified on LG 5 b and 9 b, respectively. Comparative analysis indicated a one-to-one relationship between nine switchgrass homeologous groups and nine foxtail millet (Setaria italica) chromosomes, suggesting strong homology between the two species. The linkage map derived from selfing a heterozygous parent, instead of two separate maps usually constructed for a <b>cross-fertilized</b> <b>species,</b> provides a new genetic framework to facilitate genomics research, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, and marker-assisted breeding...|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} the varietal type that a farmer will use {{is the result of}} {{considering}} the balance between seed cost and the profit possible from using one type rather than another. This paper uses the criteria of quantitative genetics to predict the relative advantages of a population, lines extracted from this population, hybrids (3 -way-, double-, and single-crosses) between such lines and their F 2 s. Inbreeding depression, rate of multiplication, genetic variability, the ratio of seed price to grain value constitute the main parameters of comparison. There is no single answer to the question and even the situation for one species may evolve over time and accompanying progress in selection. The F 1 hybrids are the best type of variety in a large range of situations with high inbreeding depression (> 40 %) and sufficient genotypic variance. In such a situation the expected superiority of single-cross hybrids over population is 20 to 35 %. For <b>cross-fertilized</b> <b>species,</b> populations are to be considered only for low genetic coefficients of variation for hybrids and a relatively high seed cost. F 2 s and lines are obviously justified only with low inbreeding depression (40 %) et une variance génotypique suffisante. Dans une telle situation, la supériorité attendue des hybrides par rapport à la population est de 20 à 35 %. Pour les espèces allogames les populations ne sont jusitifées que si la variation génétique est faible et si le coût des semences hybrides est relativement très élevé. Les F 2 et les lignées ne sont évidemment justifiées que si la dépression est faible (< 20 %) et si la variation entre hybrides est faible...|$|E
40|$|Self-fertilizing species often harbor less genetic {{variation}} than <b>cross-fertilizing</b> <b>species,</b> {{and at least}} four different models have been proposed to explain this trend. To investigate further the relationship between mating system and {{genetic variation}}, levels of DNA sequence polymorphism were compared among three closely related species in the genus Caenorhabditis: two self-fertilizing species, Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae, and one <b>cross-fertilizing</b> <b>species,</b> C. remanei. As expected, estimates of silent site nucleotide diversity were lower in the two self-fertilizing species. For the mitochondrial genome, diversity in the selfing species averaged 42 % of diversity in C. remanei. Interestingly, the reduction in genetic variation was much greater for the nuclear than for the mitochondrial genome. For two nuclear genes, diversity in the selfing species averaged 6 and 13 % of diversity in C. remanei. We argue that either population bottlenecks or the repeated action of natural selection, coupled {{with high levels of}} selfing, are likely to explain the observed reductions in species-wide genetic diversity...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 5 million years of evolution separate Arabidopsis thaliana from its close relative Arabidopsis lyrata. The two taxa differ by many characteristics, and together they exemplify the differentiation of angiosperms into self-fertilizing and <b>cross-fertilizing</b> <b>species</b> as well as annual and perennial species. Despite their disparate life histories, the two species can be crossed to produce viable and vigorous hybrids exhibiting heterotic effects. Although pollen sterile, the hybrids produce viable ovules and were used as female parent in backcrosses to both parental species. The resulting backcross plants exhibited transgressive variation {{for a number of}} interesting developmental and growth traits as well as negative nuclear/cytoplasmic interactions. Moreover, the genesis of a fertile amphidiploid neospecies, apparently by spontaneous somatic doubling in an interspecific hybrid, was observed in the laboratory. The mechanisms responsible for the generation of amphiploids and the subsequent evolution of amphiploid genomes can now be studied through direct observation using the large arsenal of molecular tools available for Arabidopsis...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that clonality provides reproductive assurance in cross- fertilizing species subject to pollen limitation, relieving one of the main selective pressures favoring the evolution of self-fertilization. According to this hypothesis, <b>cross-fertilizing</b> <b>species</b> subject to pollen limitation should often be clonal. Here, we investigated the association between clonality and a genetic mechanism enforcing outcrossing, self-incompatibility, in Solanum (Solanaceae). • We collected self-incompatibility and clonality information on 87 species, and looked for an association between these two traits. To account for the contribution of shared evolutionary history to this association, we incorporated phylogenetic information from chloroplast (NADH dehydrogenase subunit F) sequence data. • We found that self-incompatibility is strongly associated with clonal reproduction: all self-incompatible species reproduce clonally, while the absence of clonality is widespread among self-compatible taxa. The observed correlation persists after taking into account shared phylogenetic history, assumptions about the evolutionary history of self-incompatibility, uncertainty associated with phylogeny estimation, and associations with life history (annual/perennial). • Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that clonality provides reproductive assurance, and suggest that the consequences of clonal growth in the evolution of plant reproductive strategies may be more significant than previously tho...|$|R
40|$|Awareness of {{the need}} for {{biodiversity}} conservation is now universally accepted, but most often recent conservation activities have focused on wild species. Crop species and the diversity between and within them has significant socioeconomic as well as heritage value. The bulk of genetic diversity in domesticated species is located in traditional varieties maintained by traditional farming systems. These traditional varieties, commonly referred to as landraces, are severely threatened by genetic extinction primarily due to their replacement by modern genetically uniform varieties. The conservation of landrace diversity has been hindered in part by the lack of an accepted definition to define the entity universally recognized as landraces. Without a definition {{it would be impossible to}} prepare an inventory and without an inventory changes in landrace constituency could not be recognized over time. Therefore, based on a literature review, workshop discussion and interviews with key informants, common characteristics of landraces were identified, such as: historical origin, high genetic diversity, local genetic adaptation, recognizable identity, lack of formal genetic improvement, and whether associated with traditional farming systems. However, although these characteristics are commonly present they are not always all present for any individual landrace; several crop-specific exceptions were noted relating to crop propagation method (sexual or asexual), breeding system (self-fertilized or <b>cross-fertilized</b> <b>species),</b> length of formal crop improvement, seed management (selection or random propagation) and use. This paper discusses the characteristics that generally constitute a landrace, reviews the exceptions to these characteristics and provides a working definition of a landrace. The working definition proposed is as follows: `a landrace is a dynamic population(s) of a cultivated plant that has historical origin, distinct identity and lacks formal crop improvement, as well as often being genetically diverse, locally adapted and associated with traditional farming systems...|$|E
40|$|Sperm {{size and}} quality are key factors for {{fertilization}} success. There is increasing empirical {{evidence demonstrating that}} sperm form and function are influenced by selective pressures. Theoretical models predict that sperm competition could favour the evolution of longer sperm. In hermaphrodites, self-fertilizing species {{are expected to have}} shorter sperm than <b>cross-fertilizing</b> <b>species,</b> which use sperm stored from several mating partners for the fertilization of their eggs and thus are exposed to intense sperm competition. We tested this hypothesis by comparing original data on sperm length in 57 species of simultaneously hermaphroditic stylommatophoran gastropods from Europe and South America with respect to the species' breeding system. We used 28 S rRNA nuclear and COI mitochondrial sequence data to construct a molecular phylogeny. Phylogenetic generalized linear models were applied to examine the potential influence of morphological and life-history characters.; The best-fit model revealed that the breeding system and age at sexual maturity influence sperm length in gastropods. In general, species with predominant cross-fertilization had longer sperm than species with predominant self-fertilization or a mixed breeding system. Across species with shells (snails), sperm length also increased with shell size.; Our study provides evidence that sperm length in stylommatophoran gastropods is influenced by the risk of sperm competition, as well as by age at sexual maturity and shell size. This finding extends present knowledge of sperm evolution to a group of so far poorly studied simultaneous hermaphrodites...|$|R
40|$|RFLP was {{investigated}} at 52 single-copy gene loci among six species of Aegilops, including both <b>cross-fertilizing</b> and self-fertilizing <b>species.</b> Average gene diversity (H) {{was found to}} correlate {{with the level of}} outcrossing. No relationship was found between H and the phylogenetic status of a species. In all six species, the level of RFLP at a locus was a function of the position of the locus on the chromosome and the recombination rate in the neighborhood of the locus. Loci in the proximal chromosome regions, which show greatly reduced recombination rates relative to the distal regions, were significantly less variable than loci in the distal chromosome regions in all six species. Variation in recombination rates was also reflected in the haplotype divergence between closely related species; loci in the chromosome regions with low recombination rates were found to be diverged less than those in the chromosome regions with high recombination rates. This relationship was not found among the more distantly related species...|$|R

We have tested the ability of camelina to cross with arabidopsis and C. bursa-pastoris, as well as with the more distantly related Cardamine hirsuta, tribe cardamineae. No seeds were produced in crosses with arabidopsis, and a few seeds were obtained in crosses with C. hirsuta, but the embryos aborted at an early stage of development. A few seeds were also obtained in crosses with C. bursa-pastoris, which germinated to produce plants of a phenotype intermediate to that of the parents, but the hybrids were both male and female sterile.
