The initial seepage {{field analysis}} is prerequisite and important {{content for the}} water-tight underground cavern design. Although the field water pressure test can provide a more accurate isotropic permeability coefficient, which {{does not reflect the}} anisotropy permeability of jointed rock mass. Based on joins network simulation technique, a new method for calculating the anisotropy permeability is proposed. Different sizes are generated with the programming language FISH embedded within 3 DEC. The values of joint geometric characters and number of random joints in each group are decided through the derivable formulas. Principal value and characteristic vector of permeability tensor are easily calculated with Matlab software. Considering the space orthotropic permeability coefficient, the initial seepage inversion is completed with the fl_anisotropic model,the Fl_anisotropic model parameters are obtained from principal value and characteristic vector of permeability tensor.

In this paper, the following steps are suggested to handle these risks within hydropower–BOT projects: § In the case of hydropower, expectations, design and detailed requirements are stipulated by the employer (hydropower projects normally are no isolated greenfield projects); § Installation of a supplementary module for sub-surface works within EPC/Turnkey (because EPC contracts would not be suitable otherwise); § Monetary precondition as a ceiling for the construction cost of the sub-surface work for the contracto...|$|R

A 58 m bridge was built over the cavern, accounting for nearly one-quarter {{of the length of}} the tunnel. The surrounding rock was stabilized using geotechnical anchors to ensure safety before the bridge construction started. The deck of the bridge consists of reinforced concrete grillage supported by a pair of abutments and longitudinal reinforced concrete girders. Since there is an intermittent watercourse through the cavern, the tunnel tube was sealed to protect the <b>cavern</b> and <b>water</b> flowing through it.

50|$|Early Christian sources, such as Eusebius in his Onomasticon and Jerome, place Jesse's tomb, {{together}} with David's, in Bethlehem, which the Tanakh identifies as his place of origin. There {{is no evidence}} of its use by Christians in the medieval period. Rabbi Jacob, the Messenger of Yechiel of Paris, around 1238-1244, stated that either Jesse or Joab was buried in a cave on this Hebron hillsite. The Italian Jewish traveler Meshulam de Volterra stated that the tomb of Jesse he visited was located 10 miles from Hebron. In 1522-3 Rabbi Moses ben Mordecai Bassola visited the site, mentioning only Jesse’s tomb in a burial cave, putatively, in local folklore, connected by tunnel to the Cave of the Patriarchs. Francesco Quaresmi in the early 17th century, described its remains as the chancel of the earlier church, and observed that Turks and Orientals generally held this structure, to be the tomb of Isai (Jesse),the legendary father of David in biblical lore. Within a small mosque, visitors were shown the qabr yissā and qabr ruth, respectively the tombs of Jesse and Ruth. These identifications are, according to Moshe Sharon, rather late since they are not mentioned by the Arab medieval writer Mujir al-Din.

40|$|Abstract:An {{artificial}} water curtain system {{is composed of}} a network of underground galleries and horizontal boreholes drilled from these galleries. Pre-grouting measures are introduced to keep the bedrock saturated all the time. This system is deployed over an artificial or natural underground cavern used for the storage of gas (or some other fluids) to prevent the gas from escaping through leakage paths in the rock mass. An experimental physical modeling system has been constructed to evaluate the performance of {{artificial water}} curtain systems under various conditions. These conditions include different spacings of caverns and cavern radii located below the natural groundwater level. The principles of the experiment, devices, design of the physical model, calculation of gas leakage, and evaluation of the critical gas pressure are presented in this paper. Experimental result shows that gas leakage is strongly affected by the spacing of water curtain boreholes, the critical gas pressure, and the number and proximity of storage caverns. The hydraulic connection between boreholes is observed to vary with depth or location, which suggests that the distribution of water-conducting joint sets along the boreholes is also variable. When designing the drainage system for a cavern, drainage holes should be orientated to maximize the frequency at which they encounter major joint sets and permeable intervals studying {{in order to maintain the}} seal on the <b>cavern</b> through <b>water</b> pressure. Our experimental results provide a significant contribution to the theoretical controls on water curtains, and they can be used to guide the design and construction of practical storage caverns...|$|R
