40|$|In recent years, {{research}} into the engineering properties of highly organic materials have been undertaken to determine their engineering properties when used as road embankment fill materials. A prime contributor of organic wastes in municipal landfills is spent <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> from cafes and domestic households. As part of this research, an extensive suite of engineering and environmental tests were undertaken on spent <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> obtained from several popular cafes in Melbourne, Australia to evaluate their properties and potential use as a non-structural fill material in road embankments. The suite of engineering tests included, particle size distribution, Atterberg limits, particle density, standard compaction tests, static triaxial tests, oedometer consolidation, pH and organic content tests. In addition, a suite of chemical tests comprising leaching and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon tests were undertaken on the <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds.</b> From an environmental perspective, <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> were found to pose no environmental and leaching issue for use as an embankment fill material. From an engineering material perspective, the high organic content, low maximum dry densities and high optimum moisture content restricts the usage of this material to non-structural fill applications where the material {{will not have to}} sustain high traffic loadings. The usage of spent <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> as non-structural fill material in embankments was found to be a viable end-of-life option to divert <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> from landfills and furthermore to maximize the naturally high organic content present in the <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> for vegetation purposes...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of pre-measured self-contained <b>ground</b> <b>coffee</b> filter rings, fresh <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> were measured out in scoopsful and placed into the metal percolator basket. This process enabled small amounts of <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> to leak into the fresh coffee. Additionally, the process left wet grounds in the percolator basket. The benefit of the pre-packed coffee filter rings was two-fold: First, because the amount of coffee contained in the rings was pre-measured, it negated the need to measure each scoop and then place it in the metal percolator basket. Second, the filter paper was strong enough to hold all the <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> within the sealed paper. After use, the coffee filter ring could be easily removed from the basket and discarded.

50|$|<b>Coffee</b> <b>ground</b> vomitus {{refers to}} a {{particular}} appearance of vomit. Within organic heme molecules of red blood cells is the element iron, and when this iron has been exposed {{for some time to}} gastric acid, it becomes oxidized. This reaction causes the vomitus to look like ground coffee. Coffee-ground vomitus is a classic sign of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. A peptic ulcer, for example, may bleed into the stomach and produce coffee-ground vomitus. There are many causes that can result in this reaction, with use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) being particularly common. These drugs can interfere with the stomach's natural defenses against the strongly acidic environment, causing damage to the mucosa that can result in bleeding. Therefore, it is recommended that these class of drugs should be taken with food or on a full stomach. Certain types of illnesses, however, can cause this type of vomiting, and in these cases medical attention is required immediately.|$|E
40|$|Spent {{coffee grounds}} {{that are left}} behind during the coffee brewing process consist of {{valuable}} tannin compounds which makes them ideal material as a renewable tannin resource. For this reason, the concept of cleaner production had been applied in practice and a tannin extraction process with spent coffee grounds as raw material was investigated in the present study. Among the extraction key factors, namely sodium hydroxide concentration, extraction temperature, liquid to solid ratio, and extraction time, the former three factors had exerted a considerable effect on spent <b>coffee</b> <b>ground</b> tannin extraction yield and its reactivity. However, extraction time had only marginal effects which could be simply neglected in the tannin extraction process. These observations imply that spent coffee grounds can be reused as a renewable tannin resource by properly selecting the extraction parameters {{in order to produce}} the spent <b>coffee</b> <b>ground</b> tannin with desirable extraction yield and reactivity. By taking both the spent <b>coffee</b> <b>ground</b> tannin extraction yield and reactivity into consideration, the optimum extraction conditions are; 5 % sodium hydroxide concentration, 100 °C extraction temperature, 30 min extraction time, and 8. 23 liquid to solid ratio, so that tannin with a high extraction yield (21. 02 %) and high reactivity (29. 69 %) could be recovered. The present study provides an understanding on the impact of the extraction parameters on isolated spent <b>coffee</b> <b>ground</b> tannin as well as to fill up academic deficiencies in spent coffee grounds, which, in turn, could serve as a reliable guideline {{for the development of a}} full-scale, sustainable spent <b>coffee</b> <b>ground</b> tannin extraction process in coffee industries...|$|E
