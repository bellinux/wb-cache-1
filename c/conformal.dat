5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} have noticed that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional <b>conformal</b> field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the <b>conformal</b> field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a <b>conformal</b> field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{may also}} be interpreted as the <b>conformal</b> image of a spherical triangle with 120° angles. This spherical triangle {{is one of the}} Schwarz triangles (with parameters 3/2, 3/2, 3/2), triangles bounded by great-circle arcs on the surface of a sphere that can tile the sphere by reflection.|$|E
5|$|The quasi-isometry {{properties}} of the history graph can be studied using subdivision rules. For instance, the history graph is quasi-isometric to hyperbolic space exactly when the subdivision rule is <b>conformal,</b> {{as described in the}} combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem.|$|E
5|$|With Lorentz symmetry, {{additional}} structures {{come into}} play. They {{are defined by}} the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there {{is a set of}} events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image). These sets are observer-independent. In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space–time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a <b>conformal</b> structure or <b>conformal</b> geometry.|$|E
5|$|By {{studying}} {{the relationship between}} Calabi–Yau manifolds and certain <b>conformal</b> field theories called Gepner models, Brian Greene and Ronen Plesser found nontrivial examples of the mirror relationship. Further evidence for this relationship came {{from the work of}} Philip Candelas, Monika Lynker, and Rolf Schimmrigk, who surveyed a large number of Calabi–Yau manifolds by computer and found that they came in mirror pairs.|$|E
5|$|F-16E/F: The F-16E (single seat) and F-16F (two seat) are newer F-16 variants. The Block 60 {{version is}} based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52 and has been {{developed}} especially for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It features improved AN/APG-80 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, avionics, <b>conformal</b> fuel tanks (CFTs), and the more powerful General Electric F110-GE-132 engine.|$|E
25|$|Within a given <b>conformal</b> class, {{one can use}} <b>conformal</b> {{symmetry}} to find {{a representative}} metric with convenient properties. In particular, {{there is always a}} complete metric with constant curvature in any given <b>conformal</b> class.|$|E
25|$|The <b>conformal</b> latitude, , {{gives an}} angle-preserving (<b>conformal)</b> {{transformation}} to the sphere.|$|E
25|$|PCBs {{intended}} for extreme environments {{often have a}} <b>conformal</b> coating, which is applied by dipping or spraying after the components have been soldered. The coat prevents corrosion and leakage currents or shorting due to condensation. The earliest <b>conformal</b> coats were wax; modern <b>conformal</b> coats are usually dips of dilute solutions of silicone rubber, polyurethane, acrylic, or epoxy. Another technique for applying a <b>conformal</b> coating is for plastic to be sputtered onto the PCB in a vacuum chamber. The chief disadvantage of <b>conformal</b> coatings is that servicing of the board is rendered extremely difficult.|$|E
25|$|If instead angles are preserved, one {{speaks of}} <b>conformal</b> maps. <b>Conformal</b> maps {{give rise to}} Kleinian groups, for example.|$|E
25|$|Lambert <b>conformal</b> conic, which {{adjusts the}} north-south {{distance}} between non-standard parallels to equal the east-west stretching, giving a <b>conformal</b> map.|$|E
25|$|The <b>conformal</b> {{latitude}} {{defines a}} transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of arbitrary radius {{such that the}} angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid {{is the same as}} the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of small elements is well preserved). A further <b>conformal</b> transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a <b>conformal</b> double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not the only way of generating such a <b>conformal</b> projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the Transverse Mercator projection on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the <b>conformal</b> latitude to the complex plane).|$|E
25|$|A Riemann surface {{does not}} come {{equipped}} with any particular Riemannian metric. The Riemann surface's <b>conformal</b> structure does, however, determine a class of metrics: all those whose subordinate <b>conformal</b> structure is the given one. In more detail: The complex structure of the Riemann surface does uniquely determine a metric up to <b>conformal</b> equivalence. (Two metrics {{are said to be}} conformally equivalent if they differ by multiplication by a positive smooth function.) Conversely, any metric on an oriented surface uniquely determines a complex structure, which depends on the metric only up to <b>conformal</b> equivalence. Complex structures on an oriented surface are therefore in one-to-one correspondence with <b>conformal</b> classes of metrics on that surface.|$|E
25|$|A complex {{structure}} {{gives rise}} to a <b>conformal</b> structure by choosing the standard Euclidean metric given on the complex plane and transporting it to X by means of the charts. Showing that a <b>conformal</b> structure determines a complex structure is more difficult.|$|E
25|$|In three dimensions, the Ising {{model was}} shown to have a {{representation}} in terms of non-interacting fermionic lattice strings by Alexander Polyakov. The critical point of the three-dimensional Ising model is described by a <b>conformal</b> field theory, as evidenced by Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical arguments. This <b>conformal</b> field theory is under active investigation using the method of the <b>conformal</b> bootstrap. This method currently yields the most precise information about {{the structure of the}} critical theory (see Ising critical exponents).|$|E
25|$|<b>Conformal</b> {{alternatives}} to the existing spherical sonar array.|$|E
25|$|Σ is of codimension one, {{and so one}} may cut M along Σ. After such {{a cutting}} M will be a {{manifold}} with boundary and in particular classically the dynamics of Σ will be described by a WZW model. Witten has shown that this correspondence holds even quantum mechanically. More precisely, he demonstrated that the Hilbert space of states is always finite-dimensional and can be canonically identified with the space of <b>conformal</b> blocks of the G WZW model at level k. <b>Conformal</b> blocks are locally holomorphic and antiholomorphic factors whose products sum to the correlation functions of a 2-dimensional <b>conformal</b> field theory.|$|E
25|$|The minimal {{models of}} {{two-dimensional}} <b>conformal</b> field theory have an ADE classification.|$|E
25|$|The 2-torus double-covers the 2-sphere, {{with four}} {{ramification}} points. Every <b>conformal</b> structure on the 2-torus {{can be represented}} as a two-sheeted cover of the 2-sphere. The points on the torus corresponding to the ramification points are the Weierstrass points. In fact, the <b>conformal</b> type of the torus {{is determined by the}} cross-ratio of the four points.|$|E
25|$|Möbius transformations {{can be more}} {{generally}} defined in spaces of dimension n>2 as the bijective <b>conformal</b> orientation-preserving maps from the n-sphere to the n-sphere. Such a transformation is the most general form of <b>conformal</b> mapping of a domain. According to Liouville's theorem a Möbius transformation can be expressed as a composition of translations, similarities, orthogonal transformations and inversions.|$|E

25|$|Albert Fässler {{and others}} provide {{insights}} into {{the significance of these}} parabolas in the context of <b>conformal</b> mappings.|$|E
25|$|Low-drag <b>conformal</b> {{fuel tanks}} (CFTs) were {{developed}} for the F-15C and D models. They can {{be attached to the}} sides of the engine air intakes under each wing and are designed to the same load factors and airspeed limits as the basic aircraft. These <b>conformal</b> tanks slightly degrade performance by increasing aerodynamic drag and cannot be jettisoned in-flight. However they cause less drag than conventional external tanks. Each <b>conformal</b> tank can hold 750 U.S. gallons (2,840 L) of fuel. These tanks increase range and reduce the need for in-flight refueling. All external stations for munitions remain available with the tanks in use. Moreover, Sparrow or AMRAAM missiles can be attached to the corners of the <b>conformal</b> fuel tanks. The 57 FIS based at Keflavik NAS, Iceland was the only C-model squadron to use CFTs on a regular basis due to its extended operations over the North Atlantic. With the closure of the 57 FIS, the F-15E is the only variant to carry them on a routine basis. CFTs have also been sold to Israel and Saudi Arabia.|$|E

25|$|Since {{a branch}} of lognbsp&z is holomorphic, and since its {{derivative}} 1/z is never 0, it defines a <b>conformal</b> map.|$|E
25|$|On 17 March 2009, Boeing first {{displayed}} a F-15SE demonstrator. The F-15SE will use fifth generation fighter technologies, such as radar absorbing materials, {{to reduce its}} radar cross-section (RCS). Distinguishing features are the <b>conformal</b> weapons bays (CWB) that replace the <b>conformal</b> fuel tanks (CFT) to hold weapons internally (reducing fuel capacity) and the twin vertical tails canted outward 15 degrees to reduce radar cross section. Different levels of RCS reduction were studied.|$|E
25|$|The Swiss {{mathematician}} Johann Lambert invented several hemispheric map projections. In 1772 {{he created}} the Lambert <b>conformal</b> conic and Lambert azimuthal equal-area projections.|$|E
25|$|The scale {{depends on}} location, {{but not on}} direction. This is {{equivalent}} to preservation of angles, the defining characteristic of a <b>conformal</b> map.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the sphere}} {{is not a}} {{developable}} surface, {{it is impossible to}} construct a map projection that is both equal-area and <b>conformal.</b>|$|E
25|$|So this {{anomalous}} {{dimension in}} the <b>conformal</b> field theory {{is the same}} as a particular critical exponent of the Ising model phase transition.|$|E
25|$|Scale-{{invariant}} QFTs {{are almost}} always invariant under the full <b>conformal</b> symmetry, {{and the study of}} such QFTs is <b>conformal</b> field theory (CFT). Operators in a CFT have a well-defined scaling dimension, analogous to the scaling dimension, ∆, of a classical field discussed above. However, the scaling dimensions of operators in a CFT typically differ from those of the fields in the corresponding classical theory. The additional contributions appearing in the CFT are known as anomalous scaling dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} term for this transformation is a dilatation (also known as dilation), and the dilatations can also {{form part of}} a larger <b>conformal</b> symmetry.|$|E
