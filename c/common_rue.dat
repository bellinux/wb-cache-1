6000|$|In the Carrot {{and some}} allied Umbelliferae, the central flower has its petals {{somewhat}} enlarged, {{and these are}} of a dark purplish-red tint; but it cannot be supposed that this one small flower makes the large white umbel at all more conspicuous to insects. The central flowers {{are said to be}} neuter or sterile, but I obtained by artificial fertilisation a seed (fruit) apparently perfect from one such flower. (Introduction/12. 'The English Flora' by Sir J.E. Smith 1824 volume 2 page 39.) Occasionally two or three of the flowers next to the central one are similarly characterised; and according to Vaucher [...] "cette singuliere degeneration s'etend quelquefois a l'ombelle entiere." [...] (Introduction/13. 'Hist. Phys. des Plantes d'Europe' 1841 tome 2 page 614. On the Echinophora page 627.) That the modified central flower is of no functional importance to the plant is almost certain. It may perhaps be a remnant of a former and ancient condition of the species, when one flower alone, the central one, was female and yielded seeds, as in the Umbelliferous genus Echinophora. There is nothing surprising in the central flower tending to retain its former condition longer than the others; for when irregular flowers become regular or peloric, they are apt to be central; and such peloric flowers apparently owe their origin either to arrested development--that is, to the preservation of an early stage of development--or to reversion. Central and perfectly developed flowers in not a few plants in their normal condition (for instance, the <b>common</b> <b>Rue</b> and Adoxa) differ slightly in structure, as in the number of the parts, from the other flowers on the same plant. All such cases seem connected with the fact of the bud which stands {{at the end of the}} shoot being better nourished than the others, as it receives the most sap. (Introduction/14. This whole subject, including pelorism, has been discussed, and references given in my 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 26 2nd edition volume 2 page 338.) ...|$|E

60|$|It is so {{necessary}} {{to appreciate the}} important effects {{of the laws of}} growth, that I will give some additional cases of another kind, namely of differences in the same part or organ, due to differences in relative position on the same plant. In the Spanish chestnut, and in certain fir-trees, the angles of divergence of the leaves differ, according to Schacht, in the nearly horizontal and in the upright branches. In the <b>common</b> <b>rue</b> and some other plants, one flower, usually the central or terminal one, opens first, and has five sepals and petals, and five divisions to the ovarium; while all the other flowers on the plant are tetramerous. In the British Adoxa the uppermost flower generally has two calyx-lobes with the other organs tetramerous, while the surrounding flowers generally have three calyx-lobes with the other organs pentamerous. In many Compositae and Umbelliferae (and in some other plants) the circumferential flowers have their corollas much more developed than those of the centre; and this seems often connected with the abortion of the reproductive organs. It is a more curious fact, previously referred to, that the achenes or seeds of the circumference and centre sometimes differ greatly in form, colour and other characters. In Carthamus and some other Compositae the central achenes alone are furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris the same head yields achenes of three different forms. In certain Umbelliferae the exterior seeds, according to Tausch, are orthospermous, and the central one coelospermous, and this is a character which was considered by De Candolle to be in other species of the highest systematic importance. Professor Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, in which the flowers in {{the lower part of the}} spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded nutlets; and in the upper part of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved and two-seeded siliques. In these several cases, with the exception of that of the well-developed ray-florets, which are of service in making the flowers conspicuous to insects, natural selection cannot, as far as we can judge, have come into play, or only in a quite subordinate manner. All these modifications follow from the relative position and inter-action of the parts; and it can hardly be doubted that if all the flowers and leaves on the same plant had been subjected to the same external and internal condition, as are the flowers and leaves in certain positions, all would have been modified in the same manner.|$|E

Average rain-use efficiency (RUE; ANPP/precipitation) also varies between biomes, supposedly because of differences in vegetation structure and/or biogeochemical constraints 8. Here we show that RUE decreases across biomes as mean annual precipitation increases.

40|$|International audienceThe enzyme (S) -Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS; EC 4. 2. 1. 78) {{found in}} the <b>common</b> meadow <b>rue,</b> Thalictrum flavum, and other plant species is {{involved}} in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs). This group of plant secondary metabolites comprises pharmacologically active compounds like morphine and codeine. NCS catalyzes the condensation of 4 -hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4 -HPAA) and dopamine to (S) -norcoclaurine, the common precursor of all plant BIAs. While enzymatic properties of NCS and mechanistic aspects of the reaction have been studied in detail, no structural information on NCS was available so far. The enzyme shows significant sequence homology to members of class 10 of pathogenesis related proteins (PR 10 proteins) such as the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1. Our CD and NMR spectroscopic data indicated high similarity of the NCS and the Bet v 1 fold and allowed us to model NCS using Bet v 1 as a template. Virtually complete backbone assignment of the NCS sequence was used to study substrate binding by NMR titration experiments. While binding of 4 -HPAA seems to induce side chain rearrangements in an extensive part of the protein, the putative distinct interaction site for dopamine could be clearly identified.

40|$|Para el {{manejo de}} Hypsipyla grandella (Zeller), cuya larva barrena el brote {{principal}} de caobas (Swietenia spp.) y cedros (Cedrela spp.), sería deseable contar con un producto fagodisuasivo y con buena actividad sistémica, para que proteja rápidamente los tejidos jóvenes. Por tanto, conociendo que un extracto crudo del follaje de ruda (Ruta chalepensis L.) posee actividad fagodisuasiva contra dicho insecto, se formuló un producto combinando dicho extracto con varios coadyuvantes, y se evaluó en árboles de cedro amargo (Cedrela odorata L.) de 75 - 100 cm de altura, en un invernadero. Se utilizó un diseño completamente al azar, con 10 árboles por cada tratamiento, los que correspondieron al producto formulado, a un testigo absoluto (agua destilada), un testigo relativo (carbofurán al 1 %m/v en agua) y el testigo relativo a la formulación sin el extracto crudo. Las variables medidas fueron los ataques al brote principal, el número de hojas caídas, el número de montículos y la longitud de los túneles. Para dichas variables, el producto formulado aportó excelente protección a los árboles tratados, con apenas 0. 1 ataques al brote principal, en promedio, al final del período de evaluación. Asimismo, al evaluar la actividad sistémica del extracto, las sustancias presentes en él pudieron desplazarse y ser asimiladas por los árboles, causando fagodisuasión en las larvas. Finalmente, el análisis espectrofotométrico (a una longitud de onda de 355 nm) permitió determinar la concentración (403 ± 1 mg/l) y el porcentaje (0. 40 %) del flavonoide rutina en el extracto crudo, lo cual eventualmente podría utilizarse como un compuesto marcador analítico, si llegara a desarrollarse una formulación industrial. Phagodeterrent and systemic activity of a fomulation derived from an extract of <b>common</b> <b>rue</b> (Ruta chalepensis, Rutaceae) on Hypsipyla grandella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larvae. A key neotropical pest of mahoganies (Swietenia spp.) and cedars (Cedrela spp.), the larva of Hypsipyla grandella (Zeller) commonly bores {{into the main}} shoot of these valuable timber species, causing forking of the stems. Therefore, it would be desirable to count upon a phagodeterrent and systemic product which could readily protect young tissues. Since crude extracts of <b>common</b> <b>rue</b> foliage (Ruta chalepensis L.) have phagodeterrent activity on H. grandella larva, a product was formulated by combining such an extract {{with a number of}} coadjuvants, and was assessed on 75 - 100 cm tall Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata L.) trees, inside a greenhouse. A completely randomized design was used, with 10 trees per each one of the following treatments: the formulated product, an absolute control (distilled water), a relative control (carbofuran, 1 %m/v in water), and the relative control without the crude extract. Number of attacks to the main shoot, fallen leaves and frass piles were recorded, as well as tunnel length. Regarding these variables, the formulated product provided excellent protection to treated trees, with only 0. 1 attacks to the main shoot, on the average, {{at the end of the}} evaluation period. Likewise, when the systemic activity of the crude extract was assessed, substances present in it were able to translocate and get assimilated by the trees, thereafter causing phagodeterrence to larvae.

40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>rue,</b> Ruta graveolens L., is an {{aromatic}} plant. It contains acridone alkaloids, furoquinolines, coumarins, {{and numerous}} volatile compounds with antimicrobial and allelopathic activity. The {{starting point of}} this work was the biosynthesis of acridone alkaloids in Ruta graveolens L., that are restricted {{to the family of}} Rutaceae. The N-methylation of anthranilate by the anthranilate N-methyltransferase represents the first step in acridone alkaloid biosynthesis by which the anthranilic acid is removed from the primary metabolism. The anthranilate N-methyltransferase coding cDNA had to be isolated from R. graveolens cell culture material and the recombinant enzyme expressed and characterized. An appropriated method to clone an unknown protein is to isolate it from native tissue followed by microsequencing of the resulted peptides. Specific primers designed from the determined peptides would then be used for the cDNA amplification. In this work, 500 g wet weight of Ruta graveolens R- 20 cells grown in suspension culture, were employed for a six-step purification strategy leading to a 450 times purification fold. The gel electrophoresis showed a polypeptide band with an apparent molecular weight of 42 - 43 kDa. Radioactive mesurements with [Methyl- 14 C]-SAM showed a high specific activity. The microsequencing of the protein, performed by Dr. Peter Hunziker (Biochemistry Department, University of Zürich), resulted in only five short peptide fragments with no homology with other known methyltransferases. Degenerated oligonucleotide primers, designed based on the peptide fragments, produced a PCR amplicon with no homology to methyltransferases. As the purification did not bring the desired result, degenerated oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the conserved motives (SAM binding site) in O-methyltransferases (OMT). With this method, two full length cDNAs were isolated, R- 23 and R- 27. R- 23 was coding for a 366 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 40 kDa. R- 27 was coding for a 41. 6 kDa protein of 374 amino acid residues. These genes were cloned in pQE- 60 vector and expressed in E. coli M- 15. The protein R- 23 had 79 % similarity with caffeic acid O-methyltransferases and preserved all the amino acids important for methylation. R- 27 showed all the important methyltransferases conserved motifs and had 50 % similarity with a putative methyltransferase from Prunus dulcis respectively orcinol and chavicol O-methyltrasnferases from Rosa hybrida. Both bacterial overexpressed proteins were tested for substrate specificity. R- 23 coded enzyme did not methylate any of the tested substrates, including caffeic acid. R- 27 did methylate 3, 5 -dimethoxyphenol and other methoxylated phenols. The protein R- 27 was purified in four chromatographic steps and characterized. The enzyme showed narrow substrate specificity. The highest affinity was with 3, 5 -dimethoxyphenol (Km 20. 1 µM) with an optimum pH of 7. 5. Other accepted substrates were: 3 -methoxyphenol, guaiacol, 3, 4 -dimethoxyphenol and 3, 5 -dihydroxyanisole. The reaction was independent on cations. The optimum temperature was around 36 &# 730;C. On Coomassie stained SDS gel, the purified protein showed a characteristic band of 42 kDa. The calculated molecular weight from a calibrated size exclusion chromatographie was 84 kDa, suggesting that the native enzyme is a homodimer. The reaction product of 3, 5 -dimethoxyphenol methylation, 1, 3, 5 -trimethoxybenzene is {{an important component of the}} scent of roses. Therefore, is reasonable to postulate that the product of the methylation described in this work is a volatile component of the scent of R. graveolens. Based on its substrate specificity, the protein was designated as 3, 5 -dimethoxyphenol O-methyltransferase. It could be shown that in the presence of Zn 2 + the protein efficiently methylate DTT. The product was identified by LC-MS as monomethylthioether. Therefore, 3, 5 -dimethoxyphenol O-methyltransferase, in addition to the OMT activity, had a thiolmethyltransferase (TMT) activity. Kinetic analysis of 3, 5 -dimethoxyphenol methylation in the presence of various Zn 2 +/DTT concentrations showed a competitive DTT binding with an affinity of Ki = 52. 0 µM. These results indicate that the OMT and TMT take place in the same active site of the enzyme. Altogether, these results suggest that the substrate specificity of plant O-methyltransferases II and their function in vivo is probably much wider as assumed...|$|E
