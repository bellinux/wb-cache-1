The variations that constitute types occur in the various facial features on Washington, and on his Toga and on the various lines of shading on the ornaments of the stamp design.

Down they swooped, one on the right, one on the left, the sides and shrouds black with men and bristling with weapons. In heavy {{clusters}} they hung upon the forecastle all ready for a spring-faces white, faces brown, faces yellow, and faces black, fair Norsemen, swarthy Italians, fierce rovers from the Levant, and fiery Moors from the Barbary States, of all hues and countries, and marked solely by the <b>common</b> <b>stamp</b> of a wild-beast ferocity. Rasping up on either side, with oars trailing to save them from snapping, they poured in a living torrent with horrid yell and shrill whoop upon the defenceless merchantman.|$|E
60|$|Frances felt, as {{she walked}} {{by the side of}} this {{extraordinary}} man, that she was supported by one of no <b>common</b> <b>stamp.</b> The firmness of his step, and the composure of his manner, seemed to indicate a mind settled and resolved. By taking a route {{over the back of the}} hill, they descended with great expedition, and but little danger. The distance it had taken Frances an hour to conquer, was passed by Harper and his companion in ten minutes, and they entered the open space already mentioned. He struck into one of the sheep paths, and, crossing the clearing with rapid steps, they came suddenly upon a horse, caparisoned for a rider of no mean rank. The noble beast snorted and pawed the earth, as his master approached and replaced the pistols in the holsters.|$|E

60|$|In Mr. Denman's exchanges, as {{in those}} of little Agnes, the same {{peculiarity}} {{was to be}} remarked,--an undue preponderance of that despicably <b>common</b> <b>stamp,</b> the French twenty-five centimes. And here joining them in stealthy review, I found the C and the CH; then something of an A just following; and then a terminal Y. Here was almost the whole name spelt out to me; it seemed familiar too; and yet for some time I could not bridge the imperfection. Then I came upon another stamp, in which an L was legible before the Y, {{and in a moment}} the word leaped up complete. Chailly, that was the name: Chailly-en-Bière, the post town of Barbizon--ah, there was the very place for any man to hide himself--there was the very place for Mr. Norris, who had rambled over England making sketches--the very place for Goddedaal, who had left a palette-knife on board the Flying Scud. Singular, indeed, that while I was drifting over England with the shyster, the man we were in quest of awaited me at my own ultimate destination.|$|E
60|$|In fact, Tiel Wetzweiler, called Le Glorieux, was by {{no means}} a jester of the <b>common</b> <b>stamp.</b> He was a tall, fine looking man, {{excellent}} at many exercises, which seemed scarce reconcilable with mental imbecility, because it must have required patience and attention to attain them. He usually followed the Duke to the chase and to the fight; and at Montl'hery, when Charles was in considerable personal danger, wounded in the throat, and likely to be made prisoner by a French knight who had hold of his horse's rein, Tiel Wetzweiler charged the assailant so forcibly as to overthrow him and disengage his master. Perhaps he was afraid of this being thought too serious a service for a person of his condition, and that it might excite him enemies among those knights and nobles who had left the care of their master's person to the court fool. At any rate, he chose rather to be laughed at than praised for his achievement; and made such gasconading boasts of his exploits in the battle, that most men thought the rescue of Charles was as ideal as the rest of his tale; and it was on this occasion he acquired the title of Le Glorieux (or the boastful), by which he was ever afterwards distinguished.|$|E
60|$|Another {{thing which}} he took into account was that Ida would {{probably}} get over her dislike. He was a close observer of women, in a cynical and half contemptuous way, and he remarked, or thought that he remarked, a curious tendency among them to submit with comparative complacency to the inevitable whenever it happened to coincide with their material advantage. Women, he argued, have not, as a class, outgrown the traditions of their primitive condition when their partners for life were chosen for them by lot or the chance of battle. They still recognise {{the claims of the}} wealthiest or strongest, and their love of luxury and ease is so keen that if the nest they lie in is only soft enough, they will not grieve long over {{the fact that it was}} not of their own choosing. Arguing from these untrustworthy premises, he came to the conclusion that Ida would soon get over her repugnance to marrying him, when she found how many comforts and good things marriage with so rich a man would place at her disposal, and would, if for no other reason, learn to look on him with affection and gratitude as the author of her gilded ease. And so indeed she might have done had she been of another and more <b>common</b> <b>stamp.</b> But, unfortunately for his reasoning, there exist members of her sex who are by nature of an order of mind superior to these considerations, and who realise that they have but one life to live, and that the highest form of happiness is /not/ dependent upon money or money's worth, but rather upon the indulgence of mental aspirations and those affections which, when genuine, draw nearer to holiness than anything else about us. Such a woman, more especially if she is already possessed with an affection for another man, does not easily become reconciled to a distasteful lot, however quietly she may endure it, and such a woman was Ida de la Molle.|$|E
50|$|De Thuin {{specialised}} in forging overprints of Central and South American countries, especially Mexico, thus turning <b>common</b> <b>stamps</b> into rarities. He also copied illustrations that he {{had seen}} in magazines, sometimes repeating the mistakes of the original illustrator where he had no original to refer to. He is thought not to have produced whole stamps apart from the classic issues of Mexico.|$|R

50|$|De Thuin's {{method of}} sale {{was to use}} one of his aliases to send sheets of {{approvals}} to collectors, mainly in the United States, which mixed a few genuine <b>common</b> <b>stamps</b> with forgeries of rarer items. Many collectors were duped and in 1962 a London sale of 498 lots of classic Mexico belonging to Prof. Hormer Lizama was cancelled when the sale was revealed to consist mainly of de Thuin fakes.|$|R

5000|$|Because of his {{interest}} in the study of forgeries, Tyler became an expert on the subject and wrote substantial literature on the subject, including: Philatelic Forgers: Their Lives and Works, in 1976 and revised and expanded in 1991, and Focus on Forgeries: A Guide to Forgeries of <b>Common</b> <b>Stamps,</b> which was issued in 2000 and consisted of a compilation of his [...] "Focus on Forgeries" [...] in Linn's Stamp News.|$|R
50|$|In 1907 {{a member}} of the Stamp Trade Protection Association became {{concerned}} about the volume of orders for <b>common</b> <b>stamps</b> received from Treherne that could be easily manipulated by the application of fake surcharges or overprints. After a member received an order for a large number of Great Britain penny reds, the association set a trap for Treherne by marking some with a pin prick. When the stamps were eventually sold, they had acquired a CYPRUS overprint not present originally, thus greatly increasing their value.|$|R
50|$|The Deutsche Reichspost started officially on May 4, 1871 using {{initially}} stamps of the North German Confederation {{until it}} issued its first stamps on January 1, 1872. Heinrich von Stephan, {{inventor of the}} postcard {{and founder of the}} Universal Postal Union, was the first Postmaster-General. The most <b>common</b> <b>stamps</b> of the Reichspost were the Germania stamps. Germania stamps were issued from 1900 until 1922 making it the longest running series in German philately with the change in the inscription from Reichspost to Deutsches Reich being the major modification during this period.|$|R

More than 1 billion copies were printed, more than 70 percent {{of the total number of}} Columbian Issue stamps, in part because it paid the first-class rate for domestic mail.|$|E
5000|$|The Reichspost {{continued}} {{to function as}} a governmental entity after Germany became a republic. In 1919 the Reichspost issued its first commemorative, airmail, and semipostal stamps. The first semipostal stamp in 1919 carried a surcharge for the benefit of war invalids (Scott #B1). In 1923 during hyperinflation, the Reichspost issued stamps up to 50 billion marks. The main <b>common</b> <b>stamp</b> series then was the [...] "famous German people" [...] series, followed by the Hindenburg stamps.

5|$|Some {{collectors}} try {{to acquire}} a basic collection of the more <b>common</b> <b>stamps</b> from 1922 onwards, though that can be difficult now due to the quantity issued. Many collectors concentrate on one type of stamp, such as definitives or commemoratives, or even one issue, such as Gerl definitives. The First Day covers, especially commemoratives with full sets affixed, are popular though the older issues are harder to find because less than a million of the high value stamps were printed {{in the early years}} (1929–1940s) for several issues, a far lower number than the 20-plus millions printed for most of the low values during the same period.|$|R
5000|$|As many stamps of {{the colonies}} are {{valuable}} yet based on commonly available definitive German stamps, {{the stage is}} set for forgery. A forger may just [...] "overprint" [...] a <b>common</b> <b>stamp</b> of the period. Forgeries started to appear as early as 1903. A notable forger was François Fournier who produced [...] "reproductions" [...] which are close enough to the originals to fool the unsuspecting buyer. In recent years, the so-called [...] "Hialeah Forgeries" [...] have appeared on E-Bay and other auctions and include, among others, stamps from the Marshall Islands with falsified [...] "G.R.I." [...] overprints. In the [...] "Blüm Case", a forger produced false cancellation and expertizing stamps that were applied to German colony stamps and others.|$|E
50|$|For many years, {{sheets of}} stamps were {{generally}} cut into four quarters (panes) before being perforated. This produced many stamps that were perforated on only three sides. On a pane of 100, for example, 18 stamps appeared {{with a single}} straight edge, the single (corner) stamp lacked perforations on two sides, and only 81 stamps were perforated on all four sides. (A pane of 50 commemorative-sized stamps typically contained only 36 fully perforated copies.) Because stamps with a straight edge are less desirable to collectors—and fetch lower prices—than fully perforated examples, unscrupulous dealers have “reperforated” many older straight-edged stamps: that is, they have carefully cut false perforations into the flat side, so that the copy can be sold for the same price as a normally perforated version. In other cases a valuable and a common variety of a stamp may differ only by the presence or size of the perforations. Thus new perforations are cut into the stamp, or perforations are cut off to make a <b>common</b> <b>stamp</b> appear like a rare imperforate or rare coil issue.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{most major}} {{countries}} have by now issued from 1,000 to 6,000 types of stamps, it usually difficult {{for even a}} single-country collector to remember what is still missing from a stamp collection. Still, most stamps are cheap, and collectors frequently get started by acquiring one or more existing collections, which will include most of the <b>common</b> <b>stamps.</b> Then the problem is to get stamps to [...] "fill the holes"; {{only a handful of}} dealers will have a complete stock, and so the want list may take {{on a life of its}} own as the collector carries it to stamp shows, mails copies to out-of-town dealers, and so forth, gradually crossing off entries as they are located and purchased.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of stamps, {{cancellation}} with a pen was <b>common.</b> Today <b>stamps</b> are almost always cancelled with an inked handstamp or a machine cancel as this is quicker to apply.

5000|$|In the United States, {{the quality}} of gold-filled {{jewellery}} {{is defined by the}} Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If the gold layer is 10kt fineness, the minimum weight of the plated layer on an item stamped [...] "GF" [...] must equal at least 1/10th of the total weight of the item. If the gold layer is 12 kt or higher, the minimum layer of karat gold in an item stamped [...] "GF" [...] must equal at least 1/20th the total weight of the item. The most <b>common</b> <b>stamps</b> found on gold-filled jewelry are 1/20 12kt GF and 1/20 14kt GF. Also common is 1/10 10kt. Some products are made using sterling silver as the base, although this more expensive version is not common today. These standards are for modern gold-filled items. It is not uncommon to see 1/8 14kt gold-filled marks, plus many other variations, on items from the 1930s, 1940s, etc., which would have to be marked [...] "Rolled Gold Plate".|$|R
