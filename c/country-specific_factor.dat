We therefore introduce an asset pricing model which exploits information contained in both forward interest rates and forward CDS spreads. Our empirical analysis covers euro-zone countries with German government bonds as credit risk-free assets.

40|$|Abstract] Our main {{objective}} is to analyze firm-specific determinates {{and the role of}} various <b>country-specific</b> <b>factors</b> in determining corporate capital structure. On the other hand, we show that <b>country-specific</b> <b>factors</b> can also influence corporate leverage indirectly through their impact on the effect of firm-specific factors. We analyze a sample of 59 companies during the years of 2004 - 2011. We analyze the firm-specific determinants of leverage, like firm size, asset tangibility, profitability, and growth opportunities. Additionally, we incorporate a number of country-specific variables in our analysis, including market size, gross domestic product growth, and inflation rate. We find that the impact of several firm-specific factors on capital structure is significant and considerable explanatory power of country-specific variables beyond firm-specific factors. Prior research in Iran often investigated a firm’s capital structure as influenced by firm-specific factors. In this study, we show that <b>country-specific</b> <b>factors</b> can also influence corporate leverage indirectly through their impact on the effect of firm-specific factors.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a framework for}} analyzing the role of financial factors {{as a source of}} instability in small open economies. Our basic model is a dynamic open economy model with a tradeable good produced with capital and a <b>country-specific</b> <b>factor.</b> We also assume that firms face credit constraints, with the constraint being tighter at a lower level of financial development. A basic implication of this model is that economies at an intermediate level of financial development are more unstable than either very developed or very underdeveloped economies. This is true both in the sense that temporary shocks have large and persistent effects and also in the sense that these economies can exhibit cycles. Thus, countries that are going through a phase of financial development may become more unstable in the short run. Similarly, full capital account liberalization may destabilize the economy in economies at an intermediate level of financial development: phases of growth with capital inflows are followed by collapse with capital outflows. On the other hand, foreign direct investment does not destabilize. ...|$|E

40|$|According to {{a growing}} body of {{empirical}} literature, global shocks have become less important for business cycles in industrialized countries and emerging market economies since the mid- 1980 s. In this paper, we analyze the question of what might have caused a decoupling from the global business cycle: the smaller size of the global shocks or a reduced sensitivity of national business cycles to these shocks? To this end, we employ a large scale hierarchical dynamic factor model that decomposes the growth rates of GDP, consumption, and investment for 106 countries over 1961 - 2014 into a global, a group-, and a <b>country-specific</b> <b>factor,</b> as well as an idiosyncratic component. The factor loadings and conditional variances are allowed to vary over time according to random walk processes. Instead of assuming that the parameters change, we test for time variation using a Bayesian stochastic model specification search. Our results confirm a reduction in the importance of the global business cycle {{for the vast majority of}} our countries. However, the sensitivity of most countries to global or group-specific shocks as measured by the factor loadings has not changed over time. Instead, the magnitude of the global shocks relative to group-specific and country-specific shocks has decreased, resulting in a lower relevance of global shocks for national cycles...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} and test a conditional {{version of the}} international CAPM. By using a parsimonious parameterization recently proposed by Ding and Engle (1994), we allow risk premia, betas, and correlations to very through time and test the cross-section restrictions of the model using a relatively large number of assets. One advantage of our test {{is that it does}} not require the market weights to be observed in each period. In support of the international CAPM, we find that world-wide risk is priced whereas country-specific risk is not. Further, we find that the price of world risk is time-varying and has a strong January seasonal. When the price of risk is allowed to vary, a January dummy and the world dividend yield are driven out as independently priced factors. However, contrary to the prediction of the model, differences in risk premia across countries are explained not only by world-wide risk, but also by a constant <b>country-specific</b> <b>factor.</b> The estimated correlations reveal three main facts, cross-country correlations vary through time; they have been affected only to a limited extent by the process of liberalization of the last decade; they tend to increase during severe bear markets in the U.

The results prove that these non-accounting values represent {{a source of information}} for investors. However, the relationship between brand values and stock prices could differ across countries. Previous studies reveal that the value relevance of accounting variables diverges on a country basis and identify several <b>country-specific</b> <b>factors</b> which affect the information content of accounting variables. These factors are referred to the legal system, the accounting regulation and the financial system (market-oriented vs bank-oriented) of the different countries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sources of}} output shocks in Finland as compared to other EU countries. The data consists of output fluctuations in main industries in nine current EU countries for the period 1978 – 1993. The sources of output shock are considered to consist of country-specific factors, sector-specific factors and a time factor, which is common to all countries and sectors. Fluctuation is partitioned using three-dimensional analysis of variance. Output shocks in Finland are clearly more country-specific than in other EU countries. A separate examination of the time period preceding the 1990 s demonstrates that the result is not due to the exceptional recession {{in the beginning of}} the 1990 s. The more central role that the <b>country-specific</b> <b>factor</b> has in Finland as compared to other EU countries is explained by the fact that average output growth was higher in Finland than in other EU countries until the end of the 1980 s. Differences in growth rates between sectors also were larger than in other countries. Examination of the time period including the recession revealed that idiosyncratic economic cycle was clearly a more significant source of disturbances in Finland than in other countries. Examining the time period covering the depression also underlines the large volatility of the sheltered sector in Finland. output shocks; output by industry; variance partitioning; EU countries...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} essay I {{investigate}} whether the high liquidity of ETFs attracts a clientele of short-term investors. I find that liquidity {{is an important}} determinant of fund flows, particularly at weekly and monthly horizons. I also investigate whether more liquid ETFs facilitates shorter-term trading. I document a liquidity clientele amongst institutional investors: i) their buys and sells are positively related to ETF liquidity, ii) liquidity is significantly more important for short- than for long-term investors, and iii) liquidity is inversely related to average holding periods. These {{findings are consistent with}} the idea that liquidity benefits short-term traders the most. In the second essay I show that changes in ETF misvaluation – as proxied by the return difference between an Exchange-Traded Fund and its underlying portfolio Net Asset Value – comove excessively across ETFs. Excess comovements are positive and highly significant across ETFs in matching investment styles, and negative and significant across distant styles. Further tests based on return reversals suggest that ETF premiums relative to NAV reflect misvaluation primarily in the ETF, rather than the NAV price, particularly for ETFs in more liquid styles (e. g. small-cap). Finally, the degree of return comovements is stronger for funds with high commonality in demand shocks and more attractive liquidity characteristics. These findings are consistent with the idea that liquidity can sometimes be detrimental to pricing efficiency, because liquidity attracts short-horizon noise traders with correlated demand for investment styles. The third essay investigates whether asset prices are exposed to local-trading induced misvaluation. My sample contains 2727 pairs of European ETFs from 15 different country pairs. Each ETF-pair has identical fundamentals, but is traded by investors from different countries. I document a strong <b>country-specific</b> <b>factor</b> in twin return differentials. This result holds from daily to monthly horizons, it is unrelated to exchange rates and it cannot be explained by liquidity differences. Consistent with local misvaluation in the stock market, I find a significantly positive relationship between twin return differentials and local stock returns, particularly at higher frequencies. Additional tests provide evidence against the alternative explanation that misvaluation is driven by similarities in information diffusion between twins...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the determinants of efficiency, profitability {{and stability in the}} banking sector across the world over the period 2005 - 2012. In this study, efficiency is measured using data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is divided into technical efficiency (TE), pure technical efficiency (PTE), and scale efficiency (SE). The profitability is represented by return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and net interest margin (NIM). Furthermore, the z-score and capital ratios are the main indicators for stability. The data includes 323 banks (43 Islamic, 242 conventional, and 38 socially responsible banks [SRBs]) from around the world, covering 37 countries. The statistical methods to find the determinants are ordinary least square (OLS) and fixed effects model (FEM). The data for this study was extracted from the Bankscope and World Bank databases. According to efficiency, the DEA measures demonstrate that socially responsible banks (SRBs) are the most efficient banks. This {{is due to the fact}} that SRBs management employ minimum inputs; one of the main characteristics of SRBs is the saving of resources (inputs). In contrast, the least efficient scores are achieved by conventional banks. As conventional banks have higher interest expenses to pay. In terms of Islamic banks, the larger banks were found to be more efficient. Furthermore, lending services are important to maximise outputs effectively. Additionally, efficiency in Islamic banks is influenced significantly by earnings. Islamic banks with higher capitalisation were found to be more efficient, and new Islamic banks operate better than older banks. Regarding the macroeconomic factors, countries with better market capitalisations include more efficient Islamic banks. Based on the conventional banks’ findings, banks with a higher size performed better than the smaller sized banks. The loans profits increased the efficiency significantly. Focusing on age, the more recent banks achieve better efficiency scores. The three types of ownership (foreign, domestic, and public) reflect inverse correlations with DEA. With regards to the external variables, the wealth of the country is highly important in terms of efficiency. In addition, stock market growth supports the efficiency positively and significantly, while inflation and the global financial crisis (GFC) influenced the efficiency negatively and significantly. Concentrating on SRBs, banks with more capitals operated more efficiently than lower capitalised banks. Additionally, GDP, inflation and market capitalisation enhanced efficiency significantly. Overall, the relationship between the control of corruption and efficiency is positive and significant in Islamic, conventional and socially responsible banks. Tighter controls on corruption have led to better efficiency. Regarding the profitability, the highest ROA and ROE were attained by conventional banks. This is because the main aim for conventional banks is to achieve returns, and charging interest maximises their earnings. On the other hand, SRBs scored the lowest ROA and ROE as those banks are primarily concerned with providing social and environmental services over profits. According to NIM, Islamic banks do not have interest expenses, which can allow them to score the highest NIM measures in this study; while conventional banks have the minimum NIM ratios due to higher interest expenses. Based on the Islamic banks’ results, Islamic banking was affected positively by total assets of banks. In addition, the stable Islamic banks achieved greater profits based on the strong associations between z-score and earnings. This contradicts the relationship between profitability ratios and capital ratios, which indicate negative and significant correlations. Depending on <b>country-specific</b> <b>factor,</b> Islamic banks in higher productivity countries could not exploit the growth to gain higher profits. This results in a weakness for Islamic banks in terms of being resistant to higher inflation rates. For the conventional banks, size of bank and capital are highly important for profits. The conventional banks can concentrate on providing more loans to maximise their returns. The stability of conventional banks also has positive and significant associations with profitability ratios. Concerning the SRBs, profitability ratios are affected significantly and positively by stability (z-score) and market capitalisation growth. On the other hand, foreign, domestic and public ownerships negatively impacted the profits. According to industry-specific variables, GDP growth reduces profits significantly. 	 For the stability, SRBs are demonstrably the most stable and resilient system against financial crisis. Accepting more deposits and attaining greater profits significantly increase the stability of all banks and lower the risk of insolvency. Overall, listed banks were found to be more efficient, profitable, and stable than unlisted banks. This study helps managers and policy makers within the banking sector to reduce costs and increase profits with lower risks. In addition, finding the positive determinants allows managers to make more decisions based on positive factors. On the contrary, through raising efficiency, profitability and stability in banking, managers can aim to avoid negative variables altogether. Finally, this study contributes to the literature in terms of adding socially responsible banks into the equation. In addition, comparing efficiency, profitability and stability simultaneously is a new method that can allow bankers to build effective strategic decisions based on the determinants.

40|$|Most prior works {{focus on}} the effect of IFRS {{adoption}} itself on earnings quality using one dimension of earnings quality, and cover the early years of adoption. The present thesis seeks to investigate how <b>country-specific</b> <b>factors</b> shape accounting quality under IFRS across 23 countries between 2007 and 2010, the global financial crisis period. This is the first study to examine the effect of <b>country-specific</b> <b>factors,</b> using recent indicators, on both accruals and real earnings management under IFRS. It is also the first to explore the impact of <b>country-specific</b> <b>factors</b> on conditional conservatism and value relevance together, which highlights earnings quality from contracting perspective and equity valuation perspective at the same time. The results of the first empirical study indicate that overstating earnings via accruals is less pronounced in countries with strong investor protection, strict enforcement, and large capital markets, and that managing earnings upward utilizing real actions is greater in such countries. Further, the results show that firms engage in both types of earnings management at the same time. The results of the second empirical study show that earnings are more conservative in countries having strong investor protection and rigorous enforcement of accounting standards, and that the value relevance of book values is greater in those countries. Further, the strength of capital markets has no impact on the extent of conservatism, whereas the value relevance of earnings is greater in large capital markets. Overall, the main findings of this thesis suggest that <b>country-specific</b> <b>factors</b> still govern accounting quality under IFRS and that they drive different ‘quality’ earnings. The IASB should emphasise the enforcement mechanisms, not only the mere adoption of IFRS. Auditors and regulators should also consider the possible negative effects of real activities to which managers switch in a bid to escape coming under scrutiny in countries with strong institutions.

Firstly, from the analysis, during the overall reference period, the diffusion rate of the Internet is larger than that of telephone. Secondly, the gap between the diffusion rates of household-use and business-use in the Internet is much larger than it is for the telephone.
