50|$|The gearbox was the well-proven Triumph 955i unit as a {{five-speed}} to a cable-operated {{wet clutch}} and reversed, {{with the final}} drive chain on the right instead of the left. This allows the traditional Triumph twin layout of small triangular engine cover {{on the right and}} larger <b>clutch</b> <b>case</b> on the left. Instead of fuel injection the team opted for a pair of 36 mm Keihin carburettors with electric heaters to help cold starting and a throttle-position sensor linked to digital ignition to optimise throttle response. The 'peashooter' twin exhausts were designed longer than usual to meet the silencing requirements, and a kink was added to improve ground clearance. The engine is solidly mounted in the frame at five points with counter-balancers removing the need for rubber mounts. Suspension was provided by twin Kayaba rear shocks and non-adjustable 41 mm Kayaba telescopic forks, set at a 29-degree head angle, with 117 mm of trail. A 19-inch front wheel was offset by a 17-inch rear and the relatively long 58.8 in wheelbase and low 30.5 in seat height give the new Bonneville the 'lean' look of the original.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the torque {{characteristic}} of a permanent magnet magnetorheological (MR) clutch is investigated focusing {{on the influence of}} temperature. An experimental campaign was carried out on a test bench equipped with a caulk oxen, heating up to 80 ◦C. The torque characteristic was measured monitoring both fluid and <b>clutch</b> <b>case</b> temperature. Torque data were processed and well fitted by a formula where the temperature dependence is expressed by Arrhenius law. In particular, a loss of transmitted torque for increasing temperature was found.

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} properties of magnetorheological fluids has been already considered in the literature, but such an aspect related to MR clutches/brakes {{has not yet been}} analysed, though thermal effects on torque proved to be significant. In this paper the torque characteristic of a permanent magnet magnetorheological clutch is investigated focusing on the influence of temperature. An experimental campaign was carried out on a test bench equipped with a caulk heating up to 80 o C. The torque characteristics were measured and both the fluid and the <b>clutch</b> <b>case</b> temperature were monitored at the beginning {{and at the end of}} each test. Torque data were processed and well fitted by a formula where the {{temperature dependence}} is expressed by Arrhenius law, taking into account the temperature variation during the test. In particular a loss of transmitted torque for increasing temperature was found. The dependence of the gap average shear stress on temperature was also approximately estimated on the basis of finite element magnetic analyses and simplifying assumptions which could be used to estimate torque-temperature dependence on similar devices...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} two {{new species}} of Phrynopus from a cloud forest of the Cordillera Yanachaga, Yanachaga-Chemillén National Park in Peru and describe and document the first <b>clutch</b> and <b>case</b> of parental care for a species of Phrynopus. One of the {{new species of}} Phrynopus is described based on two females (SVL 19. 1 – 21. 0 mm) which were found in leaf litter and moss layer in a cloud forest at 2900 m elevation. This new species is most similar to Phrynopus bracki. The second new species of Phrynopus {{was found in the}} transitional formation between cloud forest and wet puna at 3000 m elevation. Its description is based on a single female (SVL 20. 7 mm) that was observed guarding nine eggs under moss. This new species is most similar to Phrynopus nicoleae. The eggs had a diameter of 5. 7 – 5. 8 mm (n = 3) and froglets when hatched a SVL of 6. 2 – 6. 5 mm (n = 3).

5000|$|South Island robins become {{sexually mature}} between six and 12 months of age. They begin their {{breeding}} season fairly early in August or September (Southern Hemisphere spring) {{and thus can}} {{make use of the}} winter's remaining food stores during this time. They build open-cup nests in tree-forks or inside tree cavities. Incubation lasts 18 days, and chicks leave the nest after 21 days. Five to 25 days after fledglings leave the nest, the pair may breed again. Modal clutch size is two eggs [...] with the expected inverse correlation between size and number of eggs. Replacement <b>clutches</b> in the <b>case</b> of loss of eggs or nestlings to predation can be produced relatively rapidly, within 3-10 days.|$|R
50|$|To help {{increase}} life in applications, {{friction material}} is used between the poles. This friction material is {{flush with the}} steel on the coil shell or rotor, since if the friction material was not flush, good magnetic traction could not occur between the faces. Some people look at electromagnetic clutches and mistakenly assume that, since the friction material is flush with the steel, that the clutch has already worn down, {{but this is not}} the <b>case.</b> <b>Clutches</b> used in most mobile applications, (automotive, agriculture, construction equipment) do not use friction material. Their cycle requirements tend to be lower than industrial clutches, and their cost is more sensitive. Also, many mobile clutches are exposed to outside elements, so by not having friction material, it eliminates the possibility of swelling (reduced torque), that can happen when friction material absorbs moisture.|$|R
5000|$|Racing {{equipment}} includes tubular exhaust headers, {{an electric}} fuel pump, altered rear suspension with heavy-duty traction control bars and asymmetrical leaf springs, heavy-duty trunk-mounted battery, locking differential, auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by Goodyear and Mickey Thompson (himself {{a recipient of}} one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the <b>clutch</b> in <b>case</b> of disintegration under load. The claimed compression ratio was 13.5:1. Other weight-saving measures include the elimination of such street items as the sunvisors, radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger side windshield wiper, arm rests, rear window cranks, mirrors, sound deadening material, carpeting, trunk mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire. Front seats were either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary bucket seats from the Econoline van; the carpeting was replaced with a black rubber mat. The rear seat was a standard Fairlane unit. The high-beam headlights were eliminated as well and in their place were mesh-covered air intakes which ran directly to a special air cleaner atop the 427. Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high-low 5.75 inch (146 mm) headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system were selectable with a standard foot-operated switch. Though it was technically a street legal automobile, these modifications and deletions along with a final drive ratio of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics make the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of a male}} bird {{towards a}} potential mate and her clutch may depend both on his expected paternity and on the likelihood that she will produce a replacement clutch if he commits infanticide. In this study we evaluate the choices made by replacement male European starlings Sturnus vulgaris. By removing males before and during laying, we induced other males, mainly neighbours, to mate with the reproductively active females. When the original male was removed before laying, a new male adopted the subsequent clutch in 14 out of 15 cases. When ten females were widowed during their laying period, replacement males never adopted their clutches. The paternity of replacement males was a function of when they replaced the former male. When replacement occurred more than 3 days before egglaying, the new male fathered nearly all offspring; when it occurred the day before laying, the new male still fathered more than every second young. When the original male was removed during his mate's laying period, in five out of ten cases a replacement male committed infanticide by throwing out the eggs, but this only occurred in one out of 15 cases when removal took place before laying. The evidence for infanticide actually being committed by the replacement male was circumstantial. Four out of six of the females affected by apparent infanticide produced replacement clutches in which the male presumably had higher paternity than in the original <b>clutch.</b> In all <b>cases,</b> the male adopted the replacement <b>clutch.</b> In five <b>cases</b> when the original male was removed during laying, the neighbours neither adopted the brood nor committed infanticide, although they sometimes were seen courting the widowed female and copulating with her. These cases occurred later during laying than those were males comitted infanticide. The time from infanticide to the laying of the replacement clutch tended to increase as infanticide was committed later in the laying sequence. We conclude that strategies of potential replacement males are influenced by their expected paternity in the current brood and {{the probability that the}} female will produce an early replacement clutch...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a journey}} through the legislative changes and case law in order to analyse and evaluate {{the changing nature of}} South African jurisprudence in respect of the notions of equality, discrimination and affirmative action {{and the manner in which}} these issues are proved and dealt with in our courts. It focuses firstly on the emergence of the post-Wiehahn labour laws and the developing jurisprudence concerning discrimination in South Africa towards the end of a long period of isolation from the international world. It witnesses the growing cognizance which was taken of international guidelines and their slow and gradual incorporation into our jurisprudence before the institution of the new democratic government, in the days when the country was still firmly in the grip of a regime which prided itself on its discriminatory laws. It also deals in some depth with the new laws enacted after the first democratic government was installed, especially in so far as the Constitution was concerned. The first <b>clutch</b> of <b>cases</b> dealing with discrimination which were delivered by the Constitutional Court and their effects on decisions of the labour courts thereafter, are dealt with in great detail, indicating how important those judgments were and still are ten years later. A special chapter is devoted to the Harksen case, still a leading authority on how to deal with allegations of unfair discrimination. Having traversed several of the judgments of the labour courts after Harksen, several observations are made in the conclusion of the study which, it is hoped, summarize the major areas of concern in respect of the task of testing claims of unfair discrimination arising in our Court...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between clutch size behaviour {{and the likelihood of}} egg limitation in insects with parasitoid-like life histories. We compare the incidence of egg limitation in insects that produce clutch sizes consistent with maximizing ®tness per host (i. e. the `single host maximum', or Lack clutch size) with insects exhibiting two types of dynamic behaviour. In the ®rst <b>case,</b> insects produce <b>clutch</b> sizes according to a rule that speci®es a negative relationship between egg complement and clutch size; in the second <b>case,</b> <b>clutch</b> size is determined by both egg complement and the host encounter rate using a dynamic state-variable model. The analyses are an extension of models presented by Rosenheim (1996), which predicted a strong positive relationship between the risk of egg limitation and the host encounter rate in the absence of dynamic oviposition behaviour. Our results are consistent with Rosenheim's, but they show that dynamic behaviour can greatly reduce the risk of egg limitation and weaken {{the relationship between}} the host encounter rate and egg limitation...|$|R

In the next space, members of a dysfunctional family stood on a platform that spanned the width of the space, forming a kinetic frieze, their arguments abstracted through multiple distancing layers of time, space and verbal embellishment.  At one end of the frieze stood a clutch of Nazi soldiers speaking German, at the other, a girl in a red dress recited text on a swing.  A hanged man in a fedora <b>clutching</b> a violin <b>case</b> appeared, and a chorus of dancers flooded the space - the same chorus who had previously performed a Vegas floor show decked out in headdresses, shiny bikinis and high heels, but were now either nude or bare-breasted wearing an assortment of briefs - and performed a frenetic dance before disappearing as quickly as they had appeared.|$|R
40|$|To {{transmit}} the drive, {{in form of}} rotation, produced during the combustion process in the cylinders to the gearbox, where it is transformed into different ratios, a coupling element is needed. This is {{the task of the}} clutch. The clutch is the part that enables a gear change. A disconnection between constantly-spinning crankshaft and the gearbox must be realized to be able to stand still as well as to change gears. Among many principles in design, the classical friction plate clutch has established it ` position in vehicle design. Especially, race car rules predict the use of conventional multi plate <b>clutches</b> (in some <b>cases</b> single plate <b>clutches</b> are also used) which transmit engine torque into the gearbox via friction. A traditional multi plate clutch is composed of three basic elements: the flywheel, the pressure plate and the clutch plates (in race car practice, 4 plates are the limit). The flywheel is attached {{to the end of the}} main crankshaft and the clutch plates are attached to the gearbox input shaft using a spline. When a axial load is applied to the assembly, the friction produced between plates prevents any rotation between them and a solid drive is established without any additional mechanical engagement. While a breakthrough was made with the new generation clutches in the 1980 `s, made with Carbon as friction material, the current situation in this field of the transmission is saturated. All inventions lead to some improvements in the general design field, where the main improvement happens in the whole concept of the transmission (DSG or CVT) ...|$|R
