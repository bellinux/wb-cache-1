40|$|Many {{utility systems}} {{in the world have}} power plants {{operating}} with fossil fuel. In the thermal power plants maximum requirements of fuel is a coal. The handling of this fuel is a great job. To handle the fuel, i. e., coal, each power station is equipped with a coal <b>handling</b> <b>plant.</b> Maintenance of Critical Equipments for Coal <b>Handling</b> <b>Plants</b> (CHP) of Thermal Power Stations is typical job. The failures of these equipments have led to high maintenance and operation costs. The reason for inspection depends on the component and its effect on plant operation. But one of the main systems of thermal power plant is coal-handling system. No such efforts are carried out to assess the life of coal <b>handling</b> <b>plant</b> component. To maintain an efficiently operating unit and avoid failure of critical equipment, it is necessary to maintain the critical parts of that equipment. There are varieties of critical equipments components in Coal <b>Handling</b> <b>Plants.</b> It is essential to identify the critical areas where failures are likely to occur and select suitable techniques for detection of such failures. Based on design criticality, past experience and previous failure information, suitable approach in inspection methodologies can be adopted. Maintenance of Coal crushing equipment of coal <b>handling</b> <b>plant</b> system in the thermal power plant is very important for Plant efficiency improvement...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of olive}} mill wastes (orujillo) within coal fired power {{stations}} in the UK has led to unexpected difficulties with material caking within the fuel <b>handling</b> <b>plant.</b> This study replicated orujillo caking on a laboratory scale using a planetary ball mill and explored the impact of mill parameters (speed, volume, and duration) on the caking phenomenon. The impact of orujillo composition was examined for 4 sections of fresh and dried orujillo (whole, pulp 0 - 850 µm, pulp 850 - 3350 µm, and cluster 3350 µm+) for set milling conditions. Caking was induced by heat generation within the mill and was most prevalent in the pulp section of orujillo. Caking was brought on by a glass transition step, which {{was measured to be}} around 97 - 98 °C for a moisture content of 6 - 7 % in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Caking {{was the result of the}} bulk moisture content (14 - 18 %) being higher than the standard moisture content of orujillo (< 12 %), and can be mitigated through drying. Thus the key to overcoming orujillo caking in fuel <b>handling</b> <b>plants</b> is through moisture content control. Additionally, as the caking issue is most prevalent in the pulp section, all fines below the required combustion particle size (typically < 1 mm) should be removed prior to comminution and sent directly to the burner. This would also reduce the comminution load by nearly 50 %, increase the energy potential of the fuel, and remove the most problematic section of orujillo from the fuel <b>handling</b> <b>plant...</b>|$|R

40|$|Collinsville Power Station is a 190 MW {{coal fired}} power station in Northern Queensland. The station {{consists}} of 5 generating units. Collinsville power station has been experiencing large problems with wet coal in its coal <b>handling</b> <b>plant.</b> These problems {{have led to}} a reduction in plant availability due to blockages. Wet coal {{with a high level of}} fines is adhesive and consequently sticks and builds up on items of plant. The blockages caused by wet coal can lead to generator unit trips. The identification and subsequent reduction or elimination of problems associated with wet coal is highly desirable as it would also result in a reduction in the number of unit trips and present a significant financial benefit to Collinsville Power Station as unit trips are a significant cost. A detailed review of the coal <b>handling</b> <b>plant</b> was carried out. Significant problems that were identified included the coal sampling, testing and reporting procedures as well as plant repairs and maintenance issues. It was found that particular items of plant were more susceptible to coal blockage. Part of the solution process was the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics to analyse coal flow within a specific item of plant. The review of the plant discovered numerous issues which need to be addressed so as to gain increased plant performance.
