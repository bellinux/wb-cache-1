50|$|Regarding {{the initial}} mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro {{reported}} to the king that they had found <b>cinnamon</b> <b>trees,</b> but {{that they could not}} be profitably harvested. In fact, true cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) is not native to South America.

The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.|$|R

The sticks are then rolled daily as they dry and are tied into bundles for trading and transport.|$|R

Also frequently eaten were the fruits of various <b>cinnamon</b> <b>trees,</b> Litsea, Neolitsea and Cryptocarya. Less important food were fruits of Ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata), Syzygium, and Vitex cofassus. They eat smaller fruit than some other fruit doves; the maximum recorded volume was 2.5 cm³; in a spherical fruit, a 1.7 cm diameter.|$|R
