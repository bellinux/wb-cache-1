This study aimed to establish {{an overview of the}} main actors of the sub-urban agriculture of Ouagadougou, their practices and expectations, and to characterize the used organic substrates (OS). For that, a farm survey was carried out on the most representative sites with 64 persons (<b>cereal</b> <b>farmers,</b> truckers and nurserymen) randomly chosen. OS were sampled with each actor, when available. Thus, 27 samples were taken and characterized through chemical analyses and laboratory incubations to follow organic carbon mineralization. The results highlighted that 35 % of <b>cereal</b> <b>farmers,</b> 69 % of truckers and 95 % of nurserymen were 20 to 40 years old, that a large proportion of <b>cereal</b> <b>farmers</b> and truckers were not sent to school while 70 % of nurserymen had at least primary education. Sub-urban agriculture was the only activity for 43 % of farmers, 83 % of truckers and 91 % of nurserymen. Moreover, 71 % of <b>cereal</b> <b>farmers</b> and 73 % of nurserymen used municipal wastes as source of organic matter against only 17 % of truckers, the majority of them using animal manures. The main criterion of choice of OS was their availability without any other consideration. Even if a large majority of the actors think that composts of OS were better than brut OS, a minority of them used currently composts. The best ways for an adoption and utilization of OS composts were to facilitate their accessibility and to promote these composts, composting techniques and their interests through advertising in mass media. Chemical analyses and laboratory incubations showed a great variability of the SUW, both in the same group and actors' groups. However, in case of total organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorous contents, the following tendencies were observed: Content(truckers) > Content(farmers) > Content(nurserymen). For the sum of major elements Ca, K, Mg, Na (SME), it was observed that SME(truckers) approximate to SME(farmers) > SME(nurserymen). In addition, except a few atypical substrates, OS used by nurserymen were largely stabilized compared to those of <b>cereal</b> <b>farmers</b> and truckers...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Disposal of large quantities of surplus straw, which lie in the fields after harvest, is a major annual problem to <b>cereal</b> <b>farmers.</b> The current preferred solution of burning the straw where it lies is environmentally unsatisfactory {{and appears to be}} a huge waste of a potentially valuable, renewable energy source. None of the currently available straw packaging systems provides an economically viable alternative. A process is proposed for producing industrial quality fuel briquettes using a tractor towed implement. The economic feasibility of such a system is investigated and comparisons are made with existing straw disposal methods. The projected cost of fuel, produced in this way, is compared with prevailing fossil fuel prices. A multistage continuous process machine concept is described and the various stages are proven workable both experimentally, in the laboratory, and analytically. Laboratory experiments determine the forces required to produce acceptable quality briquettes and comparisons are made between the power available from the tractor, the economical throughput rate and the energy consumed in the compaction process. The mechanism of bonding within the straw packages, under compression, is examined so that the parameters necessary to give the optimum machine design may be understood. The effect, on briquette quality, of variations in die shape within the constraints imposed by the machine concept is fully investigated. Experiments extend to compression at speeds representative of 'live' field operation and a die shape is developed which produces packages of consistently good durability. Many of the design ideas put forward in this thesis have now been incorporated in an original prototype machine, built and successfully field-tested by the company who has supported this project and now holds the relevant patents...|$|R

Development practitioners, researchers, and policy makers alike could benefit from prior insight into what interventions or environmental shocks might differentially affect farmers' food security status, {{in order to move}} towards more informed and equitable development. We examined the food security status and livelihood activities of 269 smallholder farm households (HHs) in Bihar, India. Proceeding with a four-step analysis, we first applied a multivariate statistical methodology to differentiate five primary farming system types. We next applied an indicator of food security in the form of HH potential food availability (PFA), and examined the contribution of crop, livestock, and on- and off-farm income generation to PFA within each farm HH type. Lastly, we applied scenario analysis to examine the potential impact of the adoption of ‘climate smart’ agricultural (CSA) practices in the form of conservation agriculture (CA) and improved livestock husbandry, and environmental shocks on HH PFA. Our results indicate that compared to livestock interventions, CA may hold considerable potential to boost HH PFA, though primarily for wealthier and medium-scale <b>cereal</b> <b>farmers.</b> These farm HH types were however considerably more vulnerable to food insecurity risks resulting from simulated drought, while part-time farmers and resource-poor agricultural laborers generating income from off-farm pursuits were comparatively less vulnerable, due in part to their more diversified income sources and potential to migrate in search of work. Our results underscore the importance of prior planning for development initiatives aimed at increasing smallholder food security while maintaining social equity, while providing a robust methodology to vet the implications of agricultural interventions on an ex ante basis.

40|$|Effective {{solutions}} for integrating agricultural development and conservation of biodiversity at the landscape scale {{remain to be}} identified. We present {{a case study in}} an intensively farmed French cereal plain, where the reintroduction of grasslands has been proposed first for conservation purposes {{in order to protect the}} Little Bustard, a highly threatened bird species. Monitoring the effects of grassland “experimental” implementation revealed other beneficial effects on virtually all components of the trophic web in these agroecosystems, particularly at the landscape level. Indeed, in intensive cereal systems, perennial habitats such as grasslands are radically different from annual crops in terms of level and frequency of disturbance (plowing, planting, spraying etc.). In these highly fragmented and disturbed habitats, the presence, abundance and distribution of grasslands therefore have a critical role in ecological and environmental regulatory processes. We provide evidence that grasslands, particularly alfalfa, are the support of many ecosystem services, such as pollination, biological control, in addition to forage production. To maximize their provision, it is critical to rationalize the inclusion of grasslands in the cropping system (in time, space and according to management practices). However, currently, grasslands are severely depleted by <b>farmers</b> who privilege <b>cereal</b> crops for economic reasons (including CAP subsidies). We therefore raise the issue of whether crop allocation at the landscape scale can be changed without public funding, in order to increase the proportion of grasslands. In other words, how to overcome the reluctance of <b>cereal</b> <b>farmers</b> to produce forage crop? A solution explored here is to identify the interdependencies between farmers related to the ecosystem services grasslands provide at the landscape scale. The recognition of grassland emergent functions when considered at the landscape scale gives them a status of common good: a good that should be collectively managed to maximize ecosystem services. This consideration leads to involve new stakeholders such as citizens, scientists, government bodies or NGOs in the collective management of grasslands and opens an innovative way to reconcile agriculture and conservation at the landscape scale...|$|R

40|$|After the Second World War, the United Kingdom has {{realized}} a {{great progress}} in cereal production. Two factors {{are related to}} this progress: one is high prices of cereals {{and the other is}} technical advances in cereal production such as the breeding of new varieties of crops, the development of new fertilizers and chemicals, and the improvement of various kinds of farm machinery. High prices of <b>cereals</b> gave <b>farmers</b> much incentive to introduce improved methods of cereal production. An attention should be given to herbicides because they made it easy to adopt continuous cereal cropping by reducing greatly labour input for weeding. Continuous cropping of cereals, however, was suffered from various plant diseases. Pesticides got rid of some, but not all. Another means of disease control was to plant one of the crops other than cereals like oilseed rape on the field after harvesting cereal. Those crops are called break crops. With them, the diseases of cereal crops have been controlled fairly well. The {{purpose of this study is}} to trace the changes in cropping systems on cereal farms and to make clear the features of intensification of cereal farming in England. The date analysed are based on the annual “Report of Farming in the Eastern Counties of England” published by the University of Cambridge and the duration observed ranges for 26 years, 1967 - 92. The study shows that the basic cropping system on cereal farms in the Eastern counties changed twice: first, in the middle of 1970 s and secondly, the middle of 1980 s. From 1960 s to the middle of 1970 s, the area planted to cereals, especially to barley, increased rapidly, but the area planted to non-cereal crops decreased. As for barely, the improved varieties of winter barley increased in acreage. A continuous cereal cropping was tried first on barley. Field peas and beans were main break crops at that time. From the end of 1970 s to the middle of 1980 s, a sharp increase was observed in the area planted to winter wheat and oilseed rape. The continuous cereal cropping was tried on wheat with improved herbicides and pesticides. Incidentally, the prices of oilseeds and beans and peas, protein contained feed for livestock, were supported by the CAP after the embargo on soybeans by the United States in 1973. This price support increased the cultivation of those break crops, especially oilseed rape. Since the middle of 1980 s, the acreage of break crops has increased, but that of cereals has decreased. This decrease is due mainly to the measures against the overproduction of cereals and other products. The agricultural stabilizers and set-asides, new instruments of the CAP, are included in the measures. Since agreement in the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations in 1993, the prices of cereals and break crops are expected to be reduced closer to world market levels. The <b>cereal</b> <b>farmers</b> will face in the future a considerable decline in net farm incomes. The ways to meet it will be to enlarge the size of their farms and/or to intensify their farming. Those ways are, however, likely to accelerate ill effects on the environment. Taking the environment into consideration, the reorganisation of cereal farming by making use of break crops with less application of herbicides and pesticides is desirable. イギリス東部の穀作経営をとりあげ, 中断作物を利用した穀物連作を含む穀作の集約化を伺った. 穀物と中断作物との交代のパターン(作付方式) は経済的な状況に対応して変化している. 1960 年代から 1970 年代中頃にかけては小麦の作付が大きく伸びていったが, 穀作では大麦の連作が行われ, 中断作物としては飼料用のマメ類が中心であった. たまたま, 1973 年にアメリカの大豆禁輸がおこり, これに対処するために油糧種子や蛋自作物に対して価格支持政策が取られるようになってからは, これらの作物が中断作物として作付が増加していった. 特にナタネは, 収益性の高い作物として 70 年代以降作付が急増し, 80 年代には中断作物の中心となった. しかし, 価格が抑さえられるようになった 1980 年代後半以降, 収益面での有利性は低くなりつつある. 作付方式は, 1970 年代中頃と 1980 年代中頃に転換点が見られる. 1970 年代後半に入ると小麦を中心とする穀物連作が拡大し始め, 1980 年代中頃になると収益性の低下を反映して穀物の作付率は低下し始め, それを補うようにナタネを中心とする中断作物の作付が増加している. 80 年代に入ると, どの作物でも実質粗利益は低下しているが, 穀物よりも主な中断作物であるエンドウやナタネの方が低下の度合いが大きい. 従来, 中断作物は穀作の減収分を補うという意味を持っていたが, その収益性の低下は穀作経営の収益性を一層, 低下せしめている. また, GATTのウルグアイ・ラウンド合意によって, 穀物と中断作物の価格は, 国際的な価格水準にまで引き下げられることになった. そのため, 穀物と中断作物の収益性は低下せざるを得なくなっている. こうして, 穀作経営の単位面積あたりの収益性は低下しつつある. 80 年代までは耕地面積を拡大することで経営を維持してきたが, 集約的な大規模経営に対しては環境保全の面から批判が加えられがちであり(景観や伝統的な生垣の保全など), また薬剤を多用する栽培方法も批判を受けている. 他方, 農産物の価格が低く抑さえられている現在では薬剤購入費の増加は経済的にも経営を苦しくするものとなっている. このような状況のもと, 穀作経営は, 今後, 穀物連作を継続する場合, 中断作物を活用した雑草防除や病害の抑制が諜題となる...|$|R
