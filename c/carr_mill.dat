5000|$|Both <b>Carr's</b> <b>Mill</b> and New Cut {{landfill}} were reaching {{capacity in}} the early 1970s. With the approval and construction of the Rouse Company development Columbia, {{the population of the}} county would quadruple while the landfill was in operation. County executive Edward L. Cochran was already starting the controversial process of selection of a new site, when <b>Carr's</b> <b>Mill</b> became a site of hazardous waste dumping by Western Electric in 1976. Howard County spent millions of dollars to cap the landfill and dispose of hazardous materials after contamination of groundwater on the site. In July 1976, a anonymous tip stated that Francis [...] "sonny" [...] Bohager was bribed $250 from F.P.R Bohager & Sons Inc of Fells Point to allow hazardous waste onsite. Police intercepted two Bohager trucks dumping 101 barrels hazardous materials from Farboil Paint Co. on Key Highway and Western Electric Company by the service road of <b>Carr's</b> <b>Mill.</b> Western Electric had contracted the company to haul 2,700 barrels of hazardous waste in 1976. In July 1976, police reported barrels of hazardous waste were reported to be found buried at the landfill, but were not investigated further. In December, a task force selecting new landfill sites offered <b>Carrs</b> <b>Mill</b> as a site for landfill consolidation for Western Howard County before shipment out of county which was only implemented at the historic Trinity Church property in Elkridge. <b>Carrs</b> <b>Mill</b> ceased operations in 1977.|$|R

5000|$|In 1974, the Carrboro Board of Aldermen {{voted to}} have the {{building}} torn down to build a shopping mall on the site. [...] In light of community opposition to the plan the idea was scrapped and the mill complex was renovated and reopened as <b>Carr</b> <b>Mill</b> Mall. [...] The complex now houses numerous restaurants and stores as well as commercial office space on its upper levels.

5000|$|The namesake millhouse was {{situated}} on the northern portion of an estate, near the intersection of modern Bushy Park Road and <b>Carrs</b> <b>Mill</b> Road. <b>Carr's</b> <b>Mill</b> {{is part of the}} original estate of Charles Alexander Warfield. Warfield married Elizebeth Ridgley of Laurel in 1771 and settled in a log home at [...] "Bushy Park" [...] in Glenwood, Maryland. The same year he started construction on his slave plantation manor home. The property later was owned by the [...] "Hammond" [...] family of the Major Charles Family line. The manor stood for over 150 years, burning in 1933 and demolished in 1947. A new house was built over the original foundation. In 1978 the property was purchased by the Clevenger family and had been subdivided down to 342 acres, but was still actively farmed. In 1983 it had been subdivided down to a 190 acre parcel named [...] "Bushy Park Farm" [...] and sold again. A portion of the original estate became the <b>Carr's</b> <b>mill</b> landfill. Warfield is buried at Bushy Park. The walled cemetery remains, but the majority of the 1300 acre farm has been redeveloped as the Western Regional Park, operated by Howard County.|$|R

Howard County's first landfill was New Cut in Ellicott City, Maryland which operated from 1944-1980. Alpha Ridge Landfill operated between 1980-1997 before the county switched to offsite waste disposal.|$|R
50|$|Once {{simply a}} mill pond built to power <b>Carr’s</b> <b>Mill,</b> this was hugely {{expanded}} in the 1750s to provide {{water to the}} Sankey Navigation, (Sankey Canal), about a mile away. The lake is a firm favourite, busy with anglers and water sports enthusiasts. It {{is also a great}} place for birdwatchers—herons, great crested grebes, coots and various species of duck and gull can be found here.|$|R
50|$|During {{the course}} of 2006, some local {{residents}} expressed annoyance at new rules stating that all performances on the market lawn must have signed permission in advance from the owners of <b>Carr</b> <b>Mill</b> Mall. The lawn area consistently holds events and entertainment.|$|E
5000|$|The song [...] "Freight Train" [...] by Elizabeth 'Libba" [...] Cotten is {{inspired}} by the train that ran on the State University Railroad spur past her house on Lloyd St, and served the needs of <b>Carr</b> <b>Mill.</b> Cotten wrote the song in the early 1900s, as a young teenager.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Franklin Lloyd (1 February 1841 - 24 May 1911) {{is one of}} {{the founders}} of Carrboro, North Carolina. He was a {{prominent}} North Carolina industrialist who built the Alberta Cotton Mill in 1898 in Carrboro; the former factory building is now home to the <b>Carr</b> <b>Mill</b> Mall.|$|E
50|$|Agricultural based {{industries}} include BOCM Pauls {{who have}} a large animal feed mill on the Penrith Industrial Estate and until 2005 there was another Feed Mill at Gilwilly originally belonging to Cumberland and Westmorland Farmers Ltd but eventually {{becoming part of the}} <b>Carrs</b> <b>Milling</b> Industries group. Local butchers Cranstons have an expanding meat packing, pies and sandwich manufacturing site alongside their shop and head office on Ullswater Road.|$|R
50|$|Freight traffic, {{which had}} {{done well in}} wartime, notably because {{it was on the}} north west coast, was {{following}} the pattern {{of the rest of the}} country - in decline. There was insufficient shunting to justify keeping the small locoshed open after 6 July 1953 and erstwhile staple business such as flour traffic from <b>Carr's</b> <b>Mill</b> fell from £7000 to £100 per month, the business being lost to road competition.|$|R
50|$|This {{stretch of}} the Goyt, shares much of it history with Stockport whose textile {{tradition}} started with the silk industry in the late 17th century. By the 18th century the manufacture of silk was dominating the economic life of the town. Large silk <b>mills,</b> such as <b>Carrs</b> <b>Mill,</b> Park Mill and Adlington Square Mill, became the major employers of the town. By 1769 nearly 2,000 people were employed in the town's silk trade. In 1772 the silk industry was in depression and the town turned to cotton. Stockport was very late in embracing the joint stock limited liability company boom. The first mill to be financed by that method was Vernon Mill.|$|R
50|$|In 1909, Carr {{purchased}} the Alberta Cotton Mill from Thomas F. Lloyd {{in what was}} then called West End, North Carolina, by Chapel Hill. After agreeing to extend electricity to the town, it was named Carrboro in honor of him. In the 1970s, the mill was restored and opened as <b>Carr</b> <b>Mill</b> Mall.|$|E
5000|$|The {{section of}} line from Huyton to St Helens was opened on 1 November 1871 by the London and North Western Railway, {{the line from}} St Helens to Wigan having been opened two years earlier on 1 December 1869 by the Lancashire Union Railway. The line is double-tracked from its {{junction}} with the Liverpool - Manchester line at Huyton to its junction with the West Coast Main Line at Ince Moss, although originally the section from <b>Carr</b> <b>Mill</b> to Ince Moss was four-tracked to accommodate the freight traffic from the numerous collieries on this section. In later years following colliery closures, the two freight tracks were lifted. This can still be evidenced from {{the width of the}} bridges on this part of the line ( [...] indeed the size of <b>Carr</b> <b>Mill</b> Viaduct was physically halved although the almost adjacent bridge over the A580 East Lancashire Road remains intact with four track width).|$|E
50|$|After being {{divided into}} two townships, Billinge Chapel End and Billinge Higher End in the Wigan Poor Law Union, in 1872 Billinge Local Board of Health was {{established}} for the area of these two townships and two detached parts of Winstanley township (one known as Blackley Hurst and the other situated in the <b>Carr</b> <b>Mill</b> area, both lying within the area of Billinge Chapel End township).|$|E
5000|$|Howard County has adapted {{a number}} of uses to {{capitalize}} on the long term liability of managing a landfill site. The County did not rename the landfill as a park for residential development marketing like the <b>Carr's</b> <b>Mill</b> landfill site, but it did lay out over a dozen unusable dirt streets across the site to camouflage its use on street maps with names like [...] "main street", [...] "manor lane", [...] "3rd ave", [...] "wind drive", [...] "river country drive", [...] "howard drive", [...] "back road".|$|R
25|$|Four of {{the halls}} (Charles Morris Hall, Henry Price Building, Ellerslie Hall and Lyddon Hall) {{are on the}} campus, while other halls and self-catering {{accommodation}} are located throughout the city. Bodington Hall is approximately four miles north-west of the campus, Devonshire Hall is situated around half a mile off the main campus, and other accommodation includes <b>Carr</b> <b>Mills,</b> Clarence Dock, James Baillie Park, Leodis Residences, Lupton Residences, Montague Burton Residences, North Hill Court, Opal 3 Residences, Oxley Residences, Sentinel Towers, The Tannery, Shimmin, St Marks Residences and Canal Mills.|$|R
5000|$|Cooper {{was born}} in Windsor County, Vermont on April 20, 1821. He studied three years (1840-43) at Wesleyan University, but left during his senior year. In 1844 he moved to Illinois, then in May 1845 to Spring Prairie, Wisconsin, where he ran a {{pharmacy}} and studied medicine under Dr. Jesse <b>Carr</b> <b>Mills</b> of that town, eventually going into medical practice with Mills. He married Persi E. Allen of Spring Prairie, who was a niece of Mills. Henry (called [...] "Hal" [...] in his youth) was born September 8, 1850, {{the first of what}} would eventually be six children, and their only son.|$|R
