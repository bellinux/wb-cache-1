5000|$|On July 6, 1996, Delta Air Lines Flight 1288, an MD-88, {{attempting}} {{to take off}} from Pensacola Regional Airport experienced an uncontained, catastrophic turbine engine failure that caused debris from the front <b>compressor</b> <b>hub</b> of the number one left engine to penetrate the left aft fuselage. The penetrating debris left two passengers dead and two severely injured; all were from the same family. The pilot aborted takeoff and the airplane stopped on the runway.|$|E
50|$|Delta Air Lines Flight 1288 was a {{regularly}} scheduled flight from Pensacola, Florida to Atlanta, Georgia on a McDonnell Douglas MD-88 equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 turbofan engines. During the flight's takeoff roll from runway 17 at Pensacola on July 6, 1996, the aircraft experienced an uncontained, catastrophic turbine engine failure that caused {{debris from the}} front <b>compressor</b> <b>hub</b> of the number one left engine to penetrate the left aft fuselage. The impact left two passengers dead and two severely injured; the two dead were a mother and son. The pilot aborted takeoff and the airplane stopped on the runway. Three other passengers sustained minor injuries during the emergency evacuation. Most of the passengers were traveling on vacation.|$|E
40|$|Distortion {{effects of}} the {{following}} model additions or changes were studied: (1) constant-area mixing lengths {{at the end of}} the subsonic diffuser, (2) screens with systematic variations in mesh and flow-area blockage, (3) bleeds slots on the inlet cowl, and (4) a simulated <b>compressor</b> <b>hub.</b> Data at a diffuser-exit Mach number of 0. 36 are compared with data of a similar study at Mach 0. 20. At the higher Mach number, the same length of constant-area mixing was less effective in reducing total-pressure distortions, while the use of screens was more effective...|$|E
25|$|Delta Air Lines Flight 1288: a McDonnell Douglas MD-88 {{flying from}} Pensacola, Florida to Atlanta in 1996 had a cracked <b>compressor</b> rotor <b>hub</b> failure {{on one of}} its Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 engines. 2 died.|$|R
50|$|After a total investigation, the NTSB {{determined}} the most probable {{cause of the}} accident was a fracture in the left engine's front <b>compressor</b> fan <b>hub,</b> which resulted from failure of the airline's fluorescent penetrant inspection process to detect a potentially dangerous crack in the fan which originated from the engine's initial manufacture. The NTSB also attributed the accident {{to the failure of}} Delta's maintenance team to discover the problem.|$|R
40|$|This report gives a short {{description}} of the closed circuit test facility available at Aachen Technical University in the Department of Jet Propulsion and Turbomachines. Using this test facility different geometrics of Supersonic/Transonic axial flow <b>compressors</b> with <b>hub</b> to tip ratio upto 0. 5 would be tested. Freon-Air mixture(85 : 15 in concentration) {{was chosen as the}} working medium to avoid strength problems occuring at high speed. Freon regeneration unit which works online with the closed circuit is incorporated in the test facility. Supersonic and Subsonic five hole probes are used for measuring the detailed flow upstream and downstream of the rotor and stator. A modified Schlieren technique was developed to measure the unsteady flow downstream of the rotor and within the stator. The whole test data are evaluated by an electronic data processing system...|$|R
40|$|Extensive testing {{done on a}} T 55 -L- 712 {{turboshaft}} engine compressor in a compressor test rig is being followed by engine tests in progress {{as part of the}} Army Non-Recoverable Stall Program. Goals include a greater understanding of the gas turbine engine start cycle and compressor/engine operation in the regions 'beyond' the normal compressor stall line (rotating stall/surge). Rig steady state instrumentation consisted of 497 steady state pressure sensors and 153 temperature sensors. Engine instrumentation was placed in similar radial/axial locations and consists of 122 steady state pressure sensors and 65 temperature sensors. High response rig instrumentation consisted of 34 wall static pressure transducers. Rig and engine high response pressure transducers were located in the same axial/radial/circumferential locations in front of the first three stages. Additional engine high response instrumentation was placed in mach probes in front of the engine and on the <b>compressor</b> <b>hub.</b> This instrumentation allows for the generation of detailed stage characteristics, overall compressor mapping, and detailed analysis of dynamic compressor events...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation has}} been performed to study hub corner stall phenomena in compressor blade rows. Three-dimensional flows in a subsonic annular compressor stator {{and in a}} transonic compressor rotor have been analyzed numerically by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical results and the existing experimental data are interrogated to understand the mechanism of <b>compressor</b> <b>hub</b> comer stall. Both the measurements and the numerical solutions for the stator indicate that a strong twister-like vortex is formed near the rear part of the blade suction surface. Low-momentum fluid inside the hub boundary layer is transported toward the suction side of the blade by this vortex. On the blade suction surface near the hub, this vortex forces fluid to move against the main flow direction and a limiting stream surface is formed near the hub. The formation of this vortex is the main mechanism of hub corner stall. When the aerodynamic loading is increased, the vortex initiates further upstream, which results in a larger corner stall region. For the transonic compressor rotor studied in this paper, the numerical solution indicates that a mild hub corner stall exists at 100 percent rotor speed. The hub corner stall, however, disappears at the reduced blade loading, which occurs at 60 percent rotor design speed. The present study demonstrates that hub comer stall {{is caused by a}} three-dimensional vortex system and that {{it does not seem to}} be correlated with a simple diffusion factor for the blade row...|$|E
30|$|Gbadebo et al. [24, 25], {{investigated}} the natural of 3 D separations in axial compressors; {{based on the}} insights gained regarding the formation of separations, typical <b>compressor</b> stator <b>hub</b> corner 3 D separation was controlled and eliminated by boundary layer suction by up to 0.7 % of the inlet mass flow [26]. Experimental investigation was also performed to confirm {{the removal of the}} separated region from the blade suction surface. The results indicated that the blade exhibits increased loading, enhanced averaged static pressure rise, and uniform exit flow. Chen et al. [27] performed active control of corner separation by boundary layer suction and {{investigated the}} influence of the location of the endwall suction slot. Cao et al. [28] investigated partial span suction on the suction surface of a diffusion cascade, and then removed both the trailing edge separation and corner separation through coupled suction surface and endwall suction.|$|R
5000|$|Produced by Volvo Aero (now GKN Aerospace Engine Systems), the RM12 is a {{derivative}} of the General Electric F404-400. Changes {{from the standard}} F404 includes greater reliability for single-engine operations (including more stringent birdstrike protection), increased thrust, and {{the adoption of a}} full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system. Several subsystems and components were also redesigned to reduce maintenance demands. [...] The air intakes of the engine were designed to minimize radar reflection from the compression fan, reducing the radar cross section of the aircraft overall. The F404's analogue Engine Control Unit was replaced with the Digital Engine Control - jointly developed by Volvo and GE - which communicates with the cockpit through the digital data buses and, as redundancy, mechanical calculators controlled by a single wire will regulate the fuel-flow into the engine. These mechanical backup systems remain in the new Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) which Volvo began developing in 1996. General Electric produces 50% of the engine. Elements such as the fan/compressor discs and case, <b>compressor</b> spool, <b>hubs,</b> seals, and afterburner are manufactured in Sweden, final assembly also taking place there.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the magnitude of}} the relative wall speed on the performance of an annular <b>compressor</b> cascade with <b>hub</b> clearance is examined. Five-hole probe measurements, conducted at the inlet and outlet of the cascade, are used to derive blade performance characteristics, in the form of loss and turning distributions. Characteristics are presented in the form of circumferentially mass-averaged profiles, whereas distributions on the exit plane provide information useful to interpret the performance of the blading. Four different rotational speeds of the hub have been examined, giving the possibility to observe the dependence of performance characteristics on hub rotational speed. Increasing the rotational speed is found to improve the performance of the cascade by decreasing losses in the clearance region, while it affects the flow in the entire passage...|$|R
40|$|Interstage data {{recorded}} on a J 85 - 13 engine {{were used to}} analyze the internal flow of the compressor. Measured pressures and temperatures were used as input to a streamline analysis program to calculate the velocity diagrams at the inlet and outlet of each blade row. From the velocity diagrams and blade geometry, selected blade-element performance parameters were calculated. From the detailed analysis it is concluded that the <b>compressor</b> is probably <b>hub</b> critical (stall initiates at the hub) in the latter stages for the design speed conditions. As a result, the casing treatment over the blade tips has little or no effect on stall margin at design speed. Radial inlet distortion did not appear to change the flow in the stages that control stall because of the rapid attenuation of the distortion within the compressor...|$|R
