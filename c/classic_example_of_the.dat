5|$|Coke became {{involved}} in the now classic Shelley's Case in 1581, which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today; the case also established Coke's reputation as an attorney and case reporter. His next famous case was Chudleigh's Case, a dispute over the interpretation of the Statute of Uses, followed by Slade's Case, a dispute between the Common Pleas and King's Bench over assumpsit now regarded as a <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> friction between the two courts and the forward movement of contract law; Coke's argument in Slade's Case formed the first definition of consideration.|$|E

25|$|Antithrombin {{begins in}} its native state, {{which has a}} higher free energy {{compared}} to the latent state, which it decays to on average after 3 days. The latent state has the same form as the activated state - that is, when it is inhibiting thrombin.

25|$|The seven-story Masonic Temple Building was {{designed}} by South Carolina architect Charles McMillan and built by Carolina Construction Co. Upon completion, the building was praised for its innovative construction due {{to the use of}} reinforced concrete, a new concept in building materials. The design is a conservative and <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tri-partite skyscraper composition developed by Louis Sullivan. The first three floors are covered with Indiana limestone. The rest of the building consists of light brick ornamented with terra cotta.|$|E

25|$|The {{geometry}} of the Crystal Palace was a <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept of form following manufacturer's limitations- the shape {{and size of the}} whole building was directly based around the size of the panes of glass made by the supplier, Chance Brothers of Smethwick. These were the largest available at the time, measuring 10 inches wide by 49 inches long. Because the entire building was scaled around those dimensions, it meant that nearly the whole outer surface could be glazed using millions of identical panes, thereby drastically reducing both their production cost and the time needed to install them.|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{to atone}} for his past wrongdoings, Matsuōmaru plots to save Kan Shūsai's life, {{at the cost of}} that of his own son, Kotarō. He sends Kotarō to the school, where Genzō and Tonami decide he is the only one at the school whose head could pass for Kan Shūsai's. This scene is a <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{conflict}} between giri (honor, fealty) and ninjō (human compassion), as Genzō and Tonami sacrifice an innocent boy to save their master's son. When the sound of Genzō's sword striking off Kotarō's head is heard from offstage, Matsuōmaru strikes a distinctive Matsuō mie pose, expressing his suppressed anguish. He then departs with the head in a box, to identify it for Shihei as Kan Shūsai's head, pretending to have done the deed and thus saving Kan Shūsai's life.|$|E
25|$|The Clarence Moore House is a <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beaux Arts {{architectural}} style and features a Louis XV-style exterior. The -story structure includes a basement and comprises brick walls, a concrete floor, and a steel roof. The building measures 79.5 feet (24.2m) in height {{and the walls}} are made of Roman brick. A limestone Tuscan entablature with a bracket cornice separate {{the third and fourth}} floors. The building's north entrance on Massachusetts Avenue has a 6x6foot (1.8x1.8m) stoop flanked by limestone balustrades. Above the entrance and ground floor windows are limestone corbels and guttae. The corbels support limestone second floor balconies and a vase balustrade. The third floor balconies are made of limestone and feature cast iron railings. The second, third, and fourth floor window and architraves are set in a quoined limestone ground. Six limestone chimneys, capped with Tusance entablature, are visible from the ground level. Two chimneys are located at the front and back of the house and a chimney is located on the eastern and western sides. The slate mansard roof has a limestone and metal ridge.|$|E

25|$|As for the {{required}} vocal {{range of the}} title role, it is an extraordinary case: The highest note is the high B5, not irregular for a soprano or mezzo-soprano to sing, while the lowest note is a low G3, in the contralto range and officially below the standard range for a mezzo-soprano. Considering this range, {{which is similar to}} many mezzo roles (such as Carmen and Amneris), one might assume that a high soprano is not essential to the piece, but it is; most of the relatively low sopranos who attempted this role found themselves straining their voices throughout the opera, and having reached the closing scene (the {{most important part of the}} opera for the title role) were very fatigued. This role is the <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difference between tessitura and absolute vocal range: While mezzos can perform a high note (like Carmen), or even temporarily sustain a high tessitura, it is impossible for a singer to spend such a long time (with the needed strength and breath-control) in the second octave above the middle C unless she is a high soprano. Moreover, the low G occurs twice in the opera, and in both cases it is in pianissimo—more of a theatrical effect than music—and can be growled instead of sung. The other low notes required are no lower than low A, and they are also quiet.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "magical girl" [...] character, {{of which}} Belldandy is an example, {{typically}} combines powerful abilities with very feminine characteristics. For Western audiences, a comparison {{can be drawn}} with the characters of Samantha Stephens from Bewitched and Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie. As such, Belldandy is depicted as being very sweet and exceptionally kind-hearted, with very [...] "old-fashioned" [...] sensibilities. Combined with domestic skills portrayed through the series and her loyalty to Keiichi, this makes her a <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept of Yamato Nadeshiko.|$|E

Novelist Dan Wakefield, writing in The Atlantic, says Satin {{grew up in a}} small city in northern Minnesota like Bob Dylan but did not have a guitar to express himself with. According to historian Frank Kusch, the seeds for rebellion were planted when Satin's parents moved him at age 16 from liberal Minnesota to still-segregated Texas.|$|E

[...] The [...] "after-strain" [...] {{comes at the}} final stanza; the composer and Schubert scholar Brian Newbould observed that for three-quarters of the song's final stanza, Schubert departed from the strophe to give a musical impression of the trout being caught, but returned to the strophe for the final couplet. The primary rhythmic figure in the piano accompaniment suggests {{the movement of the}} fish in the water. When the fisherman catches the trout, the vocal line changes from major to minor, the piano figuration becomes darker and the flowing phrases are [...] "broken by startled rests".
