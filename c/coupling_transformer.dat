50|$|Each tuned RF stage {{consists}} of an amplifying device, a triode (or in later sets a tetrode) vacuum tube, and a tuned circuit which performs the filtering function. The tuned circuit consisted of an air-core RF <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer</b> which also served to couple the signal from the plate circuit of one tube to the input grid circuit of the next tube. One of the windings of the transformer had a variable capacitor connected across it to make a tuned circuit.

Comparison is also done with individual Static Synchronous Series Compensators (SSSCs), one on each line of a two line system {{and the results are}} compared with the previous one. MATLAB with Simulink and SIM POWER SYSTEMS tools are used for simulation of Transmission lines and IPFC in open loop and closed loop configurations. A common DC link within the IPFC is able to facilitate real power transfer among the lines of the transmission system. Also each inverter can provide reactive power compensation independently. IPFC is developed with the objective of balancing real and reactive power flow among multi-lines and to transfer power from overloaded to under loaded lines. Second objective of IPFC is to compensate against reactive voltage drops and the corresponding reactive line power, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the compensating system against dynamic disturbances.

50|$|In more {{sophisticated}} crystal receivers, the tuning coil is replaced with an adjustable air core antenna <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer</b> which improves the selectivity by {{a technique called}} loose coupling. This consists of two magnetically coupled coils of wire, one (the primary) attached to the antenna and ground and the other (the secondary) attached {{to the rest of}} the circuit. The current from the antenna creates an alternating magnetic field in the primary coil, which induced a current in the secondary coil which was then rectified and powered the earphone. Each of the coils functions as a tuned circuit; the primary coil resonated with the capacitance of the antenna (or sometimes another capacitor), and the secondary coil resonated with the tuning capacitor. Both the primary and secondary were tuned to the frequency of the station. The two circuits interacted to form a resonant transformer.|$|E
50|$|A single bus {{consists}} of a wire pair with 70-85 Ω impedance at 1 MHz. Where a circular connector is used, its center pin {{is used for the}} high (positive) Manchester bi-phase signal. Transmitters and receivers couple to the bus via isolation transformers, and stub connections branch off using a pair of isolation resistors and, optionally, a <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer.</b> This reduces the impact of a short circuit and ensures that the bus does not conduct current through the aircraft. A Manchester code is used to present both clock and data on the same wire pair and to eliminate any DC component in the signal (which cannot pass the transformers). The bit rate is 1.0 megabit per second (1 bit per μs). The combined accuracy and long-term stability of the bit rate is only specified to be within ±0.1%; the short-term clock stability must be within ±0.01%. The peak-to-peak output voltage of a transmitter is 18-27 V.|$|E

40|$|The Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is an {{efficient}} series voltage regulator {{which increases the}} electrical grids power quality. Nevertheless, this device composed of a <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer</b> and a Voltage Source Converter (VSC) needs a power electronics protection scheme against high faults electrical grids currents.

30|$|When {{the line}} {{impedance}} is {{considered in the}} microgrid, the accuracy of load sharing will decrease. In this paper, the impact of line impedance on the accuracy of load sharing is analyzed. A robust droop control for a high-voltage microgrid is proposed based on the signal detection on the high-voltage side of the <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer.</b> For a high-voltage microgrid, the equivalent impedance of <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer</b> connecting distributed generator with the grid is usually the dominate factor. Compared with the conventional droop control strategy, the proposed control method in this paper detects the feedback signal from the high-voltage side of the <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer.</b> The impact of line impedance on the load sharing accuracy can be mitigated significantly. The proposed droop control only changes the detection point of the feedback signal, thus {{it is easy to}} be implemented. The PSCAD/EMTDC simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed robust droop control concept in load sharing and voltage regulation with highly accuracy.|$|E
3000|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  4, {{in order to}} achieve a highly load sharing {{accuracy}} with the robust droop control, the common bus voltage and power of each DG flowing into a concentrated load have to be detected. Thus, this kind of droop control concept is only suitable for the microgrid with concentrated loads. Also, the transmission process of feedback signals for a long-distance may also challenge the load sharing accuracy and reliability of microgrids. According to the analysis in Section  2, the equivalent impedance of <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer</b> is generally much larger than the line impedance for a high-voltage microgrid, namely X Ti  >>X Li, so V Ti [...] is much close to V. Thus, it is possible to applied robust power droop control by detecting V Ti [...] at the high-voltage side of step-up <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer</b> without communication devices and instead of AC common bus voltage V.|$|E
30|$|Reference [8] {{proposed}} a robust droop {{control and the}} robustness of the voltage output and load sharing accuracy could be enhanced obviously. However, it is only suitable for the centralized microgrid with communication equipment. Besides, a virtual impedance unit added in control loop should be bigger enough so {{that the effect of}} line impedance can be omitted, which is complex and limited to its application. Nowadays, the high-voltage large scale microgrid for campus and island {{are most likely to be}} developed [18, 19]. In these kinds of microgrids, DGs are always connected to the utility grid by a step-up <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer.</b> As the equivalent impedance of the <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer</b> is usually much larger than that of the line, in this sense, the effect of line impedance may be negligible. If the load sharing error caused by the equivalent impedance of transformer can be eliminated, the performance of microgrids can also be improved obviously.|$|E
