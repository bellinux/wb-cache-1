2500|$|In April 2010 Clarke {{released}} {{his book on}} <b>Cyber</b> <b>War.</b> In April 2012, Clarke wrote a New York Times op-ed addressing cyber attacks. In stemming cyber attacks carried out by foreign governments and foreign hackers, particularly from China, Clarke opined that the U.S. government should be authorized to [...] "create a major program to grab stolen data leaving the country" [...] in a fashion similar to how the U.S. Department of Homeland Security currently searches for child pornography that crosses America's [...] "virtual borders." [...] Moreover, he suggested that the US president could authorize agencies to scan Internet traffic outside the US and seize sensitive files stolen from within the United States. Clarke then stated that such a policy would not endanger privacy rights through the institution of a privacy advocate, who could stop abuses or any activity that went beyond halting the theft of important files. The op-ed did not offer evidence that finding and blocking files while they are being transmitted is technically feasible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The period {{leading to}} Zimbabwe’s {{elections}} in July 2013, is remembered for the <b>cyber</b> <b>wars</b> pitting Facebook characters Baba Jukwa and Amai Jukwa. Both characters joined Facebook in March 2013, with Amai Jukwa {{being the first}} to appear. Both characters still existed {{at the time of}} authoring this paper although the frequency and significance of their Facebook posts had largely diminished. Edmund Kudzayi, editor of the state controlled Sunday Mail and his brother Phillip were, in 2014 arrested on suspicion that they were among a syndicate of people behind the Baba Jukwa page. They faced and denied charges of “attempting to commit an act of insurgency, banditry, sabotage or terrorism, undermining the authority or insulting the President and publishing or communicating false statements prejudicial to the state” (Mathuthu 2014) 1. In the intense media coverage that followed, Mduduzi Mathuthu, editor of the statecontrolled Chronicle claimed that Edmund Kudzayi was Amai Jukwa, not Baba Jukwa.

5000|$|Williams' {{literary}} {{career began}} in 2010, when {{he enrolled in}} a correspondence writing course at The Long Ridge Writer's Group, Danbury, Connecticut. His instructor, Mary Rosenblum, a science fiction and mystery author from Canby, Oregon, was an early source of inspiration and support. His first novel, Cooper's Revenge, was an outgrowth from this course and was published in 2013. It won the Silver President's Award [...] from the Florida Authors and Publisher's Association in 2013. In 2014 Williams' second novel, the sequel to Cooper's Revenge, Unit 400: The Assassins was published. It too was recognized by the Florida Authors and Publishers Association, winning a 2014 Silver President's Award for suspense fiction. His third novel, Zero Day: China's <b>Cyber</b> <b>Wars</b> was released in February 2017 to critical acclaim. In July 2017 it was named a finalist in the Royal Palm Literary Awards Competition. He is a contributor to Volume II of Stories From Langley: A Glimpse Inside the CIA, writing a chapter entitled How Intelligence Saved The Pope. This work {{is scheduled to be}} published in 2017. In his writing, Williams draws upon thirty years of experience conducting and managing clandestine operations worldwide. His first two novels depict military and paramilitary operations in the middle east, while his third novel examines the role China plays in cyber espionage against the United States through a group of elite hackers. While his writing is primarily fiction, the stories themselves delve into many contemporary issues affecting U.S. national security.|$|R
50|$|A false flag in the cyber domain is {{slightly}} different {{and easier to}} perpetrate than in other physical theaters of <b>war.</b> <b>Cyber</b> false flags refer to tactics used in covert cyber attacks by a perpetrator to deceive or misguide attribution attempts including the attacker's origin, identity, movement, and/or code/exploitation.

30|$|Although {{the design}} of secure {{wireless}} sensor networks have been widely studied (e.g. [9 – 11] and references therein), there remain many open problems of both theoretical and engineering nature [12]. In particular, {{as the number of}} sensors is usually very large, precise management of them is challenging or even infeasible. A significant portion of the sensors might be deployed in unprotected areas, where it is impossible to ensure their physical or <b>cyber</b> security (e.g. <b>war</b> zones, or regions easily accessed by adversaries). Furthermore, sensor nodes are generally not tamper-proof due to cost restrictions, and have limited computing and networking capabilities. Therefore, they may not be capable of employing complex cryptographic or security protocols.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} and differentiate between the phenomena of cyberwarfare and information warfare, as manifestations of what we perceive as postmodern warfare. We describe and analyse the current examples of the use the postmodern warfare and the reactions of states and international bodies to these phenomena. The subject matter {{of this paper is}} the relationship between new types of postmodern conflicts and the law of armed conflicts (law of war). Based on ICJ case law, it is clear that under current legal rules of international law of <b>war,</b> <b>cyber</b> attacks as well as information attacks (often performed in the cyberspace as well) can only be perceived as “war” if executed in addition to classical kinetic warfare, which is often not the case. In most cases perceived “only” as a non-linear warfare (postmodern conflict), this practice nevertheless must be condemned as conduct contrary to the principles of international law and (possibly) a crime under national laws, unless this type of conduct will be recognized by the international community as a “war” proper, in its new, postmodern sense...|$|R
