The effects of evaporator temperature on the coefficient of performance (COP), exergy flow destruction, exergetic efficiency and efficiency defect in the four major components of the cycle for R 12, R 134 a and R 152 a were experimentally investigated. The results obtained showed that the average COP of R 152 a was very close to that of R 12 with only 1. 4 % reduction, while 18. 2 % reduction was obtained for R 134 a in comparison with that of R 12. The highest average exergetic efficiency of the system (41. 5 %) was obtained using R 152 a at evaporator temperature of - 3. 0 oC.

40|$|International {{environmental}} concern {{led to the}} control and phase out of traditional <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> <b>refrigerants</b> (CFCs) {{under the terms of}} the Montreal protocol. CFCs used in domestic applications were initially replaced with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as R 134 a which has a zero ozone depletion potential (ODP). The use of HFCs has also come under scrutiny as they have high global warming potential (GWP) and inferior thermodynamic and lubricating properties and have been replaced by hydrocarbon (HC) refrigerants such as R 600 a in much of the domestic European and Asian markets. Despite this, there has been little research into the long-term environmental consequences of their application. Domestic refrigeration compressors were analysed to ascertain the tribological contact conditions for both R 600 a and R 134 a systems. A novel pressurised micro-friction test machine was developed to simulate the tribological conditions of the critical components using aluminium on steel samples. Refrigerant charges of R 600 a with mineral oil (MO) and poly-ol-ester (POE) lubricant and R 134 a with POE were tested for their tribological performance within the test rig. Experimental tribological information is presented from the physical test procedures to establish wear mechanisms and friction coefficients within the critical components. The tribological performance is used to predict deterioration in energy consumption and system durability. Results indicate that for higher contact stresses R 600 a MO charges provide a lower wear regime than R 600 a and R 134 a POE charges. At lower contact stresses the R 600 a and R 134 a POE charges provide a very low wear, very low friction regime. Despite contact conditions lead to a faster deterioration in durability, hence increase in energy consumption compared to the R 600 a system.

40|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{have led}} to the phase out of <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFC) <b>refrigerants</b> from the domestic refrigeration industry. One intriguing aspect is that the chlorine in CFCs is a good lubricating agent and any deterioration of system performance may adversely influence other environmental considerations. Based on the above, the aim of this research is to address the sustainable development of domestic refrigeration systems using the replacement refrigerant HFC- 134 a. The work focuses on the emissions that may arise if the electrical consumption of the product deteriorates or its durability is curtailed. Tribological characteristics on compressor components influence both of these product attributes and therefore a thorough system analysis was carried out. An in-house built experimental test rig, which monitored slight variations in the electrical power drawn by a reciprocating hermetic compressor, was used under different experimental conditions. Furthermore, a detailed life cycle assessment on a domestic refrigerator was performed to help quantify the ensuing environmental burdens. In this way, a relation between tribological characteristics, power consumption and environmental impact was studied. Results have shown that the CFC substitute will increase friction and wear characteristics on the aluminium alloy connecting rod and the steel gudgeon pin. These characteristics led to an increase in the electrical energy consumption of the compressor such that the indirect global warming implications are set to rise with HFC- 134 a. If the sustainable development of this product is to be ascertained then a change in refrigerants alone will not suffice. New design considerations, primarily aimed at servicing and extending the life of the hermetic compressor itself, are considered. This work helps stimulate new ideas to address environmental issues influenced by traditional engineering disciplines.

They can be used either as stand-alone systems or with conventional AC, to improve the indoor air quality. Solar cooling is a new and a fast growing technology compared to other fields of solar energy applications. On the other hand most of the current solar cooling applications are demonstration projects in nature; the technologies are advancing yet still need a lot of additional design, planning, development, and research efforts. To now solar assisted air conditioning’s main obstacles are the high installation costs, and the lack of knowledge and familiarity with this technology between designers, developers and architects. In this paper a feasibility study is carried out to assess a solar assisted air conditioning system for an office building under three of Queensland’s subtropical climates; Rockhampton, Gladstone, and Emerald.

40|$|Halons {{have long}} been the fire suppressants of choice for {{applications}} requiring high performance. However, halons {{are linked to the}} stratospheric ozone depletion problem. The most common halon, 1301 or CF{sub 3 }Br, has an ozone depletion potential (ODP) 11 times higher than the most common <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFC) <b>refrigerant.</b> This has led to a ban on halon production under the Clean Air Act legislation in the US following the Montreal Protocols on ozone depleting substances. Halon replacements are being actively sought for new fire suppression systems and to retrofit existing systems as the current supply of halons is exhausted. One promising replacement is CF{sub 3 }I. This compound has been shown to have fire suppression performance similar to that achieved for halon 1301, but with a very low ODP. Unlike halon 1301, CF{sub 3 }I rapidly photolyzes in the troposphere, and thus has a tropospheric lifetime of less than two days. However, CF{sub 3 }I is not the perfect replacement; it has performed poorly in cardiac sensitization studies and is approved only for total flooding applications in unoccupied spaces and streaming applications. In this study, they seek to build a model for the suppression of hydrogen fires by CF{sub 3 }I. From a fundamental viewpoint, the hydrogen combustion mechanism is appealing because it is the simplest and best characterized of all combustion mechanisms, and an important sub-mechanism of all hydrocarbon combustion mechanisms. Thus, a high-performance hydrogen fire suppressant would almost certainly be an excellent suppressant for most other common fires. One-dimensional, laminar flame calculations are used to determine the major fire suppression mechanisms of CF{sub 3 }I.

The focus {{of much of the}} development of chilled water systems {{in recent years has been}} on optimization of set point and staging controls, improvements in chiller design to increase efficiency and accommodate <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFC) <b>refrigerant</b> replacements. Other improvements have been made by upgrading controls to the latest digital technologies, improving access and monitoring via communications and sophisticated liquid crystal displays (LCD), more robust fault diagnostics and operating and maintenance information logging. Advances have also been made in how chiller plant systems are designed and operated, and in the diversity of chiller products that are available to support innovative approaches. As in many industries, these improvements have been facilitated by advances in, and lower costs for, enabling technologies, such as refrigerants, compressor design, electronics for controls and variable frequency drives (VFD). Along with the improvements in electronics one would expect that advances have also been made in the functionality of unit controls included with chillers. Originally, the primary purpose of this project was to investigate the state of practice of chiller unit controllers in terms of their energy saving capabilities. However, early in the study it was discovered that advances in this area did not include incorporation of significantly different capabilities than had existed 10 - 15 years ago. Thus the scope has been modified to provide an overview of some of the basic controls-related energy saving strategies that are currently available along with guideline estimates of their potential and applicability. We have minimized consideration of strategies that could be primarily implemented via design practices such as chiller selection and plant design, and those that can only be implemented by a building management system (BMS). Also, since most of the floor space of federal buildings occurs in large buildings, we have focused on water-cooled screw and centrifugal chillers of 100 ton capacity and greater.

Refrigeration compressor oils have also been replaced {{in order to be}} miscible with the alternative refrigerants. These alternative refrigerants and oils have changed the tribological characteristics of compressor critical contacts, and in some cases have led to an increase in failure rates. Much research has been conducted on the compressor contacts with alternative refrigerants and oils to understand the tribological impacts. Polymers have seen very limited study related to compressor tribocontacts in the presence of refrigerants. Polymers have a self lubricating effect by transferring material to the metal counterface. This is an important group of materials for tribological applications, especially blended polymers, which often have enhanced mechanical and low friction properties. Most of the literature on polymer tribology is conducted at speeds and loads significantly lower than typical compressor conditions. At these low speeds and applied loads, varying degrees of polymer transfer films are reported on the metal counterfaces. It is postulated that coherent transfer films are necessary for reduced wear. The current study looks at the tribological response of polymer/metal contacts in the presence of refrigerant versus ambient air under conditions simulating refrigeration compressors. Ten different polymers are employed as potential compressor bearing materials; four unfilled polymers and six blended polymers. Friction coefficient, wear, and surface topography were evaluated at a 60 ??C system temperature, 25 psi R- 134 A atmosphere (or ambient air), 2. 4 m/s sliding velocity, and 45 or 225 N applied loads. Polymers were tested against cast iron disks of roughness 0. 3 to 0. 5 ??m Rq. Experiments conducted in R- 134 A show slightly favorable friction and wear characteristics to experiments conducted in ambient air. All blended polymers have good tribological characteristics. PEEK and polyimide in both unfilled and blended forms exhibit minimal wear and do not adversely affect the metal disks. These polymers show promise for compressor bearing materials. Representative testing in starved lubricant conditions shows decreased polymer friction and wear. This study also shows that although coherent, uniform films are not produced under compressor-like conditions, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), the tested polymers still have favorable tribological properties.

As a consequence they will be banned {{during the next two}} to four decades in accordance with Kyoto and Montreal Protocols. The search for potential substitutes is in progress. Potential substitutes include pure and mixtures of hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs) which have the potential for matching thermodynamic properties of current working fluids while meeting several criteria for ODP, GWP, flammability, toxicity and production cost. This research work is intended to make comparative study between five of the potential substitutes (R 227 ea; R 245 fa; R 600; R 410 A binary mixture; R 407 C Ternary mixture) and three of the old refrigerants (R 12; R 22; R 114) that are used in heat pumps. The comparisons were based on Environmental, Safety and Thermodynamic Criterion. The software of Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and Reference Fluid Properties (REFPROP) were employed to simulate the heat pumps under wide range of operation conditions. The results revealed that all the selected newly refrigerants match the old ones very well in term of safety and thermodynamics, with R 227 ea, R 600 and R 245 fa giving the highest coefficient of performance (COP), R 410 A and R 407 C providing the highest heating capacity, cooling capacity, and vapor pressur...|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) In {{the past}} two decades the refrigeration, {{air-conditioning}} and heat pump industries began the conversion from <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFC) <b>refrigerants</b> to hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and to natural refrigerants. This changeover not only involves redesigning, re-optimizing and re-testing all new original equipment but also involves retrofitting many large existing systems. Combining this process with the goal of developing more accurate design methods and more energy-efficient cycles, heat transfer and, specifically, heat transfer enhancement, has become a very active research field and will probably continue to boom in the next decades as the HCFCs are also phased out of use. The most prominent alternative refrigerants are R 134 a and R 407 C to replace the present market dominating refrigerant R 22. Many heat transfer enhanced techniques have simultaneously been developed for the improvement of energy consumption, material saving, size reduction and pumping power reduction. Helical wire inserts in tubes are a typical technique that offers a higher heat transfer increase and, at the same time, only a mild pressure drop penalty. This study investigates the heat transfer characteristics of a horizontal tube-in-tube heat exchanger with a helical wire inserted in the inner tube. The influence of the pitch (or helix angle) of such geometry on the heat transfer performance and pressure drop during condensation (having all other geometric parameters the same) was investigated experimentally. Firstly, three refrigerants were tested in three helical wire-inserted tubes with different pitches of 5, 7. 77 and 11 mm. The local and average heat transfer coefficients, and semi-local and average pressure drops were studied systematically. The experimental results were compared not only with the referenced experimental data of the smooth tubes, but also with the results of micro-fin tubes. The heat transfer enhancement factors, pressure drop loss penalty factors and overall efficiencies of the tested condensers with helical wire-inserted geometry were calculated. The tube with a helical wire pitch of 5 mm inserts was found to have the highest enhancement factor and overall efficiency. Secondly, the heat transfer enhancement mechanism was studied and explained. It was found that the extension of the annular flow regime contributed mainly to this enhancement. The transitional qualities from annular flow to intermittent flow were derived and incorporated in a flow regime map. Thirdly, heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop correlations for this special heat transfer enhancement geometry were deduced, and they predicted the experiment data to within 80 % and 78 % respectively, within a deviation of  20 %. Finally, the water flowing through helical wire-inserted tubes (glass) was demonstrated, providing a visual understanding of the heat transfer enhancement mechanism. Prof. J. P. Meyer Prof. L.
