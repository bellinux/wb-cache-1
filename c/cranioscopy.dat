50|$|Based on {{his early}} {{observations}} about the skull sizes and facial features of his classmates, Gall developed {{the theory of}} Organology and the method of <b>Cranioscopy</b> that would later be known as Phrenology. Gall's version of Organology states that the mind {{is a collection of}} independent entities housed within the brain. <b>Cranioscopy</b> is a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties {{on the basis of the}} external shape of the skull. During his lifetime, Gall collected and observed over 120 skulls in order to test his hypotheses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cranioscopy</b> {{was later}} renamed to phrenology (phrenos: mind, logos: study) by his student Johann Spurzheim (1776-1832), who wrote {{extensively}} on the [...] "Drs. Gall and Spurzheim's physiognomical System." [...] Physiognomy claimed a correlation between physical features (especially facial features) and character traits.|$|E
5000|$|In 1796 the German {{physician}} Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828) began lecturing on organology: {{the isolation}} of mental faculties and later <b>cranioscopy</b> which involved reading the skull's shape as it pertained to the individual. It was Gall's collaborator Johann Gaspar Spurzheim who would popularize the term [...] "phrenology".|$|E
50|$|<b>Cranioscopy</b> {{is a term}} {{created by}} Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828), a German {{neuroanatomist}} and physiologist who was {{a pioneer in the}} study of the localization of mental functions in the brain, to name his technique to infer localization of function in the brain on the basis of the external anatomy of the skull or cranium."Cranioscopy, later known as phrenology, asserts that the shape of a person's skull revealed his or her intellectual and emotional characteristics."Cranioscopy is the basis of phrenology, but was later proved to be unscientific.|$|E
5000|$|Craniometry {{was also}} used in phrenology, which purported to {{determine}} character, personality traits, and criminality {{on the basis of}} the shape of the head. At the turn of the 19th century, Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1822) developed [...] "cranioscopy" [...] (Ancient Greek kranion - [...] "skull", scopos - [...] "vision"), a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties {{on the basis of the}} external shape of the skull. <b>Cranioscopy</b> was later renamed phrenology (phrenos: mind, logos: study) by his student Johann Spurzheim (1776-1832), who wrote extensively on [...] "Drs. Gall and Spurzheim's physiognomical System." [...] These all claimed the ability to predict traits or intelligence and were intensively practised in the 19th and the first part of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Through {{the teachings}} of Gall and Spurzheim, phrenological teachings spread, and by 1834 when Combe came to lecture in the United States, phrenology had become a {{widespread}} popular movement. Sensing commercial possibilities men like the Fowlers became phrenologists and sought additional ways to bring phrenology to the masses. Though a popular movement, the intellectual elite of the United States found phrenology attractive because it provided a biological explanation of mental processes based on observation, yet it was not accepted uncritically. Some intellectuals accepted organology while questioning <b>cranioscopy.</b> Gradually the popular success of phrenology undermined its scientific merits in the United States and elsewhere, along with its materialistic underpinnings, fostering radical religious views. There was increasing evidence to refute phrenological claims, and by the 1840s it had largely lost its credibility. In the United States, especially in the South, phrenology faced an additional obstacle in the antislavery movement. While phrenologists usually claimed {{the superiority of the}} European race, they were often sympathetic to liberal causes including the antislavery movement; this sowed skepticism about phrenology among those who were pro-slavery. The rise and surge in popularity in mesmerism, phrenomesmerism, also had a hand in the loss of interest in phrenology among intellectuals and the general public.|$|E
40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{development}} and reception of Franz Joseph Gall's (1758 - 1828) ideas in Western Europe. There has been little coverage, however, of how his Sch√§dellehre or organology was received in Eastern Europe. With this in mind, we examined the transmission and acceptance/rejection of Gall's doctrine in Vilnius (now Lithuania). We shall focus on what two prominent professors at Vilnius University felt about organology. The first of these men was Andrew Sniadecki (1768 - 1838), who published an article on Gall's system in the journal Dziennik Wilenski in 1805. The second is his contemporary, Joseph Frank (1771 - 1842), who wrote about the doctrine in his memoirs and published an article on phrenology in the journal Bibliotheca Italiana in 1839. Both Frank and Sniadecki had previously worked in Vienna's hospitals, where they became acquainted with Gall and his system, but they formed different opinions. Sniadecki explained the doctrine not only to students and doctors but also to the general public in Vilnius, believing the new science had merit. Frank, in contrast, attempted to prove the futility of <b>cranioscopy.</b> Briefer mention will be made of the assessments of Johann Peter Frank (1745 - 1821) and Ludwig Heinrich Bojanus (1776 - 1827), two other physicians who overlapped Gall in Vienna and went to Vilnius afterward. Additionally, we shall bring up how a rich collection of human skulls was used for teaching purposes at Vilnius University, and how students were encouraged to mark the organs on crania using Gall's system. Though organology in Vilnius, as in many other places, was always controversial, it was taught at the university, accepted by many medical professionals, and discussed by an inquisitive public...|$|E
