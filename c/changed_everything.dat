5|$|The Blitz <b>changed</b> <b>everything.</b> In September 1940 the Luftwaffe flew 6,135 night sorties, {{leading to}} only four combat losses. The Dowding system was {{incapable}} of handling night interceptions in a practical manner, and Dowding continued to state that the only solution was to get AI into operation. Seeking alternatives, the Chief of the Air Staff, Cyril Newall, convened a review committee {{under the direction of}} John Salmond. Salmond built a heavyweight panel including Sholto Douglas, Arthur Tedder, Philip Joubert de la Ferté, and Wilfrid Freeman.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{had been}} aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen not to attack them due to {{possible}} international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies. Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard M. Nixon in 1968 and the introduction of his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, <b>changed</b> <b>everything.</b>|$|E

5|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from the Mario series, Yoshizawa kept the same title but <b>changed</b> <b>everything</b> else; it became a platformer {{as opposed to a}} beat 'em up such as Double Dragon; the gameplay was modeled after Konami's Castlevania, with Ryu being equipped with a katana-like Dragon Sword, shurikens, and ninpo techniques such as fire wheels. In designing the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja vest in order to place emphasis on his muscles, and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor to check his surroundings, but that idea was scrapped. According to Kato, they utilized specific locations and environments to justify the need for having a ninja for a main character.|$|E
25|$|With Aspasia's {{pregnancy}} approaching its end, some plotted to put {{her child}} on the throne and rumours even assured {{that she was a}} supporter of this solution. The victory of the monarchists in the elections of 1 November 1920 <b>changed</b> <b>everything.</b> Dimitrios Rallis replaced Eleftherios Venizelos as Prime Minister and Constantine I was soon restored.|$|E
25|$|The {{catalyst}} for Polly Jacob Peabody's transformation was her introduction and eventual marriage to Harry Crosby, a wealthy scion of a socially prominent Boston family, and another veteran and {{victim of the}} recent war. Harry attended private schools and until age 19 appeared to be well {{on the path to}} a comfortable life {{as a member of the}} upper middle class. His experiences in World War I <b>changed</b> <b>everything.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Klondike {{gold rush}} <b>changed</b> <b>everything.</b> In 1896, gold {{was found in}} the Klondike region of Canada's Yukon Territory. On July 29, 1897, the steamer Queen docked at Moore's wharf with the first boat load of prospectors. More ships brought {{thousands}} of hopeful miners into the new town and prepared for the 500-mile journey to the gold fields in Canada. Moore was overrun by lot jumping prospectors and had his land stolen from him and sold to others.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{episode of}} O'Brien's {{tenure at the}} show came from when Letterman asked to appear as a guest and say some kind words to him. O'Brien {{considered}} this the turning point that <b>changed</b> <b>everything</b> for him, which he mentioned while paying tribute to Letterman in an opening monologue of his own talk show on TBS, which aired the same night as Letterman's final show; O'Brien notably asked his viewers to turn him off and watch Letterman {{later on in the}} monologue.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} four {{decades of the twentieth}} century, {{long-haul}} journeys between large American cities were accomplished using trains. By the 1950s, air travel was part of everyday life for many Americans. The tourism industry in the US experienced exponential growth as tourists could travel almost anywhere with a fast, reliable and routine system. For some, a vacation in Hawaii was now a more frequent pleasure. Air travel <b>changed</b> <b>everything</b> from family vacations to Major League Baseball, as had steam-powered trains in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.|$|E

25|$|The single fact of John Paul II's {{election}} in 1978 <b>changed</b> <b>everything.</b> In Poland, everything began. Not in East Germany or Czechoslovakia. Then {{the whole thing}} spread. Why in 1980 did they lead the way in Gdansk? Why did they decide, now or never? Only {{because there was a}} Polish pope. He was in Chile and Pinochet was out. He was in Haiti and Duvalier was out. He was in the Philippines and Marcos was out. On many of those occasions, people would come here to the Vatican thanking the Holy Father for changing things.|$|E
25|$|From the 1830s to 1860, Congress {{repeatedly}} rejected Whig {{calls for}} higher tariffs, and its policies of economic nationalism, which included increased state control, regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure. President Andrew Jackson, for example, did not renew {{the charter of}} the Second Bank of the United States. The tariff was lowered time and again before the Civil War. Proposals to fund massive western railroad projects, or to give free land to homesteaders, were defeated by Southerners afraid these policies would strengthen the North. The Civil War <b>changed</b> <b>everything.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1959, {{a private}} company, the Société d'expansion métropolitaine, offered {{to build a}} rubber-tired metro but the Transportation Commission wanted its own network and {{rejected}} the offer. This was the last missed opportunity, for the re-election of Jean Drapeau as mayor {{and the arrival of}} his right-hand man, Lucien Saulnier, <b>changed</b> <b>everything.</b> In the early 1960s, the western world experienced an economic boom and Quebec underwent its Quiet Revolution. From August 1, 1960, many municipal services were addressing the project and on November 3, 1961, the Montreal City Council voted appropriations amounting to $132 million ($1.06 billion in 2016) to construct and equip an initial network of 16 kilometres in length.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 31 July the war vessel Centurion {{positioned}} itself by the Montmorency Falls to attack the easternmost French batteries. General Wolfe went on board the Russell, {{one of the two}} armed transports (the other being the Three Sisters) that were meant for the attack on the redoubt. Wolfe, who was then {{in the heat of the}} action, had a better chance to reconnoitre the French position than he could from Île d'Orléans. He immediately realized his mistake: the redoubt he hoped to seize to force the French out of their entrenchments was within range of enemy fire. The French soldiers could then very well shoot toward the redoubt without leaving their entrenchments on high ground. This fact <b>changed</b> <b>everything</b> and Wolfe's plan of attack consequently proved riskier than expected.|$|E
25|$|The second {{election}} of December 1910 <b>changed</b> <b>everything</b> to Redmond's advantage, giving his parliamentary party {{the balance of}} power at Westminster, which marked a high point in his political career. His deal over the budget crisis of 1909 led to the curbing {{of the power of the}} House of Lords, which had previously blocked the budget of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George. With the Lords' veto abolished under the Parliament Act 1911, Irish Home Rule (which the Lords blocked in 1894) became a reality. Redmond used his leverage to persuade the Liberal government of H. H. Asquith to introduced the Third Home Rule Bill in April 1912, to grant Ireland national self-government. This could no longer be blocked by the Lords, its enactment merely delayed for two years. Home Rule had reached the pinnacle of its success and Redmond had gone much further than any of his predecessors in shaping British politics to the needs of the Irish.|$|E

500|$|Reaching {{beyond the}} slavery issue, the Cabinet {{advanced}} several measures to address calls {{for political and}} administrative reform. However, all of these—including the Law of Free Birth—were only partially effective due to various loopholes. Although declared freeborn, children born to slave mothers were kept, even after the law's enactment, {{under the control of}} slaveowners until age twenty-one. It is true that [...] "unable to reproduce itself, slavery would eventually disappear", but the status quo was preserved for at least two decades. In effect, as historian Roderick J. Barman summarized it, the [...] "law <b>changed</b> <b>everything</b> and it changed nothing". Other reforms also had shortcomings. The police reform legislation of 1871 theoretically limited the police's powers to imprison arbitrarily and protected civil liberties, although they generally ignored these constraints.|$|E
500|$|Trevor Noah also avoided talking {{too much}} about Fox News, as Stewart was {{previously}} known for. [...] "The Daily Show {{was based on an}} emerging 24 hour news cycle, that’s everything it was, that’s what inspired The Daily Show. Now you look at news and it’s changed. It’s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you’ve got the 'Gawker's, the 'Buzzfeed's. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has <b>changed</b> <b>everything.</b> The biggest challenge {{is going to be an}} exciting one I'm sure is how are we going to bring all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source — which was historically Fox News" [...] Noah said at a press conference before the shows debut.|$|E
