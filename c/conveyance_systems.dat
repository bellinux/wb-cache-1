Arkansas contains a mixture of groundwater and surface water, with a variety of state and federal agencies responsible for the regulation of the water resource. In accordance with agency rules, state, and federal law, the state's water treatment facilities utilize engineering, chemistry, science and technology to treat raw water from the environment to potable water standards and distribute it through water mains to homes, farms, business and industrial customers. Following use, wastewater is collected in collection and <b>conveyance</b> <b>systems</b> (sanitary sewers and combined sewers), decentralized sewer systems or septic tanks and treated in accordance with regulations at publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) before being discharged to the environment.|$|E

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that fraud in {{relation}} to land transactions is a problem that resonates amongst land academics, practitioners, and stakeholders involved in conveyancing. As each land registration and conveyancing process increasingly moves towards a fully electronic environment, {{we need to make sure}} that we understand and guard against the frauds that can occur. What this paper does is examine the types of fraud that have occurred in paper-based <b>conveyancing</b> <b>systems</b> in Australia and considers how they might be undertaken in the National Electronic <b>Conveyancing</b> <b>System</b> (NECS) that is currently under development. Whilst no system can ever be infallible, it is suggested that by correctly imposing the responsibility for identity verification on the appropriate individual, the <b>conveyancing</b> <b>system</b> adopted can achieve the optimum level of fairness in terms of allocation of responsibility and loss. As we sit on the cusp of a new era of electronic conveyancing, the framework suggested here provides a model for minimising the risks of forged mortgages and appropriately allocating the loss. Importantly it also recognises that the electronic environment will see new opportunities for those with criminal intent to undermine the integrity of land transactions. An appreciation of this now, can see the appropriate measures put in place to minimise the risk...|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process for continuously monitoring, in real time and at different altitudes, airborne pollutants. In particular, by using a multi-rotor flying platform, a fluid dynamic <b>conveyance</b> <b>system,</b> a specific sensor and a remote transmission system for transmitting the collected data, {{it is possible to}} monitor the presence, and possibly also the concentration, of airborne pollutants along vertical transepts and/or spatial trajectories. The process is implemented by coupling single elements, appropriately built and integrated, according to a predefined sequence and by imposing a certain operational procedure. In particular, it must be pointed out that: - the multi-rotor platform has no humans aboard and is controlled remotely, although it includes an on-board automatic flight stabilization system and a system for stopping the flight in the event of failures and/or malfunctions. - the fluid dynamic <b>conveyance</b> <b>system</b> consists of a truncated-cone element arranged in {{the upper part of the}} platform and securely anchored thereto; more in detail, the length of this element is such that it allows the monitored air to be taken partly outside the interference field of the rotors, and the flow inlet and outlet areas are so arranged as to allow the air to flow without any hindrance. - the airborne pollutant sensor is located in the upper part of the platform, at the base of the fluid dynamic <b>conveyance</b> <b>system,</b> and its sensitive part is immersed in the outgoing flow. The platform, assembled with the fluid dynamic <b>conveyance</b> <b>system,</b> a specific sensor and a system for remotely transmitting the collected data, is flown along vertical trajectories where stop points are imposed at different altitudes and repositioning shifts are made by means of translational movements. The vertical transepts are obtained by imposing paths that follow lines orthogonal to the ground plane and with one vertex lying therei...|$|R
