25|$|The Teamgeist was {{the first}} World Cup ball to not have the {{traditional}} 32 panels. Instead, the ball {{is made up of}} 14 panels, which means that the number of three-panel touch points is reduced by 60% (60 to 24) and the total length of the panel lines falls by over 15% (400.5cm to 339.3cm). Building on the introduction of thermal bonding technology in 2004, the Teamgeist ball is the first time Adidas has used this in a World Cup. Loughborough University conducted extensive <b>comparative</b> <b>testing</b> on the ball, along with the Adidas football laboratory in Scheinfeld, Germany.|$|E

2500|$|The XSB3U-1 was {{delivered}} to Naval Air Station Anacostia for evaluation by the U.S. Navy in April 1936;, {{at the same time}} as its primary competitor, the XSB2U-1. <b>Comparative</b> <b>testing</b> of the two aircraft during 1936 proved the complete superiority of the monoplane configuration; on the same power, the SB2U-1 was [...] faster despite being larger and heavier than the biplane. However, the Navy was impressed by the XSB3U's method of landing gear retraction, which provided a more streamlined surface after retraction than most other methods used at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, similar {{methods to}} {{determine}} chlorophyll content in leaves non-destructively {{have been applied}} to measuring anthocyanin content. [...] There are now a couple of optical absorbance instruments available commercially which are designed to measure and compute an index value that correlates highly with the actual amount of anthocyanin content in a sample. [...] To use with grapes, the skin is removed and placed across the sensor of the meter. [...] Measurements take only a second or two. [...] These Anthocyanin Content Meters use an additional Near Infra-Red (NIR) signal, which {{takes into account the}} thickness of the sample, along with the absorbance wavelength to calculate a very accurate index value which is repeatable and consistent enough for <b>comparative</b> <b>testing.</b> [...] A new method just being explored is to dip a piece of filter paper into a solution/sample to be measured and put that across the sensor head as the test sample. [...] There have been positive reports on the second method, but they have not been published.|$|E
2500|$|Opened in 1952 {{after nearly}} four years of {{planning}} and building with many materials short of supply and problems re-housing residents of the houses that stood on the site. Stockwell garage is a listed building, and when built was a masterpiece of architectural design incorporating a new roof structure that did not need supports which enabled for a [...] unobstructed parking space. The offices and workshops are {{on the edges of}} the garage but do not take up any of the parking space. In {{the first few days of}} operation the garage ran just 11 buses on route 178 which had moved from Rye Lane (Peckham), but then gained more work from the next stage of the tram replacement program for which it had been designed, but it was still well short of capacity. More work arrived in late 1953 and early 1954 when routes 77 and 77A (now 87) moved from Victoria garage due to recruitment problems, and the closure of Nunhead which increased the PVR to 110 buses. In the early 1970s the Round London Sightseeing Tours moved to Stockwell. In 1984 Stockwell was chosen to conduct <b>comparative</b> <b>testing</b> on route 170, consisting of MCW Metrobuses, Leyland Titans, Leyland Olympians, Dennis Dominators, and Volvo Ailsas. The allocation steadied at around 120 for many years, but has increased in the last few years, partially due to taking back full control of route 11 from Waterloo garage.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} interlaboratory <b>comparative</b> <b>tests</b> {{typically}} represent {{a small sample}} size. Therefore, to evaluate the quality of test results of laboratories participating in interlaboratory <b>comparative</b> <b>tests,</b> it is proposed to use Student t-test, which connects three main characteristics of small sample: {{the width of the}} confidence interval, the corresponding confidence probability and sample size. The examples of interlaboratory <b>comparative</b> <b>tests</b> of diesel show, that the use Student test allows to more objectively evaluate the quality of tests results of laboratories, in particular to identify and assess the results outside the confidence interval of the certified value of the sample for inspection. The calculation of average values of Student statistic for the aggregate test results allows to evaluate the quality of the laboratory, to range them, to form a ranking of laboratories on an objective basis...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, most field {{efficiency}} {{measurements are}} made to verify guarantees for a new project, which have led to that this issue is well covered by standardization guidelines. There are however several other situations where information from field efficiency measurements contributes with value. Depending on issue and site characteristics, there are several feasible options, that are not described in current standards of primary methods. A <b>comparative</b> <b>test</b> is here defined as a test where efficiency is evaluated at the same flow conditions but with modified or changed turbine or water conduits. At an efficiency evaluation of a <b>comparative</b> <b>test,</b> many systematic uncertainties will cancel, and the overall evaluation of uncertainty will be at a very useful level.   This paper presents experiences of the hydropower producer Vattenfall, from several efficiency tests, where different types of <b>comparative</b> <b>tests</b> settings have been used...|$|R
