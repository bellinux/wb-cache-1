50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>rubber,</b> or cold {{polymerized}} rubber, is {{synthetic rubber}} (especially, SBR and NBR) emulsion polymerized {{at a relatively}} low temperature.|$|E
50|$|Except some SBR and NBR {{used for}} special purposes, most SBR and NBR {{available}} in the market are considered <b>cold</b> <b>rubber.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} Russian police baton {{is made of}} rubber. In {{some areas}} however wooden batons are used because the winter <b>cold</b> makes <b>rubber</b> brittle. The normal service uniform is grey with red piping and hat band. Fur hats and heavy greatcoats are worn in winter.|$|R
50|$|Non-sufficient funds (NSF) is a {{term used}} in the banking {{industry}} to indicate that a cheque cannot be honored because insufficient funds {{are available in the}} account on which the instrument was drawn. An NSF check {{is often referred to as}} a bad check, dishonored check, bounced check, <b>cold</b> check, <b>rubber</b> check, returned item, or hot check.|$|R
50|$|Other uses include {{manufacturing}} sulfur dyes, insecticides, synthetic rubbers. Also used in <b>cold</b> vulcanization of <b>rubbers,</b> as polymerization {{catalyst for}} vegetable oils and for hardening soft woods.|$|R
50|$|Sorbic acid {{can also}} be used as an {{additive}} for <b>cold</b> <b>rubber,</b> and as an intermediate in the manufacture of some plasticizers and lubricants.|$|E
5000|$|Emulsion Polymerization (1955): This book {{related to}} Kolthoff's work in {{synthetic}} rubber and his development of <b>cold</b> <b>rubber.</b> It was coauthored with F.A. Bovey, A.I. Medalia, and E.J. Meehan.|$|E
50|$|The {{polymerizing}} {{temperature is}} approximately 5℃ {{in the case}} of SBR and 5∼10℃ {{in the case of}} NBR. Since rubber molecule types have a smaller number of branches than hot rubber polymerized at high temperature (50℃) and are characterized by good stereoregularity, <b>cold</b> <b>rubber</b> has superior processability as well as the ability to produce vulcanized materials with good tensile strength, expansion and aging resistance, and flex resistance.|$|E
50|$|The {{rubberized}} {{material of}} a diving suit would have quickly become brittle due to loss of volatiles in space vacuum; and also due to <b>cold</b> making the <b>rubber</b> brittle when out of sunlight, if they radiate heat away {{faster than the}} spaceman's body heat warms them.|$|R
25|$|The {{transition}} from a traditional wooden sole to one of vulcanized rubber {{may be attributed to}} Charles Goodyear and Leverett Candee. The qualities of rubber, though fascinating to Goodyear, were highly dependent on temperature: it was tacky when hot, brittle when <b>cold.</b> Vulcanization of <b>rubber</b> tempered its properties so that it was easily molded, durable, and tough. A rubberized elastic webbing made Goodyear's galoshes (circa 1890) easy to pull on and off.|$|R
3000|$|Furthermore, firefighters {{reported}} that poor fit {{is a major}} reason for changes in their walking patterns and this negatively impacts on their safety on the fire ground. They also indicated that they experienced frequent fall-offs of the rubber boots due to the poor fit, while ascending or descending during ladder operations, stair climbing, and getting on/off the fire engine. Firefighters additionally accounted their frequent experiences of blisters due to the increased rubbing between their feet and boots resulting from the poor fit. Moreover, they {{reported that}} the stiffness of rubber often caused chaffing injuries to their calves, as a female firefighter described as following: “I had two pairs of thick socks and I always had blisters in the rubber ones (Site # 1).” Additionally, firefighters reported that wearing rubber boots during winter leaves their feet vulnerable to cold injuries and likely causes loss of traction on the slippery fire ground: “They (rubber) didn’t keep your feet warm, I remember being at a fire in the winter –my feet were frozen (Site # 1).” “When it’s really <b>cold,</b> the <b>rubber</b> boot freezes up so you don’t have good traction (Site # 2).” [...]...|$|R
50|$|In 1946 Marvel went to Germany {{as one of}} a {{technical}} intelligence team, to report on the state of German rubber technology. They found that German scientists were using a redox polymerization process at 5 °C (41 °F), considerably lower than previous processes. Marvel and his group developed this idea further, creating a <b>cold</b> <b>rubber</b> process for American industry. With their new process, polymerization could be completed in only seven hours.|$|E
5000|$|The {{full-scale}} IsaMills allowed MIM {{to refine}} the mill design to allow improved ease of maintenance. For example, the shell design was changed {{to allow it to}} split along the horizontal center-line (see Figure 5). This was done to allow the use of a replaceable slip-in liner, avoiding the need for the shell to be sent away for <b>cold</b> <b>rubber</b> lining and the need to have a stock of spare, lined shells. Also, the direction of flow of feed through the mill was reversed, because most of the disk wear occurred at the feed end, which was initially at the drive end of the mill. By changing the feed end to that opposite the drive end, the disks that required most frequent replacement were the first that were removed from the shaft rather than the last (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). [...] While the IsaMills at Mount Isa were operated using screened copper smelter reverberatory furnace slag as the grinding medium, those at McArthur River used screened primary grinding mill fines as the grinding medium for the first seven years of their operation and, in 2004, switched to using screened river sand.|$|E
40|$|Continuous-fibre-reinforced {{thermoplastic}} composites {{are increasingly}} used in demanding applications in, for example, the aerospace industry. The use of specialty thermoplastics such as polyetherimide (PEI), polyphenylenesulfide (PPS) and polyether-etherketone (PEEK) reinforced with glass, carbon or aramid fibres results in solvent and corrosion resistant products with high specific stiffness and high melting temperature. These composites can be moulded into complicated shapes with the rubber pressing process where a relatively hot laminate is shortly pressed between a <b>cold</b> <b>rubber</b> mould {{and a cold}} steel tool. The process is fast compared to the forming of thermosetting polymer matrix composites where extensive curing times are involved. During the moulding, residual stresses build up that cause unwanted distortions of the final product. These stresses are caused by anisotropic shrinkage and non-symmetric process conditions. The anisotropic shrinkage can be thermally induced {{or it can be}} a result of crystallization. The upper and lower mould induce non-symmetrical process conditions: the former is a highly deformable elastomeric with a very low thermal conductivity, whereas the latter is made from high stiffness steel with a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the laminate exhibits a non-uniform temperature profile through the thickness during moulding, and has different mechanical boundary conditions on the to...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} raw {{materials}} is the most fundamental issue for a manufacturing company, because the raw material {{is something that is}} very important for a production process.  Companies must be able to maintain optimal raw material inventory that the production process can run smoothly so as to achieve the production target set by the company and can meet the demand of consumers. PT. Gunung Pulo Sari is one of the manufacturing company engaged in tire retreading. Here {{there are two types of}} main raw material of the tire retreading process is the <b>rubber</b> <b>cold</b> rare steak to cook and cook to cook hot rubber. PT.  Gunung Sari Pulo do not meet the criteria of good inventory management. So far the company in order raw materials only based on estimates only. We conducted this study in order PT. Gunung Sari Pulo can manage them inventory system by finding the optimum safety stock, determine the total cost of the minimum size of the buyer to use the dynamic method, and the reorder point. Based on the research that has been done then the obtained value of safety stock is 18 units, the total minimum cost is Rp. Rp. 133 991 672, and reordering time (Reorder point) is 93 units.

40|$|Improved energy-absorbing {{wheels are}} under {{development}} {{for use on}} special-purpose vehicles that must traverse rough terrain under conditions (e. g., extreme <b>cold)</b> in which <b>rubber</b> pneumatic tires would fail. The designs of these wheels {{differ from those of}} prior non-pneumatic energy-absorbing wheels in ways that result in lighter weights and more effective reduction of stresses generated by ground/wheel contact forces. These wheels could be made of metals and/or composite materials to withstand the expected extreme operating conditions. As shown in the figure, a wheel according to this concept would include an isogrid tire connected to a hub via spring rods. The isogrid tire would be a stiff, lightweight structure typically made of aluminum. The isogrid aspect of the structure would both impart stiffness and act as a traction surface. The hub would be a thin-walled body of revolution having a simple or compound conical or other shape chosen for structural efficiency. The spring rods would absorb energy and partially isolate the hub and the supported vehicle from impact loads. The general spring-rod configuration shown in the figure was chosen because it would distribute contact and impact loads nearly evenly around the periphery of the hub, thereby helping to protect the hub against damage that would otherwise be caused by large loads concentrated onto small portions of the hub...|$|R
40|$|Rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) were {{successfully}} introduced to south China in the 1950 s on a large-scale; however, {{due to the}} climate, are prone to cold injury during the winter season. Increased cold tolerance is therefore an important goal, yet the mechanism underlying rubber tree responses to cold stress remains unclear. This study carried out functional characterization of HbICE 1 (Inducer of CBF Expression 1) from H. brasiliensis. A nucleic protein with typical features of ICEs, HbICE 1 was able to bind to MYC recognition sites and had strong transactivation activity. HbICE 1 was constitutively expressed in all tested tissues, with highest levels in the bark, and was up-regulated when subjected to various stresses including cold, dehydration, salinity and wounding. When overexpressed in Arabidopsis, 35 S::HbICE 1 plants showed enhanced cold resistance with increased proline content, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) metabolism and electrolyte leakage, and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Expression of the cold responsive genes (COR 15 A, COR 47, RD 29 A, and KIN 1) was also significantly promoted in 35 S::HbICE 1 compared to wild-type plants under cold stress. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis showed that cold treatment changed genes expression profiles involved in many biological processes and phytohormones perception and transduction. Ethylene, JA, ABA, as well as ICE-CBF signaling pathways might work synergistically to cope with <b>cold</b> tolerance in <b>rubber</b> tree. Taken together, {{these findings suggest that}} HbICE 1 {{is a member of the}} ICE gene family and a positive regulator of cold tolerance in H. brasiliensis...|$|R
