40|$|Coal {{moisture}} control (CMC) in coking process, which reduces coal moisture before loading the coal into the coke oven, allows substantial reduction in coking energy consumption and increase in coke productivity. The technology {{is seeking to}} integrate the <b>coal</b> <b>classification,</b> thus calling it the coal classifying {{moisture control}} (CCMC), to separate the fine and coarse coal fractions in the CMC process so that the downstream coal crushing can only treat the coarse fraction. CCMC adopts a reactor that integrates a fluidized bottom section and a pneumatic conveying top section. The present work investigates the pneumatic classification behavior in a laboratory CCMC reactor with such a configuration by removing the coal fraction below a given size (e. g., 3. 0 mm) from a 0 to 20. 0 mm coal feed. The {{results show that the}} <b>coal</b> <b>classification</b> were dominated by the gas velocity in the top conveying section, and the required gas velocity for ensuring the maximal degree of removing a fine coal fraction could be roughly predicted by the Richardson and Zaki equation.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a rock mass {{classification}} system for UK Coal Measure strata such that the output from the classification system may provide {{a means by which}} the strength and stiffness properties of Coal Measure strata encountered within UK coal mines may be predicted. The development of the <b>Coal</b> Mine <b>Classification</b> system is described within this thesis. A structured methodology utilising a database of information obtained from 118 different rock mass classifications, together with consideration of the typical mechanisms of strata deformation within coal mines, was employed to determine the parameters of the Coal Measure strata that have the greatest influence on the engineering properties of the strata. These identified parameters have formed the basis of the <b>Coal</b> Mine <b>Classification</b> system. By comparison to a series of conceptual models of strata deformation that occur within the roof,floor, ribs of roadways and within the region of the coal face, relative importance weightings and rating scales for the identified classification parameters have been proposed. The anisotropic nature of the UK Coal Measures is characterised within the <b>Coal</b> Mine <b>Classification</b> by the calculation of separate ratings for directions parallel to and perpendicular to bedding. An appraisal of the optimum method of using the classification ratings, determined by the <b>Coal</b> Mine <b>Classification,</b> to predict the strength properties of individual strata units was undertaken. Rock mass failure criteria that utilise outputs from existing rock mass classification systems to determine the rock mass strength, have been reviewed. Utilising published triaxial data the rock mass failure criterion that best predicts the failure characteristics of UK Coal Measure strata was identified. From this study the Hoek-Brown rock mass failure criterion was identified as the optimum existing criterion for predicting the intact strength and rock mass strength of Coal Measure strata. However this criterion was still found not to produce a close fit in many cases to the intact failure strength of the strata. A modified Coal Measure Failure criterion has been developed, which {{for a wide range of}} Coal Measure rock types was found to produce a better prediction of the intact strength of Coal Measure strata than any of the existing rock mass failure criteria. To determine the efficacy of the <b>Coal</b> Mine <b>Classification</b> system as a means of predicting the strength and stiffness properties of the rock mass the <b>Coal</b> Mine <b>Classification</b> was applied to the strata at case study localities within rock bolted roadways within three UK mine sites. Numerical models of the case study localities were developed using the FLAC finite difference code utilising a ubiquitous jointed elastic-perfectly plastic material model to simulate strata behaviour. The output from the modelling included predicted roof and rib side displacements, and these displacements were compared to the actual monitoring data for the case study localities. The results of the numerical modelling indicate that the predictions produced by the numerical models reflected the pattern and scale of deformations actually measured in-situ within the coal mine roadways, thus indicating that the <b>Coal</b> Mine <b>Classification</b> system provides a means of predictively determining the engineering properties of the in-situ Coal Measure strata. The modelling also indicated that time delays related to the installation of the roof extensometers may under predict that actual roof deformation that occurs within the roadway roof...|$|R

The recently vacated Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) required nation-wide reductions of mercury (Hg) from coal-fueled plants and in the initial phase relied largely on NOX and SO 2 control techniques in combination to effect reductions of Hg. 1, 2 Regardless of the current uncertainty of federal regulations for the reduction of Hg emissions from coal-fueled power plants, {{it is safe to}} assume that Hg emissions reductions from such sources will be required in the future. Further, the latest cement industry Maximum Achievable Control Technology (Cement-MACT) did not regulate Hg from existing cement kilns and is under litigation and reconsideration. 3, 4 Consequently, this review demonstrates that a significant amount of Hg removed from coal-fueled power plants can be re-emitted from existing cement kilns that use fly ash from CAIR-regulated coal-fueled plants as a raw material. The conclusion is that to achieve effective Hg reduction, the U. S.

40|$|ABSTRACT. - In this study, {{petrographic}} {{and organic}} geochemical {{characteristics of the}} Tertiary Karlıova-Halifan coals (Bingöl) were investigated. Determination of coal quality was based on chemical (moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon, ash) and elemental analyses (C, H, O, S, N). The values of the huminite reflectances in organic mat-ter-rich coal levels change between 0. 368 and 0. 573 %, which correspond to low maturity levels. These param-eters are in good aggrement with their fluorescence colors, calorific value (average original- 2266, dry- 3177 Kcal/kg, upper calorific value) and average Tmax (417 o C) values. The organic material in studied coals show low grade transformation due to low lithostatic pressure.

Existing developed economies and fast-growing ones like China and India rely heavily on fossil fuels as a source of energy. Coal is still a key element in the energy mix for the world’s leading economies, and around 30 % of all CO 2 emissions come from the combustion of fossil fuels for electricity generation (IEA, 2008). Therefore, {{there is a need for}} clean coal technology to reduce the negative effect of the combustion. The coal particle size is critical to cleaner combustion; the classifier is responsible for that. The present work details an investigation into improving the performance of coal classifiers. The particular area of focus is to find the optimum design parameters by looking at the effects and influences of key classifier parameters towards the classifier performance. The use of ineffective classifier parameters, especially the vane angle and inlet velocity, reduces the performance of the classifiers where an inappropriate size of particle is being released. This contributes to a reduction in overall efficiency of the coal power plant and contributes to the formation of NOx gases during fuel burning. The performance of the classifier in terms of flow and particle distribution is the focus of the analysis. The work within this research study employs the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique, which is a very effective, non-intrusive, virtual modelling technique with powerful visualisation capabilities. However, the importance of the experimental appreciative of the classifier is not neglected. Experiments were carried out to provide a tool for validating the CFD propositions.

40|$|Dense media {{separation}} (DMS) {{plays an}} integral part in coal processing {{as well as in}} the upgrade of low grade ore bodies prior to further processing like flotation and leaching. Various separating vessels are used in DMS; of which the dense media (DM) cyclone is the most common. However, the limited materials of construction available for DM cyclones leave the industry with little choice. In addition, the DM cyclones available moved away from the basic principles of classification hydrocyclones which is to reduce the turbulence in the feed chamber in order to achieve improved efficiency. The ceramic tiled DM cyclones available in the market have ceramic tiles installed perpendicular to each other in the feed chamber, which increase the turbulence in the feed chamber at the expense of longer equipment life. For that reason, a research project was initiated to establish the current installed base of DM cyclones in Southern Africa and to develop and evaluate a DM cyclone with a laminar spiral feed chamber design to reduce the turbulence when feeding the cyclone, whilst achieving the same or superior wear properties. Because Cavex is well proven in hard rock mining and <b>coal</b> <b>classification,</b> it was used as basis for the development of a DM cyclone. Individual moulds were developed and produced in order to fabricate a Cavex DM cyclone with the exact laminar spiral feed chamber that exists when moulded out of rubber. Afterwards, the Cavex ceramic tiled (CVXT) cyclone was manufactured, installed and commissioned. Using the basic operating principles of hydrocyclones, the predicted results were achieved. The 650 CVXT results confirmed that a DM cyclone and a classification cyclone are inherently the same piece of equipment; it is the selection criteria and material of construction that differ. There is a definite benefit in focussing on metallurgical efficiency in conjunction with wear properties, rather than equipment life (wear life) as the only parameter during equipment fabrication. A simple way to achieve improved performance is to reduce the turbulence in the feed chamber. Further work must include the evaluation of the Cavex CVXT DM cyclone in near gravity coal circuits and to investigate whether the same lower operating pressures (6 D compared to conventional 9 D) will result in improved coal yield, as was illustrated successfully in the separation of fluorspar by DMS, whilst achieving the desired ash contents.

These properties affect each other including the overall coal properties and performance required during its specified usage. Some South African coals {{are known to be}} very abrasive, this causes operational challenges during the electricity generation combustion process as the coal abrades the plant equipment at a faster rate. Various South African coal samples were tested for abrasiveness index using the Yancey, Geer and Price (YGP) method.

This lack of repeatability and reproducibility was observed in all coal samples tested.

Using the expected coal reserves as the weighting factor and based on the previously published Pb content in 4, 304 coal samples (including results obtained in our laboratory) from main coalfields or coal mines in China, the weighted mean Pb content in Chinese coals is 13. 0 mu g/g, which is higher than that of the American coals (11 mu g/g) and average world coals (7. 8 mu g/g). With respect to regional distribution of Pb in Chinese coals, Pb content can be arbitrarily divided into three groups (40 mu g/g). Following this <b>classification,</b> <b>coals</b> from Tibet have the highest average Pb content (128. 94 mu g/g). The abundance of Pb in coals varies with coal-forming periods and coal ranks, with the late Triassic and higher rank coals having the highest Pb content, which could be ascribed to regional geochemical differences and later geological evolution as well as magma hydrothermal activities. The enrichment of Pb in coals is influenced by several geological factors, including coal-forming plants, source rocks, hydrothermal fluid, and depositional environment. Pb, dominantly associates with sulfide minerals, especially galena in coals. During coal combustion or pyrolysis, Pb is partly emitted into the atmosphere and partly partitioned to solid residues. Accumulation of Pb from coal utilization in human body could lead to a range of health problems and increase the risk of cancer...|$|R
40|$|Samples {{from two}} lignite seams (Lower Seam, Upper Seam) of the Lavanttal basin (Austria) and {{additional}} xylite were investigated for variations in maceral composition, petrography-based facies indicators, bulk geochemical parameters, and molecular composition of hydrocarbons. Both seams originated in a topogenous mire and evolved within a transgressive setting. The final drowning of the mire {{is indicated by}} sapropelic shales. Whereas the sapropelic shale overlying the Lower Seam was deposited in a freshwater lake, the sapropelic shale above the Upper Seam represents a brackish lake. Numerous relationships are found between petrography-based facies indicators and the geochemical composition of organic matter. The contents of macerals of the liptinite group are positively correlated with soluble organic matter (SOM) yields and hydrogen index (HI). Consistent with maceral composition and high HI values, enhanced proportions of short-chain n-alkanes, which are predominantly found in algae and microorganisms, are obtained from samples of the sapropelic shales. The final drowning of the mire is reflected by decreasing pristane/phytane ratios, due to the rise in (ground) water table {{and the establishment of}} anaerobic conditions, as well as by decreasing ratios of diasterenes/sterenes, indicating increasing pH values in the mire. The degree of gelification of plant tissue (gelification index) is governed by the microbial activity in the mire, as indicated by the hopanes concentration. The differences in floral assemblage during the formation of the Lavanttal lignite seams are reflected by major differences in tissue preservation. Preservation of plant tissue (TPI) in the Lavanttal lignite is obviously controlled by the presence/absence of decay-resistant gymnosperms in the peat-forming vegetation, and additionally influenced by the relative contribution of wood to coal formation. The results provide evidence that valuable information for coal facies characterization could be obtained by petrography-based and geochemical facies indicators. An influence of the floral assemblage (gymnosperms/angiosperms ratio) and of the contribution of algal biomass on carbon isotopic composition of the organic matter (delta C- 13 = - 24. 2 to - 28. 6 %.) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is suggested to affect the delta C- 13 values of the <b>coal,</b> The chemotaxonomical <b>classification</b> of the xylites as gymnosperm remnants, based on the molecular composition of terpenoid biomarkers, is corroborated by the carbon isotopic composition of the xylites (mean delta C- 13 = - 24. 1 %) and the extracted cellulose (mean delta C- 13 = - 20. 2 %). The higher isotopic difference of about 3. 9 %. between cellulose and total organic carbon of the xylites, compared to the difference between cellulose and wood found in modem trees, is explained by the smaller effect of decomposition on delta C- 13 of cellulose.
