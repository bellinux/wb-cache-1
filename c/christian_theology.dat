5|$|In <b>Christian</b> <b>theology,</b> {{the work}} of the Holy Spirit under the Old Covenant is viewed as less {{extensive}} than that under the New Covenant inaugurated on the day of Pentecost.

It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E

In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God for mercy, a moment that marked his spiritual conversion.

5|$|Ethiopian historiographic {{literature}} has been traditionally dominated by <b>Christian</b> <b>theology</b> and the chronology of the Bible. There was also considerable influence from Muslim, pagan and foreign elements {{from within the}} Horn of Africa and beyond. Diplomatic ties with Christendom were established in the Roman era under Ethiopia's first Christian king, Ezana of Axum, in the 4th century AD, and were renewed in the Late Middle Ages with embassies traveling to and from medieval Europe. Building on the legacy of ancient Greek and Roman historical writings about Ethiopia, medieval European chroniclers made attempts to describe Ethiopia, its people, and religious faith in connection to the mythical Prester John, who {{was viewed as a}} potential ally against Islamic powers. Ethiopian history and its peoples were also mentioned in works of medieval Islamic historiography and even Chinese encyclopedias, travel literature, and official histories.|$|E
5|$|The doctrinal {{changes in}} the church {{occurred}} gradually, but by 1994, most of the concepts of Armstrongism had been largely modified or discontinued. However, the major bombshell was dropped during {{what is now called}} the Christmas Eve Sermon. Tapes of Tkach's sermon (dated January 7, 1995) were delivered to local congregations for viewing. In this sermon, he publicly declared that the Worldwide Church of God was a New Covenant church and, therefore, not bound by the terms of the Old Covenant. <b>Christian</b> <b>theology</b> defines the Old Covenant as the Mosaic Law embodied in the Torah. Hence, by making this statement, Tkach officially dropped all doctrines based on Mosaic Law (i.e., the keeping of the Sabbath, the Holy Days, and the dietary laws), making observance of such practices an individual choice. He also dropped the requirement of tithing, declaring that giving as taught in the New Testament was voluntary. The last change had a significant and rather immediate impact on church finances.|$|E
5|$|When the Christian Alfonso VI of Castile retook the Kingdom of Toledo {{from the}} Moors in 1085, an Arabic {{translation}} of Aristotle's works, with commentaries by Avicenna and Averroes emerged into European medieval scholarship. Michael Scot translated much of Aristotle's biology into Latin, c. 1225, {{along with many}} of Averroes's commentaries. Albert of Cologne commented extensively on Aristotle, but added his own zoological observations and an encyclopedia of animals based on Thomas of Cantimpré. Later in the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas merged Aristotle's metaphysics with <b>Christian</b> <b>theology.</b> Whereas Albert had treated Aristotle's biology as science, writing that experiment was the only safe guide and joining in with the types of observation that Aristotle had made, Aquinas saw Aristotle purely as theory, and Aristotelian thought became associated with pointless scholasticism. The scholastic natural philosophy curriculum omitted most of Aristotle's biology, but included On the Soul.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{remarkable}} success of microfinance programs in poverty alleviation, empowering the clients {{of these programs}} has proven elusive in many cases. Social capital is a commonly missing, or at least misused, asset within microfinance programs, which often leads to this outcome. Creating and fostering social capital will have {{a positive influence on}} empowering microfinance clients. The values espoused by certain <b>Christian</b> <b>theologies</b> can have a considerably positive impact on the creation and fostering of social capital. A Christian-oriented social capital also has the potential to alleviate the ills and correct the failures of a microfinance program’s intent to empower clients. This thesis argues that the values and structure of certain <b>Christian</b> <b>theologies</b> and practices create a type of social capital that increases the likelihood of Christian-based microfinance programs empowering their clients.

5|$|Calvin {{developed}} his theology in his biblical commentaries {{as well as}} his sermons and treatises, but the most comprehensive expression of his views is found in his magnum opus, the Institutes of the Christian Religion. He intended that the book be used as a summary of his views on <b>Christian</b> <b>theology</b> and that it be read in conjunction with his commentaries. The various editions of that work spanned nearly his entire career as a reformer, and the successive revisions of the book show that his theology changed very little from his youth to his death. The first edition from 1536 consisted of only six chapters. The second edition, published in 1539, was three times as long because he added chapters on subjects that appear in Melanchthon's Loci Communes. In 1543, he again added new material and expanded a chapter on the Apostles' Creed. The final edition of the Institutes appeared in 1559. By then, the work consisted of four books of eighty chapters, and each book was named after statements from the creed: Book 1 on God the Creator, Book 2 on the Redeemer in Christ, Book 3 on receiving the Grace of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and Book 4 on the Society of Christ or the Church.|$|E
