40|$|We {{present an}} {{improvement}} of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation method, which calculates electron-scattering wave functions of a nanoscale conductor suspended between a pair of electrodes. The improvement eliminates the numerical collapse which frequently occurs while solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for long <b>conductor</b> <b>systems</b> and originates from evanescent wave components of the retarded Green's function of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We introduce regularization and ratio expression into the Green's function matrix and discover that the resultant Green's function does not suffer from the numerical collapse without increasing computational cost. As a performance test, we carry out electron transport calculations of Al monoatomic linear chains with a length of up to 75. 6 bohrs. The numerical test demonstrates that the improved Lippmann-Schwinger equation method is applicable to long <b>conductor</b> <b>systems</b> with no numerical collapse and adequate computational accuracy...|$|R

30|$|Geomagnetic storms are {{potentially}} hazardous to human society. The electric {{field in the}} earth, induced by the geomagnetic storms, generates the large unpredictable electric current in conductors on the earth’s surface. This is so-called geomagnetically induced current (GIC), which can yield damages to pipelines, railways, cables, and other architectures which have long electrical <b>conductor</b> <b>systems.</b> For example, the end-to-end voltages associated with GIC can be very large along power lines and trans-oceanic submarine communication cables.
