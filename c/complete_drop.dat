40|$|In {{previous}} work in undoped MFe 2 As 2, partial drops in the resistivity indicative of traces of superconductivity {{have been observed}} in some samples of M=Ba (Tc ~ 20 K, up to 25 % drop in resistivity) and M=Ca (Tc ~ 10 K, up to 45 % drop in resistivity.) A <b>complete</b> <b>drop</b> in the resistivity to 0, along with a finite fraction of Meissner flux expulsion, has been observed in M=Sr, Tc = 22 K. Using In-flux grown single crystal samples of undoped BaFe 2 As 2, we find a <b>complete</b> <b>drop</b> in the resistivity to 0 in most samples beginning at Tc(onset) = 22. 5 K. However, {{in contrast to the}} SrFe 2 As 2 results, there is no measurable Meissner effect and no suppression of the resistive superconducting transition with annealing. The current sensitivity of the superconducting resistive transition in our samples of BaFe 2 As 2 is quite strong, with an increase in the current density of a factor of 15 to ~ 1. 5 A/cm 2 not changing Tc(onset) but broadening the transition significantly and causing the resistivity to remain finite as T approaches 0. To investigate if this unusually low critical current is indicative of filamentary conduction lacking the apparent anisotropy seen in the critical magnetic field, Hc 2, measurements of, e. g., the bulk superconductor Co-doped BaFe 2 As 2, Hc 2 was measured in both crystalline directions. These BaFe 2 As 2 samples show Hc 2 (T) values in the ab-plane and along the c-axis comparable to those seen in BaFe 2 -xCoxAs 2, which has a similar Tc. Since the lack of Tc suppression after annealing argues against strain-induced superconductivity as proposed for the other undoped MFe 2 As 2 materials, another possible cause for the superconductivity in BaFe 2 As 2 is discussed.

Recently, introducing a macro-ridge to break the hydrodynamic symmetry, has been shown to reduce the residence time on the surface of a bouncing drop.

Here we show that a parallel neighbor ridge can influence the dynamics of recoiling. Ridge spacing plays a key role on the performance of surface to reduce the residence time. This finding can be of great significance for the development of macro-ridged anti-icing surfaces. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|The Russian-Ukrainian {{crisis has}} revitalized the European {{concerns}} of supply disruptions {{of natural gas}} as experienced in 2006 and 2009. However, the European supply situation, regulation and infrastructure have changed since: imports aremore diversified, EU member states better connected and a common regulation on the security of supply has been introduced. Nevertheless, several East European countries are highly dependent on Russian natural gas. This paper investigates different Russian natural gas export disruptions scenarios and analyses short- and long-term reactions to ensure a sufficient supply of natural gas within Europe.

40|$|Pegasus is a satellite-launching {{space rocket}} {{dropped from a}} B 52 carrier {{aircraft}} instead of launching vertically from a ground pad. Its three-year, privately-funded accelerated development was carried out under a demanding design-to-nonrecurring cost methodology, which imposed unique requirements on its flight test program, such as {{the decision not to}} drop an inert model from the carrier aircraft; the number and type of captive and free-flight tests; the extent of envelope exploration; and the decision to combine test and operational orbital flights. The authors believe that Pegasus may be the first vehicle where constraints in the number and type of flight tests to be carried out actually influenced the design of the vehicle. During the period November 1989 to February of 1990 a total of three captive flight tests were conducted, starting with a flutter clearing flight and culminating in a <b>complete</b> <b>drop</b> rehearsal. Starting on April 5, 1990, two combination test/operational flights were conducted.

This study focuses on the emulsification of a silicon oil-in-water system stabilized by a surfactant through SMX+ ® static mixers involving no mass transfer between the two phases. The experiments covered a large domain of dispersed fraction from dilute conditions (5 %vol.) up to concentrated ones (60 %vol.) close to phase inversion and three different viscosities from 20 to 350 mPa s with transitional or turbulent flow regimes. The number of static mixers was studied until a constant drop size distribution monitored at line with a video probe was obtained.

40|$|The resurrection plant Haberlea rhodopensis {{was used}} to study {{dynamics}} of drought response of photosynthetic machinery parallel with changes in primary metabolism. A relation between leaf water content and photosynthetic performance was established, enabling us to perform a non-destructive evaluation of the plant water status during stress. Spectroscopic analysis of photosynthesis indicated that, at variance with linear electron flow (LEF) involving photosystem (PS) I and II, cyclic electron flow around PSI remains active till almost full dry state {{at the expense of}} the LEF, due to the changed protein organization of photosynthetic apparatus. We suggest that, this activity could have a photoprotective role and prevent a <b>complete</b> <b>drop</b> in adenosine triphosphate (ATP), in the absence of LEF, to fuel specific energy-dependent processes necessary for the survival of the plant, during the late states of desiccation. The NMR fingerprint shows the significant metabolic changes in several pathways. Due to the declining of LEF accompanied by biosynthetic reactions during desiccation, a reduction of the ATP pool during drought was observed, which was fully and quickly recovered after plants rehydration. We found a decline of valine accompanied by lipid degradation during stress, likely to provide alternative carbon sources for sucrose accumulation at late stages of desiccation. This accumulation, as well as the increased levels of glycerophosphodiesters during drought stress could provide osmoprotection to the cells...|$|E

We investigated some immune functions before, during and after one course of HDCT for poor-risk breast cancer and compared the effects of G-CSF and GM-CSF on the immune recovery. They exerted different influences on the functions we examined and showed distinctive patterns of both qualitative and quantitative in vivo activities on the immune system. The main findings were that (a) granulocyte and lymphocyte recovery rates were faster in the patients receiving G-CSF; (b) looking at the lymphocyte compartment, this difference was restricted to the CD 3 (+) /CD 8 (+) and CD 56 (+) lymphocyte subsets; (c) the reconstitution rate of CD 19 (+) lymphocytes was slow in both groups; (d) at the end of follow-up HLA-DR expression by CD 3 (+) lymphocytes was higher in the GM-CSF group; (e) the lymphocyte proliferative capacity was restored at a faster rate in the GM-CSF group, whereas cytotoxic activities recovered better in the G-CSF group; (f) the early repopulating phase was characterized by higher interleukin- 6 serum levels in the GM-CSF group. Overall, GM-CSF seemed to exert an earlier effect on all T lymphocyte subsets, preventing them from a <b>complete</b> <b>drop</b> during the long-lasting "nadir" of the cell count, whereas G-CSF appeared to boost them strongly, though a few days later, hastening their final recovery.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the application}} of two fault tolerant control schemes to a hydroelectric model developed in the Matlab and Simulink environments. The proposed fault tolerant controllers are exploited for regulating {{the speed of the}} Francis turbine included in the hydraulic system. The nonlinear behaviour of the hydraulic turbine and the inelastic water hammer effects are taken into account in order to develop a high-fidelity simulator of this dynamic plant. The first fault tolerant control solution relies on an adaptive control design, which exploits the recursive identification of a linear parametric time-varying model of the monitored system. The second scheme proposed uses the identification of a fuzzy model that is exploited for the reconstruction of the fault affecting the system under diagnosis. In this way, the fault estimation and its accommodation is possible. Note that these strategies, which are both based on identification approaches, are suggested for enhancing {{the application of}} the suggested fault tolerant control methodologies. These characteristics of the study represent key issues when on-line implementations are considered for a viable application of the proposed fault tolerant control schemes. The faults considered in this paper affect the electric servomotor used as a governor, the hydraulic turbine speed sensor, and the hydraulic turbine system, and are imposed both separately and simultaneously. Moreover, the <b>complete</b> <b>drop</b> of the rotational speed sensor is also analysed. Monte-Carlo simulations are also used for analysing the most important issues of the proposed schemes in the presence of parameter variations. Moreover, the performances achieved by means of the proposed solutions are compared to those of a standard PID controller already developed for the considered model. Finally, these strategies serve to highlight the potential application of the proposed control strategies to real hydraulic systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The pistil is a {{place where}} {{multiple}} interactions between cells of different types, origin, and function occur. Ca 2 + {{is one of the key}} signal molecules in plants and animals. Despite the numerous studies on Ca 2 + signalling during pollen-pistil interactions, which constitute one of the main topics of plant physiology, studies on Ca 2 + dynamics in the pistil during flower formation are scarce. The purpose of this study was to analyze the contents and in situ localization of Ca 2 + at the whole-organ level in the pistil of olive during the whole course of flower development. Results The obtained results showed significant changes in Ca 2 + levels and distribution during olive pistil development. In the flower buds, the lowest levels of detectable Ca 2 + were observed. As flower development proceeded, the Ca 2 + amount in the pistil successively increased and reached the highest levels just after anther dehiscence. When the anthers and petals fell down a dramatic but not <b>complete</b> <b>drop</b> in calcium contents occurred in all pistil parts. In situ Ca 2 + localization showed a gradual accumulation on the stigma, and further expansion toward the style and the ovary after anther dehiscence. At the post-anthesis phase, the Ca 2 + signal on the stigmatic surface decreased, but in the ovary a specific accumulation of calcium was observed only in one of the four ovules. Ultrastructural localization confirmed the presence of Ca 2 + in the intracellular matrix and in the exudate secreted by stigmatic papillae. Conclusions This is the first report to analyze calcium in the olive pistil during its development. According to our results in situ calcium localization by Fluo- 3 AM injection is an effective tool to follow the pistil maturity degree and the spatial organization of calcium-dependent events of sexual reproduction occurring in developing pistil of angiosperms. The progressive increase of the Ca 2 + pool during olive pistil development shown by us reflects the degree of pistil maturity. Ca 2 + distribution at flower anthesis reflects the spatio-functional relationship of calcium with pollen-stigma interaction, progamic phase, fertilization and stigma senescence. </p...|$|E
40|$|An experimental/computational {{investigation}} of turbulent spray processes affecting premixing-prevaporization in liquid-fueled lean-premixed combustors is reported. Low combustor emissions levels and high combustion efficiency require optimum premixer performance. <b>Complete</b> <b>drop</b> evaporation and spatially and temporally homogeneous fuel-air mixtures at the inlet to the combustor are desirable. ^ An experimental study with a tubular premixer, tubular combustor operating at atmospheric pressure is conducted {{to evaluate the}} importance of drop dispersion, equivalence ratio, premixer residence times, and atomization characteristics on premixing-prevaporization. Premixing-prevaporization effectiveness is evaluated primarily based on measurements of gas concentrations in the exhaust. Ultra-low NOx operation is possible for equivalence ratios less than 0. 5. The equivalence ratio is the dominant variable. Mie-scattering measurements are conducted at the exit of the premixer to determine qualitative levels of premixing-prevaporization. These measurements show considerable spatial inhomogeneities across the premixer without significant adverse effects on NOx formation. Drop dispersion {{is found to be}} the most critical parameter for high combustion efficiency and low NOx. ^ An experiment is designed to conduct a fundamental study of drop dispersion in a well characterized confined turbulent flow to obtain measurements of the velocity statistics of both phases, drop size distributions, and liquid dispersion. These measurements provide the gas-phase flow field for the dispersion calculations, and provide initial conditions for statistical simulations of drop dispersion. ^ Simulations of drop dispersion are performed using a correlated Monte-Carlo method. This approach avoids selection of a single turbulent length scale for drop-turbulence interactions, and an assumption of isotropic gas-phase turbulence. Predictions of rms velocity fluctuations, and PDFs of drop velocity and drop size are compared to measurements to provide a stringent evaluation of the simulation. The simulations provide reasonably good quantitative agreement with measurements. A new statistical approach called the Discrete Probability Function (DPF) method is evaluated for drop dispersion calculations using available dispersion measurements for single size particles. The DPF method leads to a reduction in statistical noise when compared to Monte-Carlo methods. However, the increase in computational expense with the DPF method requires that more efficient algorithms need to be developed before the DPF method can be applied to practical dispersion calculations. ...|$|E
