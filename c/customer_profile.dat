40|$|Warehousing {{and mining}} sales {{transaction}} data to generate summary information, <b>customer</b> <b>profiles,</b> and business rules {{has become increasingly}} important in ecommerce. Such summary information and rules have to be extracted from very large collections of transaction data gathered at many distributed sites. This is challenging data mining, {{both in terms of}} the magnitude of data involved, and the need to incrementally adapt the mined patterns and rules as new data is collected. This paper describes a distributed and cooperative data warehousing, OLAP, and data mining infrastructure that addresses these challenges. Our contributions are as follows. First, we define various new classes of multidimensional and multi-level association rules (scoped multidimensional, with conjoint items, and functional) that can be extracted from <b>customer</b> <b>profiles</b> and are useful for e-commerce applications. Then, we show how <b>customer</b> <b>profiles</b> and different classes of association rules can be computed in a distri [...] ...|$|R

In addition, we use the stationarity properties of the estimated models to identify typical daily <b>customer</b> <b>profiles.</b> As each one of the 245 substations can be represented by its unique daily profile, it is possible to cluster the 245 profiles in order to obtain a segmentation of the original sample in different classes of <b>customer</b> <b>profiles.</b> This methodology provides a unified framework for the forecasting and clustering problems. status: publishe...|$|R

The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the <b>customer</b> <b>profile.</b> The caller can be given the option {{to wait in the}} queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain caller line identification (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.|$|E

This paper builds profiles of grocery shoppers based on their preferences for 33 retail grocery store characteristics. The data are from a representative, nationwide sample of 900 supermarket shoppers collected in 1999. Six <b>customer</b> <b>profiles</b> are found to exist, including (1) "Time Pressed Meat Eaters", (2) "Back to Nature Shoppers", (3) "Discriminating Leisure Shoppers", (4) "No Nonsense Shoppers", (5) "The One Stop Socialites", and (6) "Middle of the Road Shoppers".

50|$|Sales {{development}} handles {{two types}} of leads. The first, {{often referred to as}} an inbound lead, is generated by marketing and sent to a Sales Development Representative (SDR). The SDR will then engage that lead, qualify their interest in purchasing a product and determine whether it is worth spending further resources selling to this lead. If an SDR determines a lead is worth spending sales resources on, the lead is handed off to a sales person to conduct the rest of the sales process. The second type of lead, often referred to as an outbound prospect, is a lead an SDR discovers by identifying potential buyers that would benefit from the product the SDR is selling. The universe of potential buyers a business can sell to is called a total addressable market (TAM). The criteria for companies within that TAM, and buyers within those companies, that a business has defined as an ideal fit is often described in an Ideal <b>Customer</b> <b>Profile</b> (ICP), which an SDR will use to identify outbound prospects.|$|E
50|$|While at its core, clienteling is a sales technique, {{the term}} is {{commonly}} used today to describe the related assisted selling software tools used to support relationship-building activities between store associates and their customers. Software-based clienteling has been said to {{have the advantage of}} collecting data about clients across different interaction channels in a searchable and retrievable database for later use. Clienteling software may also provide digital tools on mobile devices or fixed workstations aimed at enabling retailers to establish long-lasting learning relationships with their customers. While sales history collected in customer relationship management (CRM) platforms can provide some insight into a customer’s tendencies, this insight can be augmented by data collected by an associate working directly with a customer, who can improve the <b>customer</b> <b>profile</b> through each face-to-face interaction. This information can then be used to further personalize future interactions. Capabilities such as notes, wish lists, preferences, alerts, and purchase history are sometimes used to enable associates to enhance client profiles in ways that purchase history and e-commerce activity alone could not. Clienteling can also be an effective means of selling excess inventory without resorting to discounting by pairing products with the right consumers, using their past purchases to predict what they are likely to want to buy.|$|E

It is commonly held within these firms that both Black Box testing and White Box testing tools are needed {{in the pursuit of}} application security. Typically sited, Black Box testing (meaning Penetration Testing tools) are ethical hacking tools used to attack the application surface to expose vulnerabilities suspended within the source code hierarchy. Penetration testing tools are executed on the already deployed application. White Box testing (meaning Source Code Analysis tools) are used by either the application security groups or application development groups. Typically introduced into a company through the application security organization, the White Box tools complement the Black Box testing tools in that they give specific visibility into the specific root vulnerabilities within the source code in advance of the source code being deployed. Vulnerabilities identified with White Box testing and Black Box testing are typically in accordance with the OWASP taxonomy for software coding errors. White Box testing vendors have recently introduced dynamic versions of their source code analysis methods; which operates on deployed applications. Given that the White Box testing tools have dynamic versions similar to the Black Box testing tools, both tools can be correlated in the same software error detection paradigm ensuring full application protection to the client company.|$|E
