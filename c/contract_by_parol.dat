50|$|It was {{one thing}} to create an {{exception}} that displaced the need for a memorandum in writing, but something else to completely nullify the Statute’s operation. The thrust of the Statute was that contracts concerning land could not be proved <b>by</b> <b>parol</b> evidence alone. Thus, part performance might be an exception, but it could not, in effect, mean that the underlying contract could be proven <b>by</b> <b>parol</b> evidence. In developing the “part performance” exception, a balancing of the competing considerations was required. An important factor in the case law became that the part performance must be “unequivocally” related to the alleged contract.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Fabelo {{issued a}} report to the Connecticut {{legislature}} in 2006 claiming its program of reducing incarceration rates was a [...] "success". This policy was abandoned by Governor M. Jodi Rell after a series of heinous crimes committed in the summer of 2007 <b>by</b> <b>paroled</b> criminals, most notably the July 2007 home invasion in Cheshire.|$|R
5000|$|Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas also opposed Atkins' release, {{stating that}} [...] "It {{would be a}} grave {{miscarriage}} of justice to burden the citizens of Orange County <b>by</b> <b>paroling</b> her to Orange County, where she can enjoy the comforts of her husband, home and mercy she did not show Sharon Tate or her unborn baby." ...|$|R
50|$|Sections 1 to 3 and 7 to 9 and 24 were {{repealed}} by section 207 of, and Schedule 7 to, the Law of Property Act 1925 (15 Geo 5 c 20). However section 53(1)(a) required that {{interest in land}} be created or disposed by a signed writing, a will or operation of law. Section 53(1)(b) requires a declaration of trust in land must be by a signed writing or a will and section 53(1)(c) requires the same disposition of equitable interests and existing trusts. Section 52(2) state that section 53 {{does not affect the}} creation or operation of implied, resulting or constructive trusts. Section 54 provides interests in land created <b>by</b> <b>parol</b> and not put in writing and signed have the force and effect of interests at will only except that the lease for 3 years or less at the best rent may be made <b>by</b> <b>parol.</b>|$|R
50|$|Now this Court has {{accepted}} {{the rule that}} when a contract {{has been reduced to}} writing, the writing is, in general, regarded as the exclusive memorial of the transaction and in a suit between the parties no evidence to prove its terms may be given save the document of secondary evidence of its contents, nor may the contents of such document be contradicted, altered, added to or varied <b>by</b> <b>parol</b> evidence.|$|R
5000|$|Latent {{ambiguity}} {{is where}} the wording of an instrument is {{on the face of}} it clear and intelligible, but may, at the same time, apply equally to two different things or subject matters, as where a legacy is given [...] "to my nephew, John," [...] and the testator is shown to have two nephews of that name. A latent ambiguity may be explained <b>by</b> <b>parol</b> evidence: the ambiguity has been brought about by circumstances extraneous to the instrument, so the explanation must necessarily be sought in such circumstances.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} that transactions involving interests in land {{had to be}} in writing, signed by the “party to be charged” was well established by the Revolution, and appears in numerous colonial and early state court decisions. Infrequently, this decision was cited in support of that proposition. This decision was last known to be cited in or by a court of record in 1872, by a litigant in Kraut's Appeal, 71 Pa. 64, (Pa. 1872) who cited it before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for the premise that the right to pass through defendants' house could not be shown <b>by</b> <b>parol</b> (that is, verbal evidence).|$|R

500|$|Lord Loudoun, {{upset over}} the event, delayed {{implementing}} {{the release of}} French prisoners promised {{as part of the}} terms of surrender. [...] General James Abercrombie, who succeeded Loudoun as commander-in-chief, was asked <b>by</b> <b>paroled</b> members of the 35th Foot to void the agreement so that they would be free to serve in 1758; [...] this he did, and they went on to serve under Jeffery Amherst in his successful British expedition against Louisbourg in 1758. [...] Amherst, who also presided over the surrender of Montreal in 1760, refused the surrendering garrisons at Louisbourg and Montreal the normal honours of war, {{due in part to the}} French failure to uphold the terms of capitulation in this action.|$|R
