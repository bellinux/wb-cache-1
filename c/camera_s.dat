Calibrating a camera model requires a set of calibration data containing known 3 D-to- 2 D point correspondences for the given camera system.

The dynamic range of the (8 bit) video data is extended by approximately 4 magnitudes for both meteors and stellar images using saturation compensation. Camera and lens specific saturation compensation coefficients are derived from artificial variable star laboratory measurements. Saturation compensation significantly increases the number of meteors with measured intensity and improves the estimation of meteoroid mass distribution. Astrometry is automated to determine each image s plate coefficient using appropriate star catalogs. The images are simultaneously intensity calibrated from the contained stars to determine the photon sensitivity and the saturation level referenced above the atmosphere. The <b>camera</b> <b>s</b> spectral response is used to compensate for stellar color index and typical meteor spectra in order to report meteor light curves in traditional visual magnitude units. Recent efforts include improved camera calibration procedures, long focal length "streak" meteor photome&y and two-station track determination.

Whilst cosmic variance and experimental systematics can be alleviated by the multi-tracer method, we here address another systematic—introduced by not using the correct relativistic analysis of the power spectrum on very large scales. In order to reduce the errors we need to include measurements on the largest possible scales. Failure to include the relativistic effects on these scales can introduce significant bias in the best-fit value from future galaxy surveys. Web of Scienc...|$|E
40|$|Color {{constancy}} is {{of important}} for many computer vision applications, such as image classification, color object recognition, object tracking and so on. But unlike the human visual system, imaging device cannot {{be able to}} compute color constant descriptors which do not vary with {{the color of the}} illuminant, so solving color constancy problem is necessary. In the calculation of color constancy, illuminant estimation is the key. Because grey surfaces can perfectly reflect the color of the scene illumination, many methods have been proposed to identify grey surfaces to estimate the illuminant. But they either rely on the <b>camera.</b> <b>s</b> parameters, lacking universality, or work inaccurate in worse conditions. In order to solve these problems, in this paper, an iterative method is proposed. The quality of the proposed method is tested and compared to the previous color constancy methods on the Macbeth Chart and two data sets of synthetic and real images. Through MATLAB simulation, experimental pictures and quantitative data for performance evaluation were gotten. The simulated results show that the proposed algorithm is accurate and efficient in identification of the grey surfaces, even in worse condition. And it performs well in color constancy computation on both synthetic and real images. China High-Tech Industrialization Association; Chinese Society of Astronautics (CSA...|$|E

This system is composed of: (1) a light microscope with a wide working distance (13 mm) at high magnification (ca. 1, 600 -fold magnification on a TV monitor); (2) a movable microscope stage designed to permit the passage of condi-tioned air along {{both sides of a}} fixed leaf and for illuminating from above and below; (3) a high-sensitivity SIT <b>camera</b> (<b>S</b> 20 type spectral response) and a monochromatic TV monitor with high resolution and small distortion, used {{to observe the}} microscope image in a separate room (stomata can be observed with single reflected or transmitted light above ca. 0. 1 mW/cm 2); (4) remote controllers to adjust camera sensitivity, microscope focus and movement of the visual field of the microscope image from the separated observation room. This system solved the problems encountered with an ordinary light microscope in observing stomatal movement of intact growing plants.

The telescope was equipped by CCD <b>camera</b> <b>S</b> 2 C with 14 x 14 arcmin field of view and 824 mas per pix scale. The observations of outer Jovian satellites have been performed in a test mode since January 2015. The exposure time of 30 seconds allows us to obtain images of stars up to magnitude 19. 5 with the present state of the mirror and the equipment. The observations of outer Jovian satellites have been performed during testing period. These objects are interesting targets because their astrometric observations required to improve ephemeris and dynamic studies. Satellites positions have been determined on the basis of CCD images obtained within 6 nights. Astrometric reduction is performed by linear method using HCRF/UCAC 4 and HCRF/URAT 1. Internal accuracy of satellites positions has been estimated as 20 - 100 mas. The absolute values of residuals O-C do not exceed 100 mas in most cases. The independent tests have been carried out by the direct comparison with the results of observations of the Jovian satellite Himalia performed simultaneously by the Normal astrograph (the largest difference was 113 mas).

The production of the movie was challenged by the volume of data {{that needed to be}} processed, namely 40, 500 images with each image (256 x 252) containing over 264 million points (pixel depth 4096). It was also observed during the initial analysis that the RTD surface coating has a different emissivity than the surroundings. This fact added unexpected complexity in obtaining a correlation between RTD data and IR data. A scheme was devised to generate IR data near the RTD location which is not affected by the surface coating This scheme is valid as long as the surface temperature as measured does not change too much over a few pixel distances from the RTD location. After obtaining IR data near the RTD location, it is possible to make a direct comparison with the temperature as measured during the flight after adjusting for the <b>camera</b> <b>s</b> auto scaling. The IR data seems to correlate well to the flight temperature data at three of the four RID locations. The maximum count intensity occurs closely to the maximum temperature as measured during flight. At one location (RTD # 3), there is poor correlation and this must be investigated before any further progress is possible. However, with successful comparisons at three locations, it seems there is great potential {{to be able to find}} a calibration curve for the data.

40|$|Generation and {{texturing}} {{of building}} models is a fast developing field of research. Several techniques {{have been developed}} to extract building geometry and textures from multiple images and image sequences. In this paper, these techniques are discussed and extended to automatically add new textures from infrared (IR) image sequences to existing building models. In contrast to existing work, geometry and textures are not generated together from the same dataset but the textures are extracted from the image sequence and matched to an existing geo-referenced 3 D building model. The texture generation is divided in two main parts. The first part deals with the estimation and refinement of the exterior camera orientation. Feature points are extracted in the images and used as tie points in the sequence. A recorded exterior orientation of the <b>camera</b> <b>s</b> added to these homologous points and a bundle adjustment is performed starting on image pairs and combining the hole sequence. A given 3 d model of the observed building is additionally added to introduce further constraint as ground control points in the bundle adjustment. The second part includes the extraction of textures from the images and the combination of textures from different images of the sequence. Using the reconstructed exterior camera orientation for every image of the sequence, the visible facades are projected into the image and texture is extracted. These textures normally contain only parts of the facade. The partial textures extracted from all images are combined to one facade texture. This texture is stored with a 3 D reference to the corresponding facade. This allows searching for features in textures and localising those features in 3 D space. It will be shown, that the proposed strategy allows texture extraction and mapping even for big building complexes with restricted viewing possibilities and for images with low optical resolution...|$|E
40|$|Stone {{surfaces}} and façades of historic buildings, {{due to their}} predominately outdoor location, suffer from many deterioration factors, including air pollution, soluble salts, relative humidity (RH) /temperature, and biodeterioration, which are the main causes of decay. In particular, the façades of the buildings deteriorate with direct exposure to these factors; deformation and disfiguration of superficial decoration and formation of black crusts are often observed on the stones. The development and application of self-cleaning and protection treatments on historical and architectural stone surfaces could be a significant improvement in the conservation, protection and maintenance of Cultural Heritage. A titanium dioxide nanoparticle has become a promising photocatalytic material, owing to its ability to catalyze the complete degradation of many organic contaminants and environmental factors. In this study, TiO 2 nanoparticles, dispersed in an aqueous colloidal suspension, were applied directly to historic marble stone surfaces, by spray-coating, {{in order to obtain}} a nanometric film over the stone surface. The study started with an investigation of some properties of TiO 2 nanoparticles, to assess the feasibility of the use of TiO 2 on historic stone and architectural surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was, coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis, (SEM-EDX), in order to obtain information on coating homogeneity and surface morphology, before and after artificial aging; the activity of the coated surface was evaluated through UV-light exposure, to evaluate photo-induced effects. The changes of molecular structure occurring in treated samples were spectroscopically studied by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR); activity of the hydrophobic property of the coated surface was evaluated by Sterio microscopy, model Zeiss 2010 from Munich, Germany, equipped with photo <b>camera</b> <b>S</b> 23 under 80 X magnification. The efficacy of the treatments was evaluated through capillary water absorption, and colorimetric measurements, performed to evaluate the optical appearance. Results showed that TiO 2 nanoparticles are good candidates for coating applications on historic stone surfaces, where self-cleaning photo-induced effects are well evident; they enhanced the durability of stone surfaces toward UV aging, improved resistance to relative humidity (RH) /temperature and abrasion affect, reduced accumulation of dirt on stone surfaces when left in open air for 6 months, and did not alter the original features...|$|E
40|$|Based on <b>camera</b> <b>S</b> 1 C 077, having {{success with}} {{developing}} special exterior synchronizer {{in order to}} achieve CCD drift scan mode which can apply to astronomy observation more advantageously. To avoid many questions with full frame CCD drift scan mode, part frame CCD drift scan mode was achieved by software. In order to obtain good circular images of reference stars and GSS (Geo Stationary Satellites), part frame CCD drift scan mode and stare mode were carried out by turns. Making and implementing observation plan for GSS were discussed also. The elementary version of special software for data reduction was finished by ourselves. This special software was called SHAO_GSS_Positioning. The main functions of this software includes detecting stars in FTS file automatically, matching and identifying reference stars automatically, obtaining parameters of suitable plate model and magnitude mode of CCD automatically and finally getting the optical coordinates and visual magnitudes of GSS. By the way, UCAC 2 is used to be the catalogue of reference stars. More than fifty GSS were observed by this system and their coordinates and magnitudes were computed by SHAO_GSS_Positioning. The total internal errors of optical positioning results was about 0. 5 as. There were two main part of error source, the local reference system which was about 0. 15 as and the measurement coordinates of objects which were about 0. 45 as. The better observation condition the station is and the better optical performance the telescope is, The higher precision-position for GSS will be obtained. According to the observing process and the matching result of the previous test which purpose was surveying GSS in one small sky area, a new survey plan was made. The main principle of the new survey plan is always having telescope point to the equator in order to avoid missing the objects which will pass by the area of equator. The advantages and efficiency of the new survey plan were analysed detailedly also. Usually, GSS objects are observed with stare mode so that images of reference stars will be stretched because of the relative movement between telescope and stars. Therefore, a new centering method, that is MGC (mean-geometric-centering), was applied to compute centers of stars. MGC is more precise than moment for computing centers of stretched stars images. In fact, MGC is more suitable for saturated stats images also. 研制成功基于S 1 C 077 相机的外部同步触发装置，使S 1 C 077 相机具有适用于天文观测的CCD漂移扫描（drift scan）功能。为解决通常利用满帧（Full Frame）CCD漂移扫描模式观测带来的诸多问题，通过程序实现了短帧（Part Frame）CCD漂移扫描模式。利用短帧CCD漂移扫描模式和凝视模式交替观测恒星和地球同步卫星，获得参考恒星和地球同步卫星良好的圆星像。讨论了利用此设备观测地球同步卫星观测方案的制定和实施。 针对该设备获得的地球同步卫星的观测资料，独立编制了数据处理软件的初级版本，该软件主要包括以下功能：漂移扫描恒星FTS图像中星像的自动化检测、参考星的匹配与证认、CCD成像模型参数的归算、星等模型参数归算以及最终得到地球同步卫星的光学位置（站心平位置）和视星等。该软件选用UCAC 2 为参考星表。 利用上海天文台的 20 cm马克苏托夫望远镜和 25 cm牛顿－卡塞格林望远镜已经对几十颗地球同步卫星进行了观测。基于该软件对一些实测资料进行了处理，得到了目标的光学位置和视星等。光学定位结果的内部精度约为 0. 5 角秒。详细分析了主要的误差来源，分别是由参考星决定的局部参考架的误差约 0. 15 角秒，目标量度坐标误差约为 0. 45 角秒。当台站观测条件好、望远镜光学性能佳时，地球同步卫星的光学定位精度将会大大提高，理论上可以与该望远镜的恒星定位精度相当。 根据对小天区地球同步卫星搜索的试验性研究，通过对搜索过程和比对结果的分析，提出了新的搜索方案。新搜索方案的出发点是“具有“ 8 ”字运动的有倾角的地球同步卫星总是会在 24 小时内两次穿过赤道”。对新搜索方案的搜索效率和实施优点做了详细的分析和讨论。 通常观测地球同步卫星时采用跟踪卫星的凝视模式观测，针对观测资料中出现的拖长恒星星像的特点，利用平均几何中心法定恒星星像的中心。通过与重心法定拖长星像中心结果的比较，认为确定拖长星像的重心，平均几何中心法要远优于重心法。另外在确定曝光过度星像中心时，平均几何中心法也能够获得精度很高的结果...|$|E
