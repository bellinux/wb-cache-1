500|$|In 2015, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill {{announced}} that a Royal Commission would be held to investigate the state's role in the nuclear fuel cycle. South Australia is currently home to four of Australia's five uranium mines, {{and the possibility of}} the state developing nuclear power generation, enrichment and waste storage facilities have previously proven to be contentious issues. The Royal Commission comes at a time of economic contraction for South Australia, which is suffering from job losses in mining and manufacturing sectors. Immediately following the announcement of the Royal Commission, emeritus Prof. Ian Lowe [...] suggested that the current inquiry risks retreading old ground already covered by several previous public inquiries and proposals for nuclear industrialisation. Lowe referred to the 2006 UMPNER review's finding that substantial government subsidies would be required to support nuclear industrial development in Australia, and the 1976-78 Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (Fox Report), which drew attention to the problems of nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear waste. On 17 April 2015, Lowe was selected as one of five members of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal <b>Commission</b> <b>Expert</b> Advisory Committee.|$|E

The assessment of severity has also changed under the amendments to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986).

The assessment of severity must also be conducted retrospectively, which results in severity being assigned {{on the basis of the}} actual suffering experienced by the animals, rather than what is presumed during study design.

The European Commission has also launched a number of Knowledge Intensive Services Platforms designed to act as laboratories for new public policies for services innovation. Few economic development agencies at the member state level, and fewer still at the regional level, have translated this new thinking on services innovation into policy action.

We explore competing propositions about the character of the Commission’s information system, and test four hypothesis about what affects participation in the EU expert group system. We separate between three kinds of information providers: scientists, societal actors and government officials. The empirical section of the paper builds upon an analysis of a data set covering all of <b>Commission</b> <b>expert</b> groups (N= 1237). Although scientists, and interest groups, industries and NGOs are prevalent information providers for the Commission, we show that the informational foundation is strongly biased towards officials from national administrations. We argue that these distinct patterns of participation increase the ability of the Commission to anticipate reactions to its proposals and initiatives...|$|E
