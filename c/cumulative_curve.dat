40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} cumulative rim/disc area (RA/DA) curve analysis as a clinical tool for the identification of glaucoma induced optic disc pathology.  METHODS— 71 normal and 83  glaucomatous eyes were evaluated {{from a series of}} 154  subjects recruited for this study. For each eye, the cumulative distribution of RA/DA was calculated from 36  equally spaced rim sectors of each optic disc obtained by the automatic evaluation of simultaneous videographics (Image-net X Rev. 3 / 51 b). To increase the sensitivity of this analysis in early glaucoma and in normal eyes, these cumulative curves were subsequently divided into two equal segments and the slopes of their respective regression lines compared.  RESULTS—The median RA/DA value obtained from the 36  sectors was significantly different in glaucomatous eyes compared with normals (p < 0. 001). Nevertheless, the curves (5 th- 95 th percentile of the cumulative curves distribution) of early glaucomatous eyes fell within the normal range. When the <b>cumulative</b> <b>curve</b> of these marginal cases was then divided into two equal segments, the comparison of the slopes of the regression lines showed a significant difference (p < 0. 05) in 100 % of early glaucomatous eyes. Furthermore, normal eyes were shown to be true negatives in 93 % of the cases in which {{no significant difference between the}} two slopes was observed.  CONCLUSION—Analysis of the RA/DA <b>cumulative</b> <b>curve</b> from 36  sectors of the optic disc was a valid method for the identification of glaucomatous disc pathology; however, a further calculation of the slopes of the two RA/DA regression lines was needed to identify early glaucomatous damage.    Keywords: glaucoma; optic disc morphometry; rim/disc area <b>cumulative</b> <b>curve...</b>|$|E

40|$|Chapter 16 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) [1] {{contains}} a widely recognized and well-accepted procedure for calculating per-vehicle control delay at signalized intersections. Appendix F of that chapter discusses {{the relationship between}} various components of control delay using cumulative arrival and departure curves. The delay obtained from these curves has certain limitations {{that need to be}} recognized if proper conclusions are to be drawn. To illustrate these limitations, a comparison is made between the delay obtained from <b>cumulative</b> <b>curves</b> and the delay obtained through a detailed analysis of vehicle trajectories. A comparison of the control delay obtained from trajectory analysis and that obtained from <b>cumulative</b> arrival/departure <b>curves</b> shows that the <b>cumulative</b> <b>curves</b> omit certain valid portions of the control delay, while including other portions of time that are not delay at all. Taking a macroscopic approach to oversaturated delay estimation, the HCM procedures for dealing with oversaturated conditions are described and their shortcomings are explored using an example of a multi-period analysis of an oversaturated approach to a signal. It is demonstrated that the current HCM equations can overestimate multi-period delay and that the assumption of a capacity that is constant from cycle to cycle can underestimate delay at high values of the v/c ratio...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{critical}} challenges {{in the development of}} evacuation models for pedestrian crowds is the lack of complementary data under emergency conditions. Specifically, the study of evacuation behavior of students in schools has been limited in the literature. This paper analyzes school students&# 039; emergency evacuation behavior in earthquakes using data extracted from videos of real emergency evacuation. A comparison between students&# 039; behavior under normal conditions and under emergency circumstances is made to identify the differences. These differences are quantitatively analyzed through regression modeling. Overall, students&# 039; behavior under normal conditions is stable as expected. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>curve</b> of the number of departures can be modeled as a linear function. Differently, students&# 039; emergency evacuation behavior is much more chaotic. Four stages - reaction, acceleration, linearity and saturation - are identified, which form a convex <b>cumulative</b> <b>curve</b> rather than a linear one. It is also found that, under emergency circumstances, students&# 039; reaction time increases substantially, and the mean value as well as the variance of the number of departures per second becomes much larger. However, the reaction time is comparatively lower than those observed from previous studies on adults. Moreover, we could not observe the highly competitive behavior or &# 039;faster is slower effect&# 039; as predicted from previous mathematical models. These results provide useful practical knowledge towards the development of mathematical models intended to simulate the emergency evacuation behavior of students in schools...|$|E
