Dry microcapsules ranged in diameter from about 5 to less than 50 µm and exhibited only a limited extent of surface indentation. Core domains, {{in the form of}} protein-coated droplets, were embedded throughout the wall matrices and no visible cracks connecting these domains with the environment could be detected.

40|$|<b>Core</b> <b>loading</b> {{pattern design}} has great {{influence}} on {{nuclear power plant}} operation. An excellent <b>core</b> <b>loading</b> pattern can not only enhance operation factor, reduce operation cost, but also increase operation safety. Under the premise of nuclear safety, AP 1000 first <b>core</b> <b>loading</b> pattern achieves the goal of low leakage loading by simulating the reactivity distribution of the 18 -month Equilibrium Cycle design. The fuel management {{presented in this paper}} illustrates the economic performance and technical feasibility of the advanced 18 -month cycle first core fuel. The advanced feature of this first core design include: the development of loading pattern that simulates the reactivity distribution of a typical low leakage reload core in order to reduced leakage, the use of radial enrichment zoning in higher enriched assemblies to lower peaking factors, and the use of axial burnable absorber zoning to improve axial power shape control and reduce axial peaking. The discussion provided in this paper demonstrates the ability of the advanced first core design operate safety and efficiently, and the core is designed with adequate peaking factor margin in both base-load and load-follow operation. Finally, this paper analyses the impact brought about by multi-enrichment on the nuclear power plant operation capacity and operation cost, and arrive at a conclusion that precise fuel cycle evaluation such that the enrich uranium and operation costs can be accurately quantified and control in a detailed economic evaluation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} analysis of a deterministic optimization scheme termed Greedy Exhaustive Dual Binary Swap for the optimization of nuclear reactor <b>core</b> <b>loading</b> patterns. The goal of this optimization scheme is to emulate the approach taken by an engineer when manually optimizing a reactor <b>core</b> <b>loading</b> pattern. This is to determine if this approach is able to locate high quality patterns that, due to their location in the <b>core</b> <b>loading</b> solution space, are consistently missed by standard stochastic optimization methods {{such as those in}} the genetic algorithm class, or those in the simulated annealing class. This optimization study is carried out using the poropy tool to handle the reactor physics model. Initially, optimizations are carried out using beginning of cycle eigenvalue as a surrogate for core excess reactivity and thus cycle length. The deterministic Dual Binary Swap is found to locate acceptable patterns less reliably than stochastic methods, but those that are located are of higher quality. Optimizations of the full depletion problem result in the deterministic Dual Binary Swap optimizer locating patterns that are of higher quality than those found by the stochastic Simulated Annealing, with comparable frequency. The Dual Binary Swap optimizer is, however, found to be very dependent on the starting core configuration, and can not reliably find a high quality pattern from any given starting configuration. by Carl C.
