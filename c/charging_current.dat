Inrush current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially {{if there is no}} inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the <b>charging</b> <b>current</b> of the input capacitance.|$|E

The QSH regime of the six-terminal TI|FM|TI nanodevice, attached to two longitudinal and four transverse normal metal electrodes, is characterized by the SO-coupling-induced energy gap, chiral spin-filtered edge states within finite length TI regions, and quantized spin Hall conductance when longitudinal bias voltage is applied, despite the presence of the FM island.
