5|$|The {{hooded crow}} breeds in {{northern}} and eastern Europe, and closely allied forms inhabit southern Europe and western Asia. Where its range overlaps with <b>carrion</b> <b>crow,</b> as in northern Britain, Germany, Denmark, northern Italy, and Siberia, their hybrids are fertile. However, the hybrids are less well-adapted than purebred birds, {{and this is}} one of the reasons this species was split from the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow.</b> Little or no interbreeding occurs in some areas, such as Iran and central Russia.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{lifespan}} is unknown, {{but that}} of the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow</b> is four years. The maximum recorded age for a hooded crow is 16 years, and 9 months.|$|E
5|$|American crows are the {{new world}} {{counterpart}} to the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow</b> and the hooded crow. Although the American crow and the hooded crow are very similar in size, structure and behavior, their calls are different. The American crow nevertheless occupies the same role the hooded crow does in Eurasia.|$|E

5|$|The modern English word raven has {{cognates}} in {{all other}} Germanic languages, including Old Norse (and subsequently modern Icelandic) hrafn and Old High German (h)raban, all which descend from Proto-Germanic *khrabanas.

5|$|It is {{so similar}} in {{morphology}} and habits to the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow</b> (Corvus corone), {{for many years}} they were considered by most authorities to be geographical races of one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the hooded crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased vigour. Within the hooded crow species, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian crow, possibly distinct enough to warrant species status itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} (Cathartes aura), also known in some North American regions as the turkey buzzard (or just buzzard), {{and in some}} areas of the Caribbean as the John crow or <b>carrion</b> <b>crow,</b> is the most {{widespread}} of the New World vultures. One of three species in the genus Cathartes of the family Cathartidae, the turkey vulture ranges from southern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America. It inhabits a variety of open and semi-open areas, including subtropical forests, shrublands, pastures, and deserts.|$|E
40|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} genes that code {{for the major}} histocompatibility complex (MHC) is that alleles often share more similarity between, rather than within species. There are two likely mechanisms that can explain this pattern: convergent evolution and trans-species polymorphism (TSP), in which ancient allelic lineages are maintained by balancing selection and retained by descendant species. Distinguishing between these two mechanisms has major implications in how we view adaptation of immune genes. In this study we analyzed exon 2 of the MHC class IIB in three passerine bird species in the genus Corvus: jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos japonensis) American crows (C. brachyrhynchos) and <b>carrion</b> <b>crows</b> (C. corone orientalis). <b>Carrion</b> <b>crows</b> and American crows are recently diverged, but allopatric, sister species, whereas <b>carrion</b> <b>crows</b> and jungle crows are more distantly related but sympatric species, and possibly share pathogens linked to MHC IIB polymorphisms. These patterns of evolutionary divergence and current geographic ranges enabled us to test for trans-species polymorphism and convergent evolution of the MHC IIB in crows. Phylogenetic reconstructions of MHC IIB sequences revealed several well supported interspecific clusters containing all three species, {{and there was no}} biased clustering of variants among the sympatric <b>carrion</b> <b>crows</b> and jungle crows. The topologies of phylogenetic trees constructed from putatively selected sites were remarkably different than those constructed from putatively neutral sites. In addition, trees constructed using non-synonymous substitutions from a continuous fragment of exon 2 had more, and generally more inclusive, supported interspecific MHC IIB variant clusters than those constructed from the same fragment using synonymous substitutions. These phylogenetic patterns suggest that recombination, especially gene conversion, has partially erased the signal of allelic ancestry in these species. While clustering of positively selected amino acids by supertyping revealed a single supertype shared by only jungle and <b>carrion</b> <b>crows,</b> a pattern consistent with convergence, the overall phylogenetic patterns we observed suggest that TSP, rather than convergence, explains the interspecific allelic similarity of MHC IIB genes in these species of crows...|$|R

50|$|<b>Carrion</b> <b>crows</b> {{can become}} tame near humans, and {{can often be}} found near areas of human {{activity}} or habitation including cities, moors, woodland, sea cliffs and farmland where they compete with other social birds such as gulls and ducks for food in parks and gardens.|$|R
5|$|The IUCN Red List {{does not}} {{distinguish}} the hooded crow from the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow,</b> {{but the two}} species together have an extensive range, estimated at 10millionkm2 (3.8million mi2), and a large population, including an estimated 14 to 34 million individuals in Europe alone. They are not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), so are evaluated as Least Concern. The carrion crow/hooded crow hybrid zone is slowly spreading northwest, but the hooded crow has {{on the order of}} three million territories in just Europe (excluding Russia).|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the crows, {{by having a}} larger and heavier black beak, shaggy {{feathers}} around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black <b>carrion</b> <b>crow</b> (C. corone) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{specific}} examples of corvid cleverness. One <b>carrion</b> <b>crow</b> was documented to crack nuts by placing {{them on a}} crosswalk, letting the passing cars crack the shell, waiting for the light to turn red, and then safely retrieving the contents. A group of crows in England took turns lifting garbage bin lids while their companions collected food.|$|E
50|$|Poelstra and {{coworkers}} sequenced {{almost the entire}} genomes of both species in populations at varying distances from the contact zone {{to find that the}} two species were genetically identical, both in their DNA and in its expression (in the form of mRNA), except for the lack of expression of a small portion (<0.28%) of the genome (situated on avian chromosome 18) in the hooded crow, which imparts the lighter plumage colouration on its torso. Thus the two species can viably hybridize, and occasionally do so at the contact zone, but the all-black <b>carrion</b> <b>crows</b> on the one side of the contact zone mate almost exclusively with other all-black <b>carrion</b> <b>crows,</b> while the same occurs among the hooded crows {{on the other side of}} the contact zone.|$|R
50|$|Known predators of {{eggs and}} goslings include coyotes, Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus), {{northern}} raccoons (Procyon lotor), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), large gulls (Larus species), common ravens (Corvus corax), American <b>crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos), <b>carrion</b> <b>crows</b> (in Europe, Corvus corone) and both brown (Ursus arctos) and American black bears (Ursus americanus).|$|R
50|$|Pied crows are {{generally}} encountered in pairs or small groups, although an abundant {{source of food}} may bring large numbers of birds.

500|$|The {{hooded crow}} is omnivorous, with a diet {{similar to that}} of the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow,</b> and is a {{constant}} scavenger. It drops molluscs and crabs to break them after the manner of the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow,</b> and an old Scottish name for empty sea urchin shells was [...] "crow's cups". On coastal cliffs, the eggs of gulls, cormorants, and other birds are stolen when their owners are absent, and this crow will enter the burrow of the puffin to steal eggs. It will also feed on small mammals, scraps, smaller birds, and carrion. The crow has the habit of hiding food, especially meat or nuts, in places such as rain gutters, flower pots, or in the earth under bushes, to feed on it later, sometimes on the insects that have meanwhile developed on it. Other crows often watch if another one hides food and then search this place later when the other crow has left.|$|E
500|$|The {{hooded crow}} {{was one of}} the many species {{originally}} described by Linnaeus in his 18th-century work Systema Naturae and it bears its original name of Corvus cornix. cens, caplte gula alis caudaque nigris. |url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/10277#page/123/mode/1up}} The binomial name is derived from the Latin words Corvus, [...] "raven", [...] and cornix, [...] "crow". It was subsequently considered a subspecies of the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow</b> for many years, hence known as Corvus corone cornix, due to similarities in structure and habits.|$|E

50|$|Natural predators of L. cervus in Britain include cats, foxes, <b>carrion</b> <b>crows,</b> magpies and kestrels; these tend {{to strike}} at the most {{vulnerable}} stage in the beetle’s life cycle, when adults are seeking to mate and lay eggs. In the case of magpies, they have been observed in the field as waiting for emergence on a single site; subsequently consuming the beetle's abdomen.|$|R
500|$|Nesting occurs {{later in}} colder regions: mid-May to mid-June in {{northwest}} Russia, Shetland, and the Faroe Islands, and late February in the Persian Gulf region. In warmer {{parts of the}} British Isles, the clutch is laid in April. The bulky stick nest is normally placed in a tall tree, but cliff ledges, old buildings, and pylons may be used. Nests are occasionally placed {{on or near the}} ground. The nest resembles that of the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow,</b> but on the coast, seaweed is often interwoven in the structure, and animal bones and wire are also frequently incorporated. The four to six brown-speckled blue eggs are [...] in size and weigh , of which 6% is shell. The altricial young are incubated for 17–19 daysby the female alone, that is fed by the male. They fledge after 32 to 36days. Incubating females have been reported to obtain most of their own food and later that for their young.|$|E
500|$|The Australian raven (Corvus coronoides) is a {{passerine}} bird in {{the genus}} Corvus native to much of southern and northeastern Australia. Measuring [...] in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and mouth, as well as strong grey-black legs and feet. The upperparts are glossy, with a purple, blue or green sheen, and its black feathers have grey bases. The Australian raven is distinguished from the Australian crow species by its throat hackles, which are prominent in adult birds. Older adult individuals have white irises, younger adults have a white irises with an inner blue rim, while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age, and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield described the Australian raven in 1827, its species name highlighting its similarity with the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow</b> (C. corone). Two subspecies are recognised, which differ slightly in calls and are quite divergent genetically.|$|E
500|$|It may not {{immediately}} be clear why the name [...] "blackbird", first recorded in 1486, {{was applied to}} this species, but not {{to one of the}} various other common black English birds, such as the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow,</b> raven, rook, or jackdaw. However, in Old English, and in modern English up to about the 18th century, [...] "bird" [...] was used only for smaller or young birds, and larger ones such as crows were called [...] "fowl". At that time, the blackbird was therefore the only widespread and conspicuous [...] "black bird" [...] in the British Isles. Until about the 17th century, another name for the species was ouzel, ousel or wosel (from Old English osle, cf. German Amsel). Another variant occurs in Act 3 of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, where Bottom refers to [...] "The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew, With Orenge-tawny bill". The ouzel usage survived later in poetry, and still occurs as the name of the closely related ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus), and in water ouzel, an alternative name for the unrelated but superficially similar white-throated dipper (Cinclus cinclus).|$|E
40|$|West Nile virus (WNV) {{outbreaks}} in North America {{have been}} characterized by substantial die-offs of American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). In contrast, a low incidence of bird deaths has been observed during WNV epidemic activity in Europe. To examine the susceptibility of the western European counterpart of American <b>crows,</b> we inoculated <b>carrion</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus corone) with WNV strains isolated in Greece (Gr- 10), Italy (FIN and Ita 09), and Hungary (578 / 10) and with the highly virulent North American genotype strain (NY 99). We also inoculated American crows with a selection of these strains to examine the strains' virulence in a highly susceptible bird species. Infection with all strains, except WNV FIN, resulted in high rates of death and high-level viremia in both bird species and virus dissemination to several organs. These results suggest that <b>carrion</b> <b>crows</b> are highly susceptible to WNV and may potentially be useful as part of dead bird surveillance for early warning of WNV activity in Europe. 26197093 PMC 451773...|$|R

500|$|A mated pair usually {{constructs}} a nest {{by improving}} a crevice by dropping sticks into it; {{it is then}} built {{on top of the}} platform formed. This behaviour has led to the blocking of chimneys and even resulted in nests crashing down into fireplaces, sometimes with birds still on them. Nest platforms can attain a great size. John Mason Neale notes that a [...] "Clerk was allowed by the Churchwarden to have for his own use all that the caddows had brought into the Tower: and he took home, at one time, two cart-loads of good firewood, besides a great quantity of rubbish which he threw away." [...] In his The Natural History of Selborne, Gilbert White notes that western jackdaws used to nest in crevices beneath the lintels of Stonehenge, and describes an example of the bird using a rabbit burrow for nesting. The species has been recorded outcompeting the tawny owl (Strix aluco) for nest sites in the Netherlands. They can take over old nest sites of the black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) and stock dove (Columba oenas). Breeding colonies may also edge out those of the red-billed chough, but in turn be ousted by larger corvids such as the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow,</b> rook or magpie.|$|E
500|$|The Australian raven {{was first}} {{described}} by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, when they reported George Caley's early {{notes on the}} species from the Sydney district. Its specific epithet coronoides [...] "crow-shaped" [...] {{is derived from the}} Greek corone/κορόνη [...] "crow" [...] and eidos/είδος [...] "shape" [...] or [...] "form". The two naturalists regarded the Australian raven as very similar in appearance to the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow</b> (C. corone) of Europe, though they noted it was larger with a longer bill. They did not give it a common name. The location where the type specimen was collected is not recorded, but thought to be in the Parramatta district. Christian Ludwig Brehm described Corvus affinis in 1845, later determined to be this species. In his 1865 Handbook to the Birds of Australia, John Gould recognised only one species of corvid in Australia, Corvus australis, which he called the white-eyed crow. He used Johann Friedrich Gmelin's 1788 name, which predated Vigors and Horsfield's description. In 1877 Richard Bowdler Sharpe recognised two species, but recorded that the feather bases of the type specimen of C. coronoides were white. He named C. coronoides as the [...] "crow" [...] and C. australis (as Corone australis) the [...] "raven". Scottish naturalist William Robert Ogilvie-Grant corrected this in 1912 after re-examining the type specimen, clarifying the species as C. coronoides (raven, and incorporating little and forest ravens) and C. cecilae (Torresian crow).|$|E
500|$|However, {{many other}} types of animals {{have been shown to}} have the ability for object {{permanence}}. These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the <b>carrion</b> <b>crow,</b> Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. [...] Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. [...] Similarly, cats are able to understand object permanence but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats fail to understand that if they see something go into an apparatus in one direction that it will still be there if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats {{did not seem to be}} quite as good at this ‘invisible displacement test’ as dogs are, it’s hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due to the way in which they’ve been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows' ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called ‘A-not-B error’). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. [...] Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the object permanence necessary for them to be able to live independently. [...] The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.|$|E

50|$|Structurally, the {{pied crow}} is better {{thought of as}} a small crow-sized Raven (except the lack of throat hackles, fan-shaped tail and other more crow-like traits), {{especially}} as it can hybridise with the Somali crow (sometimes called the Dwarf Raven) where their ranges meet in the Horn of Africa. Its behaviour, though, is more typical of the Eurasian <b>carrion</b> <b>crows,</b> and it may be a modern link (along with the Somali crow) between the Eurasian crows and the common raven.|$|R
