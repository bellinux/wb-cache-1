50|$|Problems with design coordination, such as time {{consumption}} and ineffectiveness {{related to the}} current 2D paper-based process, {{are some of the}} top concerns of a general contractor, since late conflict correction increases the potential for errors in the field. In order to address this issue, there have been an increasing number of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) firms utilizing building information models (BIM) in their coordination and <b>clash</b> <b>detection</b> processes, which according to practitioners, allows for increased coordination and fewer field problems. Leite et al. compared types of clashes identified in a manual coordination process (overlay of 2D drawings on a light table by pairs of subcontractors) and through automatic <b>clash</b> <b>detection</b> using a Building Information Model (BIM). The automatic <b>clash</b> <b>detection</b> identified several clashes that were missed by the subcontractors, who were performing this task manually. Also, the manual <b>clash</b> <b>detection</b> identified clashes which could not possibly be found by the automatic <b>clash</b> <b>detection</b> software, since one of the clashing objects (e.g. cable trays) was not modeled in the BIM. This study also included site observations of field detected clashes, some of which were not identified in either manual or automatic processes. Leite noted that the combination of clashes identified in coordination meetings, those automatically detected, as well as those identified in the field enable identification of objects that need to be modeled in order to capture the largest possible number of clashes. This paper was limited to the comparison of types of clashes identified {{in each of the three}} methods during a specific project. Although their results cannot be generalized, they still provide insight towards the need to identify what needs to be modeled in a BIM for MEP coordination prior to the start of the coordination process.|$|E

Literature reports many methods used for analysis and optimization and different simulation applications based on assembly connection concept or which use information referring to components mating. Moreover, virtual reality (VR) environments have significantly evolved towards the A/D simulation, highlighting new requirements for the preparation stages and their integration. All these simulations address different objectives: A/D sequencing, path planning, ergonomic analysis etc., and are complementary to each other. The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to propose new tools for enhancing the A/D simulation capabilities and to define a software development pipeline, as part of an on-going research effort aimed at creating a complex virtual assembly simulation platform. In order to do that, firstly a comparative review of the assembly modules available in A/D analysis software and simulation platforms, and the assembly modeling tools provided by commercial Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software is made. Different elements are investigated: mating conditions (geometric constraints) used for reciprocally placing components in an assembly, functions used for contacts generation, as well as <b>clashes</b> and interferences <b>detection</b> tools. Furthermore, the analysis focuses on determining what type of information related to components relative mobility is available in the existing software and how this is used.

40|$|When {{designing}} construction objects, {{different disciplines}} have to collaborate intensively. Each discipline {{is responsible for}} its own contribution to the overall design. However, when the partial designs are combined, objects from different disciplines might occupy the same position in space or 'clash'. Such a clash will often be noticed during the construction process requiring {{a lot of extra}} time and cost. Using 3 D visualization, it is possible to combine the partial designs of all partners and find the clashing objects visually in an early stage. However, when the complexity of a construction project increases, a clash easily stays unnoticed. Besides, much more time is needed for inspecting a complex design. Therefore, an algorithm to discover clashes will be more reliable and efficient. <b>Clash</b> <b>detection</b> techniques are already available in 3 D graphics (referred to as 'collision detection’). There are a great number of methods described on the internet on how to perform this collision detection. All these methods are based on describing objects in terms of 3 D shapes, but do {{not take into account the}} structure/hierarchy of objects that is common in construction projects. In the AEC industry, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) open standard holds this structure next to the 3 D shape of building objects.

The Singaporean government has promoted the use of BIM in the AEC industry to help firms improve their productivity. The objectives of this study are to investigate the BIM adoption status and to identify the hindrances to BIM adoption in Singapore. To achieve the objectives, a preliminary questionnaire survey was performed with 34 professionals. A BIM adoption index (BIMAI) was proposed to measure the extent of BIM adoption. The low average BIMAI implied that the BIM adoption in the Singaporean AEC industry was still immature. Consultants were found to have a higher level of BIM adoption than contractors. Additionally, three-dimensional presentation, <b>clash</b> <b>detection,</b> design coordination, and construction system design were found to be the functions that were significantly applied in practice. Furthermore, the statistical analysis results showed that the mean scores of hindrances ranged from 3. 79 to 2. 65.
