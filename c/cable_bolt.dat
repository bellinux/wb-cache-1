40|$|The {{application}} of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> as a secondary support system {{is an increasing}} trend in underground coal mines worldwide. The performances of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> have been evaluated under both axial and shear loading conditions. Two methods of testing cables for shear, single and double shear, have been recognised. This paper examines the shear behaviour {{of a variety of}} <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> under different pre-tension loads by double shear testing. Plain, spiral and the combination of both cable types were used in this study. The initial axial load and the type of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> are the main factors affecting their shear strength. By increasing the axial pre-tension load, the peak shear load occurs at lower shear displacement. The failure angle due to cable bending across the joint at different pre-tension loads varied between 41 ° and 49 °. This demonstrates that the ratio of axial and perpendicular displacements is almost constant and on average the failure occurs at about 45 °. A novel analytical model is proposed to evaluate the shear behaviour of pre-tensioned fully grouted <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> subjected to double shearing.

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>bolt</b> {{supports}} {{are widely}} used as ground support in underground hard rock and coal mines. During the last two decades, the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> technology has improved significantly and new types of cable bolts, new grouts and new installation methods and pumps have been introduced and successfully developed. The design of cable bolts is currently attempted by empirical methods based on rockmass characterization. However, until such methods do {{not take into account}} all the important parameters affecting the mechanical behaviour of cable bolts namely, the type of cable geometry, grout quality, stiffness of the host medium, the amount of confining pressure and the presence of end anchorage and pretension. This thesis deals with the numerical modelling of cable bolts considering all of the above mentioned factors. To evaluate the shear bond stiffness of cable bolts, which simulate the interface between the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> and the rockmass, a new empirical model is developed. A database with data of pull-out tests is constructed. Empirical relations were derived between the shear bond stiffness and the variation of confining pressure, the modulus of elasticity of host medium and the water:cement ratio. The relations were derived for three types of cables (standard cable, nutcase cable and garford bulb cable). A new numerical model using the finite element method is developed for the numerical simulation of cable bolts. Together with the empirical model for shear bond stiffness, the numerical model computes the load distribution along the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> and thus can simulate fully grouted, partially grouted, end anchored and tensioned cable bolts. The model is implemented in an existing finite element code (e-z tools).

40|$|Bolting is {{currently}} the most commonly accepted rock reinforcing method of dealing with rock strata instability in both surface and underground mines as well as civil engineering. Bolts are installed in fractured rock mass to build composite beams in weak strata or to attach weak excavation surfaces to deeper and competent rock layers to achieve stability. After opening, rock mass around the excavation space experiences stress redistribution and rock fracturing occurs in this process. Bolts installed in the fractured rock mass around excavations normally bear combined tensile and shear loads due to the opening and sliding of rock fractures. Direct shear restraint and high normal stress are applied by the bolt to the fracture surfaces to minimise their displacements. This mechanism allows the excavation surfaces to stabilise and makes them self-supporting. In the interactive process of rock mass and bolt, two load transfer mechanisms are involved: the axial tensioning (axial shearing at the bolt-grout interface, in essence) and the lateral shearing. Axial tensioning was the common focus in past studies, whereas lateral shearing is attracting more attention at present. The strength of the bolt when subjected to both shear and tensile loads is smaller than bolt strength when subjected to tensile load only. Thus, ignoring the shear load in bolting design probably leads to a higher safety factor. Hence, a deep understanding of bolt behaviour subjected to combined loads is essential in bolting system design and assessment. In the past, a number of experimental and theoretical investigations were conducted on the shear behaviour of the rock discontinuity reinforced by rock bolts and a few preliminary conclusions were drawn. Yet, few studies were performed on the shear behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolted</b> rock discontinuities. Thus, this research investigated the shear performance of <b>cable</b> <b>bolted</b> rock discontinuities both experimentally and theoretically to provide more knowledge in this area. A series of experimental studies were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolted</b> concrete joints (representing rock discontinuity) and relevant influencing factors. Double shear tests with joint friction were carried out and test results were analysed in respect of joint shear strength, joint shear displacement, joint shear stiffness, cable pre-tension effect, cable wire surface profile effect, cable failure mode and the shear force-axial force relationship. Double shear tests without joint friction were also carried out using a modified double shear test apparatus. By comparing the double shear tests with and without joint friction, the joint friction and the cable dowel effects on the shear behaviour of cabled concrete joints were studied. British standard single shear tests were also carried out on four <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> and were compared with double shear tests. The comparison showed that the joint shear strength from the British standard single shear tests was {{much smaller than the}} double shear test results and the reason was analysed. Bolts used in underground rock engineering include Fibre Glass (FG) bolts, steel rebar <b>bolts</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> Since these three types of bolts have different mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, shear strength and axial tensile modulus, their reinforcing effect on rock discontinuities are expected to be different. Thus in this study, <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> were compared with FG bolts and steel rebar bolts in terms of reinforcing concrete joints with consideration of their basic mechanical properties. Comparison showed that the influence of their basic mechanical properties on their reinforcing effect on concrete joints was evident. Since the mechanical properties of FG bolts was completely different from the other two types, the FG bolt reinforcing effect on the concrete joint was entirely different. The reinforcing effect of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> and steel rebar bolts was more similar due to their similar mechanical properties. Apart from the experimental investigations, an analytical study was also carried out based on the statically indeterminate beam theory and some conclusions drawn from existing test results, with consideration of most pertinent influencing factors. An analytical model was proposed and compared with the double shear test results, which showed close agreement. In the light of the proposed theoretical method, parametric investigations were performed on four influencing factors, including cable pre-tension, joint friction coefficient, concrete strength and cable installation angle. From the parametric investigations, it was known that the joint friction coefficient and the concrete strength influenced the <b>cable</b> <b>bolted</b> joint shear strength in a consistent manner. However, the cable pre-tension and the cable installation angle affected the cabled joint shear strength in an inconsistent manner. In addition, the cable pre-tension showed opposite influences on cabled joint shear strength when changing the cable failure modulus, which was consistent with the double shear tests on the plain wire cable and the indented wire cable...|$|R

Two double shear apparatuses of different size {{were used for}} the study. The tensile strength, the shear strength and the deformation modulus of bolt control the shear behavior of a sheared bolted joint. Since the strength and deformation modulus of FG bolt, rock bolt and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> obtained from uniaxial tensile tests are different, their shear behavior in reinforcing joints is accordingly different. Test results showed that the shear stiffness of FG bolted joints decreased gradually from the beginning to end, while the shear stiffness of joints reinforced by rock bolt and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> decreased bi-linearly, which is clearly consistent with their tensile deformation modulus. The bolted joint shear stiffness was highly influenced by bolt pretension in the high stiffness stage for both rock bolt and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt,</b> but not in the low stiffness stage. The rock bolt contribution to joint shear strength standardised by the bolt tensile strength was the largest, followed by cable bolts, then FG bolts. Both the rock bolts and cable bolts tended to fail in tension, while FG bolts in shear due to their low shear strength and constant deformation modulus...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the results of}} a study into the effect of rock specimen size on the anchorage performance of a hollow strand bulbed <b>cable</b> <b>bolt.</b> As part of the design of a Laboratory Short Encapsulation Pull Test (LSEPT) facility, a question arose as to the appropriate size of the rock sample in which the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> is embedded and whether size might affect the pull out strength of the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt.</b> An analysis of previous research revealed little information regarding the rationale for the sample size used in previous test work. Many of pull out tests in the past had made use of either a rigid encasment such as steel, aluminium, or PVC casing or a biaxial pressure cell to apply a constant stress to model the in situ rock mass conditions. A test arrangement was developed to assess whether there was any appreciable change in anchorage performance with varying diameter of the rock sample. Cable bolts were embedded into the rock sample using a polyester resin grout having diameters of 150 mm, 215 mm, 300 mm and 450 mm with a constant embedment length of 280 mm. A hollow hydraulic ram was used to load the cable bolts to failure. The results indicate there was a size effect albeit only marginal whereby an increase in the diameter resulted in increased anchorage capacity of the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt...</b>|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to underground excavation design at INCO's Manitoba Division was undertaken by incorporating ground and support monitoring, and numerical modelling into an empirical framework. In {{the first phase of}} the study, a field measurement geomechanics guideline was developed for the Manitoba Division. Work in instrumentation led to the development of a new <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> monitoring device by INCO Ltd. and McGill University. This device has the ability to measure <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> performance reliably and at a low cost. As a result, a cost efficient and effective program is being implemented to monitor <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> layouts representatively. The second phase of the project utilizes the computational power of numerical modelling to aid mine design of stope backs. Results from numerical modelling, presented in the form of stress signatures, suggest that there might be a correlation between back surface stability and calculated values of major and minor principal stresses. By adding the tools of numerical modelling and instrumentation to traditional rock characterization data, a new data base for empirical modelling is established. The continual expansion of this database will lead to a more comprehensive approach to stope back design in the future...|$|E
40|$|Roofbolts – <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> – support {{stiffness}} – rock confinement Roof bolting {{technology in}} Australian coal mines has advanced considerably during the 40 years since introduction. However, there is constant {{need for more}} efficient strata control in mining {{in order to improve}} safety, maximise productivity and decrease costs. Therefore, the changes introduced to roofbolting technology are being assessed and the directions for further future development are discussed. The main area where the majority of improvements have taken place is in the stiffness of the support. The gradual increase of the support stiffness has been achieved mainly by the introduction of chemical anchors and full encapsulation of bolts, higher grades of steel with more efficient deformations and the introduction of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> and resin grouted strand bolts. Another important development occurred in the area of direct application of confinement to the rock mass by applying high support pre-tension. All the changes introduced to roof bolting technology which have resulted in better rock reinforcement are analysed and the directions for further future development are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} and cementing characteristics of single strand wire rope used as material of <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> for supporting ground around underground openings were investigated. Results of tension {{tests showed that}} Young's modulus of the wire rope was approximately {{equal to that of}} steel rod and that lateral deformation of the rope was about 30 % larger than that of steel rod. Results of pull out test of the wire rope buried in cement mortar showed that tensile force in the rope concentrates in the neighborhood of surface of surface of the mortar, and decreases exponentially torwards inside. Pull out load per unit buried length of the wire rope increased with the buried length. From the results of pull out tests, minimum buried length which brings tension break of the rope seems to be a little larger than one meter. The single strand wire rope used in this experiment seems to be about the same as the ordinary deformed steel rod for rock bolting in its axial rigidity or cementing characteristics. <b>Cable</b> <b>bolting</b> ground support seems to be effective for stabilizing large loosened ground around underground openings...|$|R
40|$|Rock bolts {{have been}} {{extensively}} {{used as a}} support element in coal mines in the US for about 40 years. Longwall development and partial extraction room-and-pillar mining systems now rely heavily on fully-grouted roof bolts as the primary support with as needed inclined <b>bolts,</b> trusses, and <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> as secondary support. These two coal mining systems develop 3 - and 4 -way intersections during extraction processes. A study of Illinois (2004 - 2008) and US coal mines found that over 70...|$|R
