50|$|The <b>Country</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Names</b> Supporting Organization (ccNSO) of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is the policy-development {{body for}} {{a narrow range}} of global issues {{regarding}} country code top-level domains (ccTLD) within the ICANN structure.|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} three Supporting Organizations. The Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) deals with policy making on generic top-level domains (gTLDs). The <b>Country</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Names</b> Supporting Organization (ccNSO) deals with policy making on country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs). The Address Supporting Organization (ASO) deals with policy making on IP addresses.|$|R
5000|$|Algorithmic and code {{efficiency}} (data {{need only}} be encoded once and branch table code is usually compact), {{and the potential}} to attain high data compression ratios. For example, when compressing <b>country</b> <b>names</b> to <b>country</b> <b>codes,</b> a string such as [...] "Central African Republic" [...] can be compressed to a single index, resulting in large savings - particularly when the string appears many times. In addition, this same index {{can be used to}} access related data in separate tables, reducing storage requirements further.|$|R
50|$|The ALAC {{appoints}} one non-voting {{representative to}} the councils of the Generic Names Supporting Organization and to the <b>Country</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Names</b> Supporting Organization, and liaisons to ICANN working groups and task forces. It also appoints five members (one per geographic region) of ICANN's Nominating Committee. It has some statutory authority, though limited, to influence ICANN's policy making activities. However, it usually shares its opinions through non-binding advisory statements sent to the ICANN Board.|$|R

25|$|The limited set of ASCII {{characters}} {{permitted in}} the DNS prevented {{the representation of}} names and words of many languages in their native alphabets or scripts. To make this possible, ICANN approved the Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) system, by which user applications, such as web browsers, map Unicode strings into the valid DNS character set using Punycode. In 2009 ICANN approved the installation of internationalized domain <b>name</b> <b>country</b> <b>code</b> top-level domains (ccTLDs). In addition, many registries of the existing top level domain names (TLDs) have adopted the IDNA system.|$|R
5000|$|The ICANN board {{approved}} {{the establishment of}} an internationalized top-level domain name working group within the <b>Country</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Names</b> Supporting Organization (ccNSO) in December 2006. They resolved in June 2007 inter alia to proceed and asked the IDNC Working Group to prepare a proposal, which the group delivered in June 2008, [...] "to recommend mechanisms to introduce a limited number of non-contentious IDN ccTLDs, associated with the ISO 3166-1 two-letter codes in a short time frame to meet near term demand." [...] The group proposed a methodology using ICANN's Fast Track Process based on the ICANN charter to work with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2009, ICANN {{resolved}} to start accepting applications for top-level internationalized domain names from representatives of {{countries and territories}} in November. [...] Starting November 16, 2009, nations and territories could apply for IDN ccTLDs. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Russian Federation {{were among the first}} countries to apply for the new internationalized domain <b>name</b> <b>country</b> <b>code</b> top-level domains. In January 2010 ICANN announced that these countries' IDN ccTLDs were the first four new IDN ccTLDs to have passed the Fast Track String Evaluation within the domain application process. [...] In May 2010, 21 different countries representing 11 languages, including Chinese, Russian, Tamil, and Thai, had requested new IDN country codes.|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{global data}} bases on the {{geographic}} and seasonal distribution of rice cultivation and associated methane emission, compiled by Matthews et al., were archived for public use. In {{addition to the}} primary data sets identifying location, seasonality, and methane emission from rice cultivation, a series of supporting data sets is included, allowing users not only to replicate the work of Matthews et al. but to investigate alternative cultivation and emission scenarios. The suite of databases provided, at 1 latitude by 1 longitude resolution for the globe, includes (1) locations of rice cultivation, (2) monthly arrays of actively growing rice areas, (3) countries and political subdivisions, and (4) monthly arrays of methane emission from rice cultivation. Ancillary data include (1) a listing, by country, of harvested rice areas and seasonal distribution of crop cycles and (2) <b>country</b> <b>names</b> and <b>codes.</b> Summary tables of zonal/monthly distributions of actively growing rice areas and of methane emissions are presented. Users should consult original publications for complete discussion of the data bases. This short paper is designed only to document formats of the distributed information and briefly describe {{the contents of the}} data sets and their initial application to evaluating the role of rice cultivation in the methane budget...|$|R

In the fifties he was member of editorial staff of Poglądy (Opinions) On 1958 he got out the stage play Domek z ogródkiem (House with an Allotment garden), that is meant for amateur theatre. 1959 following plays were published: [...] "Na granicy Górnego Śląska" [...] (at the frontier of upper silesia) and [...] "Umowa stoi" [...] (the agreement is fixed), further in 1960 the one-act play [...] "Szarwark" [...] (corvée).|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} forty years, {{there has been}} {{considerable}} international work on <b>country</b> <b>names,</b> their exonyms and their standardization. This work {{has been based on}} official written names. In contrast, this paper examines several issues relating to nonwritten <b>country</b> <b>names</b> within Deaf communities. First, the various systems used to form <b>country</b> <b>names</b> within signed languages are outlined. These can include “descriptive” semantic etymology based on behavioural traits of individuals from the countries, elements transferred from the spoken or written form of a name, via mouthing, finger spelling (using a manual alphabet), and loan translation of {{all or part of the}} name. Second, four issues in regard to <b>country</b> <b>name</b> signs are commented on, namely (a) the relationship between official languages and signed languages, (b) generational differences in the use of specific <b>country</b> <b>names,</b> (c) the influence of political correctness on <b>country</b> <b>names,</b> and (d) the work of the World Federation of the Deaf on <b>country</b> <b>names,</b> specifically the publication of Gestuno in 1975 and the consequential development of International Sign Pidgin. The final matter to be treated is exonyms and their standardization in signed rather than written languages...|$|R
