40|$|The {{development}} of smart connected prototypes is {{becoming part of}} the designers' toolbox. These connected prototypes allow collecting data about the way people use them. There is an opportunity to examine how is data collection beneficial already during the design process of a <b>connected</b> <b>product.</b> The way to test the proposition of a connected prototype is by testing it with users. Therefore, companies setup home placement tests by multidisciplinary teams. The current home placement tests lack a tool that enables real time data collection, and real-time two way communication between the designer team and the participants of the home placement test. This thesis proposes a home placement test management tool. Twelve main features are made possible by the proposed home placement test management tool during the design process of a <b>connected</b> <b>product.</b> These twelve features are introduced in three related areas. Firstly, it is discussed how the tool improves knowledge transfer between the participants of the home placement test, and among the creators of the home placement test. Secondly, it is discussed what enhancements does data collection and access to data bring to the design process. Thirdly, it is discussed how to design services for inter-connected products. The findings of this thesis are based on a six months internship at Philips Design. The aim of the internship was creating a home placement test of a <b>connected</b> <b>product</b> that collects data about the product use by the participants. The work presented in this thesis is evaluated and examined based on a case study from the industry...|$|E

Instead, the IoT brings additional challenges connected to the change of the customer-provider relationship, the need for a new business model, the need to understand the IoT ecosystem to make a product fit in, and the challenge of getting access to all the different competences needed. Our results suggest that governmental strategies, funding systems, investors and other stakeholders need to broaden the perspective on the IoT from a technological focus to include many other aspects that must be in place for companies to succeed in the IoT world, such as business models and customer relationship, as well as the positioning of a product in an IoT ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to use supply chain {{management}} in a wood furniture company and find its effect on the management indices of that company. The supply chain is a complex system consisting three or more commercial units which directly include at least one <b>connected</b> <b>product</b> procedure, financial service, and/or information from one source to a customer. In fact, in every company and factory, a cycle is carried out from raw material producing stage to product delivery to final customer. To be more precise, this cycle itself includes different rings such as provider, producer, and customer. Actually, in creating present procedures, time factor should be reduced to satisfy the customer more. In this study, data connected to a wood furniture company were provided through supply chain management model. Likewise, optimized program was offered using GAMS programming software. Considering the acquired results, the use of this model can revolutionize the wood furniture industry of Iran, regarding competitive features.

40|$|How can {{manufacturers}} {{or service}} companies provide better services with connected products, without having acquired a powerful IT infrastructure nor the competences for software development? Today companies can {{appeal to a}} relocated-IT-infrastructure provider, which is called Cloud. Consequently, {{they do not have}} to manage and take care of the safety/security aspect, the updates and the breakdown of the infrastructure internally, as those are all managed by the provider. It is possible to outsource the development of the software of the <b>connected</b> <b>product</b> to an external company. However, the question now is how fast this company can juggle from one Cloud to another in order to fulfil their clients wishes? neverMind offers a solution based on a multi-protocols-platform linking the different connected products to a multitude of Clouds without having to redesign the whole communication stack/building block for each change in the Cloud-solution.

The development follows the V-Model, the first steps to understand the complexity of the project were the realisation of the product technical and architectural specifications. The last step before the Implementation was to design in details the progress and the process of every parts of the platform. The outcome of the requirements analysis led me to divide the project in two parts: • a “General Interface” acting as a gateway between the Client-application and “Cloud-modules” • the “Cloud-modules” themselves.

40|$|For closed 3 -manifolds, Heegaard Floer {{homology}} {{is related}} to the Thurston norm through results due to Ozsváth and Szabó, Ni, and Hedden. For example, given a closed 3 -manifold Y, there is a bijection between vertices of the HF^+(Y) polytope carrying the group Z and the faces of the Thurston norm unit ball that correspond to fibrations of Y over the unit circle. Moreover, the Thurston norm unit ball of Y is dual to the polytope of (Y). We prove a similar bijection and duality result for a class of 3 -manifolds with boundary called sutured manifolds. A sutured manifold is essentially a cobordism between two surfaces R_+ and R_- that have nonempty boundary. We show that there is a bijection between vertices of the sutured Floer polytope carrying the group Z and equivalence classes of taut depth one foliations that form the foliation cones of Cantwell and Conlon. Moreover, we show that a function defined by Juhász, which we call the geometric sutured function,is analogous to the Thurston norm in this context. In some cases, this function is an asymmetric norm and our duality result is that appropriate faces of this norm's unit ball subtend the foliation cones. An important step in our work is the following fact: a sutured manifold admits a fibration or a taut depth one foliation whose sole compact leaves are exactly the connected components of R_+ and R_-, if and only if, there is a surface decomposition of the sutured manifold resulting in a <b>connected</b> <b>product</b> manifold.

40|$|The {{internet}} platform geoinformation. net offers 14 modules with a {{huge amount}} of content to support blended learning proposals. The content covers a basic set of academics with the intention to provide a basic curriculum for geoinformation. A fundamental concern during the development of geoinformation. net was to ensure a maximum of flexibility in terms of content combination and extensibility of the content pool. Closely connected with this point was the hope to increase the level of content reuse by reducing the content adoption barrier level. Starting from the geoinformation. net platform there are several demands to make on the functionality of the interaction tool, the LectureBuilder. Those demands include technical demands {{on the one hand and}} interaction demands on the other hand. Due to this, one demand was to support the geoinformation. net specific lecture navigation, as described in (Steinrücken&Plümer, 2004), and the geoinformation. net specific stylesheets for any lecture created by the LectureBuilder. Furthermore a user management is required to remember once created lectures of registrated users to enable them to edit these lectures and then download them again. To achieve a long-term usability of the LectureBuilder and the <b>connected</b> <b>product,</b> the lectures, the LectureBuilder is based on polpular international standards, like the content modules.

40|$|Growth” is {{endemic to}} our {{economic}} system. Economies of scale, long-held as critical means to efficiency and profitability, {{have taken on}} new meanings: whereas they once relied on {{the skills of the}} mechanical engineer to realize wide-scaling manufacturing capabilities, our cultural shift towards the individual means a focus placed on customization of both product research and design. In the age of networked information and networked publics—built on the “solutions” of large, multinational companies like Cisco and EMC, as well as small, <b>connected</b> <b>product</b> and service startups— this paradoxical emphasis on broad ranging customization is resolved through the automated tools at our disposal today: platforms, data, and algorithms, to name a few. Throughout the decades, however, scalability and growth has always been perceived as essential by investors and the public alike. As commercial practitioners, we are often tasked with the design and development of projects meant to reach a large audience—at the time of release or further down the line. For instance, a website for a large NGO must scale in terms of both content and reach, accommodating a broad swath of information types for a global audience. Increasingly, as the integration of social streams and other “open” sources of content becomes valued by clients, the access of publicly available APIs requires an accommodation of the parameters set by those sources—often multi-billion dollar corporations. To develop designs and technologies that scale, we build on or develop our own platforms. These platforms include those with which we are familiar and interact every day, such as YouTube (and its API), Twitter, and various content management systems such as SiteCore or WordPress. The way in which we are able to design for scale today is enabled by our ability to capture a tremendous (and often overwhelming) amount of data. “Big Data” has become common parlance. We use the data that we capture to make inferences about the users for whom we design, giving us the ability to scale solutions across geographies, demographics, and markets. Algorithms are pervasive in today’s experience of designing at scale, especially as the time and cognition required to process the volume of information with which we interact increases. Once the sources of our data and content are identified, in order to present that information back to our end-user in a means unique to our project, we must process it. Infusing this data with value requires moving it through algorithms—ones that aggregate, analyze, modify, and more...|$|E

40|$|Each {{chapter of}} this thesis is a {{self-contained}} article on sutured Floer homology. Chapter 1 : This {{article is a}} purely expository introduction to sutured Floer homology for graduate students in geometry and topology. The article contains {{most of the things}} the author wishes she had known when she started her journey into the world of sutured Floer homology. It is divided into three parts. The first part is an introductory level exposition of Lagrangian Floer homology. The second part is a construction of Heegaard Floer homology as a special, and slightly modified, case of Lagrangian Floer homology. The third part covers the background on sutured manifolds, the definition of sutured Floer homology, as well as a discussion of its most basic properties and implications (it detects the product, behaves nicely under surface decompositions, defines an asymmetric polytope, its Euler characteristic is computable using Fox calculus). Chapter 2 : We exhibit the first example of a knot K in the three-sphere with a pair of minimal genus Seifert surfaces R 1 and R 2 that can be distinguished using the sutured Floer homology of their complementary manifolds together with the Spinc-grading. This answers a question of Juh´asz. More precisely, we show that the Euler characteristic of the sutured Floer homology distinguishes between R 1 and R 2, as does the sutured Floer polytope introduced by Juh´asz. Actually, we exhibit an infinite family of knots with pairs of Seifert surfaces that can be distinguished by the Euler characteristic. Chapter 3 : For closed 3 -manifolds, Heegaard Floer homology is related to the Thurston norm through results due to Ozsv´ath and Szab´o, Ni, and Hedden. For example, given a closed 3 -manifold Y, there is a bijection between vertices of the HF+(Y) polytope carrying the group Z and the faces of the Thurston norm unit ball that correspond to fibrations of Y over the unit circle. Moreover, the Thurston norm unit ball of Y is dual to the polytope of dHF(Y). We prove a similar bijection and duality result for a class of 3 -manifolds with boundary called sutured manifolds. A sutured manifold is essentially a cobordism between two possibly disconnected surfaces with boundary R+ and R−. We show that there is a bijection between vertices of the sutured Floer polytope carrying the group Z and equivalence classes of taut depth one foliations that form the foliation cones of Cantwell and Conlon. Moreover, we show that a function defined by Juh´asz, which we call the geometric sutured function, is analogous to the Thurston norm in this context.
