5|$|Recently archaeologists say six cannons {{recovered}} from a river in Panama that could have belonged to legendary pirate Henry Morgan are being studied and <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> be displayed after going through a restoration process.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 May General Winkelman {{remained}} moderately optimistic. He still assumed a firm defence line <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> be established in North Brabant {{with the help of}} the French and expected good progress could be made in eliminating the airborne forces, while not being aware of any special danger to the Grebbe Line. During the day his hopes would be dashed.|$|E
5|$|Amid growing {{military}} setbacks, Vietnam {{signed the}} Treaty of Saigon in June 1862, losing three southern provinces {{which became the}} French colony of Cochinchina. Tự Đức hoped that by abiding by the treaty, Vietnam <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> negotiate the future return of the territory. He ordered the partisans to disband, but Định refused to recognise the treaty and disobeyed the monarch, fighting on in defense of his homeland. With the loss of imperial support, Định's forces began to struggle against the superior resources of the French. His men were gradually worn down and, following an ambush, Định committed suicide to avoid being captured.|$|E

50|$|It is {{hypothesised}} that Grippia became extinct {{because it}} was outcompeted by more advanced ichthyosaurs. This limited {{the amount of food}} that Grippia <b>could</b> secure, <b>eventually</b> leading it to its extinction around 235 Ma.|$|R
5000|$|Master of Science (by Entrepreneurship) {{exposes the}} {{students}} to opportunities in entrepreneurship and requires them to design and test the commercial viability of products/processes or business models and services that <b>could</b> be <b>eventually</b> commercialized.|$|R
5|$|In late 2011, the FAA {{assigned}} a common type rating to the 787 and 777, allowing pilots qualified on either aircraft to operate both models, due to related design features. The smaller 787 {{was the first}} stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Reportedly, the 777 <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> be replaced by a new aircraft family, Yellowstone 3, which would draw upon technologies from the 787.|$|E
5|$|It is believed, {{based on}} the {{ecological}} conditions, that C.maenas <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> extend its range to colonise the Pacific coast of North America from Baja California to Alaska. Similar ecological conditions {{are to be found}} on many of the world's coasts, with the only large potential area not to have been invaded yet being New Zealand; the New Zealand government has taken action, including the release of a Marine Pest Guide in an effort to prevent colonisation by C.maenas.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> be perfected.|$|E
50|$|In 2011-12, André netted 12 {{times from}} his midfield {{position}} to help Varzim return to division two {{after just one}} year, even though the team <b>could</b> not <b>eventually</b> promote due to irregularities. In the off-season, he signed with Vitória S.C. in the Primeira Liga.|$|R
50|$|The facts {{surrounding}} her medical condition are controversial and cannot be independently verified {{because she has}} refused to release her medical records, citing her lawsuit. However, the Mayo Clinic, where the surgery was performed, has stated that she <b>could</b> have <b>eventually</b> lost her sight without surgery.|$|R
50|$|Miami's final {{regular season}} game came {{at home against}} #8 South Carolina. South Carolina played a {{spirited}} game and gave the Hurricanes all they <b>could</b> handle. <b>Eventually,</b> Miami was able {{to walk away from}} the nail biter with a hard fought 20-16 victory, capping an 11-0 regular season.|$|R
5|$|On 20 June 2010, 611 C3 Picassos built between January and March 2010 were {{recalled}} due to incorrectly routed fuel pipes, {{which were}} {{believed to have been}} in contact with the heat shield. This fault may have caused chafing and may lead to a fuel leak. The models were built between January and March 2010 and were sold in the UK. On 24 August 2010, all 13,234 Picassos sold in the UK were recalled because the windscreen trim could deteriorate, and <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> detach, leading to a loose-fitting windscreen.|$|E
5|$|Such a shell {{would have}} no net {{gravitational}} interaction with its englobed star (see shell theorem), and could drift {{in relation to the}} central star. If such movements went uncorrected, they <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> result in a collision between the sphere and the star—most likely with disastrous results. Such structures would need either some form of propulsion to counteract any drift, or some way to repel the surface of the sphere away from the star.|$|E
5|$|There {{had also}} been {{criticism}} of the proposed definition of double planet: at present the Moon {{is defined as a}} satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon barycenter will drift outwards (see tidal acceleration) and <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> become situated outside of both bodies. This development would then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect the Sun to expand into a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E
25|$|After graduating, Mark put {{out five}} mixtapes and began {{circulating}} them in malls, clubs, {{radio stations and}} anywhere else he <b>could.</b> He <b>eventually</b> got an opportunity to open up for Lil Wayne & Juelz Santana during their I Can't Feel My Face tour. He also opened up for Lil Boosie.|$|R
50|$|However, Vigliotto's 105th victim {{decided to}} find him herself. She had met Vigliotto in a flea market, so she decided to drive through all the flea markets she <b>could</b> find. <b>Eventually</b> she found Vigliotto in Florida, where he was selling her furniture. She {{informed}} the police and Vigliotto was arrested.|$|R

5|$|Before {{the early}} 1990s, New World Order conspiracism {{was limited to}} two American countercultures, {{primarily}} the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios. Those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.|$|E
5|$|On 3 or 4January 1644, {{the five}} leading dissenting brethren signalled {{a break with}} the rest of the Assembly when they {{published}} An Apologeticall Narration, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations. By 17January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, {{failure to maintain}} infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the five member nations, which <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> lead to a common East African shilling.|$|E
50|$|In season four episode 13 of Highlander, an Immortal Native American named Coltec, {{who took}} it upon himself to rid the world of evil by killing as many evil Immortals as he <b>could,</b> was <b>eventually</b> {{overwhelmed}} by the Dark Quickening. Duncan MacLeod was forced to kill his friend and was himself overwhelmed.|$|R
50|$|It {{remained}} unclear as to {{what the}} future relationship between the Institute, Bennett and Shah <b>could</b> become. <b>Eventually</b> Bennett decided to put Coombe Springs at Shah's disposal to do with as he saw fit. In October 1965 at an extraordinary General Meeting of the Institute, Bennett persuaded the membership to take this step.|$|R
50|$|Theia {{is thought}} to have orbited in the L4 or L5 {{configuration}} presented by the Earth-Sun system, where it would tend to remain. In that case, it would have grown, potentially to a size comparable to Mars. Gravitational perturbations by Venus <b>could</b> have <b>eventually</b> put it onto a collision course with the Earth.|$|R
5|$|The 2006 Riga summit {{was held}} in Riga, Latvia, and {{highlighted}} the issue of energy security. It was the first NATO summit {{to be held in}} a country that {{had been part of the}} Soviet Union. At the April 2008 summit in Bucharest, Romania, NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania and both countries joined NATO in April 2009. Ukraine and Georgia were also told that they <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> become members. The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia, as did NATO plans for a missile defence system. Studies for this system began in 2002, with negotiations centered on anti-ballistic missiles being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia, both presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev criticized it as a threat.|$|E
5|$|The federal government, which {{owned and}} {{operated}} Dulles Airport before Congress created the MWAA, built the Dulles Access Road in the 1960s to connect the airport to Washington by way of Interstate 66. As the access road was built, the government opted to reserve the median of the road for some form of rail transit, and the nearby West Falls Church station was designed so that the line <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> be extended in this direction. The original 1968 Metrorail plan included an eventual extension to Dulles airport. In 1969, Senator William Spong of Virginia tried unsuccessfully to have the extension to Dulles be built {{as part of an}} early stage of the system rather than having it be built at some unspecified time in the future. A 1971 study of the feasibility of Metrorail running to Dulles estimated that 30,000 people would ride the extension each day.|$|E
5|$|The main Austro-Hungarian {{force of}} three light cruisers trailed the leading destroyers by a {{considerable}} distance and Commander Miklós Horthy spotted the Allied force around 09:05. Acton spotted them {{about five minutes}} later and manoeuvred his ships to cover the disabled Aquila rather than crossing the Austrians' T. The British ships opened fire about 09:30, although Horthy's ships quickly laid a smoke screen and turned away through it. Both sides settled on parallel courses to the north-northwest and Bristol gradually began to fall behind and <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> only use her bow gun at very long range before ceasing fire at 10:15. The British fire was moderately effective, but the Austrian ships concentrated their fire on Dartmouth which was hit three times, although not significantly damaged. Acton reduced his speed around 10:45 to allow Bristol to catch up. At 10:58 he ordered speed to be increased and turned two minutes later in an unsuccessful attempt {{to cut off the}} trailing Austrian cruiser. At 11:04, the British cruisers ceased fire and turned away on Acton's order, presumably to avoid encountering Austro-Hungarian reinforcements which Acton knew were en route. During the battle the British cruisers were repeatedly attacked by Austro-Hungarian aircraft, but they inflicted no significant damage or casualties.|$|E
30|$|Optimisation of the bioelectricity energy {{generation}} mechanism {{so that the}} wastewater treatment process can be largely self-sustaining. This would mean comparing the typical energy needs of traditional wastewater treatment processes in the Caribbean region using typical municipal and industrial waste streams with possible MFC bioelectricity generation setups to ascertain if a zero-energy system <b>could</b> be <b>eventually</b> developed.|$|R
50|$|A supplementation trial <b>could</b> be <b>eventually</b> {{conducted}} in 2010 by introducing captive-born chicks {{into the wild}} colony in Palmyra. For this aim, a first captive breeding center was established in Palmyra. Three chicks introduced at the wild colony in Palmyra followed a migrating wild adult for more than 1000 km from Palmyra well into south-west Saudi Arabia.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to being a demonstration craft, Sunjammer was to collect scientific data in its own right. With several instruments to detect various aspects of space weather, Sunjammer <b>could</b> have <b>eventually</b> become part of a larger network of solar sails studying the Sun, allowing {{for the creation of a}} more robust early-warning system for space weather.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, {{scientists}} {{announced that}} the more cost effective saliva testing <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> replace some blood tests, as saliva contains 20% of the proteins found in blood.|$|E
25|$|In {{brain tumors}} (primary or metastatic), {{dexamethasone}} {{is used to}} counteract the development of edema, which <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> compress other brain structures. It is also given in cord compression, where a tumor is compressing the spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} up to 4000 people <b>could</b> <b>eventually</b> die of {{radiation}} exposure from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP) accident nearly 20 years ago, an international team of more than 100 scientists has concluded.|$|E

5000|$|Till the {{beginning}} of the French revolution, the Hamburger Correspondent was almost the only gazette in Germany which derived its information respecting foreign countries from original correspondence. The Neue Zeitung, in Hamburg, <b>could</b> not <b>eventually</b> sustain competition with it, and was discontinued. From these and similar sources, articles were copied into hundreds of provincial papers, and this was then called editing a gazette.|$|R
