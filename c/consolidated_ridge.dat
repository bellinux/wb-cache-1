50|$|The blocks {{making up}} {{pressure}} ridges are {{mostly from the}} thinner ice floe involved in the interaction, {{but it can also}} include pieces from the other floe if it is not too thick. In the summer, the ridge can undergo a significant amount of weathering, which turns it into a smooth hill. During this process, the ice loses its salinity (as a result of brine drainage). This is known as an aged ridge. A <b>consolidated</b> <b>ridge</b> is one whose base has undergone complete freezing. The term consolidated layer is used to designate freezing up of the rubble just below the water line. The existence of a consolidated layer depends on air temperature — in this layer, the water between individual blocks is frozen, with a resulting reduction in porosity and an increase in mechanical strength. A keel's depth of an ice ridge is much higher than its sail's height - typically about four times. The keel is also 2-3 times wider than the sail.|$|E

40|$|Conical {{structures}} {{are often used}} to ameliorate the action of floating ice. There is {{a long history of}} using cone-shaped bridge piers. Moreover, many recent designs adopt downward-breaking cones to further reduce ice forces. The present work aims to clarify aspects of ice interaction with cones that are poorly understood. This work builds on a previous study that employed a numerical model of ice dynamics in order to predict ice failure patterns and forces on a conical structure. Performance of the model was validated against available ice basin tests, and the study examined a test case representing a pier of the Confederation Bridge, Canada. The present tests examine the roles of ice-structure friction and shape of the cone (upward- or downward-breaking) in more detail. Additionally, the effects of ice thickness and embedded <b>consolidated</b> <b>ridges</b> are examined. The results reveal trends of the dependence of the modes of ice failure and the resulting forces on ice-structure friction, slope and the type of the cone (upward- or downward-breaking). For upward-breaking cones, ice-structure friction proved to be more significant for gentler slopes than for steeper ones. For those cones, ice failure appeared to correspond to three-dimensional buckling. Downward-breaking cones displayed a different behavior with downwards bending failure. The value of the ice-structure friction coefficient had a clear influence on the forces for all downward-breaking cases. The results also support the idea that downward-breaking cones correspond to lower horizontal forces than those acting on upward-breaking cones. Concerning ice sheet thickness, peak horizontal ice forces show a near linear dependence on the thickness. For large <b>consolidated</b> <b>ridges,</b> forces increased substantially. The numerical model results are compared with the elastic beam bending approach given in the ISO 19906 Arctic Offshore Structures Standard for ice loading on a sloped structure. In order to use the equations in ISO 19906, assumptions must be made on the maximum accumulated rubble height and other parameters, which affect the calculated load. The peak loads from the model and ISO approach are similar for level ice interactions, although the ISO approach is more sensitive to ice-structure friction. Also, the ISO approach may overestimate the load generated by some ridge geometries. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|Ice {{actions on}} {{offshore}} structures {{are one of}} the main concerns for engineering activities in cold areas with ice-infested waters. This thesis deals with three aspects of ice actions, namely design ice loads from level ice, dynamic ice actions of resonant character, and the actions caused by ridged ice. Ice pressures on full-scale structures have been summarized in the present work. The scatter in reported values has been partly explained by categorization with respect to the applied measuring devices, structural characteristics and geographical locations. An existing design code was found to fit well for the widest structures and dramatically over-predict ice loads for structures of widths less than four metres. The present work was concerned with the analyses of full-scale data from the Norströmsgrund lighthouse conducted in the LOLEIF and STRICE projects (1999 - 2003). Analyses of time records from ice crushing indicate that the effective structural width should not be reduced from full width when predicting design ice loads. New applications of continuous wavelet transforms have been presented using the Morlet wavelet for the detection of intervals with ice loads of resonant character. The typical length of intervals with ice-induced structural vibrations appeared to be from 1. 9 - 8. 6 seconds; however, one interval lasting for 80 seconds was also detected. Ice loads of resonant character were found to occur more frequently warmer the ice. A critical speed was also found. This critical speed seemed to be higher the thicker the ice. Studies of the initial phase of intervals with ice-induced vibrations also revealed two mechanisms that could cause steady-state vibrations, namely circumferential cracking and internal cracking. Fourteen incidents of ice ridge actions on the Norströmsgrund lighthouse were selected to reveal more details about actions from ridged ice to a vertical structure. A keel-to-sail ratio of 8. 2 was estimated with a keel depth evolution of - 0. 04 m/day during a period from 3 March to 4 April, 2002. Four different failure modes were detected together with an insignificant influence from the increasing keel depth on the highest measured loads. In-situ and laboratory measurements were conducted on ridged and level ice from the Barents Sea and the Van Mijen fjord on Svalbard where the level ice generally was found to be stronger than <b>consolidated</b> ice in <b>ridges.</b> Vertical samples with ice columns in the loading direction were found to be stronger than horizontal samples. <b>Consolidated</b> ice from <b>ridges</b> had an equal hardness to level ice, but was harder than ice rubble.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{morphological}} properties of over 300 full-scale floating first-year sea ice ridges has been made, including measurements from 1971 until the present time. Ridges were examined from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, Beaufort Sea, Svalbard waters, Barents Sea and Russian Arctic Ocean for the Arctic regions; and from the Canadian East Coast, Baltic Sea, Sea of Azov, Caspian Sea and Offshore Sakhalin for the Subarctic (or temperate) regions. Grounded ridges were excluded. A wide catalogue comprising the ridge thicknesses (sail, keel and consolidated layer), widths and angles {{as well as the}} macroporosity and the block dimensions is provided. The maximum sail height was found to be 8 m (offshore Sakhalin), and the mean peak sail height was 2. 0 m, based on 356 profiles. The mean peak keel depth is 8. 0 m, based on 321 profiles. The relationship between the maximum sail height, hs, and the maximum keel depth, hk, for all ridges is best described by the power equation hk = 5. 11 hs 0. 69. The correlation differs depending on the region. For Arctic ridges a linear relationship was found to be the best fit (hk = 3. 84 hs), while for the Subarctic ridges a power relationship (hk = 6. 14 hs 0. 53) best fit the data. The ratio of maximum keel to maximum sail is 5. 17 on average (based on 308 values), and has also been calculated for each region mentioned above. Arctic ridges generally have a lower keel-to-sail ratio than those in Subarctic regions. The statistical distribution of keel-to-sail ratios is best represented by a gamma distribution. The average sail and keel widths were 12 and 36 m, respectively. The relationships between the sail and keel widths and other geometrical parameters were also determined. Variation of sail and keel thicknesses within individual ridges has been compared with the variability of all ridges. Ridge cross-sectional geometry can vary greatly along the length of a ridge, even over a short distance. A study was made on sail block thicknesses, and {{it was found that the}}y correlate well with the sail height with a square root model. The typical macroporosity for a first-year ice ridge is 22 % (based on 58 values) with an average sail macroporosity of 18 % (based on 49 values) and average keel rubble macroporosity of 20 % (based on 44 values). The average <b>ridge</b> <b>consolidated</b> layer thickness was 1. 36 m based on 118 values. The variation of the consolidated layer was examined, and it was found that the layer tends to grow evenly with time over the width of the ridge cross section. A greater spacing between the measurements seemed to affect the variation, as it decreased with an increasing distance between each borehole. A statistical analysis based on 377 measurements of the <b>consolidated</b> layer of <b>ridges</b> in the Barents Sea showed that the gamma distribution well describes the distribution of the consolidated layer thicknesses in that area.

40|$|First Year Ice ridge loads {{are often}} the design loads for {{offshore}} structures in Arctic regions. Based on the field observation data for Confederation bridge, the calculated upper limit for the ice ridge loads according to ISO 19906 Standard were quite high {{when compared to the}} measured loads. There is a need to obtain an improved description of the internal structure of the ice ridge to understand its mechanical behavior. Finite Element (FE) thermodynamic analysis on a large ridge in 3 dimensions is computationally expensive due to the large number of elements required to accurately capture the phase change process occurring in the pores. Thus, the aim of this thesis has been to analyze the thermodynamic consolidation process on an ice ridge composed of 2 -dimensional ice bodies, construct the analytical function to predict increase in boundaries of the ice bodies and then finally obtain a <b>consolidated</b> ice <b>ridge</b> geometry. Firstly, a ridge formation model was created to obtain the arrangement of the ice bodies within the ridge internal structure. The bodies were allowed to interact with each other under the influence of buoyancy and gravity and the contacts between the loose ice bodies were resolved using impulses calculated using Non-smooth discrete element method (NDEM). Finite Element (FE) thermodynamic analysis was carried out on the ice body arrangement based on constant temperature boundary conditions to model the consolidation process and obtain the temperature distribution within the ridge. The proposed consolidation model was validated by comparing with results from Stefan’s Law predictions for growth in level ice thickness. Analytical functions to predict the increase in dimension of the ice bodies were based on simplified heat transfer processes within the ridge. One dimensional heat conduction was used to model the influence of the initial temperature of the ice body at each corner point. The influence of the cold ambient air was modelled using Stefan’s Law expression. In this case, average thermal conductivity of the area directly above the ice body was used to model the heat flux. Non-linear regression analysis was then performed using the results from the FE analysis to fit the function to the dataset. The functions were then used to predict the expansion of the ice bodies after a given time duration and the boundaries were merged to give the final ridge geometry. Finally, a comparison was made with the FE results. It was concluded that the major increase {{at the top of the}} ridge is caused by the contribution from ‘ambient temperature’ and the depth of the ice body below the waterline was the major variable for this case. The major variable for the ice bodies in the lower part of the keel, was the corner point temperature. Some deviations from the FE model results were observed due to the fact that deterioration of ridge keel due to surrounding water is not included in the regression model and thus the blocks near the bottom of the ridge keel do not show the expected decrease in boundaries. Overall, the modelling work presented in this thesis provides a good framework to approximate the FE consolidation results and the analytical functions can be improved to include more variables that are involved in consolidation process.

40|$|Sea ice {{is a major}} {{obstacle}} for developing oil and gas industries in Arctic regions. To ensure safe and efficient exploration and exploitation of resources in the Arctic Basin, knowledge of the type, thickness, strength and concentration of sea ice is required, especially in areas in which developments are planned. In addition, data on the physical properties (e. g., the temperature, salinity and density) would greatly facilitate the prediction of ice loads because these properties influence ice strength. A special feature of the ice cover is the sea ice ridges, which {{are considered to be}} the design loads for offshore structures in ice-infested waters in the absence of icebergs. This thesis consists of 6 papers and is composed of 2 separate but nevertheless very close parts. The first part presents and analyzes field measurements of different properties of level ice, whereas the second part covers the spatial and temporal evolution of the morphology as well as the physical and mechanical properties of sea ice ridges. Fieldwork investigating the mechanical and physical properties of land-fast level ice in the frozen fjords of Spitsbergen commenced in 2003. With the design of a transportable uniaxial compressive rig in 2005, uniaxial compressive strength tests were performed directly on-site. An intensive field campaign was performed in the winter of 2010 on Van Mijenfjorden, Spitsbergen, to study the spatial and temporal distribution of the properties of level ice, namely, uniaxial compressive strength, temperature and salinity. Sampling matrices were established, and 310 samples were extracted for immediate compression, considering the load direction. Additional samples were collected in the vicinity of these boreholes to measure the temperature, density and salinity profiles and to produce a structural profile using thin sections. The variability in strength correlated with the variability in salinity, the brine fraction and possibly the sample spacing. The drainage and the localization of the brine channels may have been important for the spatial variability of the strength. Because uniaxial compressive tests were performed on site with the same rig from 2005 to 2011, the data were sufficient for a statistical analysis of the uniaxial compressive strength of sea ice. Over 7 years, 1237 samples were collected and used to determine a statistical distribution that explained the uniaxial compressive strength of sea ice. Seven groups were defined: “horizontal”, “vertical”, “early”, “late”, “horizontal early/late”, “vertical early/late” and “ridge”, to determine the impact of the loading direction and the season on the best fitting statistical distribution. Key statistics were calculated. The vertical samples were stronger than the horizontal samples with an average value of the strength of 4. 2 MPa and 2 MPa, respectively. The early or “cold” samples were stronger than the late or “warm” samples, with an average value of the strength of 3. 7 MPa and 2. 1 MPa, respectively. The key statistics were visualized using box plots. The gamma, Weibull and lognormal distributions were examined. The least squares combined with QQ-Plots enabled the observation and the quantification of the fit between the data distribution and the hypothesized theoretical distribution. The Weibull parameters (scale and shape) were estimated using the maximum likelihood method, the method of the moments and the least squares method. The optimum pair (scale and shape) was obtained through a combination of the least squares method (for the scale parameter) and the maximum likelihood method or the method of the moments (for the shape parameter). The fit between the data distribution and the theoretical distribution was good. Neither the sample orientation nor the season influenced the statistical distribution determination, even though the defining parameters varied between the groups. The gamma distribution was the best candidate for the statistical distribution of the field data with a coefficient of correlation of 0. 986. Finally, a new experimental setup was established in May 2008 to measure the propagation of stresses in the ice. This setup consisted of freezing 6 stress sensors in the ice. The sensors were placed at a depth of 0. 2 m and every 0. 6 m along a line. A borehole jack was used to trigger the stresses that propagated to the sensors. The borehole jack was placed along the same line at 8, 5, 2, 1 and 0. 6 m from the first stress sensor. A 98 % decreased pressure was recorded by the sensors within the first 60 cm, and the pressure was 0 after 4 m. The stresses decreased for increasing distances between the triggering source and the measurement point, following an inverse exponential law. The second focus of this thesis was on sea ice ridges. For a better understanding and overview of the current knowledge of ridges, an extensive analysis of their morphological properties was performed. Over 300 full-scale, floating first-year ridges were examined from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, Beaufort Sea, Svalbard waters, Barents Sea and the Russian Arctic Ocean for the Arctic regions; from the Canadian east coasts, the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnia, Sea of Azov, Caspian Sea and Offshore Sakhalin for the Subarctic regions. A catalogue of all the available dimensions of the ridges, their macroporosities and the dimensions of the blocks constituting the sail was also provided. The maximum sail height was 8 m (offshore Sakhalin), and the mean peak sail height was 2. 0 m based on 356 profiles. The mean peak keel depth was 8. 0 m based on 321 profiles. The correlation between the internal dimensions such as the sail height and the keel depth as well as or the sail width and the keel depth were h k = 5. 11 h s 0. 69 and w k = 7. 19 h k 0. 72. The statistical distribution of keel-tosail ratios is best represented by a lognormal distribution. Ridge cross-sectional geometry can vary greatly along the length of a ridge, even over a short distance. The block thicknesses were very different from the surrounding level ice thicknesses and they correlate well with the sail height with a square root model: h s = 3. 73 h b 0. 5. The consolidated layer tended to grow evenly with time over the width of the ridge cross section. A statistical analysis based on 377 measurements of the <b>consolidated</b> layer of <b>ridges</b> in the Barents Sea showed that the gamma distribution well described the distribution of the consolidated layer thickness in that area. When prospecting for sea ice ridges in Van Mijenfjorden in February 2009, only a small first-year ridge feature was found. The ridge was visited 6 times between February 14 and May 14. The thickness of the consolidated layer was measured by drilling along two lines across the ridge. It grew as fast as the surrounding level ice (approximately 25 cm in 3 months). The block thickness of the sail was relatively constant until May, after which the block thickness decreased rapidly due to solar radiation. In addition, temperature, density and salinity profiles were constructed. The salinity of the consolidated layer was relatively constant for increasing porosities, mostly because of increasing air temperatures. Samples were extracted for in field compressive tests during two visits. The average strength, porosity and temperature for the first date was 3. 0 MPa, 11 % and - 11. 3 °C, respectively, and for the second date 2. 6 MPa, 11 % and - 10. 6 °C, respectively. The data fit reasonably well with the empirical formulae established for level ice. The rubble was soft and eroded, even more than in previous ridge studies in Van Mijenfjorden because of the small size of the ridge and the increased contribution of oceanic fluxes. In early September 2009, six medium-sized sea ice ridges were investigated in the Fram Strait as part of the fourth year of a field study of multi-year ice ridges. The geometry and macroporosity were examined by cross-sectional drillings. The largest depth recorded was 7. 8 m, and the highest sail measured was 1. 9 m. In addition, a profile of the physical properties of each ridge was established. The average density, salinity and porosity of the keel were respectively 945 kg/m 3, 2. 05 psu and 14 %, respectively. For the first time in that area, uniaxial compression tests were performed at three stations, and the average strength of the keel was 1. 8 MPa.
