The firm had first been involved in the area during the construction of the Channel Tunnel for which it supplied stone. The terminal was part of the <b>concrete</b> <b>works</b> site of TransManche Link, the Anglo-French engineering consortium which took over the land formerly occupied by the BP refinery. The tunnel lining segments for the English side of the tunnel were manufactured here. The Grain terminal receives annually 2 million tonnes of stone by sea from Glensanda. The completion of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 led to the dissolution of TransManche Link, and the aggregates terminal continued to distribute material by rail, road or barge for use in south eastern construction projects, including the high speed one rail link, and as a major supplier of ballast for rail maintenance.|$|E
