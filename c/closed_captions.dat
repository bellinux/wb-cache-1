5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} to pass closed caption data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents <b>closed</b> <b>captions</b> when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|E

25|$|The Telecommunications Act of 1996 {{expanded}} on the Decoder Circuity Act {{to place}} the same requirements on digital television receivers by July 1, 2002. All TV programming distributors in the U.S. are required to provide <b>closed</b> <b>captions</b> for Spanish-language video programming as of January 1, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|This new <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> {{workflow}} {{known as}} e-Captioning involves making a proxy video from the non-linear system to import into a third-party non-linear <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> software. Once the <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> software project is completed, it must export a <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> file {{compatible with the}} non-linear editing system. In the case of Final Cut Pro 7, three different file formats can be accepted: a [...]SCC file (Scenarist <b>Closed</b> <b>Caption</b> file) for Standard Definition video, a QuickTime 608 <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> track (a special 608 coded track in the [...]mov file wrapper) for standard-definition video, and finally a QuickTime 708 <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> track (a special 708 coded track in the [...]mov file wrapper) for high-definition video output.|$|R

25|$|The closed {{captioning}} system was successfully encoded and broadcast in 1973 {{with the cooperation}} of PBS station WETA. As a result of these tests, the FCC in 1976 set aside line 21 for the transmission of <b>closed</b> <b>captions.</b> PBS engineers then developed the caption editing consoles that would be used to caption prerecorded programs.|$|E
25|$|Subtitles {{exist in}} two forms; open {{subtitles}} are 'open to all' and cannot {{be turned off}} by the viewer; closed subtitles are designed for a certain group of viewers, and can usually be turned on/off or selected by the viewer – examples being teletext pages, US <b>Closed</b> <b>captions</b> (608/708), DVB Bitmap subtitles, DVD/Blu-ray subtitles.|$|E

25|$|High-definition disc media (HD DVD, Blu-ray Disc) uses SDH {{subtitles}} as {{the sole}} method because technical specifications do not require HD to support line 21 <b>closed</b> <b>captions.</b> Some Blu-ray Discs, however, are said to carry a closed caption stream that only displays through standard-definition connections. Many HDTVs allow the end–user to customize the captions, including the ability to remove the black band.|$|E
25|$|<b>Closed</b> <b>captions</b> {{were created}} for deaf or {{hard of hearing}} {{individuals}} to assist in comprehension. They {{can also be used}} as a tool by those learning to read, learning to speak a non-native language, or in an environment where the audio is difficult to hear or is intentionally muted. Captions can also be used by viewers who simply wish to read a transcript along with the program audio.|$|E
25|$|Teletext {{services}} {{were introduced to}} ABC-TV in 1983 to allow hearing impaired viewers access to <b>closed</b> <b>captions.</b> Nationwide, successor to This Day Tonight, was replaced in turn by a new, hour-long, national news programme called The National.

2500|$|Other {{non-linear}} editing systems indirectly support <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> only in Standard Definition line-21. Video files on the editing timeline must be composited with a line-21 VBI graphic layer {{known in the}} industry as a [...] "blackmovie" [...] with <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> data. [...] Alternately, video editors working with the DV25 and DV50 firewire workflows must encode their DV [...]avi or [...]mov file with VAUX data which includes CEA-608 <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> data.|$|R
50|$|VITAC {{has been}} {{continuously}} providing <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> services since 1986. In 2000, VITAC {{was sold to}} Word Wave, Inc. In 2006, Word Wave, Inc. was acquired by Merrill Corporation. In August 2012, VITAC acquired <b>Closed</b> <b>Captioning</b> Services.|$|R
25|$|<b>Closed</b> <b>captions</b> {{are also}} used in public environments, such as bars and restaurants, where patrons {{may not be able}} to hear over the {{background}} noise, or where multiple televisions are displaying different programs. In addition, online videos may be treated through digital processing of their audio content by various robotic algorithms (robots). Multiple chains of errors are the result. When a video is truly and accurately transcribed, then the closed-captioning publication serves a useful purpose, and the content is available for search engines to index and make available to users on the internet.|$|E
25|$|QuickTime video {{supports}} raw 608 caption data via proprietary {{closed caption}} track, which are just EIA-608 byte pairs {{wrapped in a}} QuickTime packet container with different IDs for both line 21 fields. These captions can be turned on and off and appear in the same style as TV <b>closed</b> <b>captions,</b> with all the standard formatting (pop-on, roll-up, paint-on), and can be positioned and split anywhere on the video screen. QuickTime closed caption tracks can be viewed in Macintosh or Windows versions of QuickTime Player, iTunes (via QuickTime), iPod Nano, iPod Classic, iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.|$|E
25|$|Like SMPTE 259M, SMPTE 292M {{supports}} the SMPTE 291M standard for ancillary data. Ancillary data is provided as a standardized transport for non-video payload within a serial digital signal; {{it is used}} for things such as embedded audio, <b>closed</b> <b>captions,</b> timecode, and other sorts of metadata. Ancillary data is indicated by a 3-word packet consisting of 0, 3FF, 3FF (the opposite of the synchronization packet header), followed by a two-word identification code, a data count word (indicating 0 - 255 words of payload), the actual payload, and a one-word checksum. Other than in their use in the header, the codes prohibited to video payload are also prohibited to ancillary data payload.|$|E
30|$|The <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> {{extraction}} modules {{are used}} to convert the <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> input streams into a sequence of words in BP. The synchronization module is used to synchronize the <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> input and the LIBRAS window output. As mentioned earlier, it extracts the reference clock from the input and uses it to generate the timestamps for the signs presentation. The machine translation and encoding modules will be detailed in the next subsections.|$|R
5000|$|... e-Captioning is a {{workflow}} {{for adding}} <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> data to video tapes and files. This process uses software to encode the <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> data into a video, {{instead of the}} dedicated <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> hardware encoders that were previously required. Originally, e-Captioning could be done only for web based new media formats such as Windows Media, Real Video, QuickTime, and Flash. However, e-Captioning is now available to TV Broadcast facilities for tapeless workflows.|$|R

25|$|In 2010, Vegas Pro, the {{professional}} non-linear editor, was updated to support importing, editing, and delivering CEA-608 <b>closed</b> <b>captions.</b> Vegas Pro 10, released on October 11, 2010, added several enhancements to the closed captioning support. TV-like CEA-608 closed captioning {{can now be}} displayed as an overlay when played back in the Preview and Trimmer windows, {{making it easy to}} check placement, edits, and timing of CC information. CEA708 style Closed Captioning is automatically created when the CEA-608 data is created. Line 21 closed captioning is now supported, as well as HD-SDI closed captioning capture and print from AJA and Blackmagic Design cards. Line 21 support provides a workflow for existing legacy media. Other improvements include increased support for multiple closed captioning file types, as well as the ability to export closed caption data for DVD Architect, YouTube, RealPlayer, QuickTime, and Windows Media Player.|$|E
25|$|Closed {{captioning}} {{of video}} games {{is becoming more}} common. One of the first video game companies to feature closed captioning was Bethesda Softworks in their 1990 release of Hockey League Simulator and The Terminator 2029. Infocom also offered Zork Grand Inquisitor in 1997. Many games since then have at least offered subtitles for spoken dialog during cutscenes, and many include significant in-game dialog and sound effects in the captions as well; for example, with subtitles turned on in the Metal Gear Solid series of stealth games, not only are subtitles available during cut scenes, but any dialog spoken during real-time gameplay will be captioned as well, allowing players who can't hear the dialog to know what enemy guards are saying and when the main character has been detected. Also, in many of developer Valve Corporation's video games (such as Half-Life 2 or Left 4 Dead), when <b>closed</b> <b>captions</b> are activated, dialog and nearly all sound effects either made by the player or from other sources (e.g. gunfire, explosions) will be captioned.|$|E
25|$|Although same-language {{subtitles}} and captions {{are produced}} primarily with the deaf and {{hard of hearing}} in mind, many hearing film and television viewers choose to use them. This is often done because the presence of closed captioning and subtitles ensures that not one word of dialogue will be missed. Bars and other noisy public places, where film dialogue would otherwise be drowned out, often make <b>closed</b> <b>captions</b> visible for patrons. Viewers may also find thick regional accents from other same-language countries hard to understand without subtitles. Films and television shows often have subtitles displayed in the same language if the speaker has a speech impairment. In addition, captions may reveal information {{that would otherwise be}} difficult to obtain from hearing. Some examples would be song lyrics, dialog spoken quietly or by those with accents unfamiliar to the intended audience, or supportive, minor dialog from background characters. It is argued that such additional information and detail enhances the overall experience and allows the viewer a better grasp of the material. Furthermore, people learning a foreign language may sometimes use same-language subtitles to better understand the dialog without having to resort to a translation.|$|E
50|$|XDS {{uses the}} same line in the {{vertical}} blanking interval as <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> (NTSC line 21), and shares the available second video field bandwidth with the <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> channels CC3 and CC4, and with the text channels TXT3 and TXT4.|$|R
30|$|Synchronization between <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> input in BP and the LIBRAS window {{output is}} {{performed}} {{by using the}} axis-based synchronization model [5]. This model defines synchronization points that are inserted in the stream using timestamps based on a global timer. In this case, the global timer is the reference clock of the <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> input stream. This clock is extracted from <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> and is used to generate the presentation timestamps for the signs in the LIBRAS window.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, WMAQ-TV {{became the}} first station in the Chicago {{metropolitan}} area to adopt its real-time <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> for the hearing impaired {{in all of its}} newscasts; five years later in 1994, the <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> service was later added to the station's morning newscast.|$|R
25|$|NTSC DVDs {{may carry}} <b>closed</b> <b>captions</b> in data packets of the MPEG-2 video streams {{inside of the}} Video-TS folder. Once played out of the analog outputs of a set top DVD player, the caption data is {{converted}} to the Line 21 format. They are output by the player to the composite video (or an available RF connector) for a connected TV's built-in decoder or a set-top decoder as usual. They can not be output on S-Video or component video outputs {{due to the lack}} of a colorburst signal on line 21. (Actually, regardless of this, if the DVD player is in interlaced rather than progressive mode, closed captioning will be displayed on the TV over component video input if the TV captioning is turned on and set to CC1.) When viewed on a personal computer, caption data can be viewed by software that can read and decode the caption data packets in the MPEG-2 streams of the DVD-Video disc. Windows Media Player (before Windows 7) in Vista supported only closed caption channels 1 and 2 (not 3 or 4). Apple's DVD Player does not have the ability to read and decode Line 21 caption data which are recorded on a DVD made from an over-the-air broadcast. It can display some movie DVD captions.|$|E
