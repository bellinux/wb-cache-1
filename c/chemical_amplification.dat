40|$|Research {{described}} in this work includes exploration of new resist systems {{that can be used}} for 193 nm lithography. Most of the conventional 193 nm resists rely on <b>chemical</b> <b>amplification</b> in which a small amount of photogenerated acid can catalyze many reactions. Even though the sensitivity is improved drastically with such a mechanism, the printed profiles are known to be suffering from line edge roughness (LER) and image blurring. Furthermore, the resolution is limited by the diffusion length of the generated acid. For sub- 32 nm technology nodes, specified LER criterion cannot be satisfied by utilizing chemically amplified resists (CAR). However, improvements in laser power and lens materials enable relaxation in high sensitivity requirement for the resist materials. When low sensitive photomaterials are acceptable, <b>chemical</b> <b>amplification</b> in the resists can be reduced or can even be completely eliminated. In this research, reasons behind the need of using non-chemically amplified resists is explained and some possible solutions are explored.

40|$|Kinetic {{hybridization}} {{measurements on}} a microarray {{are expected to}} become a valuable tool for genotyping applications. A method has been developed that enables kinetic hybridization measurements of PCR products on a low-density microarray. This is accomplished by pumping a solution containing PCR products up and down through a porous microarray substrate. After every pumping cycle, the fluorescently labeled PCR products hybridized to capture probes immobilized on the solid surface of the porous microarray substrate are measured. By this method, both binding curves and high-resolution melting curves are obtained instead of the single endpoint hybridization intensities as with commonly used post-PCR array-based hybridization techniques. We used 20 subtypes of the human papillomavirus (HPV) as a model system to test our detection method and blindly analyzed 216 clinical samples. We compared our microarray flowthrough method with a reference method, PCR followed by a reverse line blot (RLB). Real-time hybridization measurements followed by high-resolution melting curves of low concentrations of fluorescently labeled HPV targets on a microarray were successfully carried out without any additional <b>chemical</b> signal <b>amplification.</b> The results of our new method were in good agreement (93 %, with a kappa coefficient of κ = 0. 88 [95 % CI, 0. 81 to 0. 94]) with the RLB results.

40|$|With {{progress}} in the semiconductor industry, transistor density on a single computer chip has increased dramatically. This {{has resulted in a}} continuous shrinkage of the minimum feature size printed through microlithography technology. Resist, as the pattern recording medium of such printing, has been extensively studied to achieve higher resolution, higher sensitivity and lower line edge roughness. For decades this has been realized through <b>chemical</b> <b>amplification.</b> With the feature size continuously shrinking and the energy of exposure source therefore exceeding the resist ionization threshold, the performance of conventional chemically amplified resists is approaching the limits. Novel high-performance chemically amplified resists or non-chemically amplified resists are urgently needed to meet the requirement of next generation lithography. In this work a negative tone chemically amplified resist system based on a novel method to control the catalytic chain reaction is presented. The method to control the catalytic chain reaction is demonstrated using two model polymer resists. This method is then applied to a fullerene-based molecular resist system and a combination of good industrial compatibility, high resolution and good sensitivity has been achieved in this resist. Through a chromatographic separation, another chemically amplified molecular resist was also developed with further improved performance. An alternative route to sensitivity improvement other than <b>chemical</b> <b>amplification</b> is then introduced and a family of fullerene-based metal containing materials is presented.

In place of a single, relatively long oligonucleotide probe, two or three short oligomers terminated by thiophosphoryl and bromoacetamido groups are employed. Fast and efficient autoligation takes place when the oligomers hybridize in a contiguous mode to the same complementary strand such that a thiophosphoryl group on one strand and a bromoacetamido group on another are brought into proximity. A single nucleotide mismatch for the short probes leads to marked reduction {{in the rate of}} autoligation. The binding affinity of the product is close to that for a natural probe of the same length.

Each stage of amplification is performed by a reaction autocatalytic in Co^(2 +). The microfluidic network is used to maintain the two chemical reactions away from equilibrium and control the interactions between them in time.

This dissertation exploits the recent advances in nanotechnology and chemistry for the design smart nanoscale constructs that can be triggered to disassemble and deliver encapsulated drugs. We design and evaluate light- and inflammation-sensitive systems for treatment of inflammatory diseases in animals. In Chapter 1, we demonstrate safety and efficacy of a UV light-triggered particles for controlled delivery of anti-angiogenics to treat age-related macular degeneration. The drugs are physically entrapped in a polymeric particle comprised of a series of self-immolative quinone-methide-based monomers protected with a light-sensitive moeity. The cleavage of these moeities results in a scission in the polymeric backbone, leading to the release of the encapsulated drugs. In Chapter 2, we explore <b>chemical</b> signal <b>amplification</b> as a strategy to improve sensitivity of the light-triggered drug delivery systems. We altered the polymer so that photocleavage unmasks acidic groups that then provide intramolecular assistance to ketal hydrolysis in the polymer backbone, resulting in significant polymer degradation upon a brief, low power trigger. Chapter 3 focuses designing a system with a longer wavelength light as the trigger for degradation. Red-shifting the actuating wavelength increases its tissue penetration and allows control over drug delivery at greater depth. In Chapter 4, we investigate if a polymer that reacts and degrades upon an increase in concentration of reactive oxygen species can be used as a drug delivery vehicle for the eye. As pathophysiology of macular degeneration involves oxidative stress, we examine the feasibility of delivering drugs using an inflammation-sensitive depot. This approach tailors release of drugs to the progression of disease, and thus will be useful in its long-term management...|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in the biochemistry of existing RNA enzymes and in the development of RNA enzymes with novel catalytic function. The focal point of our research program has been the design and operation of a laboratory system for the controlled evolution of catalytic RNA. This system serves as working model of RNA-based life and can be used to explore the catalytic potential of RNA. Evolution requires the integration of three <b>chemical</b> processes: <b>amplification,</b> mutation, and selection. Amplification results in additional copies of the genetic material. Mutation operates at the level of genotype to introduce variability, this variability in turn being expressed as a range of phenotypes. Selection operates at the level of phenotype to reduce variability by excluding those individuals that do not conform to the prevailing fitness criteria. These three processes must be linked so that only the selected individuals are amplified, subject to mutational error, to produce a progeny distribution of mutant individuals. We devised techniques for the amplification, mutation, and selection of catalytic RNA, all of which can be performed rapidly in vitro within a single reaction vessel. We integrated these techniques {{in such a way that}} they can be performed iteratively and routinely. This allowed us to conduct evolution experiments in response to artificially-imposed selection constraints. Our objective was to develop novel RNA enzymes by altering the selection constraints in a controlled manner. In this way we were able to expand the catalytic repertoire of RNA. Our long-range objective is to develop an RNA enzyme with RNA replicase activity.

For the optimum design of such devices, dependence of flame area change on the wave and flame parameters should be well understood. ^ To gain the understanding of flame area increase following shock or expansion wave passage, baroclinic vortex sheet layer generation was analyzed both analytically and numerically. It was found that for weak waves or small angles, the vortex sheet strengths were nearly equal in magnitude for shocks and expansion waves of equal pressure ratio. The difference between vortex sheet strengths for expansion waves and shocks of equal pressure ratio increased with shock strength. The vortex sheet strength for expansion waves was 50 % lower than for shocks, for pressure ratios over 20. ^ After vortex sheet production was examined, the flame area increase was investigated following shock or expansion wave passage through a sinusoidal interface. It was found that the density interface length grows almost linearly for a time period significantly exceeding the time of the linear perturbation amplitude growth. Significantly faster interface growth rates were observed when the shock or expansion wave approached the interface from the hot gas side (called fast/slow interaction based on the relative speed of sound across the interface). The result is opposite to that expected from Richtmyer-Meshkov theory. Finally, the interface length increase and its contribution to the overall fuel consumption rate increase produced by the shock or expansion wave passage were investigated. The results showed that the flame area increase plays a dominant role in the total fuel consumption rate increase with relatively weak shocks (shock Mach number 1. 1 – 1. 5) and expansion waves (pressure ratio of 1. 245) for reactive mixtures at room temperature.

Gene amplification has been applied to the industrial production of therapeutic protein. 　Models proposed to explain the amplification process include; unequal sister-chromatid exchange, localized over-replication, rolling-circle and double rolling-circle replication, extrachromosomal amplification and reintegration, and breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles. Despite great effort, the molecular mechanism responsible for the majority of amplification events remains unknown. For example, the gene amplification occurring in tissue-cultured cells during selection for resistance to methotrexate (MTX) is believed to be initiated by the BFB cycles. However rather complicated products are produced which may require additional kinds of amplification processes. The complexity of these structures has made it difficult to analyze the mechanism at a molecular level. 　The mechanism responsible for amplification of rDNA is fairly well understood. In S. cerevisiae, rDNA amplification is initiated by a double-strand break (DSB) produced when a DNA replication fork encounters a replication fork barrier (RFB) present in each rDNA unit. This double-strand end enhances unequal sister chromatid recombination, resulting in rDNA amplification. The blocking of replication forks also causes gene amplification in E. coli at a recombinational hotspot, named Hot DNA. However, known chromosomal amplifications in E. coli and yeast are invariably direct tandem copies, while mammalian cells show a mixture of direct and inverted repeats. Thus, understanding of amplification in higher eukaryotes might be enhanced by development of a microbial system that generates products analogous to those observed in tumors and cultured cells. 　The mechanisms underlying these gene amplifications in yeast and bacteria appear to be quite different. While yeast rDNA amplification occurs through unequal sister-chromatid recombination, bacterial Hot amplification seems to proceed through rolling-circle replication. However, it is possible that both processes are initiated by break-induced replication (BIR). While inter-chromatid unequal BIR could cause rDNA amplification in yeast, a similar intra-chromatid BIR could cause the rolling-circle type amplification of Hot DNA in E. coli. 　The double rolling-circle replication (DRCR) is a continuous replication process in which two replication forks synthesize a circular DNA. This model was first proposed by Futcher for amplification of yeast circular 2 μ plasmid and experimentally confirmed by Volkert and Broach. Later a similar model was proposed by Hyrien et al. to explain a case of drug-resistance gene amplification. However, the former DRCR depends on a 2 μ-specific site-specific recombination system (FLP 1 /FRT) and the latter model has not been examined experimentally. Thus far, no amplification system has shown to rely on DRCR. 　Here, he uses double-strand breaks to study the sequences, structures and reactions required for in vivo gene amplification in S. cerevisiae. This system is based on the action of break-induced replication (BIR) and double rolling-circle replication (DRCR). BIR is a recombination-dependent replication process and starts as a one-ended recombination event. A broken chromosome end finds a homologous sequence, invades it to form a new replication fork, and initiate replication. In the system described here, a single chromosome is cut by HO endonuclease to generate two fragments designed to amplify a sequence by DRCR. Each fragment can act both as end donor and end recipient for BIR. If the two BIR forks start simultaneously, double rolling-circle replication (DRCR) should highly amplify the regions flanked by the replication forks within a single cell cycle. The DRCR process can terminate by recombination between leu 2 d genes on each bi-directionally elongated arm. 　The system formed a single type of product containing 3 - 5 inverted copies of the amplification marker, leu 2 d, on a plasmid-derived artificial mini-chromosome, and it successfully produced three types of amplification products on a resident chromosome. Type- 1 products contain 5 - 7 inverted copies of leu 2 d. Type- 2 products contain 13 -〓 100 copies of leu 2 d (up to 〓 730 kb increase) with a novel arrangement present as randomly oriented sequences flanked by inverted leu 2 ds copies. Type- 3 products are acentric multi-copy mini-chromosomes carrying leu 2 ds. Structures of type- 2 and - 3 products resemble those of homogeneously staining region (HSR) and double minutes (DMs) of higher eukaryotes, respectively. Interestingly, products analogous to these were generated at low frequency without deliberate DNA cleavage. These features strongly suggest that the processes described here may contribute to natural gene amplification in higher eukaryotes. Utilization of this amplification system in mammalian cells has the potential to provide great savings of time and energy in the overproduction of recombinant proteins for medical uses...|$|R
