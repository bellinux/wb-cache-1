50|$|A disorder-broadened first-order {{transition}} occurs over {{a finite}} {{range of temperatures}} where the fraction of the low-temperature equilibrium phase grows from zero to one (100%) as the temperature is lowered. This continuous variation of the coexisting fractions with temperature raised interesting possibilities. On cooling, some liquids vitrify into a glass rather than transform to the equilibrium crystal phase. This happens if the cooling rate is faster than a <b>critical</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>rate,</b> and is attributed to the molecular motions becoming so slow that the molecules cannot rearrange into the crystal positions. This slowing down happens below a glass-formation temperature Tg, which may depend on the applied pressure., If the first-order freezing transition occurs over a range of temperatures, and Tg falls within this range, then there is an interesting possibility that the transition is arrested when it is partial and incomplete. Extending these ideas to first-order magnetic transitions being arrested at low temperatures, resulted in the observation of incomplete magnetic transitions, with two magnetic phases coexisting, down to the lowest temperature. First reported {{in the case of}} a ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic transition, such persistent phase coexistence has now been reported across a variety of first-order magnetic transitions. These include colossal-magnetoresistance manganite materials, magnetocaloric materials, magnetic shape memory materials, and other materials.The interesting feature of these observations of Tg falling within the temperature range over which the transition occurs is that the first-order magnetic transition is influenced by magnetic field, just like the structural transition is influenced by pressure. The relative ease with which magnetic field can be controlled, in contrast to pressure, raises the possibility that one can study the interplay between Tg and Tc in an exhaustive way. Phase coexistence across first-order magnetic transitions will then enable the resolution of outstanding issues in understanding glasses.|$|E

40|$|The glass-forming {{ability of}} Zr–Ti–Be ternary alloys has been {{evaluated}} by coupling the Davies–Uhlmann kinetic formulations with the CALPHAD approach. In the computations, time-temperature-transformation (TTT) curves were obtained, {{which are a}} measure of the time necessary for the formation of detectable amounts of a crystalline phase from a supercooled liquid as a function of temperature. The <b>critical</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated from the TTT curves, and these enabled us to evaluate the glass-forming ability of this ternary alloy. The driving force for the crystallization of the crystalline phases was derived from the Gibbs energy functions of each phase, where thermodynamic calculations were carried out using a simple ternary extrapolation of the binary data sets with no solubility of the third element in the binary phases except for the liquid, hcp, and bcc phases. The evaluated glass-forming compositional range was in good agreement with experimental data from the Be-rich side. However, the calculated <b>critical</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> for some alloys were too low. The validity of the ideal mixing of the metastable ZrBe(B 2) and TiBe(B 2) phases, and the possibility of the formation of the ternary B 2 phase are also discussed from an ab initio energetic point of view, and the <b>critical</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> were recalculated assuming an ideal mixing of the metastable ZrBe(B 2) and TiBe(B 2) phases.

40|$|Due to the {{relevance}} of the <b>critical</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>rate,</b> Rc, for glasses, Barandiarán and Colmenero (BC) developed a method for calculating Rc {{as a function of the}} crystallization temperature on cooling obtained from thermal analysis.

However, for polymers, there is a strong reason for modifying the original BC method. In this case, the extrapolation must be extended only to the undercooling associated to the glass transition temperature, Tg, because no crystallization can occur below this temperature.
