5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek {{in the parking lot of}} the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E
500|$|Pacquette {{earned a}} call-up to the Dominica {{national}} {{team for the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification CONCACAF First Round match against Barbados on 6 February 2008. Barbados went into the match as heavy favourites but fell behind to Pacquette's goal on his international debut, which finished as a 1–1 draw. After making his debut, manager Christopher Ericson said [...] "He is great in front of goal, powerful and full of effort and work. I only hope that we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> some more support up front in the next game – if we do I am sure we can win it". He also played in the 1–0 defeat in the second leg on 26 March.|$|E
500|$|Boyd is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, {{and has been}} used on the left-wing throughout {{the majority of his}} career. He has described himself as a winger, but has stated that he prefers to play [...] "in the hole" [...] because the position allows him to get more time on the ball. He has expressed his willingness to [...] "play anywhere" [...] to help the team, believing his versatility across the midfield and attacking areas to be one of his main strong-points. He said [...] "I have played {{on both sides of the}} park and will always try my best to do a good job regardless of where the manager plays me". Under former Peterborough United manager, Jim Gannon, Boyd was given a [...] "free-role", essentially playing across the midfield and behind the strikers. Gannon said [...] "if we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> free in attacking areas he can be a great creative force". Gannon believes that Boyd is at his best when he [...] "is saved from doing defensive work that wingers may have to do", and as a result, during Gannon's short spell at Peterborough, was deployed just behind the strikers as part of a 3–4–1–2 formation. Boyd has also been used as a striker by manager Mark Stimson during the first half of Stevenage's 2006–07 campaign. He is predominantly left-footed, and scores the majority of his goals with his left-foot, but is also comfortable using his right. Kieran Trippier, Boyd's teammate at Burnley, said of Boyd: [...] "He's great to play with, with a good left foot and a great engine".|$|E

500|$|Johnson's move to Austin Aztex was {{finalised}} in March {{and completed}} their initial starting side, which included fellow English players Alex Tapp and Gifton Noel-Williams and Welshman Gareth Evans. Upon Johnson's transfer, team manager Adrian Heath said: [...] "I think it's {{fair to say}} that Eddie has lost his way recently and I hope we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> back on the right path to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football." [...] Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2–0 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2–0 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player. The newspaper's citation said: [...] "he's been out there hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field. At 24, with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams, he might not be with us much longer, but it's a treat while it lasts." [...] He went on to win one of the club's player of the season awards.|$|E

2500|$|From Andrew's hurt {{reaction}} to his mother's rejection of him, it appears that he deeply loves his mother, as his determination to hurt her in Season 2 is so he can [...] "stop loving her first". He also loves and respects his father, and only Rex who <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to stop tormenting Bree in Season 1, albeit briefly. Later on in Season 2, Karl, another strong male figure, has some similar success in forcing Andrew to stop harassing Bree temporarily. In Season 3, it is Orson, and not Bree, who persuades Andrew to return home and whom he continues to respect throughout the season.|$|E

2500|$|Lyra {{is portrayed}} as having dirty-blonde hair and pale-blue eyes, and is thin and short for her age. Lyra is unruly and tomboyish and her {{complete}} disregard for her appearance and personal hygiene exasperates her adult carers. She receives a scant and haphazard education {{at the hands of}} Jordan scholars, being neither interested in study nor officially a student of the college. However, she is highly intelligent, and is particularly talented at deceiving others; she is capable of making up complex yet plausible lies {{on the spur of the}} moment. Initially she uses this talent to avoid punishment by her guardians, and to entertain and deceive other children, but later in the series employs it to save her own life and the lives of others. She deceives Iofur Raknison, king of the panserbjørne ("armored bears" [...] in Scandinavian languages) of Svalbard, by suggesting that she <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> a dæmon. Tricking a panserbjørn was a feat that her friend Iorek Byrnison had believed to be impossible for a human, and her success prompts Iorek to informally christen her [...] "Silvertongue", which she adopts as a surname thereafter.|$|E

6000|$|... "Humph! Do {{you suppose}} I'd tell him without pay? Not much! I <b>can</b> easily <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to fork over fifty or a hundred dollars. And he'll make you pay it back, ten times over." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not at all!" [...] said I. [...] "This is {{a splendid}} fish, if I <b>can</b> ever <b>get</b> <b>him</b> off the hook. Don't come near him! If he sticks that back-fin into you, it will poison you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} very person!" [...] exclaimed Richard. [...] "He has had just the {{experience}} you desire, and I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> at once, too." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. Somehow, I {{think we}} <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>him,</b> {{if we try}} hard enough. And {{it would be a}} feather in our caps to bring back a bear." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fleda, {{as if she}} humbly assented, {{went through}} no form of controverting this; she simply stood passive to her companion's sudden {{refreshment}} of her appearance. [...] "How <b>can</b> I <b>get</b> <b>him</b> away from her?" [...] she presently demanded.|$|R
6000|$|... "With his men, I reckon. One of them {{acted as}} sailor aboard the sloop {{that carried the}} live stock and grain from Hog island, and you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> from <b>him</b> what {{information}} you need concerning the colonel." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am {{not worthy}} {{to sit at}} his feet. He is the most amusing knave on the coast. He is like a sunbeam in a sick room when you <b>can</b> once <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to talk of his experiences. Have you seen young Nugent lately? Does he seem cheerful?" ...|$|R
