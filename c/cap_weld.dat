5000|$|Enabling high {{performance}} optoelectronic modules using novel gas-conserving {{resistance welding electrode}} system - Amada Miyachi America developed a new projection welding technique that dramatically reduces the amount of Xenon gas needed to backfill a package. Xenon has good thermal properties that aid in transporting reliability-reducing heat away from the electronic device. In addition, it is an inert gas, which does not enter into slow chemical reactions with other materials {{that can be a}} root cause of degraded performance and reliability. However, it is extremely expensive, about $150 a liter and many existing processes waste significant quantities of the costly gas during backfilling. The new <b>cap</b> <b>welding</b> technique uses an innovative electrode vacuum and gas backfill system that enables packages to be evacuated, and then filled with gas before being hermetically sealed using projection welding. This process consumes as little as 5 cubic centimeters of Xenon gas, costing only $0.75 per part.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 86) The {{purpose of}} this Graduate Project is to study the deflections, moments and stresses in tubular rods subjected to transverse loads. The three methods of analysis used are (1) the Inextensional Deformation Theory, (2) the Infinite Cylinder with two opposed vertical loads at the middle and (3) the Finite Element Method. The analysis results are compared to laboratory test data. The deflections calculated in Section 2 using the Inextensional Deformation Theory are smaller due to the assumption of two degrees of freedom. This assumption makes a rod stiffer and hence harder to deflect. An end <b>cap</b> <b>welded</b> at the free end of a rod is shown to carry {{a substantial amount of}} load applied transversely. In Section 3 an approximate method which assumes four degrees of freedom is used to calculate deflections. The Finite Element Method of analysis is used in Section 4 to calculate the deflections, stresses and moments for four types of rods, with and without the end cap. A shell element with six degrees of freedom per node was used. These deflection results are the largest of the three methods of analysis. These results compare well with the method of Section 3...|$|R

40|$|The MCO is {{designed}} to facilitate the removal, processing and storage of the spent nuclear fuel currently stored in the East and West K-Basins. The MCO is a stainless steel canister approximately 24 inches in diameter and 166 inches long with cover cap installed. The shell and the collar which is welded to the shell are fabricated from 304 / 304 L dual certified stainless steel for the shell and F 304 /F 304 L dual certified for the collar. The shell has a nominal thickness of 1 / 2 inch. The top closure consists of a shield plug with four processing ports and a locking ring with jacking bolts to pre-load a metal seal under the shield plug. The fuel is placed in one of four types of baskets, excluding the SPR fuel baskets, in the fuel retention basin. Each basket is then loaded into the MCO which is inside the transfer cask. Once all of the baskets are loaded into the MCO, the shield plug with a process tube is placed into the open end of the MCO. This shield plug provides shielding for workers when the transfer cask, containing the MCO, is lifted from the pool. After being removed from the pool, the locking ring is installed and the jacking bolts are tightened to pre-load the metal main closure seal. The cask is then sealed and the MCO taken to the Cold Vacuum Drying (CVD) facility for bulk water removal and vacuum drying through the process ports. Covers for the process ports may be installed or removed as needed per operating procedures. The MCO is then transferred to the Canister Storage Building (CSB), in the closed transfer cask. At the CSB, the MCO is then removed from the cask and becomes one of two MCOs stacked in a storage tube. MCOs will have a cover <b>cap</b> <b>welded</b> over the shield plug providing a complete welded closure. A number of MCOs may be stored with just the mechanical seal to allow monitoring of the MCO pressure, temperature, and gas composition...|$|R

40|$|A {{round robin}} was {{organized}} to measure FN (ferrite) {{levels in the}} weld metal of five stainless steel weldments, including: types AISI 308 H (with controlled ferrite), 2205 (22 % Cr duplex), 309 Mo, 16 - 8 - 2 (316 H- a lean composition with controlled ferrite), and 316 NF (with negligible ferrite). Each weldment was sliced into several pieces, and various locations on the surfaces of these pieces were specified for measurements. In addition, some locations on the <b>weld</b> <b>caps</b> and <b>weld</b> roots were given different finishes (as-welded, lightly polished, ground flush, and filed flush) to assess {{the effect of these}} surface finishes on the measurements. The specimens were circulated to 17 different laboratories in 9 different countries around the world. A Summary Report (distributed to two Commissions within the International Institute of Welding in 2001, as IIW Documents II- 1440 - 01 and IXH- 512 - 01) presented the data and some preliminary analysis of the data. That report recommended a more comprehensive statistical analysis, which {{is the subject of this}} report. First, a two-way analysis of variance showed that the laboratory and area (location within the specimen) were both statistically significant variables and so both were considered in further analyses. Next, Tukey analyses showed the large number of statistically distinct subsets into which both the laboratory and area data could be divided. Box-and-whiskers plots for these weldments show the distribution of the data, both by laboratory and by area. The data for each location in the weldments were combined to show the variation (as standard deviations) in the values of FN, to estimate the variation that might be expected among laboratories. Finally, the surface finish was found to be significant, but the effect varied from weld to weld...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic {{inspection}} is {{the primary}} technique {{for the detection of}} planar flaws within the nuclear industry. Current inspections are typically limited to the application of rigid wedge, single element transducers to components with regular surface geometry. This thesis addresses some of the limitations of this approach and develops new methods and techniques that are suitable for application in an industrial environment. Inspection modelling is a cost effective technique for inspection design and qualification; {{it can be used to}} aid understanding of the inspection process, and provides valuable insight into inspection data interpretation. In this work semianalytical and numerical modelling tools have been used to accurately and efficiently simulate the ultrasonic inspection of large complex components. Modelling tools have also been applied to aid in the design of a membrane coupled conformable phased array device. The membrane coupled array is a low-cost, robust device that uses a conventional phased array coupled to the outer surface of the component under test via a water path encapsulated by low-loss membrane. Early design of this device was performed by Long and Cawley at Imperial College, London. The work reviewed in this thesis discussed the further development of this membrane coupled device and its application for the inspection of a specific target application component. The target application is a safety critical, thick-walled stainless steel section of pipework that contains an austenitic weld. The current inspection of this component is carried out by first removing the component <b>weld</b> <b>cap</b> and then mechanically raster scanning a large number of rigid wedge single element transducers. <b>Weld</b> <b>cap</b> removal is an expensive time consuming task that can lead to excessive wall thinning and the exposure of small surface breaking defects. The motivation for this work is to provide complete inspection of the weld and heat affected zone with the <b>weld</b> <b>cap</b> in place. It is also designed to improve inspection speed and accuracy, and to reduce the amount of user intervention required to complete the inspection in a hostile environment Inspection results from the 2 nd and 3 rd generation membrane coupled device on multiple test-pieces representative of the target application are presented. These results demonstrate that the membrane coupled device can be used to detect defects in locations that cannot be inspected using conventional techniques. The amount of scanning required can be significantly reduced, simplifying the inspection and helping to improve inspection speed by over 60 % in comparison to the single element approach.

40|$|Abstract. Arch {{springing}} is {{an important}} critical joint in a steel truss arch bridge, {{and it has a}} great influence on the mechanical behavior of the global structure. The adoption of a reasonable structure of the springing joint is of important significance in the design of an arch bridge. In this paper, with regard to the structure of Xinshiji Bridge, two types of arch springing were put forward. In Scheme- 1, the lower chords of steel truss arch ribs are connected to the concrete piers with shear studs on the ribs and <b>cap</b> plates <b>welded</b> on the ribs at the top of concrete piers., while Scheme- 2 is a integrated spring joint with a base plate {{on the bottom of the}} steel arch ribs and with reinforcing bars through the holes on the joints steel arch ribs. 3 D finite element models of the two types of springing joint were established and the relative slips between the concrete and steel were taken into account in the analyses.

40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} inspection of components with irregular surface geometry is challenging. Flexible arrays {{are available to}} improve the inspection {{of this type of}} component but inspection performance is adversely affected by errors in the assumed or measured position of each element within the flexible array. This can result in image aberration and reduced defect detection and characterisation performance. A novel autofocus algorithm has been developed specifically for ultrasonic nondestructive testing and evaluation (NDE). This autofocus algorithm is used for estimating and correcting errors in the assumed element positions for a flexible ultrasonic array coupled to a specimen with an unknown surface profile. Experimental results are provided using a prototype flexible array to inspect a component containing a realistic, undressed <b>weld</b> <b>cap.</b> The results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of generating autofocused imagery that is comparable in quality to benchmark imagery generated using accurately known imaging parameters...|$|R

40|$|Shear {{connectors}} {{are widely}} used to link the slab and girders together in slab-on-girder structures. Assessment of the integrity of shear connectors {{is an important issue}} in the maintenance and health monitoring of such structures. In this study, a 1 : 3 scaled bridge model was constructed with removable anchors linking the slab and girders as shear connectors. Each anchor consisted of a threaded bar penetrating through the soffit of a girder and anchored in the slab by an embedded nut <b>cap</b> with <b>welded</b> steel bar. Different damage scenarios were simulated by removing some of these connectors. A signal-based damage detection method in which the damage feature is characterized by the wavelet packet energy changes was applied to the damage identification of the shear connectors. Using measurements of hammer impact responses, the locations of the loosening of the shear connectors were effectively detected. This paper demonstrates that the wavelet packet-based energy index is a sensitive local damage indicator. The results also show that comparison of the relative vibration between the slab and the girders is a more effective technique for evaluating the shear connector damage than comparison of the vibration of the slab before and after shear connector damage. This finding is particularly interesting because data from the intact (undamaged) bridge is not required. The suitability and efficiency of the approach is expected to be applied in situ to assess the integrity of shear connectors in existing structures.

50|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{attaching}} the stainless steel to the aluminium. The oldest is a co-extruded method, where the stainless steel is extruded with the aluminium. This method has suffered, in isolated cases, from de-lamination (where the stainless steel separates from the aluminium); this {{is said to have}} been eliminated in the latest co-extruded rails. A second method is an aluminium core, upon which two stainless steel sections are fitted as a <b>cap</b> and linear <b>welded</b> along the centre line of the rail. Because aluminium has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than steel, the aluminium and steel must be positively locked to provide a good current collection interface.

The primary mission of the CSB is to safely store spent nuclear fuel removed from the K Basins in dry storage until such time that it can be transferred to the national geological repository at Yucca Mountain Nevada. This sub-project was initiated in late 1994 by a series of studies and conceptual designs. These studies determined that the partially constructed storage building, originally built {{as part of the}} Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP) Project, could be redesigned to safely store the spent nuclear fuel. The scope of the CSB facility initially included a receiving station, a hot conditioning system, a storage vault, and a Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) Handling Machine (MHM).

Ozone (O 3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) samples were collected according to OSHA ID- 214 method and NIOSH analytical method 6014, respectively. Direct reading instruments were used for sampling of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). A semi-quantitative method was used for risk assessment.

40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{control of}} steel welds {{is crucial in}} {{the oil and gas}} transportation industry. The state-of-the-art method is zonal focusing which consists in focusing the ultrasonic beam at specific distances using a wedge in order to check the integrity of specific zones in the weld. Advanced methods such as the total focusing method (TFM) give potentially better images in terms of signal to noise ratio and flaw resolution [1]. Moreover, a complete view of the weld is possible using TFM, contrary to zonal focusing. In this paper, we present a fast implementation of the TFM imaging for weld inspection using wedges. In particular, we propose a GPU implementation that tremendously accelerates the process and makes nearly real-time applications possible. The configuration with two media necessitates an optimization iterative procedure to estimate the proper times of flight, which is implemented in the GPU as well.

These starts-stops led to a high stress on economizer piping welds. Fatigue cracks filled with oxides were developed at the toe root and in the counterbores. Finite element stress analysis (FESA), supported by operating experience data, predicted the life of these welds based on cracks located namely in the counterbore areas (see Figure 1). Periodic and inservice inspections, including TOFD, were performed during a 20 + years of service and the crack growth was monitor based on ISI results.

The residual stress measurements were made by employing the relatively new Contour method and by neutron diffraction using ENGIN-X, the engineering spectrometer at the ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK). The measured underlying transverse residual stress levels are observed to be essentially uniform directly beneath the weld bead in the plate specimen and in the heat affected zone beneath the capping passes moving from mid-length towards the stop-end of the pipe repair. However, results from both test components demonstrate the existence of short-range concentrations of transverse residual stress along the welding direction owing to individual <b>weld</b> <b>capping</b> bead start and stop effects. Such short length-scale stress variations must be allowed for when interpreting residual stress measurements from line-scans. The experimental work also demonstrates the importance of knowing the expected stress or strain distribution prior to choosing measurement lines for detailed study.

40|$|Laser welding is a {{promising}} technique for welding thick metal sheets, {{which is usually}} used for achieving full penetration in a single weld pass. However, among the imperfections that can occur, dropout formation becomes an increasingly larger problem when the sheets to be welded get thicker. When the sheets are 15 mm or thicker {{it is a challenge}} to suppress and countermeasures to suppress dropouts get less impact. If full penetration is not achieved, the dropout formation cannot be formed and the melt flows to form better <b>weld</b> <b>caps.</b> Therefore a typical method when welding 15 mm and thicker is to use partial penetration {{from both sides of the}} joint and thereby achieving full penetration, at a cost of increasing plate handling complexities and time losses. If the mechanisms behind the dropout formation can be understood, countermeasures may be developed and applied in order to be able to laser weld thicker plates with full penetration single pass welding. In order to understand the mechanics of the formation of dropout during full penetration welding in 15 mm thick plates, experiments have been conducted using laser hybrid arc welding (LAHW) using the laser in CW mode and also applying power modulation. During the experiments, the root has been observed with High Speed Imaging (HSI) to observe the mechanisms behind the formation. It is determined that the downward flow from the keyhole along with the surface tensional forces of the molten steel and its cooling rate play the most significant roles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} is to document the structural adequacy of Multi-Canister Overpacks (MCOs) in two separate normal configurations for the 40 -year interim period in the storage tubes at the Canister Storage Building (CSB). The two configurations apply when the lower MCO is arranged with (1) just a shield plug mechanical closure or (2) with the canister cover welded over the shield plug. Multiple analyses have been conducted to show the MCO design is adequate for drop events involving a lower, passive MCO being struck by an overhead drop load MCO both in vertical position. Minimal plastic deformations are experienced for either the MCO with shield plug or the MCO with cover cap. This survivability at 35 g's demonstrates the package's worthiness for 40 years of storage. The force between the two MCOs created by a drop event far exceed that resulting from stacking two loaded MCOs. The stacking load condition is not a structural concern and is, therefore, acceptable for the design duration of 40 years of storage. Both mechanical and <b>welded</b> <b>cap</b> models have the lifting ring and associated flat plate for the top unit to rest on and, therefore, easily fit together.

40|$|The Lemudong’o Formation {{is defined}} here {{as part of}} a late Miocene to Late Pleistocene {{sequence}} of stratified lavas, air-fall and waterlain tuffs, lacustrine, alluvial, and fluvial sediments, and paleosols, that crop out over an approximately 25 * 50 km area on the western margin of the southern Kenyan Rift Valley, approximately 100 km west of Nairobi. The study area is deeply incised by three major permanent river systems that expose sediments of three late Neogene lake basins. The Lemudong’o Formation comprises deposits of the second paleolake basin, which formed during the late Miocene. Stratigraphic sections in several localities are described and correlated in this report, the Lemudong’o Formation is defined, and a basin sedimentary history and environmental reconstruction is proposed. The Lemudong’o Formation has three main phases of sedimentation with a total thickness of 135 m. Phase 1 is represented by predominantly lacustrine and lake-margin siltstones, mudstones,and sandstones. Phase 2 comprises paleosols in the basin center, and fluvial and alluvial sediments on the eastern basin margin. Phase 3 comprises mainly waterlain tuffs and silts, <b>capped</b> by a <b>welded</b> tuff. Phase 2 may reflect a more arid climate, or a lower basin-overflow elevation. Four tuffs in upper phase- 1 mudstones in Lemudong’o Gorge are dated to 6. 12 – 6. 08 Ma.
