40|$|ABSTRACT: Evaporated metal <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> reflectors {{have been}} shown to yield high values of {{internal}} rear reflectance, and are particularly eective when combined with a thin dielectric layer between the silicon and the metal. However, evaporated metals are not compatible with low-cost solar cell fabrication processes and generally do not scatter light well, resulting in inecient trapping of light. In this work, aordable screen-printed metal pastes have been employed to fabricate eective low-cost <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> reflectors. The best of these, fabricated from screen-printed silver paste on a thin silicon nitride dielectric layer, yield <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> reflectance values similar to those of evaporated metal reflectors. Furthermore, the screen-printed <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> reflectors in this study are shown to be highly diuse, thus enhancing light trapping in planar silicon solar cells. PC 1 D simulations suggest that a solar cell with a screen-printed metal/dielectric <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> reflector should outperform one with a high-quality aluminum <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> field...|$|R

40|$|The {{operating}} temperature is reduced and {{the output of}} a solar cell is increased by using a solar cell which carries electrodes in a grid finger pattern on its <b>back</b> <b>surface.</b> These electrodes are sintered at the proper temperature to provide good ohmic contact. After sintering, a reflective material is deposited on the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> by vacuum evaporation. Thus, {{the application of the}} <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> reflector is separate from the back contact formation. <b>Back</b> <b>surface</b> reflectors formed in conjunction with separate grid finger configuration back contacts are more effective than those formed by full back metallization of the reflector material...|$|R

50|$|Although {{corrective}} lenses {{can be produced}} in many different profiles, the most common is ophthalmic or convex-concave. In an ophthalmic lens, both the front and <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> have a positive radius, resulting in a positive / convergent front surface and a negative / divergent <b>back</b> <b>surface.</b> The difference in curvature between {{the front and rear}} surface leads to the corrective power of the lens. In hyperopia a convergent lens is needed, therefore the convergent front surface overpowers the divergent <b>back</b> <b>surface.</b> For myopia the opposite is true: the divergent <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> is greater in magnitude than the convergent front surface. To correct for presbyopia, the lens, or section of the lens, must be more convergent or less divergent than the person's distance lens.|$|R

Trombe walls of thicknesses 20 cm, 25 cm, 30 cm, 35 cm, 40 cm, and 45 cm were investigated in this work.

40|$|A {{model of}} 2 D SH {{ultrasonic}} nondestructive testing for interior strip-like cracks near a non-planar <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> in a thick-walled elastic solid is presented. The model employs a Green's function to reformulate the 2 D antiplane wave scattering problem as two coupled boundary integral equations (BIE) : a displacement BIE for the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> displacement and a hypersingular traction BIE for the crack opening displacement (COD). The integral equations are solved by performing a boundary element discretization of the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> and expanding the COD {{in a series}} of Chebyshev functions which incorporate the correct behaviour at the crack edges. The transmitting ultrasonic probe is modelled by prescribing the traction underneath it, enabling the consequent calculation of the incident field. An electromechanical reciprocity relation is used to model the action of the receiving probe.

40|$|A 3 D {{model of}} {{non-destructive}} ultrasonic testing for cracks near a non-planar <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> is presented. The scattering by an interior rectangular crack in a thick-walled component with a <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> of general geometry is considered. The 3 D wave scattering problem is solved using boundary integral equation methods (BIEMs) : the boundary element method (BEM) for the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> displacement {{is combined with}} an analytical technique for the hypersingular traction boundary integral equation for the crack opening displacement. The solution method generates many unknowns, but by applying a threshold criterion a sparse approximation of the system matrix is obtained such that a fast sparse solver may be used. The computations are accelerated further using the stationary phase approximation for the computation of probe field integrals. The action of ultrasonic probes in transmission and reception, calibration by side-drilled holes and effects of material damping {{are taken into account}} in the model, and a few numerical examples illustrate the influence of the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> geometry...|$|R

30|$|It {{should also}} be borne in mind that most often a metal {{electrode}} {{is applied to the}} <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> of the CdTe absorber layer with the result that radiation with low absorption coefficient is reflected from such an interface. In this case with 100  % reflectance from the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> the absorptivity is the same as for the double thickness of the absorber layer, i.e. the Ahv(d) value in such a solar cell can be found by doubling the thickness d in Eq. (13). The calculation results in Fig.  10 b show that in this case to ensure complete absorption of photons in the solar radiation, the CdTe layer {{should also be}} thick enough, i.e. greater than 40 – 50  μm. If, for example, 95  % absorptivity in solar cell is to be accepted as an acceptable value, the thickness of the CdTe layer with a mirror <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> should be equal to ~ 0.7  μm rather than ~ 1.4  μm as in the case when the reflection from the <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> is not used.|$|R

One solar cell had an Al <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> field (BSF), while the other had boron BSF fabricated by using spin-on boric acid as a p-type dopant. As compared to the Al-BSF solar cell, an improvement in efficiency of 1. 7 % was observed for a solar cell with boron BSF. Since boron BSF is stronger than Al-BSF, an improvement in efficiency {{can be attributed to}} an increase in long wavelength response, collection efficiency and reduced <b>back</b> <b>surface</b> recombination. The boron BSF solar cell showed an efficiency of 12. 9 % with V-oc of 0. 56 V, J(sc) of 32. 2 mA cm(- 2) and FF of 0. 72.
