Simultaneously, global CEO turnover continued to fall to 13. 8 percent in 2007. In contrast, the CEO turnover rate in Australia increased to 18 percent in 2007. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to determine under what conditions a change in a CEO is associated with firm performance. Succinctly, does the firm’s decision to replace the CEO depend on the CEO’s human capital or firm performance? The empirical study of Australian listed firms (2005 – 2008) shows that firm performance is not a determinant of CEO turnover, rather a CEO with less valuable human capital is more likely to be replaced. The study also finds that merely changing the CEO is not associated firm performance. Rather, there is a positive association between firm performance and the successor’s general human capital for firms that replace the CEO. Specifically, it is the internal successor’s general human capital that is an important determinant of increasing firm performance. These results are important because they imply that CEO turnover is a result of a more active market for CEOs and contributes to explaining why firms retain CEOs despite poor firm performance...|$|R

Cervical cancer starts as a precancerous condition, however the changes of precancerous are hardly detected  by the naked eyes, special test such as Papanicolaou test are used to spot the conditions. These are time consuming to inspect visually. In the last 50 years there have been many projects to develop automated computer image analysis system for screening. One of the most important changes in a cell when it becomes precancerous is a change in chromatin texture. The field of nuclear texture analysis gives information about the spatial arrangement of pixel gray levels in a digitized microscopic nuclei image. A well known method for quantifying textures in digital images is the gray level co-occurrence matrix(GLCM). This method tries to quantify specific pairwise gray level occurrence at specific relative positions. In this project, firstly we have developed and tested three image normalization methods : gradient based intensity normalization, histogram equalization and standardizing normal random variables; secondly we have developed 2 D gray level co-occurrence matrix calculation and 3 D gray level co-occurrence matrix calculation, thirdly compared Haralick features with adaptive feature vectors from class distance and class difference matrices (adaptive texture feature) based on the 2 D gray level co-occurrence matrix; compared the Haralick features with adaptive feature based on the 3 D gray level co-occurrence matrix.

This thesis describes research that investigates {{the role of the}} two component system AdeRS, which regulates production of the AdeABC MDR efflux pump. Its role in MDR, biofilm formation and virulence of A. baumannii was determined in mutants constructed for this study. Deletion of AdeRS or AdeABC resulted in increased susceptibility to antibiotics, decreased biofilm formation on biotic and abiotic surfaces and decreased virulence in a strain dependent manner. RNA-Seq revealed that loss of AdeRS or AdeB significantly altered the transcriptome, resulting in changed expression of many genes, notably those associated with antimicrobial resistance and virulence interactions. Thjs study demonstrated the scope of AdeRS mediated regulation and suggests that inhibition of AdeABC could prevent biofilm formation or colonisation in patients by A. baumannii and so provides a good target for drug discovery. This study also highlighted the differences between A. baumannii strains and shows that conclusions for the species should not be drawn from the study of single strains. ...|$|R

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) {{has been reported in}} OC and downregulation of Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) is a hallmark of this process. However, findings on the relationship between E-cadherin levels and OC progression, dissemination and aggressiveness are controversial. In this study, the evaluation of E-cadherin expression in an OC tissue microarray revealed its prognostic value to discriminate between advanced- and early-stage tumors, as well as serous tumors from other histologies. Moreover, E-cadherin, Neural cadherin (N-cadherin), cytokeratins and vimentin expression was assessed in TOV- 112, SKOV- 3, OAW- 42 and OV- 90 OC cell lines grown in monolayers and under anchorage-independent conditions to mimic ovarian tumor cell dissemination, and results were associated with cell aggressiveness. According to these EMT-related markers, cell lines were classified as mesenchymal (M; TOV- 112), intermediate mesenchymal (IM; SKOV- 3), intermediate epithelial (IE; OAW- 42) and epithelial (E; OV- 90). M- and IM-cells depicted the highest migration capacity when grown in monolayers, and aggregates derived from M- and IM-cell lines showed lower cell death, higher adhesion to extracellular matrices and higher invasion capacity than E- and IE-aggregates. The analysis of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, cytokeratin 19 and vimentin mRNA levels in 20 advanced-stage high-grade serous human OC ascites showed an IM phenotype in all cases, characterized by higher proportions of N- to E-cadherin and vimentin to cytokeratin 19. In particular, higher E-cadherin mRNA levels were associated with cancer antigen 125 levels more than 500 U/mL and platinum-free intervals less than 6 months.

Because the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a cyprinid susceptible to SVCV and their genetics and genome sequence are well advanced, it has been chosen as a model for SVCV infections. We have used newly designed pathway-targeted microarrays 3 - 4 -fold enriched for immune/infection functional-relevant probes by using zebrafish orthologous to human genes from selected pathways of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The comparative analysis of differential expression of genes through 20 pathways in 2 -day exposed or 30 -day survivors of SVCV infection allowed the identification of 16 multipath genes common to more than 6 pathways. In addition, receptors (Toll-like, B-cell, T-cell, RIG 1 -like) as well as viral RNA infection pathways were identified as the most important human-like pathways targeted by SVCV infection.

Female animals that had abortion history were sampled. Totally, 226 serum samples were collected from cattle herds living in Ardebil (46), Garmsar (84) and Babol (96) regions, representatives of three cold, warm and dry and mild temperate climate zones of Iran, respectively. Herd’s abortion history, age and gestation numbers were assessed by questionnaires. 1 : 100 serum dilutions were analyzed for Neospora caninum antibodies by commercially available ELISA kit. Optical 2 absorbencies (OD) were above 0. 5 was considered as positive for NC infection. R test, linear and logistic regressions were also done. Seroprevalences of 7 %, 45. 2 % and 57. 3 % were observed for cattle herds from Ardebil, Garmsar and Babol regions, respectively. Gestation number, abortion number and age of cattle had specific effects on Neospora caninum seroprevalence, so that, age group of 4 through 5 years with history of 1 abortion and gestation, had highest seroprevalences almost among all three main groups. Cold temperate climate region had significantly reduced rate of Neospora caninum seropositivity...|$|R
40|$|Giardia and Cryptosporidium are {{the most}} {{frequent}} enteric protozoa <b>causing</b> gastroenteritis <b>in</b> humans <b>worldwide.</b> Intense recreational activity at Portuguese river beaches triggered {{the opportunity for a}} 2 -year seasonal survey of 19 large river basin beaches. A total of 74 samples were collected and processed according to USEPA Method 1623 to detect Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo) cysts. Faecal indicators (thermotolerant/total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci) and physicochemical parameters were also analysed according to the EU Bath Water Directive (BWD). Results pointed to a widespread presence of these protozoa at Portuguese river beaches. The percentage of samples testing positive for Giardia and Cryptosporidium were 85 and 82 % respectively, with no significant differences between wet and dry seasons (p > 0. 05). Although Portuguese river beaches present a very low exposure risk for infection with Giardia and Cryptosporidium (under 10 (- 3)), a few particular cases revealed values over 0. 2 %, and were related to stormy wet events. The correlation between levels of Giardia and thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli and enterococci, was high (r ≥ 0. 87, p < 0. 001), suggesting the need to carry out specific procedures for the detection of Giardia and Cryptosporidium whenever the values of those faecal indicators approach the maximum allowed level of the EU BWD...|$|R
