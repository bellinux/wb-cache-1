5000|$|In 2009, Fiskars sold Brunton Inc. to a Swedish company, Fenix Outdoor AB. [...] After divestiture, Brunton {{closed out}} its Nexus <b>and</b> Elite <b>compass</b> lines <b>and</b> {{discontinued}} the Brunton 54LU compass, {{all of which}} were relabeled Silva of Sweden products, and discontinued imports of the Silva Multi-Navigator GPS sold in North America as the Brunton MNS. These actions left Silva of Sweden without a North American distributor for its Swedish-made <b>compasses</b> <b>and</b> GPS tools. As a result, Silva of Sweden <b>compasses</b> <b>and</b> GPS products are no longer available in North America.|$|R

5|$|The {{relation}} of two fields is {{expressed by the}} notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a <b>compass</b> <b>and</b> straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as a civil engineer, Lemoine wrote a {{treatise}} concerning <b>compass</b> <b>and</b> straightedge constructions entitled, La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which he considered his greatest work, {{despite the fact that}} it was not well-received critically. The original title was De la mesure de la simplicité dans les sciences mathématiques, and the original idea for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics. Time constraints, however, limited the scope of the paper. Instead of the original idea, Lemoine proposed a simplification of the construction process to a number of basic operations with the <b>compass</b> <b>and</b> straightedge. He presented this paper at a meeting of the Association Française in Oran, Algeria in 1888. The paper, however, did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there. Lemoine published several other papers on his construction system that same year, including Sur la mesure de la simplicité dans les constructions géométriques in the Comptes rendus of the Académie française. He published additional papers on the subject in Mathesis (1888), Journal des mathématiques élémentaires (1889), Nouvelles annales de mathématiques (1892), and the self-published La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which was presented at the meeting of the Association Française in Pau (1892), and again at Besançon (1893) and Caen (1894).|$|E

5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} <b>compass</b> <b>and</b> he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the <b>compass,</b> <b>and</b> gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
5|$|In 1756, French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{introduced the}} constellation of Circinus with the French name le Compas, representing a pair of dividing compasses, on a chart of the southern sky. On that chart, Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus, and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a <b>compass,</b> <b>and</b> a surveyor's level {{in a set of}} draughtsman's instruments. Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.|$|E
5|$|Several {{problems}} were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported {{issue is that}} the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, <b>compass,</b> <b>and</b> accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested {{that this is a}} hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have been fixed by software updates.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{methods can}} be used to enclose an {{arbitrary}} simple polygon within a curve of constant width, whose width equals the diameter of the given polygon. The resulting shape consists of circular arcs (at most as many as sides of the polygon), can be constructed algorithmically in linear time, and can be drawn with <b>compass</b> <b>and</b> straightedge. Although the regular-polygon based Reuleaux polygons all have an odd number of circular-arc sides, it is possible to construct constant-width shapes based on irregular polygons that have an even number of sides.|$|E
5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun <b>compass</b> <b>and</b> some trucks were also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E

In June 1942, he assumed command of a new patrol bomber squadron, VB-106, equipped with PB4Y-1 Liberators, which he led in a daring raid on Wake Island, in the Solomon Islands campaign, and in the Southwest Pacific Area. Returning to the United States in 1944, he was posted was to the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California, where he joined the Manhattan Project, participating in Project Camel, the development of the non-nuclear components of the Fat Man bomb, and in its drop testing.|$|E

5|$|In {{the century}} from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, {{the field of}} mathematics—specifically algebra—underwent a {{profound}} revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., cubic, quartic, and quintic equations, {{as well as on}} the related problem of constructing regular polygons using <b>compass</b> <b>and</b> straightedge. Beginning with Carl Friedrich Gauss's 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in Gaussian integers, Évariste Galois's introduction of permutation groups in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846 by Liouville), William Rowan Hamilton's discovery of quaternions in 1843, and Arthur Cayley's more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether's most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, abstract algebra.|$|E
5|$|The {{game had}} {{multiple}} versions for players to purchase. A season pass was announced on November 12, 2015. Players who bought {{this version of}} the game could gain early access to operators offered in the DLCs and receive several weapon skins. The game was also released alongside its Collector's Edition, which included the game's season pass, a hat, a <b>compass</b> <b>and</b> bottle opener, a backpack, and a 120-page guide. A Starter Edition was released on PC in June 2016, featuring all the maps, modes and weapons of the standard edition, and included two operators plus enough Rainbow 6 Credits to purchase two more of the player's choice (players could purchase the rest of the operators with Renown or Rainbow 6 Credits). The Starter Edition was cheaper than the main game, and was initially available for a limited time. In February 2017, the Starter Edition became permanently available via Uplay.|$|E
