50|$|The colour {{scheme for}} the drones {{used in the}} second film is {{essentially}} the same as that used for the television versions at the time, being silver with grey shoulders, natural aluminium collars <b>and</b> <b>slats,</b> blue hemispheres <b>and</b> a black fender. The narrative fails to establish a precise hierarchy for the Dalek commanders seen in the film. The leader of the expeditionary force appears to be a gold Dalek with natural aluminium collars <b>and</b> <b>slats,</b> black hemispheres <b>and</b> a black fender. A black Dalek with gold hemispheres, natural aluminium collars <b>and</b> <b>slats</b> <b>and</b> a black fender is in charge of a mining operation in Bedfordshire, while a red Dalek with natural aluminium collars <b>and</b> <b>slats</b> <b>and</b> a black fender with red topping is shown commanding a Dalek spaceship and operations to capture human slaves and wipe-out the resistance. Drones sport blue dome lights, the black and red Daleks have red dome lights and the gold Dalek has yellow dome lights. As for the first film, the Dalek props were constructed by Shawcraft Engineering.|$|R

40|$|The Flap/Slat Controller {{benchmark}} {{is derived}} from a case study for Airbus [1]. During take-off (and landing) flaps <b>and</b> <b>slats</b> of the aircraft are extended to generate more lift at low velocity {{and have to be}} retracted in time as they are not robust enough for high velocities. Our system model is scalable in the number of flaps/slats, which allows us to study scalability of our methods on systems of concurrent components. 1 Application Domain Flaps <b>and</b> <b>slats</b> are aerodynamic surfaces on respectively the trailing and leading edge of an aircraftâ€™s wings. During take-off and landing, these flaps <b>and</b> <b>slats</b> are extended to generate more lift at low velocity and have to be retracted in time as they are not robust enough for high velocities. They are under the primary control of the pilot via a Slat/Flap Lever, where lever positions correspond to flap/slat positions.
