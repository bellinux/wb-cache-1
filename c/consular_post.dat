2500|$|In Jerusalem, the French {{consulate}} {{is claimed}} to have issued stamps in May 1948 for its staff and local French nationals. The French stamps supposedly went through three issues: {{the first and second}} were [...] "Affaires Étrangères" [...] stamps, inscribed gratis but overprinted, while the third were [...] "Marianne" [...] stamps (6 francs) that arrived from France by the end of May. The consulate also created its own cancellation: Jerusalem Postes Françaises. Philatelic research has exposed the French <b>Consular</b> <b>post</b> as a fraud perpetrated by the son of the then consul, though other philatelists have maintained their claims that the postal service and its stamps are genuine.|$|E

These words should be inscribed on his buttons if he had any--but he has none.

60|$|It was in {{the summer}} of 1865 that I came home from my <b>consular</b> <b>post</b> at Venice; and two weeks after I landed in Boston, I went out to see Lowell at Elmwood, and give him an {{inkstand}} that I had brought him from Italy. The bronze lobster whose back opened and disclosed an inkpot and a sand- box was quite ugly; but I thought it beautiful then, and if Lowell thought otherwise he never did anything to let me know it. He put the thing {{in the middle of his}} writing-table (he nearly always wrote on a pasteboard pad resting upon his knees), and there it remained as long as I knew the place--a matter of twenty-five years; but in all that time I suppose the inkpot continued as dry as the sand-box.|$|E
