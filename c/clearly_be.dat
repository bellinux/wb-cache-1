5|$|Four of {{the twelve}} LCPRs had been damaged. Three were soon repaired, {{but they could not}} be risked further, for without them, the {{reconnaissance}} force could not be evacuated. The emergency plan provided for an APD to enter the harbour and take troops off from a jetty but this would <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> a desperate measure indeed. Over the next four hours, the boats continued to make trips to the beach, but only when it was believed destroyers had suppressed enemy fire. Heavy rain made it safer by reducing visibility. The last destroyer was unloaded at 12:50. By this time, the navy had lost two men dead and three wounded.|$|E
5|$|Twyfelfontein valley {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by Stone-age hunter-gatherers of the Wilton stone age culture group since approximately 6,000 years ago. They made {{most of the}} engravings and probably all the paintings. 2,000 to 2,500 years ago the Khoikhoi, an ethnic group related to the San (Bushmen), occupied the valley, then known under its Damara/Nama name ǀUi-ǁAis (jumping waterhole). The Khoikhoi also produced rock art which can <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> distinguished from the older engravings.|$|E

25|$|Archeological {{evidence}} suggests {{a history of}} settlement in the area since roughly 2000 BC. The present city can <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> traced back to AD 995, {{when a group of}} monks from Lindisfarne chose the strategic high peninsula as a place to settle with the body of Saint Cuthbert, that had previously lain in Chester-le-Street, founding a church there.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{portions}} of the tunnel have collapsed, once claiming several houses. The line of the underground tunnel can <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> traced by dips {{in some of the}} north-south streets crossing its path. The largest cave-in to date resulted in creation of a park on Broad Street between 24th and 25th where a church once stood.|$|E
25|$|Another {{decision}} {{added two}} more guidelines regarding {{the design of}} the coins. The state issuing a coin should in some way <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> identified on the obverse side, either by stating the full name or a clearly identifiable abbreviation of it; and neither name nor the denomination of the coin should be repeated on the obverse, as it is already featured on the common reverse side.|$|E

25|$|Removal of the {{remaining}} liquid (solvent) phase requires a drying process, which is typically accompanied by {{a significant amount of}} shrinkage and densification. The rate at which the solvent can be removed is ultimately determined by the distribution of porosity in the gel. The ultimate microstructure of the final component will <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> strongly influenced by changes imposed upon the structural template during this phase of processing.|$|E
25|$|Woodman {{was exposed}} to the {{symbolic}} work of Max Klinger whilst studying in Rome from 1977 to 1978 and his influence can <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> seen in many photographic series’, such as Eel Series, Roma (1977–78) and Angel Series, Roma (1977). In combining performance, play and self-exposure, Woodman’s photographs create extreme and often disturbing psychological states. In concealing or encrypting her subjects she reminds the viewer that photographs flatten and distort, never offering the whole truth about a subject.|$|E
25|$|He {{appeared}} as himself on several television shows during his retirement, first on Ed Sullivan's variety show Toast of the Town June 5, 1949, {{and again on}} July 6, 1958. He {{appeared as}} the Mystery Guest on What's My Line? on April 26, 1953, and twice on This Is Your Life: on March 10, 1954 for Mack Sennett, and again on December 14, 1955, on his own episode.

25|$|For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, {{thinking}} {{they would have}} 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 to bat for 20 overs, it would <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> unfair to give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.|$|E
25|$|Structuralism is an epistemologically {{realistic}} view in that {{it holds}} that mathematical statements have an objective truth value. However, its central claim only relates to what kind of entity a mathematical object is, not to what kind of existence mathematical objects or structures have (not, in other words, to their ontology). The kind of existence mathematical objects have would <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> dependent on that of the structures {{in which they are}} embedded; different sub-varieties of structuralism make different ontological claims in this regard.|$|E
25|$|The known {{remains of}} Samarra occupy {{an area of}} {{approximately}} , mostly {{on the east side}} of the Tigris. Out of 6,314 registered buildings at the site (as of 1991), only nine still have any components of significant height; the vast majority of the ruins consist of collapsed mounds of rammed earth and scattered debris. At ground level, the remains are mostly unimpressive; when viewed from the air, however, the entire plan of the Abbasid city, with its buildings and street pattern, can <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> seen.|$|E

25|$|It can {{be argued}} that within this {{backdrop}} of mostly indistinguishable types, exceptions would be far more pronounced. Atypical reverses are usually seen during and after periods of war, at which time emperors make various claims of liberation, subjugation, and pacification. Some of these reverse images can <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> classified as propaganda. An example struck by emperor Philip in 244 features a legend proclaiming the establishment of peace with Persia; in truth, Rome had been forced to pay large sums in tribute to the Persians.|$|E
25|$|This comment has {{traditionally}} caused commentators {{to conclude that}} Luke was a Gentile. If this were true, it would make Luke the only writer of the New Testament who can <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> identified as not being Jewish. However, {{that is not the}} only possibility. Although Luke is considered likely to be a Gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to be a Hellenized Jew. The phrase could just as easily be used to differentiate between those Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism and those who did not.|$|E
25|$|A form {{of these}} arms {{was first used}} by King William the Lion in the 12th century, though no trace {{of them can be}} made out on his seal. However, a lion rampant can <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> made out on the seal of his son, Alexander II. Over the years many writers have claimed them to be much older; even Alexander Nisbet, {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} more reliable Scottish heralds, claims that a lion was first adopted as a personal symbol by the legendary Fergus, with the royal tressure being added in the reign of Achaius. This is clearly untrue as, even if Fergus and Achaius had existed, they predate the existence of heraldry by several centuries.|$|E
