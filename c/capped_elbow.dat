5|$|There are {{numerous}} issues {{that can occur}} with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness. Stocking up {{is an issue that}} occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing swelling and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and swelling. Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue, called a <b>capped</b> <b>elbow,</b> or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or swelling {{to the back of the}} fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear most often in the rear legs. Soft and fluid-filled, the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness. Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath, often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and lameness.|$|E
5000|$|Capped joint: Inflammation {{leading to}} the {{development}} of a [...] "false" [...] or acquired bursa over the point of the elbow (<b>capped</b> <b>elbow,</b> also known as a [...] "shoe boil"), point of the hock (capped hock), or knee (capped knee, or carpal hygroma) which causes an obvious swelling in the area. These are generally considered blemishes.|$|E

40|$|Unlike other farm animals, {{the horse}} is {{serviceable}} only when in motion. Any abnormal deviation in the structure or action of a horse can render it partly or completely useless. Therefore, any defect that affects serviceability is considered an unsoundness, i. e., lameness, blindness, faulty wind, etc. Those defects that detract from appearance but do not impair serviceability are considered blemishes, i. e., scars, <b>capped</b> hocks and <b>elbows,</b> etc. Blemishes are looked upon with great disfavor in gaited, parade, and some pleasure horses. They are more common in stock horses and tend to detract less from their value than from other types of horses...|$|R
60|$|Here {{a hearty}} but silent laugh {{interrupted}} his words, and nudging <b>Cap</b> with his <b>elbow,</b> they all continued {{to watch the}} movements of Chingachgook in profound stillness. The Mohican remained stationary as the rock on which he stood full ten minutes; {{and then it was}} apparent that something of interest had occurred within his view, for he drew back with a hurried manner, looked anxiously and keenly along the margin of the stream, and moved quickly down it, taking care to lose his trail in the shallow water. He was evidently in a hurry and concerned, now looking behind him, and then casting eager glances towards every spot on the shore where he thought a canoe might be concealed.|$|R
