By considering competitive intensity and supply economies of scale simultaneously, we find that equilibrium channel structures are primarily determined by the competitive intensity, which is true even under supply diseconomies of scale; the key message in the second paper of scale economies driving retailer's outsourcing supply decision is highly dependent on the assumption of perfect substitutes. Our finding has no qualitative difference when either the suppliers or the retailers are modeled as the channel leader and make the outsourcing decisions.

40|$|The idea of {{outsourcing}} is {{to achieve}} the optimal performance within a company and a supply <b>chain.</b> <b>Outsourcing</b> decisions, therefore, require life cycle analysis of anticipated changes concerning all relevant costs, including indirect ones, to avoid undesired surprises. Life cycle costing (LCC) is an approach which aims at producing comprehensive cost information for decision makers by estimating the costs incurring {{in the future and}} by monitoring the costs during the life cycle. In the context of outsourcing, LCC can provide useful information for both customers and suppliers.

30|$|Supply chain network design (SCND) decisions, as {{the most}} {{important}} strategic level decisions in supply chain management, are concerned with complex interrelationships between various tiers, such as suppliers, plants, distribution centers, and customer zones as well as determining the number, location, and capacity of facilities to meet customer needs effectively. Supply chain management integrates interrelationships between various entities through creating alliance, such as information system integration and process integration, between entities to improve response to customers in various aspects such as, higher product variety and quality, lower costs, and faster responses. One of the vital challenges for organizations in today's competitive markets is the need to respond to customer needs, which are very volatile and can occur in volume and in a variety of customer needs ([Amir 2011]). Agility with its various contexts is the most popular strategy that enables organizations to confront unstable and highly volatile customer demands. Since the SCND is the most important strategic level decision that affects the overall performance of supply chain, it is necessary to consider agility concepts such as response to customers in maximum allowable time, direct shipment, alliance (information and process integration) between entities in different echelons, discount to achieve competitive supply <b>chain,</b> <b>outsourcing,</b> using different transportation modes to achieve flexibility, and safety stock to improve responsiveness. It is evident that considering agility concepts in SCND plays an incredible role in agility of the overall supply chain. As yet, many researchers have tried to show the most important factors in agile supply chain management theoretically, and this context has been omitted in the mathematical modeling area especially in the supply chain network design area.|$|E

As emerging economies tap deeper into global supply <b>chains,</b> <b>outsourcing</b> of jobs will influence employment and there is need for a more transparent, coherent and balanced framework at the global level. Also a more balanced pattern of domestic demand will only be achieved with rising wages rather than through increased debt levels. Economies need continuously to increase their skill and knowledge base in order to successfully integrate themselves into the global production process. Active labour market policies (including skill development) should be strengthened to better prepare workers for the future job market. When temporary dislocation of workers cannot be avoided, appropriate social protection measures provide worker security.

40|$|The {{organisational}} {{forms of}} companies have undergone a transformation from a hierarchal structure towards a network based form. The network form {{has proven to}} be the best structure for the current competitive environment. With technological advancements in almost every area it has become almost impossible to produce everything “in-house” and still stay competitive. This has caused an increase in the degree of outsourcing parts of the value chain to suppliers. Therefore, the competition has now moved from between companies to between entire value chains. For a manufacturing company, with {{a large part of the}} value <b>chain</b> <b>outsourced</b> to suppliers the task of setting up production in a new market brings forth new questions such as: is it possible to move an entire value chain to a new country? The purpose of this thesis is to explore what factors influence the construction of a strategic network of suppliers of a manufacturing company when entering a new market. The purpose was divided into two research questions: How is the internationalisation process performed in a strategic network situation and what factors influence the construction of a supplier structure in a world based on networks? Three multinational companies with a large part of their value <b>chain</b> <b>outsourced</b> to suppliers were chosen for interviews: Ericsson, Scania and Volvo Truck Corporation. The internationalisation process of a manufacturing company is conducted as follows: the first step is the decision to enter a new market followed by a rather quick set up of a production plant. In this initial phase of the establishment, everything or almost everything is imported which is possible due to a global network of suppliers. The last step depends on the strategic objective with the establishment, either importing will continue or a complete organisation will be established in the country. A complete organisation is in this aspect when the company makes large investments inthe market and starts constructing a supplier network, surrounding sales and marketing functions. Factors influencing the internationalising process are: degree of networking, the type and structure of the network surrounding the company; level of knowledge, the accumulated experience of operating in foreign markets; type of market, the characteristics of the market and degree of commitment i. e. will an entire organisation be built up or will importing suffice...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a generic {{framework}} to assess and simulate outsourcing risks in the supply chain. Design/methodology/ approach: This combination approach involves a qualitative risk analysis methodology termed as the supply chain risk-failure mode and effect analysis (SCR-FMEA) which integrates risk identification, analysis and mitigation actions together to evaluate supply <b>chain</b> <b>outsourcing</b> risk. The qualitative risk assessment will allow risk manager to provide a visual presentation of imminent risks using the risk map. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) on the imminent risks of delivery outsourcing using the Milk-Run system is adopted. Findings: With basic statistical concepts, key performance variables and the risk of delivery outsourcing are analyzed. It is found that a newly implemented delivery outsourcing arrangement on the Milk-Run system reduces the average customer lead-time and total cost. However, a certain extent of risk or uncertainty can still be detected due to the presence of variation. Research limitations/implications: This paper reveals that company can manage the risk by adopting a systematic method for identifying the potential risks before outsourcing and MCS can be applied for examining the quantifiable risks such as lead time and cost. Practical implications - The paper provides a generic guideline for practitioners to assess logistics outsourcing, especially for logistics management consultants and professionals for evaluating the risk and impact of outsourcing. It is believed that the proposed risk assessment framework can help to analyze the operational cost uncertainty and ensure the stability of the supply chain. However, the limitation of this research is that the full spectrum of outsourcing risk, especially the non-quantifiable risk may not be analyzed by MCS. Originality/value: This paper proposed an integrated framework which combines qualitative and quantitative method together for managing outsourcing risk. This research provides a standardized metric to quantify risk in the supply chain so as to determine the effectiveness of outsourcing. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Background: The costs {{incurred}} {{in the provision}} of products and services across the supply chain are on the rise in many industries, including the mobile phone industry. Despite this, there is limited information in South Africa on the perceptions of supply chain players regarding cost reduction in the mobile phone industry. Furthermore, there is currently no framework for reducing supply chain costs in the South African mobile phone industry. Aim: The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore supply chain costs in the South African mobile phone industry, and to develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Setting: This study explores supply chain costs in four mobile phone companies operating in the South African mobile phone industry, of which three mobile network operators and one mobile retailing group. It uses semi-structured interview data collected in 2011. Method: This study adopted a qualitative case study design to understand supply chain costs and develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Eight semi-structured interviews with managers of mobile phone companies were conducted. The data were analysed with the help of Atlas. ti, using an adapted three-phased analytical framework as suggested by Miles and Huberman (1994) and O’ Dwyer (2004). Results: The study found that consolidation of strategic relationships through collaboration and strategic alliances between MNOs and other supply chain players is one of the ways to drive costs down across the supply <b>chain.</b> <b>Outsourcing</b> of some of the support activities and retailers’ direct purchasing transactions from device manufacturers were also found to be other avenues for reducing supply chain costs in the industry. Conclusion: The study suggests that mobile network operators (MNOs) need to consolidate their strategic relationships by increasing the share of the network infrastructure, and emphasising the need to strive for operational efficiencies. This combined effort should result in significant cost reductions across the supply chain. The findings of this study provided some avenues that managers of mobile-phone companies could consider to drive costs down supply chain-wide and service end-users at lower rates. The findings of this study could also help regulating authorities to get insights into supply chain cost reduction and develop appropriate mobile phone policies in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{a typical}} company would manage all {{logistics}} processes by itself, end-to-end. Larger organisations {{are able to}} manage these activities better because they gain economies of scale from processing all logistics functions. However, business rivalry and globalisation have forced many organisations to rationalise all activities from marketing to production, human resources and now also logistics. In the process, the organisational focus has now shifted from an organisation carrying out all its activities to concentrating on its core activities; non-core activities such as logistics and other back office functions are being outsourced. Outsourcing of logistics and supply chain services {{is not a new}} concept. While outsourcing has seen renewed emphasis in recent years, the practice {{can be traced back to}} almost as far as one would care to research it. In Warehousing Profitably, Ackerman (2000) suggests that one of the first business logistics arrangements is described in The Bible, Genesis 41 1 : This is an account of the seven years of plenty during which the people in the land of Egypt accumulated crops for the predicted seven years of famine. The grains and other fruits of their labours were taken to storehouses for safekeeping. One could argue that this could be the beginning of logistics outsourcing in the form of warehousing by a third party. What we see today is the advanced and most modern form of outsourcing which includes value added services beyond anyone's imagination. This has contributed to the phenomenal growth of the logistics outsourcing industry worldwide. According to a recent study by Armstrong & Associates Inc., the logistics and supply <b>chain</b> <b>outsourcing</b> business exceeded US$ 100 billion in 2005 in the United States of America alone. This is a 16 % increase over the previous year's turnover 2. This figure includes 22 % revenue generated by value added services. The global revenue of Third Party Logistics (3 PL) companies in 2005 was US$ 333 billion 3. However, the success of outsourcing is in question due to an increasing number of outsourcing initiatives failing within the first year and continued discontent among the outsourcing business community. "About one quarter of all logistics outsourcing agreements fail within the first year, and 60 percent within three years," says Jim Tompkins, CEO and founder of supply chain consulting firm Tompkins Associates, Raleigh, N. C. A recent Warehousing Education and Research Council (WERC) pamphlet reported that 55 % of logistics outsourcing alliances are terminated after 3 - 5 years. In some cases it was noticed that the relationship ended even before completion of the first year of operation. According to a survey reported by the Journal of Commerce, 43 % of identified users of 3 PLs in North America cancelled at least one 3 PL contract in 1998 4. Outsourcing of logistics and supply chain activities is considered an innovative solution in view of expanding and increasingly growing globalisation. However, the outsourcing of non-core activities to a third party is not always successful. This particular issue encouraged me to investigate the reasons for outsourcing failures. This research focuses on the reasons for outsourcing failure and discontent among the outsourcing community...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of retailers structure their businesses using the supply <b>chain</b> <b>outsourcing</b> model. Pursuant to this model retailers outsource production to suppliers who then outsource the actual clothing manufacturing work to factories and/or outworkers. The supply chain model {{is an extremely}} profitable business model for corporations. These retailers, rather than being involved with both manufacturing and marketing, devote all their attention to marketing and designing new products. For all intents and purposes, they are hollow corporations, focusing entirely upon marketing. Even though retailers {{are not involved in}} the manufacturing process, this does not mean they have no influence over this process. Weller has observed that the buyer driven model is not suitable for all retailers. The buyer driven model is however appropriate for major Australian retailers such as Coles Myer, Woolworths or Australian Discount Retail Pty Ltd. These large retail groups have sufficient market power to exercise substantial control over suppliers of clothing products and over traders who interact with outworkers. Nossa, Quinlan and Johnstone refer to these corporate groups at the top of supply chains as effective business controllers. Research has continually demonstrated that outworkers are vulnerable and operate in unsafe working conditions. Marshall J in Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Southern Cross Clothing Pty Ltd explained: Outworkers in the clothing industry in Australia {{are some of the most}} exploited people in the Australian workforce. They perform garment making work often at absurdly low rates in locations outside their employer's premises. This frequently occurs in the homes of outworkers. In order to address the plight of outworkers legislative reforms have been introduced to extend industrial protection to outworkers in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. In a previous paper the author has focused on how these duties operate to impose OHS duties over the trader who directly supplies the outworker with work. This article will analyse if OHS duties can be pushed higher in the supply chain to vest over the parties who outsource work in the first place and often control the overall supply chain: retailers. Nossar, Quinlan and Johnstone argue that an 'overarching deficiency [of the current regulatory framework] has been the absence of any relevant formal legal obligations upon the major retailers, who effectively control the Australian clothing supply chains. This has provided an economic context in which the different parties competing further down the supply chains can only survive commercially by reducing their costs, most notably the costs of complying with formal legal obligations. ' This article will analyse the OHS duties of retailers in four parts. First this paper will consider how deemed employment laws which require traders to manage outworkers’ workplace safety may be able to be extended up supply chains to vest over retailers. Secondly this paper will analyse how employers’ OHS duties for non-employees may create OHS duties for retailers to ensure outworkers safety. It appears that imposing OHS duties across several corporate relationships and across geographical locations may diminish the capacity of retailers to manage outworkers. The third part of this paper will demonstrate how the OHS duties only require parties to take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure safety. Finally this paper will analyze the capacity of retailers to utilize hold harmless clauses to avoid OHS duties. Hold harmless clauses have been subject to recent judicial and legislative attention in the principal/contractor relationship. The precedents established in the principal/contractor relationship on hold harmless clauses are applicable for all relationships, and this may include the retail/outworker relationship. As the relationship between retailers and other participants in supply chains is governed predominantly by common law contracts, hold harmless clauses may have significant potential to determine the scope of a retailer's responsibility for the OHS of outworkers in a supply chain. More importantly, if allowed to operate widely, hold harmless clauses have the potential to act as a significant limitation on the reach of OHS laws to a growing population of vulnerable workers. ...|$|E
40|$|Value chain {{collaboration}} {{has been}} a prevailing topic for research, {{and there is a}} constantly growing interest in developing collaborative models for improved efficiency in logistics. One area of collaboration is demand information management, which enables improved visibility and decrease of inventories in the value <b>chain.</b> <b>Outsourcing</b> of non-core competencies has changed the nature of collaboration from intra-enterprise to cross-enterprise activity, and this together with increasing competition in the globalizing markets have created a need for methods and tools for collaborative work. The retailer part in the value chain of consumer packaged goods (CPG) has been studied relatively widely, proven models have been defined, and there exist several best practice collaboration cases. The information and communications technology has developed rapidly, offering efficient solutions and applications to exchange information between value chain partners. However, the majority of CPG industry still works with traditional business models and practices. This concerns especially companies operating in the upstream of the CPG value chain. Demand information for consumer packaged goods originates at retailers' counters, based on consumers' buying decisions. As this information does not get transferred along the value chain towards the upstream parties, each player needs to optimize their part, causing safety margins for inventories and speculation in purchasing decisions. The safety margins increase with each player, resulting in a phenomenon known as the bullwhip effect. The further the company is from the original demand information source, the more distorted the information is. This thesis concentrates on the upstream parts of the value chain of consumer packaged goods, and more precisely the packaging value chain. Packaging is becoming a part of the product with informative and interactive features, and therefore is not just a cost item needed to protect the product. The upstream part of the CPG value chain is distinctive, as the product changes after each involved party, and therefore the original demand information from the retailers cannot be utilized as such – even if it were transferred seamlessly. The objective of this thesis is to examine the main drivers for collaboration, and barriers causing the moderate adaptation level of collaborative models. Another objective is to define a collaborative demand information management model and test it in a pilot business situation in order to see if the barriers can be eliminated. The empirical part of this thesis contains three parts, all related to the research objective, but involving different target groups, viewpoints and research approaches. The study shows evidence that the main barriers for collaboration are very similar to the barriers in {{the lower part of the}} same value chain; lack of trust, lack of business case and lack of senior management commitment. Eliminating one of them – the lack of business case – is not enough to eliminate the two other barriers, as the operational model in this thesis shows. The uncertainty of the future, fear of losing an independent position in purchasing decision making and lack of commitment remain strong enough barriers to prevent the implementation of the proposed collaborative business model. The study proposes a new way of defining the value chain processes: it divides the contracting and planning process into two processes, one managing the commercial parts and the other managing the quantity and specification related issues. This model can reduce the resistance to collaboration, as the commercial part of the contracting process would remain the same as in the traditional model. The quantity/specification-related issues would be managed by the parties with the best capabilities and resources, as well as access to the original demand information. The parties in between would be involved in the planning process as well, as their impact for the next party upstream is significant. The study also highlights the future challenges for companies operating in the CPG value chain. The markets are becoming global, with toughening competition. Also, the technology development will most likely continue with a speed exceeding the adaptation capabilities of the industry. Value chains are also becoming increasingly dynamic, which means shorter and more agile business relationships, and at the same time the predictability of consumer demand is getting more difficult due to shorter product life cycles and trends. These changes will certainly have an effect on companies' operational models, but it is very difficult to estimate when and how the proven methods will gain wide enough adaptation to become standards...|$|E

40|$|The rising {{share of}} {{intangibles}} in economies worldwide highlights {{the crucial role}} of knowledge-intensive and creative industries in current and future wealth generation. The recognition of this trend has led to intense competition in these industries. At the micro-level, firms from both advanced and emerging economies are globally dispersing their value chains to control costs and leverage capabilities. The geography of innovation is {{the outcome of a}} dynamic process whereby firms from emerging economies strive to catch-up with advanced economy competitors, creating strong pressures for continued innovation. However, two distinct strategies can be discerned with regard to the control of the value chain. A vertical integration strategy emphasizes taking advantage of ‘linkage economies’ whereby controlling multiple value chain activities enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of each one of them. In contrast, a specialization strategy focuses on identifying and controlling the creative heart of the value <b>chain,</b> while <b>outsourcing</b> all other activities. The global mobile handset industry is used as the template to illustrate the theory...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} aircraft manufacturing industry is {{starting a process}} of delocalization from developed to developing countries. From its original strongholds in the United States, Western Europe and Canada, it is now moving towards the largest new industrial countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The technology transfer channels include investment by multinational corporations, participation in global value <b>chains,</b> and <b>outsourcing</b> by large prime contractors based in North America and Western Europe. The process through which technological learning occurs has been studied in economics as international knowledge spillovers. In management, similar processes have been studied under outsourcing and global value chains. Drawing hypotheses from theory, the paper analyzes the patterns of trade, foreign direct investment and outsourcing in the global aircraft manufacturing industry. The evidence amassed shows that through these mechanisms, North American and Western European aircraft industries risk now losing their dominance to the developing countries. - multinational corporations, aircraft industry, modularity, value chain, spillovers...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary and incomplete] I discuss {{three issues}} that have deeply {{influenced}} the North American automobile industry in the last decades. Proliferation of models and vehicle types has reduced the average sales per vehicle with important consequences on the manufacturing side. Manufacturers have responded by adopting flexible production technology in their assembly plants. One {{of the most important}} features of the flexible technology is the ability to build a variety of platforms and body styles on the same assembly line. They have also reorganized their supply <b>chain.</b> Increased <b>outsourcing</b> of components, even sharing the burden of research and development with preferred (tier 1) suppliers, and just-in-time inventory management are the most visible exponents of this transformation. These three trends are discussed with an eye to their interrelatedness, the impact on industrial performance, and policy options available to Canada. An attempt is made to develop a rigorous theoretical framework incorporating the different aspects of this industrial transformation and to check the importance of each trend using plant and firm-level data...|$|R
40|$|As the {{outsourcing}} of key {{supplies and}} business processes becomes increasingly popular, the effective {{management of the}} outsourced business functions is of critical importance in supply chain management. Instead of managing all supply chain activities by themselves, many firms have chosen to transfer the governance of certain supply chain processes to third parties for lower cost and better service levels. This paper addresses {{the selection of the}} supply chain governance mode between self-managing and outsourcing {{from the perspective of the}} focal companies. To facilitate the decision-making process, we develop a model to investigate supply chain performance where knowledge transfer and compliance effort are two determinant factors. Mathematical properties related to the existence, uniqueness, and monotonicity of the model solution are derived. The results show that the optimal governance mode of the supply chain depends on the characteristics of the <b>chain.</b> Specifically, <b>outsourcing</b> to a third-party can function well only if the external coordinator can ensure low knowledge transfer cost along the supply chain. Self-managing by the focal company is preferred if the company can keep the cost of the compliance effort lo...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} has found that the Australian garment industry has been slow to embrace both mandatory and voluntary mechanisms to protect workers in international and local manufacturing supply chains. Due to industry restructuring and tariff reductions, the Australian garment industry is no longer vertically integrated, resulting in complex manufacturing supply <b>chains</b> and much <b>outsourcing.</b> Consequently, many principal companies have little knowledge of the labour rights issues in their supply chains, and some consider that labour rights are the responsibility of their suppliers. The study found companies had limited awareness and understanding of either local laws or international mechanisms for monitoring labour rights in their supply chains. Many companies, especially smaller enterprises...|$|R
