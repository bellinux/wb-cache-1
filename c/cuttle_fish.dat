The data on sailfish catches, the gear used and the area depths of fishing during the two seasons have been presented. The h'saviest sailfish catch was made in October 1974 (5505. 0 kg). The catch data of the black marlin, Makaira indica (Cuvier) and the blue marlin, M. nigricans Lacepede, have also been given. Length-frequency studies on the sailfish during the above-cited seasons indicated that the standard length of the fish ranged from 1450 to 2590 mm. In October 1974, the dominant modal length was at 2000 mm. In November and December, both the 1950 and the 2050 mm modal lengths preponderated. In January of 1975, both the 1850 and the 2200 mm modal lengths were dominant. The 2050 mm length mode of November progressed to 2150 mm in December and also in January 1976; it progressed further in February. The mean standard lengths of the fish have also bsen calculated.

40|$|Abstract Cephalopods play a {{significant}} role in coastal and oceanic ecosystems, both as con-sumers of invertebrates and small fish and as the prey of some fish, seabirds and marine mam-mals and other large predators. Approximately 30 species of cephalopod have been recorded in the north-eastern Atlantic and adjacent waters, including 18 teuthid (squid), seven sepiolid (bobtail), three sepiid (<b>cuttle</b> <b>fish)</b> and 10 octopod (octopus) species. A number of these are exploited com-mercially and support important target and by-catch fisheries in Western Europe. During the past decade, annual landings of cephalopods from the north-eastern Atlantic (international Council for the Exploration of the sea [iCEs] area) have ranged from 40, 000 to 55, 000 t, including substantial catches of long-fin (loliginid) squid (7000 – 11, 000 t per annum), short-fin (ommastrephid) squid (3000 – 10, 000 t), <b>cuttle</b> <b>fish</b> (including sepiolids; 16, 000 – 24, 000 t) and octopods (12, 000 – 18, 000 t).

40|$|Trawl net is a bag-shaped gear towed through water, {{the mouth}} of which is kept open either by a frame or beam or otter boards and floats or kites and sinkers or weight. Sometimes the opening is {{effected}} by dragging the net with two boats. According to the habitation of fish in sea, trawl net is operated either at the bottom or in the midwater. For fish living in the bottom, bottom trawls are operated. Shrimps, flatfish, sciaenids, ribbonfish, carangids, perches etc. are caught by bottom trawls. For catching pelagic fish such as sardine, silver belly, anchovies, ribbonfish, shallow water mix etc. midwater trawls can be used.

40|$|Abstract: Twenty-five seafood samples (shrimps, {{crabs and}} <b>cuttle</b> <b>fish)</b> {{collected}} from seven Fishing Companies and some local fishermen in Lagos, Nigeria, were examined {{for the presence}} of Vibrio species. A total of 44 vibrios belonging to five different species were isolated. The most predominant species was Vibrio alginolyticus (31. 8 %), followed by V. harveyi (27. 3 %), V. mimicus (22. 7 %), V. parahaemolyticus (11. 4) and V. cholerae (6. 8 %). All the strains of V. mimicus, V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae and some strains of V. alginolyticus and V. harveyi lysed human red blood cells. None of the isolates tested elicited fluid accumulation in the experimental mice. However, histology sections showed that V. parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae, two strains of V. mimicus, one strain each of V. alginolyticus and V. harveyi caused erosion of the epithelial linings of the intestines of the experimental mice.

40|$|Fish is a {{good source}} of {{high-quality}} protein, vitamins and other essential nutrients, especially essential fatty acids (EFAs), known as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Nutritionists have suggested an intake of 35 g or more of fish daily and two fatty fish-meals per week as to reduce the relative risk of death from coronary heart diseases. However, fish consumption also has been identified as one of the primary route of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This study has identified the type and level of 12 congeners of PCBs that are the most toxic to humans.

40|$|Cephalopoda - the octopuses, squids and {{cuttlefishes}} - comprise one of {{the most}} significant components of marine life. All are large, fast-growing, and active predators with highly evolved and specialized qualities of great inherent interest. There are approximately 650 recognized species of cephalopods alive today and more than 10, 000 fossil forms. Cephalopod translates literally into "head footed" which explains why squid, as well as the nautilus, <b>cuttle.</b> <b>fish</b> and octopus among others, with their arms and tentacles attached directly to their heads, is so named. Cephalopods are found in all of the world's oceans, from the warm water of the tropics to the near freezing water at the poles.

Large populations of cephalopods are found in all the world's oceans from the surface to the deep sea. They are major food resources for many top predators such as whales, dolphins, seals, birds and large fish. Worldwide, between 1990 and 1997, cephalopod landings increased steadily from 2. 4 million tonnes to 3. 3 million tonnes.

The article reviews the history of healing with animals in the Levant (The Land of Israel and parts of present-day Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, defined by the Muslims in the Middle Ages as Bilad al-Sham) in the medieval and early Ottoman periods. Intensive research into the phenomenon of zootherapy in the medieval and early Ottoman Levant has yielded forty-eight substances of animal origin that were used medicinally. The vast majority of these substances were local and relatively easy to obtain. Most of the substances were domestic (honey, wax, silkworm, etc.), others {{were part of the}} local wildlife (adder, <b>cuttle</b> <b>fish,</b> flycatcher, firefly, frog, triton, scorpion, etc.), part of the usual medieval household (milk, egg, cheese, lamb, etc.), or parasites (louse, mouse, stinkbug, etc.). Fewer substances were not local but exotic, and therefore rare and expensive (beaver testicles, musk oil, coral, ambergris, etc.). The range of symptoms that the substances of animal origin were used to treat was extensive and included most of the known diseases and maladies of that era: mainly hemorrhoids, burns, impotence, wounds, and skin, eye, and stomach diseases. Changes in the moral outlook of modern societies caused the use of several substances of animal origin to cease in the course of history.

This organism was isolated from 16. 67 % of IQF squid, 8. 82 % of frozen prawns, 2. 38 % of frozen squid and 2 % of IQF prawns. In general 3. 34 % of the samples {{were found to be}} carriers of V. metschnikovii. All samples of frozen fish fillets, frozen <b>cuttle</b> <b>fish,</b> frozen octo-pus were found to be free from this organism. Informatioin regarding the inci-dence of this organism in fish product is scanty. Hence this observation may be relevant to public health considerations of seafood consumption. Vibrio spp. are important, being pathogenic for animals or man with food as the vehicle of transmission (Desmarchelier, 1984). Out of thirty spe-cies of Vibrios at present defined and characterized, only 12 have been impli-cated in human infections (Hansen et al., 1993). V. metschnikovii, an oxidase-negative and nitrate negative species was described initially by Lee et al., 1978. The organism was first recovered from human disease by Jean et al. (1981) and several other instances of infection have been reported (Buck, 1991; Hansen et al., 1993). This bacterium has also been iso-lated from food borne disease outbreaks involving shrimps and crab (Farmer et al., 1998). V. metschnikovii was reported in finfish by Lee et al. (1978) subsequently it was isolated from fresh shellfish and finfishes (Buck, 1991; Prasad and Rao, 1994). Information regarding the inci-dence of this organism in frozen fish prod-uct is scanty.
