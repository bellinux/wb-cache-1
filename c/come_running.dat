25|$|Some <b>Come</b> <b>Running</b> {{essentially}} {{marked the}} end of Capaldi's career as a solo artist. He would not record another solo album for well over a decade, though a greatest hits compilation, Prince of Darkness, was released in 1995 and made the charts in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Snoopy {{is lying}} {{on top of his}} doghouse, {{relaxing}} vacantly and peacefully. He begins to daydream about being a wild jungle beast. In a few minutes, however, he is back to his peaceful state ("Snoopy"). Linus enters, holding his blanket and sucking his thumb. Lucy and Sally show up and mock him for this habit. Linus decides to abandon his blanket and move on, only to <b>come</b> <b>running</b> back to it in desperation. After the girls leave, Linus daydreams of a blanket fantasy where everyone can relax with their blankets ("My Blanket and Me"). Lucy later tells him that she would someday like to be a queen. However, Linus tells her that she can't and she threatens to punch him. Sally gets a C for her pathetic coat-hanger sculpture.|$|E
25|$|The Kelb tal-Fenek {{is usually}} taken out to hunt {{at night when}} there are fewer distractions. Generally, the hunters will take their dogs into the {{countryside}} and release pairs of a male and a female dog in each compass direction. The dogs will then search out their prey using scent. When a rabbit is found the hounds will give chase, the small and more agile female in the lead with the male keeping the rabbit from darting {{too far to the}} sides. At this point the dogs giving chase will emit a high pitched bark, attracting the other dogs and the hunters, all of whom will <b>come</b> <b>running.</b> By the time the hunters and other dogs arrive the rabbit will almost always have taken to the ground. The hunters will then gather and leash all but one dog, then place nets over all of the likely escape holes of the rabbit. Finally the hunter will take a ferret (with a small bell attached) from a round wicker basket, and places it into the last entrance to the rabbit's burrow. The Kelb tal-Fenek can hear the little bell up to 3 meters down under the rocky terrain. When the ferret flushes the rabbit out a hole, one free dog swoops down upon it. This style of hunting is mentioned by Strabo about hunting in the Balearic Islands under Roman rule, and the Maltese word for ferret—"nemes"—may have its roots in the Greek word ''.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Cobbs! It's Cobbs!" [...] cries Master Harry, and <b>comes</b> <b>running</b> to him, and {{catching}} {{hold of his}} hand. Miss Norah <b>comes</b> <b>running</b> to him on t'other side {{and catching}} hold of his t'other hand, and they both jump for joy.|$|R
60|$|They saw me, {{and began}} gesticulating and advancing. I stood {{watching}} them approach. The two Beast Men <b>came</b> <b>running</b> forward to {{cut me off}} from the undergrowth, inland. Montgomery <b>came,</b> <b>running</b> also, but straight towards me. Moreau followed slower with the dog.|$|R
6000|$|... [HERSELF, {{dripping}} wet, <b>comes</b> <b>running</b> {{along the}} verandah, [...] through the French window, {{with a wet}} Scotch terrier in her [...] arms. She vanishes through the door left. A little pause, and [...] LADY ELLA <b>comes</b> <b>running,</b> dry, thin, refined, and agitated. She [...] halts where the tracks of water cease at the door left. A [...] little pause, and MAUD <b>comes</b> <b>running,</b> fairly dry, stolid, [...] breathless, and dragging a bull-dog, wet, breathless, and stout, [...] by the crutch end of her 'en-tout-cas'].|$|R
500|$|When the Bengali saint Ramakrishna {{once asked}} a devotee why one {{would prefer to}} worship Mother over him, this devotee rhetorically replied, [...] "Maharaj, {{when they are in}} trouble your devotees <b>come</b> <b>running</b> to you. But, where do you run when you are in trouble?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Stars and Stripes Forever" [...] — The band {{reserved}} this Sousa march as {{a signal}} that an emergency had come up calling for the clowns to <b>come</b> <b>running</b> out from the Alley directing public {{attention away from the}} emergency or for the audience to be evacuated.|$|E
2500|$|Capaldi laid low {{as a solo}} {{artist for}} the next few years, only to bounce back in 1988 with the heavily publicised Some <b>Come</b> <b>Running.</b> Though the album {{failed to live up to}} {{commercial}} expectations, it reached number 183 in the USA and number 46 in Sweden, while achieving two hit singles in the Netherlands. Though Eric Clapton and George Harrison appeared on [...] "Oh Lord, Why Lord", it was [...] "Something so Strong" [...] which became his biggest hit in the Netherlands, breaking the top 40 and powering the album itself into the charts.|$|E
60|$|At this {{juncture}} the women <b>came</b> <b>running</b> out, badly frightened.|$|R

2500|$|For much of Eton's history, junior {{boys had}} to act as [...] "fags", or servants, to older boys. Their duties {{included}} cleaning, cooking, and running errands. A Library member was entitled to yell {{at any time and}} without notice, [...] "Boy, Up!" [...] or [...] "Boy, Queue!", and all first-year boys had to <b>come</b> <b>running.</b> The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as fagging, were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s. Captains of House and Games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from School Office.|$|E
2500|$|The Anderson Independent {{ridiculed}} Watson {{for having}} been [...] "unable to fault the state administration on any real issues" [...] and had therefore [...] "sent posthaste for 'Spiro the Lip' (a reference to Vice President Spiro T. Agnew) and young David Eisenhower (President Nixon's son-in-law) to <b>come</b> <b>running</b> to the rescue." [...] West discouraged out-of-state endorsements and relied instead on U.S. Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the Democratic members of the South Carolina congressional delegation, and Governor Robert E. McNair, who termed West [...] "my right arm in government."United Methodist clergyman Angus McKay Brabham endorsed West and claimed that Watson carried the backing of {{various members of the}} Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch Society.|$|E
2500|$|Randell {{left school}} and was signed to EMI in 1965, her first single [...] "I'll <b>Come</b> <b>Running</b> Over" [...] (cover of a Lulu song) was {{released}} in February on its HMV label and became a No.11 hit in Melbourne. She appeared on television to promote her single including Bandstand, Saturday Date and Sing Sing Sing. The first single was followed by [...] "A Love Like You" [...] (No.27 in Melbourne) and [...] "Forever". She had regular appearances on TV's The Go!! Show alongside contemporaries The Easybeats and Olivia Newton-John. Randell also appeared on another TV series, Kommotion with fellow pop artists including Burns (now a solo artist) and also featured performers miming to overseas artists' hits: Meldrum, for example, mimed to [...] "Winchester Cathedral" [...] by The New Vaudeville Band. Randell signed a new contract with CBS Records to release two further singles [...] "Heart" [...] and [...] "Goin' Out of My Head" [...] which both became Top20 hits in Melbourne.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{the central}} region of Vietnam {{where the family}} lived was still under the {{sovereignty}} of Emperor Tự Đức, but {{the southern part of}} the country had gradually been colonised in the 1860s and turned into the colony of Cochinchina. In 1874, an attack on Hanoi forced Tự Đức to sign a treaty to open up the Red River for French trade. In Nam Đàn District, a Binh Tây (Pacify the French) movement sprung among the local scholar-gentry, and Phan responded at the age of seven by playing Binh Tây with his classmates, using “guns” made of bamboo tubes and lychee bullets. The unrest was enough to prompt the imperial court to bring in troops to quell the opposition to Huế's deal with the French. Phan's family was not affected by the crackdown, but the movement had a deep impact on him. Later in life, he noted that as a youth, “I was endowed with a fiery spirit. From the days when I was a small child … every time I read the stories of those in the past who were ready to die for the righteous cause, tears would <b>come</b> <b>running</b> from my eyes, soaking the books.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Belmonte and Pedrillo come to {{the garden}} with ladders (Aria, Belmonte: [...] "Ich baue ganz auf deine Stärke" [...] – [...] "Love, only love, can now direct me"). [...] Pedrillo gets the {{attention}} of the women by singing a ballad about a rescue similar to the one he is planning (Romanze, Pedrillo: [...] "In Mohrenland gefangen war" [...] – [...] "In Moorish lands a maiden fair"). However, Osmin enters, sees the ladders, and rouses the castle. [...] As the Pasha and his guards <b>come</b> <b>running</b> in, Osmin exults in the prospect of seeing them all hanged (Aria: [...] "O, wie will ich triumphieren" [...] – [...] "My triumphant hour's approaching"). Belmonte pleads for their lives and tells Pasha Selim that his father is a Spanish Grandee and Governor of Oran, named Lostados, and will pay a generous ransom. Unfortunately, Pasha Selim and Lostados are long-standing enemies. The Pasha rejoices in the opportunity to subject his enemy's son to a horrible death. He leaves Belmonte and Konstanze to bid each other a last farewell; they lovingly assure each other that being tortured to death will be a pleasure, so long as they get tortured to death together (Duet: [...] "Welch ein Geschick! O Qual der Seele.... Weh, du soltest für mich sterben" [...] – [...] "What dreadful fate conspires against us.... Woe, you will die because of me"). However, the Pasha decides that he can make a better point against Lostados by showing mercy and releasing Belmonte and his friends. All are set at liberty – much to the dismay of Osmin, who would prefer to see them all brutally executed (Finale: [...] "Nie werd' ich deine Huld verkennen" [...] – [...] "Your noble mercy passes measure").|$|E
2500|$|During a chaperoned conversation, Sophie and Octavian {{exchange}} greetings and pleasantries (in {{this conversation}} she reveals Octavian's full name: Octavian Maria Ehrenreich Bonaventura Fernand Hyacinth Rofrano, aka Quinquin in intimacy). Ochs enters with Sophie's father ("Jetzt aber kommt mein Herr Zukünftiger"). The Baron speaks familiarly with Octavian (though {{they have never}} officially met), examines Sophie like chattel and generally behaves like a cad, also [...] "revealing" [...] that Octavian has illegitimate family. [...] Sophie is disgusted and appalled {{by the prospect of}} being his wife. He exits. Sophie starts to weep, and Octavian promises to help her ("Mit Ihren Augen voll Tränen"). He embraces her and they sing another love-duet, but they are discovered by Ochs's Italian spies Valzacchi and Annina, who hold them and shout loudly for Ochs. Ochs is only amused, considering the much younger Octavian no threat, but Octavian's temper is raised enough to challenge the bull-headed Ochs to a duel. He jabs Och's arm with his sword, drawing blood; Och screams in pain and terror. [...] Faninal {{and other members of the}} household <b>come</b> <b>running</b> in. [...] Sophie tells her father that she will never marry Ochs, but her father insists, and threatens to send her to a convent. Octavian is thrown out, and Sophie is sent to her room. As Ochs is left alone on the divan with his wounded arm in a sling, he begins to raise his spirits with a glass of port. Annina enters with a letter for Ochs from [...] "Mariandel", the [...] "chambermaid" [...] from Act 1, actually Octavian in disguise, asking to meet him for a tryst. The now recovered and drunk Ochs, in anticipation of his imminent meeting, dances around the stage to one of the opera's many ironic and wry waltzes. Annina hints that he should give her a tip for bringing the message; he puts her off, and she silently swears revenge ("Da lieg' ich!").|$|E
