50|$|Of central {{importance}} for the diaspora of Italians in many countries, {{as it relates to}} the holding of Italian citizenship alongside another citizenship, is article 7 of law number 555 of 1912. The provisions of this article gave immunity to some living Italian children from the citizenship events of their fathers. If the child was born to an Italian father in a jus soli country, the child was born with the Italian <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> and also with the citizenship of the country where he or she was born. That is to say that the child was born as a dual citizen. Children born with dual citizenship in this form were allowed to maintain their dual status in the event that the father naturalised later, thus parting with Italian citizenship. Moreover, Italy has not imposed limitations on the number of generations of its citizens who might be born outside Italy, even as holders of citizenship foreign to Italy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{children}} {{followed the}} <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father,</b> {{and only in}} certain cases, the citizenship of the mother. The mother could transmit the citizenship to her children born before 1 January 1948 (the effective date of entry of the Constitution of the Italian Republic) only in the special cases found in paragraph 2 of article 1 of this statute: These cases arose if the father was unknown, if he was stateless, or if the children could not share the father's foreign citizenship {{according to the law}} of his county (as in cases where the father belonged to a country where citizenship was possible by jus soli but not by jus sanguinis). In this last situation, the Ministry of the Interior holds that if the child received jus soli citizenship of the foreign country where he was born, the mother's Italian citizenship did not pass to the child, just as in situations where the child received the father's citizenship by jus sanguinis.|$|E
5000|$|The Palestinian National Authority drafted, {{but did not}} pass, a {{piece of}} {{legislation}} in 1995 outlining its Citizenship Law. Article 7 of this legislation defines a Palestinian as anyone who [...] "(1) was a holder of Palestinian citizenship (other than Jews) before 15 May 1948; (2) was born to a Palestinian father; (3) was born in Palestine to a Palestinian mother even if the <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> is not known; (4) was born in Palestine to unknown parents; and (5) was born outside of Palestine to a Palestinian mother and to a father whose nationality was not known - provided that this person opts for Palestinian citizenship within one year after reaching maturity, that he notifies the minister of interior of his intention to become a Palestinian citizen, that he becomes habitually a resident of Palestine, and that the minister does not object to this applicant within one year from the time he receives the notice from the applicant.|$|E

50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{reasons for}} this {{worldwide}} increase in dual citizenship is <b>the</b> gradual elimination <b>of</b> gender bias in laws regarding citizenship. These laws {{used to say that}} a child would gain <b>the</b> <b>citizenship</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. Now this has changed and if <b>the</b> parents <b>of</b> a child both have different citizenship the child will acquire both.|$|R

5000|$|The wife may {{be granted}} {{citizenship}} only if she declares her {{wish to be}} Kuwaiti. She may be granted citizenship only after 15 years from the date of her wish to become a Kuwaiti. The Minister of Interior {{has the right to}} reduce the number of years. The Kuwaiti husband has to be a Muslim in order to pass his citizenship to his wife. [...] A wife whose husband was naturalized as a Kuwaiti may be granted citizenship only if she declares her wish to be a Kuwaiti within one year of her husband's naturalization. The children of the naturalization are considered to be Kuwaiti. They can decide whether they want to be Kuwaiti or attain the nationality of the parent's previous citizenship. Termination of marriage will not normally lead to revoking of citizenship. The wife of a husband who takes up the nationality of another country may not lose her nationality unless she wishes to do so. The children of their father who is a naturalized citizen of another nation may not get to keep their Kuwaiti citizenship and have to attain the <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father.</b> The children may keep their nationality if the law of that country allows it. The children can get back their Kuwaiti citizenship upon attaining the age of majority.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, it was {{alleged that}} Duynhoven might have accidentally {{violated}} an electoral regulation, thus depriving {{him of his}} seat. This claim arose after Duynhoven applied to resume his <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. His <b>father</b> was from <b>the</b> Netherlands, and Duynhoven had possessed citizenship from birth, but had temporarily lost it due to a change of Netherlands law. According to electoral law, applying for foreign citizenship would require Duynhoven to vacate his seat. The law was {{seen by many as}} misguided, however, and Duynhoven, with his huge majority, was almost certain to re-enter Parliament in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> a by-election. As such, the government passed an act retroactively amending the law.|$|R
5000|$|Romania {{was under}} {{communist}} rule between 1947 and 1989. During <b>the</b> early phases <b>of</b> communism, <b>the</b> principles <b>of</b> Jus Sanguinis were emphasized {{and a strong}} sense of nationalism was demanded of all Romanian citizens. [...] International migration was rigorously controlled by the regime and the population was under strict observation. [...] The 1971 Law on Romanian Citizenship upheld these principles and expressed <b>the</b> superiority <b>of</b> Romanian <b>citizenship.</b> “Law No. 24 on Romanian <b>Citizenship</b> <b>of</b> December 1971 stipulated that descendants of a Romanian woman were automatically ascribed Romanian <b>citizenship,</b> regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father’s</b> citizenship”. [...] Article 5 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Law reads: “As an expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between parents and children, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uninterrupted continuity on <b>the</b> fatherland <b>of</b> previous generations that fought for social and national freedom, children born from Romanian parents on <b>the</b> territory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Socialist Republic <b>of</b> Romania are Romanian citizens.” [...] The law also stipulates that “the president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> republic alone, as representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive power..." [...] could grant or withdraw Romanian citizenship.|$|R
