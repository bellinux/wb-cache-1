5|$|The {{victory was}} {{important}} for the Danes. Not only had their arch-enemy been defeated, out of the smoldering city came a stronger bourgeoisie with renewed confidence, more privileges and an improved position vis-a-vis the Danish crown.

Pemberton burned the bridges over the Big Black River and took everything edible in his path, both animal and plant, as he retreated to the well-fortified city of Vicksburg.|$|E

5|$|An attack {{started on}} 6 December, spearheaded by Soviet T-54 and T-55 tanks and {{reportedly}} coordinated by advisors from the Soviet Union and East Germany, brought {{the fall of}} the <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> 16 December. The Libyan force, numbering between 7,000 and 9,000 men of regular units and the paramilitary Pan-African Islamic Legion, 60 tanks, and other armored vehicles, had been ferried across 1,100 kilometers of desert from Libya's southern border, partly by airlift and tank transporters and partly under its own power. The border itself was 1,000 to 1,100 kilometers from Libya's main bases on the Mediterranean coast. Wright states that the Libyan intervention demonstrated an impressive logistical ability, and provided Gaddafi with his first military victory and a substantial political achievement.|$|E
5|$|Antananarivo is the {{administrative}} capital and largest city of Madagascar. It {{is located in}} the highlands region, near the geographic center of the island. King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> the hilltop of Analamanga. As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants. The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).|$|E
5|$|Before World War I, {{the city}} had a {{population}} that was 42% ethnic German, 41% Hungarian and 15% Slovak (1910 census). After World War I {{and the formation of}} Czechoslovakia on October 28, 1918, the city was incorporated into the new state despite its representatives' reluctance. The dominant Hungarian and German population tried to prevent annexation of the city to Czechoslovakia and declared it a free city. However, the Czechoslovak Legions occupied the city on January 1, 1919, and made it part of Czechoslovakia. The city became the seat of Slovakia's political organs and organizations and became Slovakia's <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> 4 February. On February 12, 1919 the German and Hungarian population started a protest against the Czechoslovak occupation, but the Czechoslovak Legions opened fire on the unarmed demonstrators.|$|E

5|$|Bruce paid two further {{visits to}} Spitsbergen, in 1912 and 1914, but the {{outbreak}} of war prevented further immediate developments. However, early in 1919 the old syndicate {{was replaced by a}} larger and better-financed company. Bruce had now fixed his main hopes on the discovery of oil, but scientific expeditions in 1919 and 1920 failed to provide evidence of its presence, although substantial new deposits of coal and iron ore were discovered. Thereafter Bruce was too ill to continue with his involvement. The new company had expended most of its <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> these prospecting ventures, and although it continued to exist, under various ownerships, until 1952, there is no record of profitable extraction. Its assets and claims were finally acquired by a rival concern.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Khmer Rouge {{initiated}} their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos.

The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels and unemployment was not even measured anymore.|$|E

Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As the election occurred prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, each elector cast two votes for the presidency, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person. Under the terms of the constitution, the individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted.|$|E
