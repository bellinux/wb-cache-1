40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} the safety, efficacy, and clinical {{application of a}} new self <b>centring</b> <b>device</b> ("angel wings") for closure of secundum atrial septal defects (ASD II) and persistent foramen ovale in all age groups.  Design—Multicentre, prospective, non-randomised study.  Patients—Inclusion criteria: defects with an occlusive diameter of ⩽  20 mm and a surrounding rim of >  4 mm; body weight >  10  kg; and an indication for surgical closure of secundum atrial septal defect. Additionally, there were compassionate indications for closure in patients with persistent foramen ovale.  Interventions—Defects were closed by a transcatheter device consisting of two square frames made of superelastic nitinol wire. The frames are covered by elastic polyester fabric, which is sewn together at a central circle. All procedures, except for three interventions that were carried out under sedation, were performed under general anaesthesia using transoesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy to monitor intervention.  Results—Closure was attempted in 75  (71 %) of 105  patients. An ASD II was present in 35  children and 15  adults. A persistent foramen ovale was present in 25  adults with suspected paradoxical embolism. Transcatheter closure was unsuccessful in three children and crossover to surgery was required. Residual shunts were found in 20  patients (27 %) immediately after the procedure. A transient atrioventricular third degree block occurred in three patients (4 %) and the right atrial disk was not fully deployed in three. A minor shunt (< 3  mm) was present in only three (4 %) of 72  patients during follow up of 1 - 17 months. Blood clots on the right atrial disks in two patients (one required lysis) were seen during follow up transoesophageal echocardiography. Serious complications demanding surgical removal of the device occurred in three patients. One patient had haemopericardial tamponade because of an aortic lesion. Left atrial thrombus formation due to an unfolded right atrial disk {{was found in a}} second patient and dislodgement of the left atrial disk resulted in a large residual shunt in a third.  Conclusions—Percutaneous closure of a central ASD with a diameter ⩽  20  mm in paediatric and adult patients is feasible and effective with this new device. It is a promising alternative to surgical closure. Modifications of the design, however, seem to be mandatory as 4 % of patients developed serious complications.    Keywords: secundum atrial septal defect;  persistent foramen ovale;  interventional cardiology;  transcatheter occlusio...|$|E
40|$|One {{way to make}} rail {{vehicles}} {{a competitive}} means of transportation is to increase running speed. However, higher speeds usually generate increased forces and accelerations on the vehicle, which {{have a negative effect}} on ride comfort. With conventional passive suspension, it may be difficult to maintain acceptable passenger comfort. Therefore, active technology in the secondary suspension can be implemented to improve, or at least maintain, ride comfort at increased vehicle speeds or when track conditions are unfavourable. This thesis describes the development of an active secondary suspension concept to improve ride comfort in a high-speed train. Firstly, an active lateral secondary suspension system (ALS) was developed, including dynamic control of the lateral and yaw modes of the carbody. Furthermore, quasi-static lateral carbody control was included in the suspension system in order to laterally centre the carbody above the bogies in curves at high track plane acceleration and hence to avoid bumpstop contact. By means of simulations and on-track tests, it is shown that the ALS system can offer significant lateral ride comfort improvements compared to a passive system. Two different control strategies have been studied—the relatively simple sky-hook damping and the multi-variable H∞ control—using first a quarter-car and then a full-scale vehicle model. Simulation results show that significant ride comfort improvements can be achieved with both strategies compared to a passive system. Moreover, H∞ control in combination with the carbody <b>centring</b> <b>device</b> is better at reducing the relative lateral displacement in transition curves compared to sky-hook damping. Secondly, an active vertical secondary suspension system (AVS) was developed, using simulations. Dynamic control of the vertical and roll modes of the carbody, together with quasi-static roll control of the carbody, show significant vertical ride comfort improvements and allow higher speeds in curves. Further, the AVS system compensates for negative ride comfort effects if the structural stiffness of the carbody is reduced and if the vertical air spring stiffness is increased. Finally, the two active suspension systems (ALS and AVS) were combined in simulations. The results show that both lateral and vertical ride comfort is improved with the active suspension concept at a vehicle speed of 250 km/h, compared to the passive system at 200 km/h. Further, active suspension in one direction does not affect the other direction. The ALS system has been included in two recent orders comprising more than 800 cars. QC 20111205 Gröna Tåge...|$|E

We evaluated the possibility of predicting atrial fibrillation (AF) -related inappropriate ICD shocks through continuous monitoring of device diagnostics. Methods: 1404 ICD patients were prospectively followed in an observational research by 74 Italian cardiology <b>centres.</b> <b>Device</b> diagnostics stored daily information on AF duration and ventricular rate (VR) during AF. Uncontrolled VR was defined as mean VR> 80 beats per minute (bpm) and maximum VR> 110 bpm. Expert electrophysiologists reviewed the ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) episodes electrograms, stored in the device memory, and classified appropriate detections, inappropriate detection mechanisms and ICD therapy outcomes. Results: Over a median follow-up of 31 months, 511 (36 %) patients suffered spontaneous VT/VF, which were treated by ICD shocks in a subgroup of 189 (13 %) patients. Inappropriate detections occurred in 232 (16 %) patients, and inappropriate ICD shocks in 101 (7 %) patients. AF was the cause of inappropriate shocks in 60 patients. AF caused 144 inappropriate shocks: 53 % of all inappropriate shocks. The likelihood of experiencing AF-related inappropriate shocks was 2. 4 % at 1 year and 6 % at 5 years. Uncontrolled VR during AF proved to be an independent predictor of AF-related inappropriate shocks (OR= 3. 02, p= 0. 006); an alarm set at a VR> 90 bpm or 100 bpm was associated with prediction of AF-related inappropriate shocks with a sensitivity of 73 % or 62 %, respectively. Conclusions: AF is {{the most common cause of}} inappropriate shocks in ICD patients.

This paper details a hydrodynamic model based on Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) developed to assess ’conventional’ 3 -bladed tidal stream turbines (TSTs), adapted here to analyse an ’unconventional’ case of a ducted and open <b>centre</b> <b>device.</b> Validations against a more detailed coupled Reynolds averaged computational fluid dynamics (RANS-BEM) model shows excellent agreement, of within 2 % up to the peak power condition, with associated computational times {{in the order of}} a few minutes on a single core. The paper demonstrates the application of hydrodynamic forces into a structural analysis tool, in order to assess blade stress distributions of a generic hubless turbine. Incorporation of parameters such as non-uniform inflows and blade weight forces are investigated, with their effects on stress profiles presented. Key findings include: i) the adapted BEMT model replicates the majority of turbine performance characteristics estimated through previous CFD assessments; ii) the proposed model reduces the computational effort by several orders of magnitude compared to the reference coupled CFD, making it suitable for engineering assessments iii) blade stress distribution profiles are quantified, detailing concentration zones and cyclic values for use in fatigue analyses.

40|$|IntroductionIn our <b>centre,</b> <b>device</b> closure is the first-intention {{therapy for}} secundum atrial septal defect (ASD). In {{difficult}} cases {{we use a}} Meditech sizing balloon to optimize position of the device. We sought to determine (1) the efficacy of this sizing balloon-assisted technique (SBT) and (2) the percentage of ASDs that can be percutaneously closed. PatientsIn 2009, 65 patients (37 female) were referred for secundum ASD closure, at a median age and weight of 27. 5 (0. 8 to 88) years and 40. 6 (5. 6 to 97) kg, respectively. Six had pulmonary hypertension. ResultsEight patients had surgical closure because of referral cardiologist and/or patient's choice. Among the 57 remaining patients, 4 were unsuitable by echocardiography and surgically closed. Transcatheter closure was attempted in 53 cases, including 28 children (53 %), and was successful in 50 cases, including 10 with SBT (20 %). Amplatzer devices were used in all the patients with a median Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO) size of 20 (10 to 40) mm. A 12 mm ASO could not be positioned in a 5. 6 kg infant. Surgical closure was contraindicated for poor general condition (former 26 weeks premature baby with severe bronchodysplasia). Transcatheter closure failed in 2 cases, despite SBT. No major complication occurred. Five patients (10 %) had a trivial residual shunt. By univariate analysis, the deficiency of superior rim (25 mmHg) were associated with failure to percutaneously close the ASD (p = 0. 02 and 0. 03, respectively). Out of 57 patients candidates for transcatheter closure, 50 were successfully closed percutaneously (87 %). ConclusionTranscatheter closure of ASD is successfully accomplished {{in the majority of}} the cases.
