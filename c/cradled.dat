He <b>cradled</b> the grenade under him and absorbed the full impact of the explosion, thus saving the lives of his comrades. Lopez was nominated for the Medal of Honor. Lopez however, was not the only Hispanic member of the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division to be awarded the Medal of Honor. PFC Eugene Arnold Obregon (1930–1950), who also participated in the Inchon landing, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions 11 days after Lopez gave his life.

This platform generates social, economic and eco-effective benefits, which go beyond the conventional sustainability approach of using eco-efficiency to minimize environmental impacts. <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> is well known through earlier published works but most practitioners in the built environment are still unfamiliar with how to apply its principles. The framework here provides {{an introduction to the}} philosophy then translates the three basic <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> principles into criteria that can be quantifiably applied and evaluated.

25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be <b>cradled</b> into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

I opgaven fokuseres på <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradles</b> principper om recirkulering. Opgavens formål er at sætte disse generelle antagelser fra <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> ind i et virkelighedsperspektiv. Dette gøres ved hjælp af en case. Casen omhandler plastemballagefabrikanten Færch Plast A/S, som producerer emballage af PET og PLA. Virksomhedens incitamenter for produktion af PLA produkter og recirkulering analyseres med Michael Porters ’Green and Competitive’. Opgavens analyse fokuserer således på hvilke tekniske muligheder og barrierer der er for en recirkulering, hvilke økonomiske incitamenter en virksomhed kan {{have for}} en recirkulering samt hvilke muligheder der er for en større udbredelse af <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> principperne i Danmark. Abstract The current project {{is based on}} the <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> principles by William McDonugh and Michael Braungart. <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> is a new environment paradigm on the rise with the central point that waste equals food. This project focuses on the <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> principles regarding recycling in closed flows. The main purpose of this project is to present these general assumptions in a perspective of reality. This is done by using a case. The case concerns the manufacturer of plastic packaging Færch Plast A/S which produces packaging made of the polymers PET and PLA. The company’s incitements for production of PLA products and recycling are analyzed by using Michael Porter’s ‘Green and Competetive’. The analysis found in this project focuses therefore on which technical possibilities and boundaries could have an influence on recycling. Secondly focus is on a company’s economic incitements for recycling and last focus is on the possibilities for prevalence of the <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> principles in Denmark...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects that}} <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> and Circular Economy principles can have on business models in Denmark. More specifically, the paper investigates how companies that works with <b>Cradle</b> to <b>cradle</b> and Circular Economy, can think in new ways {{in regards to the}} development of their business models. The thesis uses a hermeneutical framework for the analysis of two companies from the Danish construction business which is used as case examples. One of the companies is Troldtekt that is already <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> Certified and the other is Novopan who is working with the Circular Economy principles and {{is on its way to}} become <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> certified. The findings are that the <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> and Circular Economy principles can have an effect on business models in Denmark. <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> and Circular Economy has a focus and an effect on the ownership of the materials of the products, the relations to customers and suppliers, the local environment and inward oriented consumption in regards to costumers being environmentally friendly. With increasing prizes on raw materials and a planet that is under great stress from an increasing population, and higher demands for products, there is good reason to look further into the possibilities of <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> and Circular Economy. Although the <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> and Circular Economy has big potential, there is still work to be done in getting the construction business and the political scene in Denmark to help accelerate the transition. The above mentioned aspects, are aspects that concerns the different building blocks in the business model and therefore has important effects on the business model on an higher level. This is of paramount importance to the way the companies can think about running their business in the future...|$|R

This is nonsense; it misses how Madonna conflated notions of spontaneity and calculation. Rodgers is the ideal collaborator." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times said: [...] "With a tough-cookie voice that's both coy and streetwise, Madonna's singing harks back to the rock-and-roll girl-group tradition that preceded the Beatles. But where girl groups, from the Shirelles to the Ronettes, worshipfully extolled their boyfriends' cars, haircuts and rebel poses, Madonna's point of view is decidedly more self-interested. In matters of love, she is a comparison shopper with a shrewd sense of her own market value.
