40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a fast approach for matching stereoscopic images acquired by stereo cameras mounted aboard a moving car. The proposed approach exploits the spatio-temporal consistency between consecutive frames in stereo sequences to improve matching results. This {{means that the}} matching process at current frame uses the matching results obtained at its preceding one. The preceding frame allows to compute an Initial Disparity Map for the current frame. The initial disparity map is used to derive disparity ranges for each scanline {{as well as what}} we call Matching <b>Control</b> <b>Edge</b> Points. Dynamic programming is performed for matching edge points in stereo pairs. The matching <b>control</b> <b>edge</b> points are used to drive the search for an optimal solution in the search plane. This is accomplished by dividing the dynamic programming search space into a number of subspaces depending on the number of the matching <b>control</b> <b>edge</b> points. The proposed approach has been tested both on virtual and real stereo images sequences demonstrating satisfactory performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{software}} birthmark is {{an inherent}} {{characteristic of a}} program {{that can be used}} to identify that program. By comparing the birthmarks of two programs, it is possible to infer if one program is a copy of another. In this paper, we propose a static birthmark based on the <b>control</b> flow <b>edges</b> in Java programs. <b>Control</b> flow <b>edges</b> can represent possible behaviors in program execution. Thus, a set of the <b>control</b> flow <b>edges</b> of a program can be used as a birthmark for that program. The similarity between two programs can then be calculated by finding pairs of similar behaviors of the <b>control</b> flow <b>edges</b> in the two birthmarks. The proposed birthmark is evaluated and compared with previous approaches in terms of credibility and resilience.

40|$|Path-sensitivity {{is often}} a crucial {{requirement}} for verifying safety properties of programs. As it is infeasible to enumerate and analyze each path individually, analyses compromise by soundly merging information about executions along multiple paths. However, this frequently results {{in a loss of}} precision. We present a program analysis technique that we call Satisfiability Modulo Path Programs (SMPP), based on a path-based decomposition of a program. It is inspired by insights that have driven the development of modern SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) solvers. SMPP symbolically enumerates path programs using a SAT formula over <b>control</b> <b>edges</b> in the program. Each enumerated path program is verified using an oracle, such as abstract interpretation or symbolic execution, to either find a proof of correctness or report a potential violation. If a proof is found, then SMPP extracts a sufficient set of <b>control</b> <b>edges</b> and corresponding interference edges, as a form of proof-based learning. Blocking clauses derived from these edges are added back to the SAT formula to avoid enumeration of other path programs guaranteed to be correct, thereby improving performance and scalability. We have applied SMPP in the F-Soft program verification framework, to verify properties of real-world C programs that require path-sensitive reasoning. Our results indicate that the precision from analyzing individual path programs, combined with their efficient enumeration by SMPP, can prove properties as well as indicate potential violations in the large...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} recent {{experimental}} and theoretical studies concerning {{the effects of}} plasma shape and current and pressure profiles on edge instabilities in DIII-D are presented. Magnetic oscillations with toroidal mode number n {approx} 2 [...] 9 and a fast growth time {gamma}{sup {minus} 1 } = 20 [...] 150 {micro}s are often observed prior to the first giant type 1 ELM in discharges with moderate squareness. High n ideal ballooning second stability access encourages edge instabilities by facilitating the buildup of the edge pressure gradient and bootstrap current density which destabilize the intermediate to low n modes. Analysis suggests that discharges with large edge pressure gradient and bootstrap current density are more unstable to n > 1 modes. Calculations and experimental results show that ELM amplitude and frequency can be varied by controlling access to the second ballooning stability regime at the edge through variation of the squareness of the discharge shape. A new method is proposed to <b>control</b> <b>edge</b> instabilities by reducing access to the second ballooning stability regime at the edge using high order local perturbation of the plasma shape in the outboard bad curvature region...|$|E

High resolution ablation profiles and pellet path measurements at different pellet parameters (mass and velocity) are required to understand the mechanism of the ELM triggering.
