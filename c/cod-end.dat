25|$|The {{display on}} a net sounder shows the {{distance}} of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance.

In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the <b>cod-end</b> of the net.

40|$|Catch {{figures of}} {{different}} demersal species(cod, haddock, saithe etc.) in the <b>cod-ends</b> of a two level trawl were examined using variable {{height of the}} separating panel (0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0 and 1. 5 m). Cod enters the trawl mainly in {{the lower part of}} trawl while haddock, and especially saithe, enter the trawl at higher levels. Diurnal and size dependant effects were recorded...|$|R
40|$|Fishing {{operations}} were conducted off Kakinada using a 3 panel double trawl net with twin <b>cod-ends</b> {{to study the}} utility of the net in catching both bottom and off bottom fishes.

40|$|In eel catches {{with special}} small-mesh trawls the {{proportion}} of by-catch is unjustifiably high. From 2003 to 2005 eel trawls with various types of separation panels were designed, constructed, and tested under real fishing conditions. Tests were carried out using cover <b>cod-ends</b> and an underwater TV equipment. It was possible {{to reduce the amount}} of by-catch to one tenth of its usual amount. However, a decline of the catch efficiency for the target species eel could not be avoided...|$|R
60|$|But Billy {{could not}} keep down his feelings. They were too strong for him. He was {{naturally}} of an excitable--what we may call a jovial-- jumping--disposition, and, although he had now been some months at sea, {{he had not yet}} succeeded in crushing down that burst of delight with which he viewed the <b>cod-end</b> of the great deep-sea net as it was hoisted over the side by the power of block and tackle.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the heavy beam had been secured {{to the side of}} the vessel, most of the net hauled in, and the bag, or <b>cod-end,</b> was above the surface filled almost to {{bursting}} with upwards of a ton of turbots, soles, haddocks, plaice, dabs, whitings, etcetera, besides several hundredweight of mud, weeds, stones, and oysters. Sometimes, indeed, this bag does burst, and in one moment all the profit and toil of a night's fishing is lost.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was indeed}} a huge mass of wreck {{entangled}} with sea-weed which had rendered the net so heavy on that occasion, {{but there was also}} a satisfactory mass of fish in the [...] "cod-end," [...] or bag, at the extremity of the net, for, when, by the aid of the winch, this <b>cod-end</b> was finally got inboard, and the cord fastening the bottom of it was untied, fish of all kinds gushed over the wet decks in a living cataract.|$|E
40|$|At present {{both the}} wedge gauge and the ICES mesh gauge {{are used to}} examine the mesh opening of trawl <b>cod-ends.</b> A {{thorough}} investigation of both instruments by an EU project (MESH) has revealed a number of deficiencies. This has lead to the conclusions to not further recommend the use of both devices but to go {{for the development of a}} complete new measurement tool. This is presently progressing in a further EU project named OMEGA. Prototypes of the new device have been produced and a number of introductory tests have already been made. This contribution reports on further laboratory tests carried out at the Institute for Fishing technology and Fish Quality with special emphasis on netting yarn diameters below 4 mm. The results demonstrate further yarn size depending inaccuracies of the wedge gauge and support the rapid introduction of the newly developed measurement instrument...|$|R
40|$|Many {{technical}} measures {{aimed at the}} conservation and recovery of fish stocks {{are based on the}} implementation of minimum mesh sizes to guarantee a certain level of fishing gear selectivity. At present, different methods are used to measure mesh opening, according to whether the measurement serves fisheries inspection, fisheries research or the manufacturing of netting for fishing nets. At the very least, this causes confusion but can also have more serious consequences such as the criminalization of well intentioned fishermen or the setting of inappropriate mesh size regulations. For example, the measurements made by fishery inspectors using the wedge gauge are generally larger than those made by scientists using the ICES gauge. As a result the <b>cod-ends</b> used by fishermen to satisfy the fishery inspectors will have a selectivity lower than that anticipated by the scientists who provided the advice that informed the relevant legislation. In 1999, owing to the wider range of twines and netting materials used by the fishing industry, ICES established the Study Group on Mesh Measurement Methodology (SGMESH) to refine mesh measurement procedures. At the same time the different stakeholders agreed that there was a need to consider the adoption of a standard mesh measurement method. A major step in the standardization of mesh measurement methodologies was {{the development of a new}} standard mesh gauge (2002 - 2005). In October 2005, it was adopted by ICES as the new standard for mesh measurements and in June 2006 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recommended its use for scientific purposes. This review paper critically examines the different mesh measurement methodologies and their related problems, and introduces and describes a new objective mesh gauge (OMEGA) to replace the former less satisfactory gauges. Its adoption will result in researchers, fisheries inspectors and the netting industry using one standard gauge and one set of standard protocols to achieve consistent mesh-size measurements...|$|R
60|$|The first haul of {{the mission}} vessel was a great success, prophetic of the great successes in store, thought her skipper, as the <b>cod-end</b> was finally swung inboard in an almost {{bursting}} condition. When the lower end was opened, and the living fountain of fish gushed over the deck, {{there was a general}} exclamation of satisfaction, mingled with thanksgiving, from the crew, for fishes great and small were there in abundance of every sort that swims in the North Sea.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the curious}} {{results of this}} flood was that Bob was always more prompt to the summons to haul up the trawl {{than he had ever}} been before, more {{energetic}} in clawing the net inboard, and more eager to see and examine the contents of the <b>cod-end.</b> The explanation is simple. He had overheard his skipper say how fond Eve was of shells--especially of those which came {{from the bottom of the}} North Sea, and of all sorts of pretty and curious things, wherever they came from.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few seconds}} dead silence ensued, while the men glanced at the empty <b>cod-end,</b> and at each other. Then a terrible oath burst from John Gunter, and a sort of sigh broke {{from some of the}} others, as if words were {{incapable}} of expressing their feelings--as, indeed, they were! The skipper was standing by the companion-hatch at the moment with a handspike in his grasp. A deep-toned curse issued from his lips when the fish went down, and he dashed the handspike to the deck with fearful violence.|$|E
60|$|He {{strained}} {{with all}} his might. So did {{the rest of the}} crew. Round went the capstan, and in a few minutes the great forty-eight feet beam appeared. This was soon hoisted up by means of tackle, and made fast to the side, and then began the hauling in--we might almost say clawing in--of the net, hand over hand, until the <b>cod-end</b> was visible near the surface. It now became evident that a grand haul had indeed been made, and that it had been the mere weight of the fish that had delayed them so long.|$|E
6000|$|The trawl {{which they}} had to put down was, as we have said, a huge and {{ponderous}} affair, and could only be moved by means of powerful blocks and tackle aided by the capstan. It consisted of a thick spar called the [...] "beam", about forty-eight feet long, and nearly a foot thick, supported on a massive iron hoop, or runner, at each end. These irons were meant to drag over {{the bottom of the}} sea and keep the beam from touching it. Attached to this beam was the bag-net--a very powerful one, as may be supposed, with a small mesh. It was seventy feet long, and about sixteen feet of the outermost end was much stronger than the rest, and formed the bag, named the <b>cod-end,</b> in which the fish were ultimately collected. Besides being stronger, the <b>cod-end</b> was covered by flounces of old netting, to prevent the rough bottom from chafing it too much. The cost of such a net alone is about 7 pounds. To the beam, attached at the two ends, was a very powerful rope called the bridle. It was twenty fathoms long. To this was fastened the warp--a rope made of best manilla and hemp, always of great strength. The amount of this paid out depended much on the weather; if very rough it might be about 40 fathoms, if moderate about 100. Sometimes such net and gear is carried away, and this involves a loss of about 60 pounds sterling. We may dismiss these statistics by saying that a good night's fishing may be worth from 10 pounds to 27 pounds, and a good trip--of eight weeks-- may produce from 200 to 280 pounds.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 26 {{effective}} trawl hauls using a remotely operated trawl <b>cod-end</b> closure system {{were carried out}} to determine whether samples collected in a rear section of the <b>cod-end</b> and in a front section of the <b>cod-end</b> were homogeneous, {{and can be used}} as reliable replicates for community sampling and resource assessment. Comparative analyses of these sample hauls and 25 other hauls that did not use the <b>cod-end</b> closure system were also performed. The results indicate certain technical difficulties in the practical operation of the system and that samples were not homogeneous either between the <b>cod-end</b> sections in the same haul or between hauls.

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{different}} size groups of prawns caught by four shrimp trawls having different <b>cod-end</b> meshes {{was made by the}} author.

40|$|A shaking motion {{could be}} used to improve fish {{escapement}} from a <b>cod-end</b> net by creating a sieving effect over the swept vol-ume or by disturbing the optomotor response of the fish. In this study, a perpendicular shaking motion was generated in a towed <b>cod-end</b> net by a circular canvas attached {{to the end of the}} codend, which formed a biased cap-like shape. This concept was tested by using a model in a flow tank and by towing a prototype <b>cod-end</b> during sea trials. For the model tests, the amplitude of the shaking motion was 0. 6 ± 0. 1 times the rear diameter of the <b>cod-end,</b> and the period of the shaking motion was 2. 6 ± 0. 1 s at a flow velocity of 0. 6 or 0. 8 m/s. In the sea trials, the amplitude was 0. 5 ± 0. 2 times the rear diameter of the <b>cod-end,</b> and the period of the shaking motion was 7 ± 4 s at towing speeds of 1. 2 or 1. 7 m/s. Thus, the shaking amplitude during the sea trials was equal to or less than that observed in the tank tests, and the shaking period was twice as long. The shaking motion described by the amplitude and period could be an effective means to stimulate fish escapement from <b>cod-end</b> during fishing operations considering the response of the fish...|$|E
40|$|A {{pilot study}} to {{estimate}} the survival of saithe escaping from a <b>cod-end</b> with 145 mm diamond meshes was done in April-May 1992 north of the Faroes. Escaped fish were collected in fine meshed net cages (2 x 2 x 5 m aluminium frame) mounted aft on a <b>cod-end</b> cover. After one hour trawling below 150 m depth the cages were released {{by means of an}} acoustic release system and slowly hauled up to 40 m below sea surface for UTV observations (6 - 7 days). The net cages were drifting freely with the current in the area north of the Faroes and located by means of radio tracked buoys. Preliminary results indicate that saithe can withstand almost the same sorting as cod with low mortality. However, more experimental work is needed to draw more firm conclusions on survival rates of saithe escaping from a <b>cod-end...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cod (Gadus morhua L.) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus L.) {{escaping}} {{through the}} meshes of a <b>cod-end</b> (135 mm diamond meshes) {{or through a}} metal grid sorting device mounted in the foremost part of the <b>cod-end,</b> were withheld in cages (2 x 2 x 5 m) covering the <b>cod-end</b> during trawling. The scale loss of the escaped fish was examined and {{compared to that of}} cod and haddock from a control group. On average, less than 1 % of the total body surface of cod was injured, while haddock, particularly those smaller than 40 cm, showed substantial scale loss. Cages containing escaped fish were released from the trawl by means of an acoustic releaser and kept for observation (UTV) at sea bottom for 12 to 16 days. No mortality was found for cod, and the mortality of mesh and grid selected haddock was less than 10 %. Methodological problems that may have lead to errors in the mortality estimates are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Allegations {{of growth}} {{overfishing}} of the already depleted snapper (Pagrus auratus) stock in Denham Sound, Shark Bay, Western Australia, due to prawn trawling, and concerns for by-catch species generally, {{led to the}} investigation of size-related catchability and <b>cod-end</b> selectivity of juvenile snapper and western butterfish (Pentapodus vitta). The <b>cod-end</b> selectivity of prawn trawling was investigated by fitting a fine-mesh <b>cod-end</b> cover to commercial trawl nets to measure the size of fish passing through the <b>cod-end.</b> A Leslie-Delury depletion experiment involving trawling the same area over four consecutive nights {{was used to determine}} the catchability coefficients of snapper and butterfish. The size of snapper and butterfish caught on the trawlable grounds ranged from 3 to 18 and 5 to 20 cm fork length (FL), respectively. Ontogenetic changes in habitat preference meant that snapper were susceptible to commercial trawling only between approximately 9 - 17 months of age. Retention of snapper and butterfish in the trawl nets increased with increasing length, with the deeper-bodied snapper retained at smaller lengths. Catchability coefficients also increased with fish length. A single trawl pass was estimated to remove up to 57 % and 52 % of juvenile snapper and butterfish, respectively. The rate of natural mortality (M) for juvenile snapper was estimated to be high; mean M = 2. 58 (92 % year- 1). Catchability of butterfish was low prior to their sexual maturation and trawling is assessed not to be a threat to this species. To reduce the impact of prawn trawling on snapper recruitment in Denham Sound, restricting trawling from areas where juvenile snapper are in high abundance, combined with fish escape panels, would be preferable to increasing mesh size in commercial trawl gear...|$|E
40|$|After due {{consideration}} the EU Commission has decided in December 2005 to admit cod-ends made of netting turned 90 de-grees (T 90) as an allowable alternative for the cod fishery of the Baltic. The construction was included {{as one of}} two admissibles versions into the newly issued EU regulation 2187 / 2005 on technical measures {{for the conservation of}} fishery resources of the Baltic. This contribution describes some of the investigations preceeding that decision with which some of the previous demurs could be dispelled. In the course of these experiments it was detected that the <b>cod-end</b> netting material plays an important role for the mesh selection of a T 90 <b>cod-end,</b> whereas the netting twine diameter is negligible. Problems with modern twine mate-rial have to be taken in consideration for constructional changes of T 90 cod-ends. A relation of 1 to 2 in the circumferences in meshes at the joining round between last row of the belly and extension/cod-end turned out to be acceptable. Both the hauling technique (sidetrawler or sterntrawler) and an extensive use in the commercial fishery proved to be of no relevance for to the selection of T 90 cod-ends. Taken alone, the different hydrodynamic conditions in a <b>cod-end</b> are insufficient to fully explain the selection phenomena. This was demonstrates by the material-related differences in selectivity of T 90 cod-ends...|$|E

40|$|The fishery for brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) is {{important}} in the North Sea and is carried out by more than 600 vessels, with total annual brown shrimp landings of around 20, 000 t. Due to the small mesh size used the catches also contain large amounts of by-catch. To find ways of reducing this by-catch, experiments were carried out with a Nordmøre type sorting grid during two trips on a research vessel and three trips on a commercial vessel. The results depended strongly on the catch composition in the brown shrimp fishery. If the catch composition did not cause clogging problems with the sorting grid, it met the objectives it was designed for. The reduction of fish (> 70 %) and benthos (65 %) in the catch was quite high. The commercial brown shrimp catch was reduced by 15 %. The <b>cod-end</b> catch consisted mainly of shrimps and required less sorting and the <b>cod-end</b> selectivity for shrimp increased. If, however, material occurred in the catch that caused clogging, the commercial brown shrimp catch was soon below the level acceptable to commercial fishermen...|$|E
