40|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>{{nematodes}}</b> (Helicotylenchus spp.) {{are common}} plant-parasitic nematodes in fields of many crops. In June 2015, two soil {{samples were collected}} from a soybean field in Richland County, ND. Nematodes were extracted from soil using the sugar centrifugal flotation method (Jenkins, 1964). Plant-parasitic nematodes were identified to genus based on morphological features and counted. Both samples contained <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> from 1, 500 to 3, 300 per kilogram of soil. In June and August 2016, 10 soil samples were collected from the same field. Nematodes were extracted, and nine of the samples had <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> ranging from 125 to 3, 065 per kilogram of soil. One soil sample with 1, 500 <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> per kilogram was used to inoculate two soybean cultivars Sheyenne and Barnes each in four replicates. After 15 wk of growth at 228 C in a greenhouse room, the population of <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> {{was found to have}} increased greatly. The final density was 9, 300 6 1, 701 <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> per kilogram of soil for Sheyenne and 9, 45162, 751 for Barnes. The reproductive factor in Sheyenne and Barnes was 6. 2 and 6. 3, respectively, indicating that this <b>spiral</b> <b>nematode</b> infects and reproduces well on these two soybean cultivars. Infected soybean roots had small brown lesions on the surface. Individual <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> were handpicked and examined morphologically and molecularly for species identification. Morphological measurements of adult females (n = 15) included body length (mean = 708. 5 mm, range = 600. 0 – 812. 0 mm), stylet (27. 6, 26. 0 – 29. 0), body width (28. 3, 25. 0 – 33. 0), lip region end to posterior end of pharyngeal glands (142. 5, 130. 0 – 152. 0), anal body width (15. 8, 14. 0 – 17. 5), tail length (20. 3, 15. 0 – 25. 0), tail annules (11. 6, 10. 0 – 14. 0), a (25. 0, 21. 4 – 27. 1), b (5. 0, 4. 4 – 5. 7), c (35. 4, 30. 2 – 41. 7), c 9 (1. 3, 1. 0 – 1. 6), and V (61. 8 %, 60. 0 – 63. 7). The <b>spiral</b> <b>nematode</b> was identified as Helicotylenchus microlobus according to morphological and morphometric characteristics (Subbotin et al., 2015). DNA was extracted from single nematodes (n = 8) using the Proteinase K method (Kumari and Subbotin, 2012). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with the primers rDNA 2 /rDNA 1. 58 S (Cherry et al., 1997). The PCR products were then purified and sequenced. The consensus ITS rDNA sequence (accession no. KY 271078, 822 bp) that was deposited into the GenBank shared 99 % identity with two isolates of H. microlobus from California (KM 506860. 1 and KM 506859. 1) and one isolate of H. microlobus from Spain (KM 506862. 1) (Subbotin et al., 2015). It had only 91 % sequence identity with seven isolates of H. pseudorobustus (KM 506875. 1, KM 506880. 1, KM 506876. 1,KM 506874. 1, KM 506872. 1, KM 506879. 1, and KM 506878. 1) from California, Switzerland, and New Zealand, a <b>spiral</b> <b>nematode</b> species very closely related to H. microlobus in morphology. The molecular tests confirmed the identity of this <b>spiral</b> <b>nematode</b> as H. microlobus. The H. microlobus nematode was reported {{as one of the most}} commonly observed <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> in soil samples in the state of Minnesota, and all 13 soybean cultivars tested except Hawkeye were rated as hosts (Taylor, 1960).

40|$|Morphological {{identification}} of <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> {{of the genus}} Helicotylenchus is a difficult task because most characters used for their diagnosis vary within species. In this paper we provide morphological and molecular characterisations of several <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes,</b> H. broadbalkiensis, H. digonicus, H. dihystera, H. microlobus, H. paxilli and H. pseudorobustus, collected in different geographical areas of USA, Switzerland, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, UK, South Korea and Russia. We suggest that H. microlobus and H. pseudorobustus are valid species separated from each other morphologically and molecularly. Seven species with distinct molecular characteristics are also distinguished, but are not ascribed morphologically to any specific taxon because of the low number of specimens available. Phylogenetic relationships of H. pseudorobustus with other Helicotylenchus species are given as inferred from the analyses of 154 sequences of the D 2 -D 3 of 28 S rRNA gene and 37 sequences of ITS rRNA gene.

40|$|The {{synthetic}} banana hybrid FB 920 (Musa spp., AAA group) {{has been}} designed to be resistant to Sigatoka and Black Leaf Streak Diseases, caused respectively by Mycosphaerella musicola and Mycosphaerella fijiensis. In addition to these features, the hybrids seem less susceptible to plant-parasitic nematodes, especially the burrowing nematodes (Radopholus similis) and the lesion nematode (Pratylenchus coffeae) than classic Cavendish cultivars, such as Williams, Grande Naine, or Poyo. This genetic modification drastically reduces pesticide use. Herein, we used the SIMBA model (a model to simulate phenology, growth, and plant-parasitic nematode/banana interactions) to examine the population dynamics of plant-parasitic nematodes in cropping systems with hybrid FB 920 in various initial conditions. Results from field observations and simulations show that in the long-term, the <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> (Helicotylenchus multicinctus) can overtake the burrowing nematodes and that nematode populations are smaller than in Cavendish banana fields.

The <b>spiral</b> plant-parasitic <b>nematode</b> genus Rotylenchus is a cosmopolitan group of nematodes which is predominantly found in temperate regions of the world. In this genus are included a number of species of significant economic importance in agriculture. They parasitise a wide-range of hosts, including vegetables, ornamentals, and fruit and forest trees. We therefore considered it useful to collect in a book all the information available in the current literature. Our views, which {{are the result of}} hard and patient work, are offered in this volume. The book comprises seven sections and presents summarised and specialised information on various aspects of the <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> belonging to the genus Rotylenchus. Sections 1 and 2 describe the importance of Rotylenchus species in agricultural crops, their distribution and numerous aspects of their biology, feeding habits, pathogenicity to vegetables, fruit and forest trees, and ecology. Section 3 presents different management strategies for the most important and pathogenic species of Rotylenchus, including chemical control, crop rotation, and biological control by means of nematophagous fungi, entomopathogenic nematodes, the hyperparasitic bacteria Pasteuria penetrans, and nematicidal plants. Sections 4 and 5 describes the most important morphological characters used in characterising and diagnosing species, as well as a broad discussion on the taxonomy and systematics in Rotylenchus and related genera, including a list of nominal species. These sections also include morphometric and cluster analyses in order to separate groups of species in order to facilitate identification. Section 6 provides a complete description and measurements of all populations characterised for each species, as well as their world distribution. Finally, Section 7 includes comprehensive tabular and dichotomous keys for species identification. Whilst recognising the complexity of creating a system to identificate such a large number of species, we are nevertheless confident that, by using both systems, the reader has the wherewithall to identify the species of Rotylenchus they are dealing with.

40|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>nematode</b> {{species of}} the genus Rotylenchus have been {{reported}} on olive (Olea europaea L.) in several Mediterranean countries (Castillo et al., 2010; Ali et al., 2014). Nematological surveys for plant-parasitic nematodes on olive trees were carried out in Tunisia between 2013 and 2014, and two nematode species of Rotylenchus were collected from the rhizosphere of olive cv. Chemlali in several localities of Tunisia (Tables 1, 2). Twenty-two soil samples of 3 to 4 kg were collected with a shovel from the upper 50 cm of soil from arbitrarily chosen olive trees. Nematodes were extracted from 500 cm 3 of soil by centrifugal flotation method (Coolen, 1979). Specimens were heat killed by adding hot 4 % formaldehyde solution and processed to pure glycerin using the De Grisse's (1969) method. Measurements were done using a drawing tube attached to a Zeiss III compound microscope. Nematode DNA was extracted from single individuals and PCR assays were conducted as described by Castillo et al. (2003). Moderate-to-low soil populations of these <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> were detected (5. 5 – 11. 5, 1. 5 – 5. 0 individuals/ 500 cm 3 of soil, respectively). This prompted us to undertake a detailed morphological and molecular comparative study with previous reported data. Morphological and molecular analyses of females identified these species as Rotylenchus eximius Siddiqi, 1964, and Rotylenchus incultus Sher, 1965. The morphology of R. eximius females (five specimens studied) was characterized by having a hemispherical lip region clearly off set, with four to five annuli, body without longitudinal striations, lateral fields areolated in the pharyngeal region only, stylet 32 to 36 mm long, and broadly rounded tail. The morphology of R. incultus females (51 females and 16 males; Table 2) was characterized by a hemispherical lip region with the basal annulus subdivided by irregular longitudinal striations, with three, rarely four annuli; stylet 21. 5 to 27. 5 mmlong, female tail hemispherical with terminus regularly annulated; phasmids anterior to anus level (3 – 6 annuli above). The morphology of the isolated nematodes agreed with previous descriptions of R. eximius (Siddiqi, 1964; Castillo and Vovlas, 2005) and R. incultus (Sher, 1965; Castillo and Vovlas, 2005; Vovlas et al., 2008), respectively. A single individual was used for DNA extraction. Primers and PCR conditions used in this research were specified in Cantalapiedra-Navarrete et al. (2013), and a single amplicon of 800, 1, 100, and 450 bp was obtained and sequenced for D 2 to D 3, ITS 1, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (coxI), respectively. Sequence alignments for D 2 to D 3 (KX 669231 –KX 669233), ITS 1 (KX 669238 –KX 669240), and coxI (KX 669244 –KX 669245) from R. eximius, showed 99 % to 97 %, 98 % to 94 %, 93 % similarity to other sequences of R. eximius deposited in GenBank (EU 280794 –DQ 328741, EU 373663 – EU 373664, JX 015401 –JX 015402, respectively). Similarly, D 2 to D 3 (KX 669234 –KX 669237), ITS 1 (KX 669241 –KX 669243), and coxI (KX 669246 –KX 669249) sequence alignments from R. incultus, showed 99 %, 99 % to 95 %, 99 % to 90 % similarity, respectively, to other sequences of R. incultus deposited in GenBank (EU 280797, EU 373672 –EU 373673, JX 015403, respectively). The best fitted model of DNA evolution was obtained using jModelTest v. 2. 1. 7 (Darriba et al. 2012) with the Akaike information criterion. BI analyses were performed under the general time reversible (GTR) with invariable sites and a gamma-shaped distribution of substitution rates (GTR + I + G) model for ITS 1 and coxI. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS 1 and coxI using Bayesian inference (BI) placed R. eximius and R. incultus from Tunisia in subclades that included all R. eximius and R. incultus sequences deposited in GenBank (Fig. 1), which agrees with previous results (Cantalapiedra-Navarrete et al., 2013). Morphology, morphometry, and molecular and phylogenetic data obtained from these samples were consistent with R. eximius and R. incultus identification. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of R. incultus in Tunisia.

The impact of nematodes in these more fertile soils was assessed by repeatedly applying nematicides (aldicarb and fenamiphos) to plant and ratoon crops in 16 fields, and measuring their effects on nematode populations, sugarcane growth and yield. In untreated plant crops, mid-season population densities of lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae), root-knot nematode (M. javanica), stunt <b>nematode</b> (Tylenchorhynchus annulatus), <b>spiral</b> <b>nematode</b> (Helicotylenchus dihystera) and stubby-root nematode (Paratrichodorus minor) averaged 1065, 214, 535, 217 and 103 nematodes/ 200 mL soil, respectively. Lower mean nematode population densities were recorded in the first ratoon, particularly for root-knot nematode. Nematicides reduced populations of lesion nematode by 66 – 99 % in both plant and ratoon crops, but control of root-knot nematode was inconsistent, particularly in ratoons. Nematicide treatment had {{a greater impact on}} shoot and stalk length than on shoot and stalk number. The entire community of pest nematodes appeared to be contributing to lost productivity, but stalk length and final yield responses correlated most consistently with the number of lesion nematodes controlled. Fine roots in nematicide-treated plots were healthier and more numerous than in untreated plots, and this was indicative of the reduced impact of lesion nematode. Yield responses averaged 15. 3 % in plant crops and 11. 6 % in ratoons, indicating that nematodes are subtle but significant pests of sugarcane in fine-textured soils.

The most important plant-parasitic nematodes detected, in order decreasing frequency of infestation (percentage of samples), were <b>spiral</b> <b>nematodes</b> Helicotylenchus spp. (100 %) and Rotylenchus spp. (87 %), lesion nematodes Pratylenchus spp. (100 %) and root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne spp. (40 %). Most of the nematode species were assigned to more or less colonizer nematodes, whereas only one family (Longidoridae) was assigned to persistent nematodes. Considering the two producing areas, plant-parasitic nematodes were significantly more abundant in the Souss region than in the Haouz region, but nematode diversity was higher in the second one. The prevalence of Meloidogyne spp. in the Haouz region would be related to the predominance of irrigated cropping systems in this region. Hoplolaimidae nematodes (Helicotylenchus spp. and Rotylenchus spp.) are better adapted to rainfed conditions that prevail in the Souss region. Co-inertia analysis showed the importance of soil physic-chemical characteristics (e. g., pH, texture and nutrients) on the structure of the plant-parasitic nematode community patterns. The high occurrence of Helicotylenchus spp. in olive orchards may be induced by fertilization. Aphelenchoides spp., Gracilacus spp., Pratylenchus spp., Rotylenchidae and Tylenchidae were supported by coarse textures as it was observed in the Souss region.

In this context, nematode communities were determined in soil samples collected from 23 olive growing sites in the Haouz and Souss regions (southern Morocco).

40|$|Understanding the {{influence}} of soil properties and cultural practices on the communities of plant-feeding nematodes (PFNs) in agrosystems {{is a prerequisite for}} cost-efficient and environment-friendly pest control. Although plantain is a staple food crop in the Caribbean, the relationships between PFN communities and environmental factors are poorly understood in plantain agrosystems. In this study, which was conducted in Martinique (French West Indies), we quantified the PFNs in 301 root samples taken from 53 plantain fields that differed in climate, edaphic conditions, and cultural practices. The physico-chemical properties were also determined for the soil in each field. Coinertia analysis (CI) and General Linear Mixed Models (GLMMS) were used to investigate the relationships between the PFN communities, soil properties, and cultural practices. Four nematode taxa were found in plantain roots: Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus coffeae, Helicotylenchus multicinctus, and Meloidogyne spp. The lesion nematode P. coffeae was the most prominent PFN species, followed by the burrowing nematode R. similis, root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne spp., and the <b>spiral</b> <b>nematode</b> H. multicinctus. P. coffeae was significantly more abundant in ferralsols and nitisols (which have a low organic matter content and a high exchangeable cation content) than in andosols (which have a high organic matter content). Nematode abundances were apparently affected by the previous crops e. g., P. coffeae was slightly more abundant in fields where tuber plants such as sweet potato, yam, or dasheen were the previous crop; R. similis was particularly abundant in fields where banana or plantain was the previous crop; and Meloidogyne spp. were abundant in fields where a market garden was the previous crop. The results of this study will be useful for the design of PFN control methods in plantain. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Varietal {{mixture is}} a {{cultural}} technique in which the genetic and functional diversities of varieties are used to manage pests and diseases. This strategy is commonly used on grass crops such as rice, barley, maize, and wheat to mitigate some windborne and soilborne pathogens. The effects of varietal mixtures on the number and community structure of pests, including plant-feeding nematodes (PFNs), however, have rarely been studied. In experiments conducted in Martinique, we evaluated the effect of varietal mixtures of bananas on PFN communities. A growth chamber experiment {{was used to measure}} the susceptibility of three banana cultivars dessert banana cv. 902 (Musa AAA, Cavendish subgroup); a new synthetic hybrid cv. FB 924 (Musa AAA); and a plantain cv. Creole blanche (Musa AAB, French Horn) to the two major PFNs. The multiplication rates of Radopholus similis and Pratylenchus coffeae were substantially different on the three varieties; for example, the multiplication rate was up to 10 times greater on plantain cv. Creole blanche than on hybrid cv. FB 924. In a field experiment, we planted the three varieties in pairs that included all six possible combinations. Banana varietal mixtures significantly affected both PFN densities and community composition. Differences in community composition among the pairs involved a shifting equilibrium among nematode species and an interspecific competition for food resources. The relative abundance of the <b>spiral</b> <b>nematode</b> Helicotylenchus multicinctus increased while that of the burrowing nematode R. similis, which is the most damaging species on bananas, decreased. The use of a varietal mixture in which one variety supports a low PFN multiplication rate appears to have practical relevance, especially in systems based on very susceptible cultivars such as plantains. The use of varietal mixtures should not create management problems, especially for plantations that produce bananas for local markets. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|A {{solar sail}} concept has been {{developed}} from a <b>common</b> <b>spiral</b> fold pattern in order to enable a simultaneous mast and sail deployment. This novel concept utilizes the stored strain energy {{in a series of}} elastic spar members to enforce proper folding kinematics rather than relying on bulky mechanical joints. The critical inner and outer spar networks are secured to four elastically extendible masts anchored to a central drum. Deployment of the solar sail system is actuated by rotating the central drum around which the masts, spars, and film are wrapped. Tensioned radial cords deterministically unfold the membrane film under the authority of the resilient, spring-like spar members. Proper elastic behavior of the spars is an important facet to this design, and thus a significant effort was dedicated their development. This compact ground demonstration concept includes about 7. 5 m 2 of reflective membrane film for useful propulsion. Features of this robust, lightweight membrane structure may prove valuable to reducing mass and increasing deployment reliability of other planar subsystems such as sun shades, solar arrays, radiators, or antenna arrays...|$|R
40|$|Radar {{systems that}} allow early {{detection}} of underground IEDs can save lives. The Microwave Impulse Radar (MIR) capable of IED detection requires antennas capable of transmitting sub-nanosecond pulses over ultra-wideband (UWB) frequency ranges. This thesis investigates the suitability of a novel MIR antenna for high-accuracy ground-penetrating radar (GPR) applications. Key GPR antenna considerations are pulse dispersion, size, and cost. UWB horn antennas provide excellent dispersion performance but limit system efficacy due to significant size and cost requirements. Micro-strip spiral antennas provide a low-cost alternative to UWB horn antennas, but <b>common</b> <b>spiral</b> designs demonstrate poor pulse dispersion performance. The article “Low-Dispersion Spiral Antennas” proposes using combination spirals, which combine the performance of multiple simple spiral antennas. This work investigates combination spiral suitability through 3 D EM simulations and micro-strip fabrication. Testing results indicate that combination spirals possess improved pulse fidelity versus current spiral designs. Size and cost improvements are realized over horn antenna solutions. Updated simulation hardware and fabrication equipment could allow future combination spiral antennas to rival horn antenna performance...|$|R
