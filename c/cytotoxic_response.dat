25|$|Wild-type AAV has {{attracted}} considerable interest from gene therapy researchers {{due to a}} number of features. Chief amongst these is the virus's apparent lack of pathogenicity. It can also infect non-dividing cells and has the ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome at a specific site (designated AAVS1) in the human chromosome 19. This feature makes it somewhat more predictable than retroviruses, which present the threat of a random insertion and of mutagenesis, which is sometimes followed by development of a cancer. The AAV genome integrates most frequently into the site mentioned, while random incorporations into the genome take place with a negligible frequency. Development of AAVs as gene therapy vectors, however, has eliminated this integrative capacity by removal of the rep and cap from the DNA of the vector. The desired gene together with a promoter to drive transcription of the gene is inserted between the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) that aid in concatemer formation in the nucleus after the single-stranded vector DNA is converted by host cell DNA polymerase complexes into double-stranded DNA. AAV-based gene therapy vectors form episomal concatemers in the host cell nucleus. In non-dividing cells, these concatemers remain intact {{for the life of the}} host cell. In dividing cells, AAV DNA is lost through cell division, since the episomal DNA is not replicated along with the host cell DNA. Random integration of AAV DNA into the host genome is detectable but occurs at very low frequency. AAVs also present very low immunogenicity, seemingly restricted to generation of neutralizing antibodies, while they induce no clearly defined <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>response.</b> This feature, along with the ability to infect quiescent cells present their dominance over adenoviruses as vectors for human gene therapy.|$|E

40|$|Normal rat spleens contain {{suppressor}} cells {{which can}} inhibit proliferative and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> of lymphocytes to alloantigens in vitro. The suppressor cells are adherent, phagocytic, resistant to treatment with ATS and C, radioresistant, resistant to treatment with mitomycin C, apparently {{absent from the}} thymus, and found in very high concentrations in peritoneal exudates.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of Fc- and Fc+ T cells, separated on the fluorescence- activated cell sorter, in proliferative and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> to alloantigens was examined.

The proliferative responses to alloantigen exposure in mixed lymphocyte cultures was equivalent in intensity for unseparated T cells, the Fc+ T-cell fraction, and the Fc- T-cell fraction isolated from nonsensitized spleen cells. In contrast, the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> generated by the Fc- T-cell fraction (less than 1 % Fc+) were much weaker than the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> generated by the Fc+ T-cell fraction (80 - 90 % Fc+), and {{the responses of the}} Fc+ T-cell fraction were generally weaker than, or equal to the responses of unseparated T cells (Fc- T less than Fc+ T {{less than or equal to}} unseparated T). Mixtures of the Fc- and Fc+ T-cell fractions mounted stronger <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> than the sum of the responses of either fraction alone. Examination of the Ly phenotypes of the synergizing populations revealed that the CL precursor activity (Ly- 2 + T cells) resided in the Fc- T-cell population, and that the amplifier T-cell activity (Ly- 1 + T cells) resided in the Fc+ T-cell population.

50|$|Dendritic {{cells can}} be stimulated to {{activate}} a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>response</b> towards an antigen. Dendritic cells, {{a type of}} antigen presenting cell, are harvested from the person needing the immunotherapy. These cells are then either pulsed with an antigen or tumor lysate or transfected with a viral vector, causing them to display the antigen. Upon transfusion into the person, these activated cells present the antigen to the effector lymphocytes (CD4+ helper T cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and B cells). This initiates a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>response</b> against tumor cells expressing the antigen (against which the adaptive response has now been primed).

40|$|Lymphocytes {{isolated}} from the blood of 17 human fetuses, varying in gestational age between 16 and 26 weeks, were tested for their capacity to generate specific cytotoxic cells after mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) with allogeneic cells in {{the presence or absence}} of exogenous T cell growth factor (TCGF). Blood cells from seven fetuses, distributed throughout the age range, failed to generate cytotoxic cells even when TCGF was added in MLC, whereas six others gave positive responses but only when exogenous TCGF was present during the sensitisation phase. The maturation induced in the latter was not caused solely by a direct, non-specific effect of the TCGF, for control responder cells incubated with TCGF in the absence of allogeneic stimulator cells always responded less strongly or not at all. Fetal blood lymphocytes from the remaining four fetuses gave significant <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> that were not augmented by TCGF. It is concluded that there can be a clear dichotomy between proliferative and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> to alloantigens and that the inability of human fetal blood lymphocytes to mount <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> at this stage of development might be due to deficiencies in helper cells, cytotoxic precursors or both. For three fetuses it was possible to study, additionally, <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> of spleen, liver and thymus with and without TCGF. None of them made specific responses even when TCGF was added, though cells from two spleens and one thymus responded directly to TCGF. To ascertain whether the absence of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> might have been caused by a failure of blood, spleen, thymus or liver cells to proliferate, their mixed lymphocyte reactivity, as detected by the uptake of 3 H-thymidine, was studied without exogenous TCGF.

Heat-treatment or ultraviolet irradiation of the stimulator cells eliminated the capacity of the cells to induce the production of CTL-helper factor in I-region-primed and D-region-primed lymphocytes. It was concluded that both I-region-primed and D-region-primed lymphocytes produce a cell-free factor which induces proliferation and secondary cytotoxicity in D-region-primed lymphocytes.

Furthermore, provirus and tax may be absent from blood for extended periods, emphasizing the relevance of surveying other compartments during chronic lymphoproliferative disorders.

This <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>response</b> {{was accompanied by}} a temporal series of intracellular signals that are commonly triggered by a mitogenic stimulus: increased c-fos (20 - 30 min) and c-myc (40 - 60 min) expression, increased activity of ornithine decarboxylase (3 h), increased intracellular polyamine content (7 h) and increased thymidine incorporation into DNA (14 h). A <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>response</b> independent of these mitogenic signals could not be explained by an induction of interleukin- 6, which is an autocrine cytotoxic agent in some cell types; nor by a biphasic, dose-dependent response in which low concentrations of TNF are mitogenic and higher concentrations are cytotoxic. Conversely, a dependent role of these mitogenic signals was suggested by the absence of a TNF-promoted increase in thymidine incorporation into DNA in an ME- 180 clone that is resistant to TNF-induced cytotoxicity. A decrease in the proliferation rate of TNF-sensitive cells induced by either alpha-difluoromethylornithine treatment (resulting in polyamine depletion) or serum starvation rendered the cells insensitive to TNF-induced cytotoxicity, further suggesting a role for mitogenic signals and cell division in TNF-mediated cytotoxicity.

Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the mechanisms behind conventional T and MAIT cell <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> to NTHi. Methods Human ex vivo lung explants were infected with a clinical strain of NTHi. Monocyte-derived macrophages were also infected with NTHi in vitro and co-cultured with autologous T cells. <b>Cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> of T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. Results We found significant upregulation of the cytotoxic markers, CD 107 a and granzyme B, in lung CD 4 +, CD 8 + and MAIT cell populations. We show that MAIT cell <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> were upregulated by a combination of both time-dependent antigen presentation and through a novel mechanism by which IL- 12 and IL- 7 synergistically control granzyme B through upregulation of the IL- 12 receptor. Conclusions Overall our data provide evidence for a cytotoxic role of MAIT cells in the lung and highlight important differences in the control of adaptive and innate-like T cell responses.
