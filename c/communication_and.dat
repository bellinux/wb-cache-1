After some preliminary remarks, the following two sections deal with the definition of media <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> forms <b>and</b> the most important characteristics of communication forms, which are illustrated with examples of chat communication. Section 4 introduces the concept of <b>communication</b> genre, <b>and</b> section 5 shows the way communication genres, especially the expert chat and the information chat, can be analyzed within this framework and why it is not possible to do it in the same way with emails and short text messages. In this context the distinction between <b>communication</b> genres <b>and</b> text genres will also be discussed...|$|R
