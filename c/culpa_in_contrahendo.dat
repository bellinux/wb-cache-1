There are disputes {{about the nature of the}} liability: is it a contractual liability, liability of its own or form of the tort liability? These questions are neccesery to answer also for czech juridiction. The following thesis, as the chosen title already indicates, deals with the issue of pre- contractual liability in Czech private law. It starts with the historical analyses of <b>culpa</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrahendo</b> in European countries and compares foreign legislation especially German laws related to this issue. In doing so, it tries to demonstrate that there exists strong European tradition interrupted in Czechoslovakia during a communist regime established in Czechoslovakia from 1948 to 1989, which forced us to look back on the ancient Civil Code of Austria enacted in 1811, which was the basic Czechoslovak Code of private law until 1950.

The authors underline that, according to the current case law regarding medical malproactice, both the main surgeon and their assistant/subordinate are liable for engaging in a markedly imprudent and/or negligent conduct, such as not double-checking scrupulously the surgical site before its closure in order to highlight forgotten foreign bodies. As well, the authors underline that either the circulator nurse or the theatre nurse can be considered punishable by law when that medical error occurs, {{even if they are}} responsible for the count of the instruments used {{in the course of the}} surgery. Conversely, the main surgeon and his or her assistant are always directly responsible, due to the fact that the nurses' count procedure represents merely an additional control measure, without substituting at all the check the surgeons must obligatory conduct on the surgical site. Finally, the authors point out that, as the count procedure is performed by the members of a surgical team, where a hierarchy-based relationship rules, the main surgeon is the liable for any preventable and avoidable adverse event provoked by the nursing staff as a consequenc of the objective responsibility due to <b>culpa</b> <b>in</b> eligendo and <b>culpa</b> <b>in</b> vigilando...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to {{consider}} the importance of <b>culpa</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrahendo</b> which {{does not have a}} long tradition in the Czech law. However, since the 1 January 2014 it has become enshrined the Czech legal system. The instrument of <b>culpa</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrahendo</b> is connected with the need to protect the good faith of the parties to a contract which is an essential principle of modern contract law, particularly in continental legal systems. Despite the lack of the general duty to act in good faith while negotiating contracts in common law systems, we can see that English or American judges solve the practical problems resulting from dishonesty of one party to the contract through equitable principles such as misrepresentation or promissory estoppel. The importance of protecting good faith is visible even from international contract law documents that are important for the interpretation of national law. Chapter One contains the explanation of <b>culpa</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrahendo</b> as a practical instrument and I distinguish it from pre-contractual liability in the anglo-american legal systems.

40|$|Precontractual {{liability}} is liability {{that arises}} {{out of a}} harmful conduct that occurs during the formation period of a contract. Where the harmful conduct occurs during international negotiations, a conflict of laws issue arises. The determination of the applicable law to precontractual liability can be a complex and tedious task, {{which is why the}} European Legislature has provided a special conflict-of-law rule in Article 12 of the Rome II Regulation on the applicable law to non-contractual obligations. Through this provision, the European Legislature aims to achieve uniformity between EU Member States, while providing an appropriate conflicts rule. The present essay assesses the European Legislature’s attempt at codification and offers a commentary of Article 12 of the Rome II Regulation. It {{comes at a time when}} the Commission is scheduled to submit a report on the application of the Rome II Regulation to the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Economic and Social Committee. This essay will show that the Legislature has displaced the traditional rules of European private international law by adopting a contractual connecting factor in order to determine the applicable law to a non-contractual obligation. Indeed, the European Legislature has, for the purposes of European private international law, chosen to characterize <b>culpa</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrahendo</b> as non-contractual, but has chosen to determine the applicable law to this non-contractual obligation on the basis of a contractual connecting factor. Thus, Article 12 (1) of the Rome II Regulation has, in fact, chosen to submit claims arising out of <b>culpa</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrahendo</b> to the lex contractus in negotio. According to this provision, the applicable law to claims arising out of <b>culpa</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrahendo</b> is the law of the contract that was under negotiation. In spite of its advantages, the rule provided by Article 12 of the Rome II Regulation lacks flexibility. The lack of escape devices and the relative inapplicability of the second paragraph of Article 12 of the Rome II Regulation make this rule a rigid one whose application cannot be displaced whenever it reaches inappropriate results...|$|E

Different sources will be quoted, those of which in the formation period on the Roman judiciary system present configurative elements or at least, approximate to information duty. Due to the number of literary or judiciary sources found in that period, the analysis will be deepened in some sayings of Cicero that offer a valuable contribution to the evolution of the topic presented in this research paper. Then and after a short account of intermediate duty, we will come to modern right, framed by the Latin-American Civil Codifications and their European antecedents to study in depth in the reception of the duty to inform in the judiciary systems of the Common South Market - MERCOSUR.

Then we will study this figure according to relevant doctrinary experiences in the European countries, and also the unification legislative projects, such as Unidroit, Pavia`s European Private Law Academy and Lando Commission.
