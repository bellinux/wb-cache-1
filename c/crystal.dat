5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular <b>crystal,</b> crystallography generally requires a pure <b>crystal</b> of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals can sometimes be obtained from natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with macromolecular <b>crystal</b> annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality <b>crystal</b> is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E

40|$|Typically when {{researchers}} want {{to collect data}} from protein <b>crystals,</b> those <b>crystals</b> must be flash-frozen using liquid nitrogen.

5|$|<b>Crystal</b> Dynamics is an American {{video game}} {{developer}} that {{was founded in}} 1992 by Judy Lang, Madaline Canepa and Dave Morris. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, <b>Crystal</b> Dynamics was the first licensed developer for Panasonic's original 3DO console, a gaming hardware platform founded by Kleiner Perkins. Their first release, Crash N Burn, was a launch game for the system and was included as a pack-in game with the console. The 3DO's launch during the 1993 Christmas season was a commercial failure, severely damaging <b>Crystal</b> Dynamics' software strategy. In 1994, the company became a publisher for two new gaming platforms, the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. The studio was acquired by Eidos Interactive, a British video game publisher, in 1998.
