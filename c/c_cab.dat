5000|$|Critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{wrote in}} her review: [...] "D.C. CAB is a musical mob scene, a raucous, crowded movie that's fun {{as long as it}} stays wildly busy, and a lot less {{interesting}} when it wastes time on plot or conversation. There's a lot of talent in the large cast, and Joel Schumacher, the director, generally keeps things bustling. Mr. Schumacher was once a costume designer, which helps explain why everything here is so wildly colorful, as the characters joke around in outfits that are traffic-stopping. The movie has just the sort of bouncy, frantic, dopey humor to please the young fans of Mr. T., who is one of its stars. However, the film makers have thrown in enough R-rated material to make D. <b>C.</b> <b>Cab</b> slightly out of reach for very young audiences.|$|E

The ST 5 extract displayed antifungal activity against 100 % (5 / 5) {{of the clinical}} strains tested. The smallest zone of inhibition of 11.3  ±  0.9  mm was observed for <b>C.</b> neoformans <b>CAB</b> 1055 and the largest zone of inhibition (14.7  ±  0.5  mm) was obtained against C. albicans 8911 strain. An average zone of inhibition by the ST 5 extract against the clinical strains was recorded as 13  ±  1.2  mm. The ST 5 extract then displayed 80 % (4 / 5) antifungal activity against the environmental fungal strains. No zone of inhibition was observed against <b>C.</b> neoformans <b>CAB</b> 842, and the largest zone of inhibition (18  ±  0.8  mm) was observed against C. neoformans 1034.

40|$|PURPOSE: The acute GH {{lowering}} {{effects of}} a single dose of either octreotide (OCT) or cabergoline (CAB), given alone and in combination, were studied {{in a series of}} 21 patients with acromegaly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma GH was measured for 8 hours after a single subcutaneous injection of OCT (100 micrograms) and for 48 hours after a single oral dose of CAB (0. 5 mg) in all patients. Fourteen patients, who did not suppress GH levels below 5 micrograms/L after either OCT or CAB given alone, also received a combination of both drugs (OCT 100 micrograms s. <b>c.</b> + <b>CAB</b> 0. 5 mg p. o. 24 h before OCT). RESULTS: GH levels were acutely suppressed by more than 50 % in 15 / 21 cases after OCT alone and in 5 / 21 after CAB alone, respectively (P < 0. 01). In the 14 patients who received the combined test, the magnitude of GH suppression was significantly higher than after OCT alone 4, 6 and 8 hours after OCT administration (P < 0. 02). In patients with mixed GH/PRL-secreting tumors, the additive effect of OCT and CAB was observed at each time point. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that combined therapy with OCT and CAB may be more effective in suppressing GH secretion than either compound given alone, especially in patients with GH/PRL-secreting adenomas...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY This paper {{gives an}} {{efficient}} algorithm to com-pute addition in Jacobian of C 34 curves, aiming at C 34 curve cryptosystems. Using C 34 curves for cryptosystems has two ad-vantages. The first is {{safety and the}} second is the short size of the base field. In the paper, we modify the addition algorithm of [1] for Cab curves in the specific manner to C 34 curves. We classify all of the forms of the Groebner bases of ideals involved in the algorithm and eliminate the use of Buchberger algorithm from it. Our resulting algorithm computes the addition in Jaco-bian of C 34 curves in about 3 times amount of computation of the one in elliptic curves, when the sizes of groups are set to be the same. key words: algebraic curve cryptosystem, <b>C</b> 34 curve, <b>Cab</b> curve, addition in Jacobian, Groebner base 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{systematically}} investigated how the solvent composition used for polymer dissolution affects the porous structures of spin-coated polymers films. Cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and poly(methylmethacrylate) with low(PMMA-L) and high (PMMA-H) molecular weights were dissolved in mixtures of acetone (AC) and ethyl acetate (EA) at constant polymer concentration of 10 g/L The films were spin-coated at a relative air humidity of 55 +/- 5 %, their thickness and index of refraction were determined by means of ellipsometry and their morphology was analyzed by atomic force microscopy. The dimensions and frequency of nanocavities on polymer films increased with the acetone content (phi(AC)) in the solvent mixture and decreased with increasing polymer molecular weight. Consequently, as the void content increased in the films, their apparent thicknesses increased and their indices of refraction decreased, creating low-cost anti-reflection surface. The void depth was larger for PMMA-L than for CAB. This effect was attributed to different activities of EA and AC in CAB or PMMA-L solution, the larger mobility of chains and the lower polarity of PMMA-L in comparison to <b>CAB.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2012 Elsevier B.
