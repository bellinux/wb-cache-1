5000|$|In China {{there were}} reports in 2006 of a {{resurgence}} in the ancient practice of ghost marriages in the northern <b>coal-mining</b> <b>regions</b> of Shanxi, Hebei and Shandong. Although the practice has long been abandoned in modern China, some superstitious families in isolated rural areas still pay very high prices for the procurement of female corpses for deceased unmarried male relatives. It is speculated that the very high death toll among young male miners in these areas has led more and more entrepreneurial body snatchers to steal female cadavers from graves and then resell them through the black market to families of the deceased. In 2007, a previously convicted grave robber, Song Tiantang, was arrested by Chinese authorities for murdering six women and selling their bodies as [...] "ghost brides".|$|R
40|$|The authors {{examine the}} role of {{organized}} labor in the restructuring experience of two <b>coal-mining</b> <b>regions</b> in the Czech Republic and Romania in the 1990 s. Under similar external circumstances, the Ostrava region of the Czech Republic undertook early gradual restructuring, whereas the Jiu Valley region in Romania did not undertake restructuring until 1997, which was followed by massive layoffs in the sector. The authors conduct a quantitative exercise that accounts for mine productivity, labor-market conditions, and constraints in compensating laid-off miners. They show that the belated restructuring in the Jiu Valley was inefficient: gradual restructuring with reasoned compensation would have benefited both the miners and the state. An {{important factor in the}} delayed restructuring was the miners’ resistance to it.

40|$|The {{authors of}} the paper deal with preconditions, dynamics, {{substance}} and characteristics of negative phenomena in social sphere of miners’ towns and settlements under market transformations. Both common and local social problems of <b>coal-mining</b> <b>regions</b> are shown gradually, as well as reasons for their growth and decline. Specific facts emphasizing hard living conditions of population in miners’ towns and settlements are submitted. The authors think they were much worse than {{at the end of}} soviet period. The correlation of social problems and high protest activity is considered. The conclusion is drawn that financial conditions of miners were hard because the state didn’t influence on economic situation in the country and implement restructuring of coal-mining industry. They didn’t have an opportunity to solve all socially significant problems and the state couldn’t provide them with a mechanism of support. Poverty and unemployment were key problems of miners. On one hand, they facilitated protest activity. On the other hand, they restrained it, because miners and their families were exposed to risk to obtain no assistance for solution of their social-economic problems. That is why protests of miners were chaotic, local and caused different response of the society to them...|$|R

2500|$|Coal burning {{accounts}} for about 40% of the PM 2.5 in Beijing and is also the chief source of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide. Since 2012, {{the city has been}} converting coal-fired power stations to burn natural gas and aims to cap annual coal consumption at 20 million tons. In 2011, the city burned 26.3 million tons of coal, 73% of which for heating and power generation and the remainder for industry. [...] Much of the city's air pollutants are emitted by neighboring regions. Coal consumption in neighboring Tianjin is expected to increase from 48 to 63 million tons from 2011 to 2015. Hebei Province burned over 300 million tons of coal in 2011, more than all of Germany, of which only 30% were used for power generation and a considerable portion for steel and cement making. Power plants in the <b>coal-mining</b> <b>regions</b> of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, where coal consumption has tripled since 2000, and Shandong also contribute to air pollution in Beijing. Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, respectively rank from first to fourth, among Chinese provinces by coal consumption. There were four major coal-fired power plants in the city to provide electricity as well as heating during the winter. The first one (Gaojing Thermal Power Plant) was shut down in 2014. Another two were shut in March 2015. The last one (Huaneng Thermal Power Plant) would be shut in 2016. Between 2013 and 2017, the city planned to reduce 13 million tons of coal consumption and cap coal consumption to 15 million tons in 2015.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{highlights}} {{the features of}} the creation of the basin GIS, developed to support the environmental monitoring, assessment and forecasting of negative consequences in the areas of technogenic disaster (on the example of abandoned Kizel coal basin, located in Perm Region, Russia). The world experience of applying GIS-technologies for solving environmental problems of <b>coal-mining</b> <b>regions</b> is also being discussed. The information basis and structure of the cartographic and attributive database of the Kizel coal basin GIS are presented. The main tasks of creating the GIS, including inventory of man-made impact sources, identification of the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of pollutants, quantification and mapping of the territory ecological status, forecasting of the environmental situation and planning of environmental measures have been identified. A system of spatial criteria for the integrated assessment of the territory ecological status within coal basins is proposed, which will allow monitoring of environmental changes and identifying areas with the critical environmental situation. These criteria include the pH value and the sulfates concentration in the streams, the complex of heavy metals, the species composition of microorganisms in surface waters, the area of degraded land and dead forest stands. The degree of negative impact of the abandoned coal mines on streams and groundwater is described, and the priority pollutants are identified. The estimates of the extent of contaminated streams, as well as areas of potential contamination of floodplain lands have been obtained using LANDSAT satellite imagery data. The significance of the creation of the algorithms for the integration of heterogeneous spatial information (ground-based and remote sensing observations) for compiling synthetic maps that objectively estimate the ecological situation has been noted.  </p...|$|R
