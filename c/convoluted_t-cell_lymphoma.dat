METHODS: A computerized diagnostic retrieval system was used to identify all patients with <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> involving the skin who were examined at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) between January 1, 1976 and December 31, 1990. The medical records of affected patients were reviewed. RESULTS: During the 15 -year interval from 1976 through 1990, cutaneous <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> was diagnosed in 2, 155 patients. Of these 2, 155 patients, 42 (1. 95 %; 26 male and 16 female) had at least 1 ophthalmic abnormality attributable to the disease.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: T {{follicular}} helper (T(FH)) cells {{reside in}} the light zone of germinal centers and are considered the cell of origin of angioimmunoblastic <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Recently, CXCL 13, PD- 1 and SAP were described as useful markers for T(FH) cells and angioimmunoblastic <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> but also reported in some peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> not otherwise specified. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the present study the expression pattern of ICOS protein was investigated by immunohistochemistry-based techniques in routine sections of normal lymphoid tissues and 633 human lymphomas. RESULTS: Cells strongly positive for ICOS were restricted to the light zone of germinal centers and co-expressed T(FH) -associated molecules. In addition, weak to moderate ICOS expression was observed in {{a small proportion of}} FOXP 3 -positive cells. In lymphomas, ICOS expression was confined to angioimmunoblastic <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (85 / 86), peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> of follicular variant (18 / 18) and a proportion of peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> not otherwise specified (24 / 56) that also expressed other T(FH) -associated molecules.

40|$|Nodal {{follicular}} helper T-cell-derived lymphoproliferations (specifically {{the less}} common peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> of follicular type) exhibit {{a spectrum of}} histologic features that may mimic reactive hyperplasia or Hodgkin lymphoma. Even though angioimmunoblastic <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> of follicular type share a common biologic origin from follicular helper T-cells and their morphology has been well characterized, flow cytometry of peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> of follicular type has not been widely discussed {{as a tool for}} identifying this reactive hyperplasia/Hodgkin lymphoma mimic. We identified 10 peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> of follicular type with available flow cytometry data from five different institutions, including two cases with peripheral blood evaluation. For comparison, we examined flow cytometry data for 8 classical Hodgkin lymphomas (including 1 lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma), 15 nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin <b>lymphomas,</b> 15 angioimmunoblastic <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> and 26 reactive nodes. Lymph node histology and flow cytometry data were reviewed, specifically for the presence of a CD 3 (-/dim) CD 4 (+) aberrant T-cell population (described in angioimmunoblastic <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas),</b> besides other <b>T-cell</b> aberrancies. Nine of 10 (90 %) peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> of follicular type showed a CD 3 (-/dim) CD 4 (+) T-cell population constituting 29. 3 % (range 7. 9 - 62 %) of all lymphocytes. Five of 10 (50 %) had nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma or lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma-like morphology with scattered Hodgkin-like cells that expressed CD 20, CD 30, CD 15, and MUM 1. Three cases had a nodular growth pattern and three others exhibited a perifollicular growth pattern without Hodgkin-like cells. Epstein-Barr virus was positive in 1 of 10 cases (10 %). PCR analysis showed clonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement in all 10 peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> of follicular type. By flow cytometry, 11 of 15 (73. 3 %) angioimmunoblastic <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> showed the CD 3 (-/dim) CD 4 (+) population (mean: 19. 5 %, range: 3 - 71. 8 %). Using a threshold of 3 % for CD 3 (-/dim) CD 4 (+) T cells, all 15 nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma controls and 8 classical Hodgkin lymphomas were negative (Mann-Whitney P= 0. 01, F-PTCL vs Hodgkin lymphomas), as were 25 of 26 reactive lymph nodes. The high frequency of CD 3 (-/dim) CD 4 (+) aberrant T cells is similar in angioimmunoblastic <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> of follicular type, and is a useful feature in distinguishing peripheral <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> of follicular type from morphologic mimics such as reactive hyperplasia or Hodgkin lymphoma...|$|R

40|$|Primary {{gastrointestinal}} <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> is {{an uncommon}} entity and primary colon <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> is even rarer. The majority of enteropathy-associated <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> present predominantly as ulcers or strictures in the endoscopic examinations, while primary B-cell lymphomas commonly present as exophytic lesions. Ulcerative colon <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> may mimic Crohn's disease (CD), {{which is a}} chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines with ulcer and fistula formations difficult for clinicians to diagnose based on endoscopic observations alone. Like CD, <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> may be characterized {{by the presence of}} multiple skipped ulcers distributed from the terminal ileum to the descending colon. Furthermore, it is difficult to diagnose this unusual lymphoma by a single endoscopic biopsy. Typically, the histological composition of <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> is made of medium to large atypical cells located in the base of the ulcer with extension to the muscle layer and the adjacent mucosa. However, it is common that biopsy specimens show only mixed inflammatory changes where the lymphoma cells are hard to be identified. The differential diagnosis of malignant lymphoma must be considered when clinically diagnosed CD is refractory to the medical treatment or when its clinical behavior becomes aggressive. The current study presents a rare case of primary colon <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in a 56 -year-old male with marked recent weight loss, watery diarrhea and bilateral neck lymphadenopathy, who received a laboratory checkup and endoscopic workup for colon biopsy. The initial pathological report was consistent with mucosal inflammation and benign colon ulcers. Interestingly, the blood test showed a prominent eosinophilia.

Syringolymphoid hyperplasia (SLH) with alopecia is an uncommon chronic dermatosis first described by Sarkany et al in 1969. 1 SLH is characterized histologically by hyperplasia of eccrine ducts and glands that are infiltrated and surrounded by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate. Nine patients with SLH have been reported with or without follicular mucinosis or cutaneous <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (CTCL). We report a patient with CTCL and associated SLH and follicular mucinosis. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|Primary {{cutaneous}} CD 30 -positive (anaplastic) large <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and lymphomatoid papulosis {{are closely}} related types of cutaneous <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> with a favorable prognosis. The neoplastic T cells in these conditions have the phenotype of activated CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 −, CD 30 + skin homing T cells, but their normal counterpart {{has not yet been}} defined. To further characterize the cellular origin of the neoplastic T cells, skin biopsies from 14 patients with primary cutaneous CD 30 -positive (anaplastic) large <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> nine patients with lymphomatoid papulosis, and six patients with primary cutaneous CD 30 -negative pleomorphic large <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> were stained with monoclonal antibodies against cytotoxic cell-associated molecules granzyme B and T-cell restricted intracellular antigen. In nine of nine lymphomatoid papulosis and in 10 of 14 CD 30 -positive primary cutaneous large <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> expression of granzyme B and T-cell restricted intracellular antigen by variable numbers of neoplastic cells was found. Expression of granzyme B by the neoplastic CD 30 -positive T cells was confirmed by double-staining for granzyme B and CD 30 (three cases) and by the detection of granzyme B mRNA using RNA in situ hybridization (one case). In most cases equal numbers of granzyme-B-positive and T-cell restricted intracellular antigen positive tumor cells were observed. In five of six CD 30 -negative primary cutaneous large <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> the neoplastic cells did not express these proteins, whereas in one case a sporadic positive tumor cell was found. These results demonstrate that, in contrast to primary cutaneous CD 30 -negative pleomorphic large <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> the neoplastic cells in most primary cutaneous CD 30 -positive (anaplastic) large <b>T-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and lymphomatoid papulosis have a unique CD 4 +, CD 8 −, cytotoxic T-cell phenotype...|$|R
