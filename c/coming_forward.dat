5|$|A break formed after , {{including}} Gustavo César, Cameron Meyer, Dmytro Grabovskyy and Alessandro Donati. Soon after, Levi Leipheimer crashed, but was unhurt. The break was caught, and a solo break {{was formed}} by Vladimir Isaichev. Astana drove the peloton up the Turchino, the day's lone climb, with Armstrong leading the descent and race leader Danilo Di Luca somewhat surprisingly <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> to hold Armstrong's wheel. Some riders tried to escape for victory on the way into Arenzano, but the sprinters' teams worked to keep the field together, and Mark Cavendish took another bunched sprint win over Tyler Farrar and Alessandro Petacchi.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When {{a clear idea of}} the {{conspiracy}} emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into <b>coming</b> <b>forward,</b> giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, {{on the kitchen floor}} beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter from the airport to their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage. The man who had helped Dion stands to one side, watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E

5|$|Electric Music for the Mind and Body was {{released}} on May 11, 1967. Much of the album's material continued to expand upon the band's new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all facets of the members' influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> in a larger role with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald's lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, recreational drug use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band's orientation and message. The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though Electric Music for the Mind and Body {{was among the most}} complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.|$|E
5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would be singing in tongues. There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of tongues. There was prayer in tongues for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two hours}} half the Australian Division was {{involved}} in the battle of 400 Plateau. However, most of the officers had misunderstood their orders. Believing the intention was to occupy Gun Ridge and not hold their present position, they still tried to advance. The 9th and 10th Battalions had started forming a defence line, but there was a gap between them that the 7th Battalion was sent to fill. Seeing the 2nd Brigade <b>coming</b> <b>forward,</b> units of the 3rd Brigade started to advance to Gun Ridge. The advancing Australians did not then know that the counter-attacking Turkish forces had reached the Scrubby Knoll area around 08:00 and were prepared for them. As the Australians reached the Lone Pine section of the plateau, Turkish machine-guns and rifles opened fire, decimating the Australians. To the north other troops, advancing beyond Johnstone's Jolly and Owen's Gully, were caught by the same small arms fire. Soon afterwards a Turkish artillery battery also started firing at them. This was followed by a Turkish counter-attack from Gun Ridge. Such was the situation they now found themselves in that at 15:30 McCay, now giving up all pretence of advancing to Gun Ridge, ordered his brigade to dig in from Owen's Gully to Bolton's Ridge.|$|E

25|$|On 22 June 2017, Theresa May {{promised in}} the House of Commons that no {{immigration}} checks would be performed on anyone <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> {{to help the}} authorities identify casualties, or to provide information to the criminal investigation. However, two weeks later the government said that anyone <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> {{would be subject to}} normal immigration rules, including the possibility of deportation after twelve months. May also said that the death toll may rise further; in some cases, entire families had perished.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the men who}} had not {{volunteered for}} foreign service, {{together}} with the recruits who were <b>coming</b> <b>forward,</b> remained at Stoke-on-Trent to form a 2nd Line unit designated the 2/II North Midland Brigade, after which the parent unit became the 1/II Brigade.|$|E

Fancy me walking into a room alone, and a great man fifty years old <b>coming</b> <b>forwards,</b> and after a few minutes' {{conversation}} actually turning his back upon me, and then abruptly going out of the room. Such odd ways! I daresay his conscience smote him, for they all say at home I am the picture of aunt Ginevra. Mamma often declares the likeness is quite ridiculous." ...|$|R
25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the fortress engineers were mobilised and moved into their war stations in the coastal defences. In August 1914, TF units were authorised to establish 2nd Line duplicate units to absorb the rush of volunteers <b>coming</b> <b>forward.</b> The City of Dundee unit thus formed the 1/1st Dundee Fortress Company, RE, and 2/1st Dundee Fortress Company, RE.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the men who}} had not {{volunteered for}} foreign service, {{together}} with the recruits who were <b>coming</b> <b>forward,</b> remained at the drill halls to form 2nd Line units designated the 2/1st and 2/2nd North Midland Field Companies, while the parent units took a '1/' prefix. Later the 1/3rd and 3/1st Field Companies were formed. The 2nd Line units joined the 2nd North Midland Division.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan called}} for the 9th (Scottish) Division (which {{included}} the 1st South African Infantry Brigade) to be brought forward from reserve to the new line extending from Montauban {{to the south of}} Trones Wood. After <b>coming</b> <b>forward,</b> the division was told to prepare for the second stage of the battle, an assault on Longueval scheduled for 7 July. In advancing to the start-line, the 2nd South African Infantry Regiment (at that time, the reserve battalion), relieved two battalions of the 27th Brigade in Bernafay Wood and incurred over 200 casualties in the process.|$|E

50|$|Sastre {{began his}} {{football}} career at Progresista, being traded to Independiente in 1931. With the <b>coming</b> of <b>forwards</b> Vicente de la Mata and Arsenio Erico, Independiente built a powerful formation that {{would win the}} 1938, 1939 league titles plus domestic cups Ibarguren, A. Escobar and international Copa Aldao twice.|$|R
25|$|People with schizoid {{personality}} disorder rarely seek treatment for their condition. This is an issue found in many personality disorders, which prevents {{many people who are}} afflicted with these conditions, who tend to view their condition as not conflicting with their self-image and their abnormal perceptions and behaviors as rational and appropriate, from <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> for treatment. There is little data on the effectiveness of various treatments on this personality disorder due to the infrequency of encountering this personality disorder in clinical settings. However, those in treatment have the option of medication and therapy.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 2017, Theresa May {{stated in}} the House of Commons that anyone {{affected}} by the tragedy, regardless of their immigration status, would be entitled to support, including healthcare services and accommodation. No immigration checks would be performed on those affected. (Two weeks later, however, the government said that anyone <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> {{would be subject to}} normal immigration rules, including the possibility of deportation, after twelve months.) May added that it was important for those receiving payments from the fund to understand that they could keep the money – they would not have to pay it back, and it would not impact their entitlement to any other benefits.|$|E
25|$|In 1915 Park {{played with}} VFL club Melbourne, where he kicked 35 goals in 13 games, but was {{suspended}} for four matches for striking Gerry Balme of St Kilda, despite three witnesses <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> to say that Park had not hit the player at all. Park refused to play football again after his suspension, ending his VFL career with 146 goals in 57 matches. However, {{following the end of}} the war, Park returned to football, playing with Footscray Football Club, who were then a member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA). In the 1920 VFA second semi-final, Park won the match for Footscray against North Melbourne Football Club with a dramatic kick that dribbled through for a goal with less than ten seconds left on the clock.|$|E

25|$|On 16 October 2015 Cleverly fought Polish {{former world}} title {{challenger}} Andrzej Fonfara (27-3, 16 KOs) at UIC Pavilion in Chicago for the WBC International Light Heavyweight title. Fonfara outlasted Cleverly over 12 entertaining rounds {{to claim a}} victory by unanimous decision in the main event of a Premier Boxing Champions card. The judges scored it 115-113, 116-112, 116-112 for Fonfara. Combined, Cleverly and Fonfara set CompuBox records for the most combined punches thrown and landed in a light heavyweight fight, throwing 2,524 punches and landing 936, both CompuBox records. Fonfara also set individual records for a light heavyweight by landing 474 punches and attempting 1,413. Despite bleeding from a grotesquely swollen nose over {{the second half of}} the fight, Cleverly never stopped <b>coming</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kvitová {{uses the}} {{pinpoint}} service stance {{and is known}} for her fast and well-placed serves. As a left-handed player, she executes the shot well by serving out wide away from her opponent, especially on the advantage-side of the court to her opponent's backhand, and then <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> to finish off the point with a winner down the line. She is also noted for her exceptional timing. On forehands, she prefers to take the ball early, thus allowing her to produce down-the-line winners effectively. On backhands, she utilises all the important muscle groups to produce shots with exceptional amount of power. When returning, she uses a short compact motion which allows her to return aggressively regardless of the serve speed. She is also known to attack weak second serves by producing powerful winners.|$|E
25|$|When Britain {{declared}} war on Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, debates began in official circles about the possible {{ways in which the}} German military might launch an invasion of Britain; {{in the first week of}} the conflict numerous diplomatic and intelligence reports seemed to indicate that there was the possibility of an imminent German amphibious assault. Many government ministers and senior army officials including the Commander in Chief Home Forces, General Walter Kirke, believed that the threat of invasion was greatly exaggerated and were sceptical but others were not, including Winston Churchill the newly installed First Lord of the Admiralty. Churchill argued that some form of home defence force should be raised from members of the population who were ineligible to serve in the regular forces but wished to serve their country; in a letter he wrote to Samuel Hoare, the Lord Privy Seal on 8 October 1939, Churchill called for a Home Guard force of 500,000 men over the age of 40 to be formed. At the same time that government officials were debating the need for a home defence force, such a force was actually being formed without any official encouragement; in Essex, men not eligible for call-up into the armed forces were <b>coming</b> <b>forward</b> to join the self-styled 'Legion of Frontiersmen'. Officials were soon informed of the development of the legion, with the Adjutant-General, Sir Robert Gordon-Finlayson, arguing that the government should encourage the development of more unofficial organisations. However, the fear of invasion quickly dissipated as it became evident that the German military was not in a position to launch an invasion of Britain, and official enthusiasm for home defence forces waned, and the legion appears to have dissolved itself at the same time.|$|E
