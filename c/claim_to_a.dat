He had confined his efforts to jumps, hurdles and shot-puts, but now added pole vaulting, javelin, discus, hammer and 56lb weight. In the Olympic trials held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events and so he riveted a <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> place on the team that went to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Richard Gilmore was {{the first}} person of European descent to lay <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> plot of land on Kettle Creek. He settled there on July 21, 1794. James Caldwell was the second European to arrive, {{reaching}} the area by 1807. Simeon Pfoutz, a former resident of Perry County arrived in the watershed in 1813. Pfoutz also built a sawmill and gristmill on the creek. Other early settlers included John Calhoun and David Summerson, who arrived in 1822 and 1823, respectively. The population of the watershed increased fairly slowly in the early 1800s, with only a few families inhabiting the watershed by 1834.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, the {{practice}} was most prevalent from the medieval era until the outbreak of World War I, but evidence of intermarriage between royal dynasties {{in other parts of}} the world can be found as far back as the Late Bronze Age. Monarchs were often in pursuit of national and international aggrandisement on behalf of themselves and their dynasties, thus bonds of kinship tended to promote or restrain aggression. Marriage between dynasties could serve to initiate, reinforce or guarantee peace between nations. Alternatively, kinship by marriage could secure an alliance between two dynasties which sought to reduce the sense of threat from or to initiate aggression against the realm of a third dynasty. It could also enhance the prospect of territorial acquisition for a dynasty by procuring legal <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> foreign throne, or portions of its realm (e.g., colonies), through inheritance from an heiress whenever a monarch failed to leave an undisputed male heir.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} he {{was expelled}} from Tehran to Baghdad, in the Ottoman Empire; then to Constantinople (now Istanbul); and then to Adrianople (now Edirne). In 1863, {{at the time of}} his banishment from Baghdad to Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh declared his <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> divine mission to his family and followers. Tensions then grew between him and Subh-i-Azal, the appointed leader of the Bábís who did not recognize Bahá'u'lláh's claim. Throughout the rest of his life Bahá'u'lláh gained the allegiance of most of the Bábís, who came to be known as Bahá'ís. Beginning in 1866, he began declaring his mission as a Messenger of God in letters to the world's religious and secular rulers, including Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III, and Queen Victoria.|$|E

25|$|Some Federal Circuit {{decision}}s, however, {{had held}} some transformations of signals and data patent-eligible. For example, the Abele decision approved a dependent <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> method transforming X-ray attenuation data produced in a X-Y field by an X-ray tomographic scanner to {{an image of}} body organs and bones — {{while at the same}} time the Abele court rejected a more generic and abstract independent <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> process of graphically displaying variances from their average values of unspecified data obtained in an unspecified manner. The court said that this kind of difference between the two claims was critical to patent-eligibility. The dependent claim, unlike the independent claim, involved signal data representing tangible physical objects, which were electronically manipulated to provide a screen image of the physical objects. But Bilski's process had nothing to do with such a procedure. Like State Street, Bilski involved manipulation of financial data.|$|E
5000|$|Hypocrisy is the {{contrivance}} of a false {{appearance of}} virtue or goodness, while concealing real character or inclinations, especially {{with respect to}} religious and moral beliefs; hence in a general sense, hypocrisy may involve dissimulation, pretense, or a sham. Hypocrisy is the practice of engaging in the same behavior or activity for which one criticizes another. In moral psychology, it is the failure to follow one's own expressed moral rules and principles. [...] According to British political philosopher David Runciman, [...] "Other kinds of hypocritical deception include <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> knowledge that one lacks, <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> consistency that one cannot sustain, <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> loyalty that one does not possess, <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> identity that one does not hold." [...] American political journalist Michael Gerson says that political hypocrisy is [...] "the conscious use of <b>a</b> mask <b>to</b> fool the public and gain political benefit." ...|$|R

25|$|According to Alain Daniélou and Kenneth Hurry, the Rashtrakuta and Reddy dynasties may {{both have}} been descended from the earlier dynasty of the Rashtrikas. This common origin {{is by no means}} certain: there is {{evidence}} suggesting that the Rashtrakuta line came from the Yadavas in northern India and also that they may simply have held a common title.

25|$|Many Coptic intellectuals hold to Pharaonism, {{which states}} that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, Pharaonic culture, and is not indebted to Greece. It gives the Copts a <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> deep {{heritage}} in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic and Muslim scholars in the early 20th century, and it helped bridge the divide between those groups. Some scholars see Pharaonism as shaped by Orientalism.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{alarmed by}} these {{unilateral}} declarations, the French government laid <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strip {{of the continent}} in 1924.

The British eventually decided to recognize this claim and the border between Adélie Land and Australian Antarctic Territory was fixed definitively in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Until their {{amendment}} in 1999 Articles 2 and 3 {{were the}} subject of some controversy, particularly among Unionists in Northern Ireland.

Furthermore, they claimed, the articles constituted an extraterritorial <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> part of a foreign nation and were therefore in violation of international law.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all other}} tort cases, the {{plaintiff}} or their attorney files {{a lawsuit in}} a court with appropriate jurisdiction.

25|$|The Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company (C) was {{chartered}} on February 4, 1830, on {{the same}} day as the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company, after the two competing companies had come to a compromise. The C and D had the same goals — to connect the Delaware River, serving Philadelphia, with the Raritan River, for access to New York City — one by tried and true tow-path canal with some new innovations to cross the hills and the other by the novel & as yet untried railroad technology then emerging in Europe. Both ventures were considered risky, and both needed right-of-way grants from the legislature along the river's banks, requiring negotiations and design compromises before either could lay <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> land rights charter.|$|E
25|$|So great an {{accession}} {{of strength}} to a neighbouring state, whose ambition {{she had just}} reason to fear, proved intolerable to Austria, which laid <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of lordships — forming one-third of the whole Bavarian inheritance — as lapsed fiefs of the Bohemian, Austrian and imperial crowns. These were at once occupied by Austrian troops, with the secret consent of Charles Theodore himself, who was without legitimate heirs, and wished to obtain from the emperor the elevation of his natural children {{to the status of}} princes of the Empire. The protests of the next heir, Duke Charles II of Zweibrücken (Deux-Ponts), supported by the king of Prussia, led to the War of Bavarian Succession. By the peace of Teschen (13 May 1779) the Innviertel was ceded to Austria, and the succession secured to Charles of Zweibrücken.|$|E
