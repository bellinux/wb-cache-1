40|$|Evidence from {{laboratory}} impact experiments is {{indicating that}} increasing <b>crater</b> aspect <b>ratios</b> (diameter:depth) {{can result from}} increasing both velocity and projectile size without invoking unusual impactor conditions. An extensive data base of experimental impact cratering was analyzed {{for a variety of}} impactors and impact velocities for low strength targets. These data indicate a change in cratering efficiency that appears {{to be related to the}} onset of projectile deformation or rupture. When all projectile types and sizes are considered, one finds two contrasting relationships between <b>crater</b> aspect <b>ratio</b> and impactor parameter. These relationships are briefly considered...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{production}} of new fragmental lunar surface material is derived theoretically on the hypothesis that such material is excavated from a bedrock layer by meteoroid impacts. An overlaying regolith effectively shields the bedrock layer from small impacts, reducing the production rate of centimeter-sized and smaller blocks by a large factor. Logarithmic production rate curves for centimeter to motor-sized blocks are nonlinear for any regolith from centimeters to tens of meters in thickness, with small blocks relatively much less frequent for thicker (older) regoliths, suggesting {{the possibility of a}} statistical reverse bedding. Modest variations in the exponents of scaling laws for <b>crater</b> depth-diameter <b>ratio</b> and maximum block-diameter to <b>crater</b> diameter <b>ratio</b> are shown to have significant effects on the production rates. The production rate increases slowly with increasing size of the largest crater affecting the region...|$|R
40|$|Fresh crater shapes, in {{particular}} <b>crater</b> depth/diameter <b>ratios</b> d/D, have been measured for craters on {{nine of the}} icy satellites. Crater depths were determined from photoclinometry plus some shallow measurements. Interior morphology, including rimwall slope, was also examined from photoclinometry profiles. Central peak statistics and the characteristic break in slope of d/D curves were determined in order to estimate the transition diameter from simple to complex craters. Crater morphology and transition diameters on the icy satellites were then compared with crater morphology on the terrestrial rocky planets in order to separate or evaluate the relative importance and similarity of surface gravity and target characteristics in controlling crater formation and modification in icy and rocky targets. Estimates of effective rheologies of the target materials were also obtained based on morphologic changes...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was restricted to}} the determination of recognitional characteristics of a single type of relief form, dimple craters {{on the surface of}} maria. These craters were arbitrarily considered as closed, negative relief forms, circular in plan-view, and symmetric relative to the center. Two techniques were used to determine the shadow configuration in the craters: (1) experimental determination of the shadow edge by illuminating the models of different profile shapes with a parallel light beam; and (2) geometric construction of the shadow edge using a vertical section of the formation {{in the direction of the}} solar rays. A morphological map of the surface which includes the following factors can be compiled using the proposed identification technique: crater profile nature, <b>crater</b> diameter, <b>ratio</b> of diameter and depth, sharpness of the lip, and distribution density of the forms...|$|R

The encounter velocity and dust incidence direction are well constrained and can be simulated by laboratory shots. A crater size calibration programme based upon buckshot firings of tightly constrained sizes (monodispersive) of glass, polymer and metal beads has yielded a suite of scaling factors for interpretation of the original impacting grain dimensions. We have now extended our study to include recognition of particle density for better matching of crater to impactor diameter. A novel application of stereometric crater shape measurement, using paired scanning electron microscope (SEM) images has shown that impactors of differing density yield different <b>crater</b> depth/diameter <b>ratios.</b> Comparison of the three-dimensional gross morphology of our experimental craters with those from Stardust reveals that most of the larger Stardust impacts were produced by grains of low internal porosity...|$|R
40|$|Consideration {{is given}} to the {{geological}} history of Mars as inferred from cratering statistics. The geomorphology of the cratered terrain in Terra Tyrrhena is described in detail, and crater counts made from Viking images of cratered terrain as well as pure cratered areas from the Southern Hemisphere, craters superposing both the intercrater plains and dissected terrain, and plains units in the Northern Hemisphere are presented. Comparison of the Martian crater counts with those obtained for the lunar highlands reveals the distribution functions to be quite similar for crater diameters greater than 8 km, indicating their derivation from the same population of bodies, with an integrated Mars/moon <b>crater</b> flux <b>ratio</b> of at least 0. 75. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that if this ratio was due to resurfacing processes, then the Martian population is probably a remnant of obliteration by both inter- and intra-crater plains acting in concert. Results also suggest that most of the endogenetic activity in the cratered terrain occured before the end of heavy bombardment and that two stages of geologic activity were present...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain a better {{understanding}} and model of the natural and artificial particulate environment from measurements of impact damage features on returned spacecraft materials, {{it is necessary to}} be able to determine how {{the size and shape of}} an impact feature are related to the parameters of the impacting particle. The AUTODYN- 3 D hydrocode has been used to study the effects of projectile density, velocity and impact angle on the the depth, diameter and ellipticity of the impact craters. The results are used to determine the distributions of crater depth to <b>crater</b> diameter <b>ratios</b> and of <b>crater</b> ellipticities to be expected on an aluminium surface exposed to an isotropic distribution of incident particles of given densities and velocities. Comparison of these calculated distributions with those observed for craters on aluminium clamps on various faces of the Long Duration Exposure Facility shows that particles with a wide range of densities, including significant proportions both greater and smaller than that of aluminium, were responsible for these craters...|$|R
40|$|The {{ejection}} {{parameters of}} material excavated {{by a growing}} crater directly relate to the subsurface excavation flow-field. The ejection angles and speeds define the end of subsurface material streamlines at the target surface. Differences in the subsurface flow-fields can be inferred by comparing observed ejection parameters of various impacts obtained using three-dimensional particle image velocimetry (3 D PIV). The work presented here investigates the observed ejection speeds and angles of material ejected during vertical (90 impact angle) experimental impacts {{for a range of}} different projectile types. The subsurface flow-fields produced during vertical impacts are simple when compared with that of oblique impacts, affected primarily by the depth of the energy and momentum deposition of the projectile. This depth is highly controlled by the projectile/target density ratio and the disruption of the projectile (brittle vs. ductile deformation). Previous studies indicated that cratering efficiency and the <b>crater</b> diameter/depth <b>ratio</b> were affected by projectile disruption, velocity, and the projectile/target density ratio. The effect of these projectile properties on the excavation flow-field are examined by comparing different projectile materials...|$|R
40|$|Hypervelocity oblique impacts using spherical 1 mm {{diameter}} aluminum projectiles at velocities of (5. 2 +/- 0. 2) km s(- 1) were {{incident at}} angles ranging from normal (0 {{degrees to the}} vertical) to grazing incidence (80) onto thick polycrystalline H 2 O ice targets at 253 K. Data were obtained to distinguish changes in crater size and shape. The resultant craters had a deep central pit surrounded by a shallower terrace. Results on crater size showed that volume and crater depth had varying levels of dependence on obliquity for the full angular range, and terrace depth had a dependence only at angles > 45 degrees. Length and width measurements held a strong dependence on obliquity only at angles > 50 degrees from the normal. These results for ice show {{that it is hard}} to determine angle of impact from crater morphology. Although crater depth and volume do change with angle, it would be hard to separate this effect from the influence of an impact of a projectile of different speed, density, etc., which might also affect crater depth or <b>crater</b> depth/diameter <b>ratios.</b> Only at extreme angles > 70 degrees do real differences in shape emerge for ice...|$|R
40|$|The {{depths of}} 109 impact craters about 2 - 16 km in diameter, {{located on the}} ridged plains {{materials}} of Hesperia Planum, Mars, have been measured from their shadow lengths using digital Viking Orbiter images (orbit numbers 417 S- 419 S) and the PICS computer software. On {{the basis of their}} pristine morphology (very fresh lobate ejecta blankets, well preserved rim crests, and lack of superposed impact craters), 57 of these craters have been selected for detailed analysis of their spatial distribution and geometry. We find that south of 30 deg S, craters less than 6. 0 km in diameter are markedly shallower than similar-sized craters equatorward of this latitude. No comparable relationship is observed for morphologically fresh craters greater than 6. 0 km diameter. We also find that two populations exist for older craters less than 6. 0 km diameter. When craters that lack ejecta blankets are grouped on the basis of depth/diameter <b>ratio,</b> the deeper <b>craters</b> also typically lie equatorward of 30 S. We interpret the spatial variation in <b>crater</b> depth/diameter <b>ratios</b> as most likely due to a poleward increase in volatiles within the top 400 m of the surface at the times these craters were formed...|$|R
40|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of microtektites from Barbados {{was determined to}} establish their possible source {{and their relationship to}} known tektite strewn fields. Analyzed samples included microtektites and tektite fragments from the Barbados oceanic beds, samples of deep sea ooze, in which they occur, and of underlying volcanic ash, as well as glass beads from Lake Wanapitei <b>Crater.</b> Isotope <b>ratios</b> (Sr- 87 /Sr- 86, Nd- 143 /Nd- 144, Rb- 87 /Sr- 86, and Sm- 147 /Nd- 144) were determined, and the epsilon values for Sr and Nd plotted on the diagram available for the fields of North America, Australia, Ivory Coast, and Moldavite tektites. The epsilon coordinates of all Barbados microtektite and bulk tektite samples plot precisely within the narrow field determined by North American tektites (epsilon Sr, 111; epsilon Nd, - 6. 2), yield an Nd model age of 0. 6 AE, and are distinct from all other fields. The isotopic signatures of samples from sea ooze, ash layer, and of the Lake Wanapitei glass beads are clearly different from all known tektite classes. It is concluded that the Barbados tektites are of the same source and temporal event as the North American tektites...|$|R
40|$|Ejection energy-diameter scaling {{relations}} for impact craters are studied by assuming the energy {{is equal to}} a constant times the diameter raised to a (different) constant power. These scaling relations are derived from least-squares fits to calculated ejection energies over a range of crater diameters and vary according to ejection angle, ejecta blanket distribution, planetary radius, and the depth-diameter ratio. Extremely broad changes in ejection angle and ejecta blanket distribution result in relatively small changes in the total energy. The {{way in which the}} exponent in the scaling relation is dependent on the planetary radius of curvature {{as well as on the}} exponent of the power-law depth-diameter scaling relation is described. Two ejection energy-diameter scaling relations, one for simple <b>craters</b> with depth-diameter <b>ratios</b> of approximately 0. 2 and the other for large complex craters, are presented. The scaling relations explicitly include target density, surface gravity, and planetary radius...|$|R
40|$|Secondary crater {{fields are}} {{important}} stratigraphic markers that can {{shed light on}} resurfacing processes that have occurred since their formation. We examine the morphologies of secondary craters formed from the ejection of material from two large impacts on the Martian South Polar Layered Deposits (SPLD) : McMurdo crater at 84. 5 °S, 0 °W, and an unnamed impact at 80. 8 °S, 284 °W. The morphologies of these secondary craters allow us to impose constraints on the modification history of the SPLD. We have quantified crater morphologies using data sets from the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey missions. We find a complete lack of secondary craters smaller than 300 m in diameter in both crater fields, which implies that at least the upper 30 m of the deposits have been resurfaced {{since the time of}} these impacts. Secondary <b>crater</b> depth-to-diameter <b>ratios</b> are low (average of 0. 016), indicating that significant degradation has occurred since their emplacement. We find that vertical resurfacing alone is not enough to explain the observed depth-to-diameter distribution and suggest that viscous relaxation of craters coupled {{with a small amount of}} vertical resurfacing best fits the data. In the McMurdo field, high depth-to-diameter craters are found preferentially on steeper terrain associated with scarps cutting through the secondary field. This observation suggests that crater modification exhibits a dependence on slope. We comment on possible mechanisms that may explain this observation.

30|$|The {{surface of}} {{asteroid}} 25143 Itokawa {{is covered with}} numerous boulders although gravity is very small {{compared with that of}} other asteroids previously observed from spacecraft. Here we report the size-frequency statistics of boulders on the entire surface of Itokawa based on high-resolution images (1 pixel ≈ 0.4 m) obtained by the Hayabusa spacecraft. There are 373 boulders larger than 5 m in mean horizontal dimension on the entire surface— 0.393 km 2 —and the number density is nearly 103 /km 2. The cumulative boulder size distribution on the entire surface has a power-index of − 3.1 ± 0.1. For the east and west sides and the head and body portions of Itokawa, the power-index of the size distributions and the number densities of boulders of these areas are thought to be similar from the statistical point of view. A global mapping of boulders shows that there is no apparent correlation in the locations of boulders and <b>craters.</b> The <b>ratio</b> of the total volume of the boulders to the total excavated volume of the craters on Itokawa is ≈ 25 % when only craters larger than 50 m in mean diameter are considered, and this ratio is extremely larger than that on Eros and the Moon, respectively. The origin of boulders on the surface of Itokawa was examined quantitatively by calculating the number of boulders {{and the size of the}} largest boulder using a model based on impact cratering experiments. The result indicated that the boulders on the surface of Itokawa cannot solely be the product of craters. Our results suggest that the boulders originated from the disruption of the larger parent body of Itokawa, as has been described in previous papers (Fujiwata et al., Science, 312, 1330 – 1334, 2006; Saito et al., Science, 312, 1341 – 1344, 2006).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary {{experimental study of}} the factors affecting the micro-EDM process aiming at obtaining {{a deeper understanding of}} the micro-EDM die sinking process. In particular, the machining response at micro-scale of materials metallurgically and mechanically modified has been investigated. Tests were conducted that involved producing micro-EDM holes in course grained (CG) Al 1070 with an average grain size of 300 m and Ultra Fine Grained (UFG) Al 1070 with an average grain size of 0. 6 m, produced by Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP). These experimental trials were carried out under different levels of applied energy, voltage, maximum current and pulse duration in order to identify the effects of these process conditions on the obtainable surface roughness, wear <b>ratio,</b> <b>craters</b> and spark gap. The results of this investigation have revealed that, by refining the material microstructure, a better surface finish can be achieved. This observation can be mainly attributed to the homogeneity of the refined material microstructure that normally leads to more isotropic behavior of the microstructure. Furthermore, the applied energy is found to be the most important factor affecting the roughness average and wear ratio in the micro-EDM process. However, the applied voltage is found to be the second effective factor on wear ratio, while the interaction of energy and current have a significant influence on the surface roughness...|$|R

Currently, {{these images are}} being processed at JSC to yield more accurate feature information. Work is currently underway to determine the minimum number of data points necessary to parametrically define impact crater morphologies {{in order to minimize}} the man-hour intensive task of tie point selection. Initial attempts at deriving accurate crater depth and diameter measurements from binocular imagery were {{based on the assumption that}} the crater geometries were best defined by paraboloid. We made no assumptions regarding the <b>crater</b> depth/diameter <b>ratios</b> but instead allowed each crater to define its own coefficients by performing a least-squares fit based on user-selected tiepoints. Initial test cases resulted in larger errors than desired, so it was decided to test our basic assumptions that the crater geometries could be parametrically defined as paraboloids. The method for testing this assumption was to carefully slice test craters (experimentally produced in an appropriate aluminum alloy) vertically through the center resulting in a readily visible cross-section of the crater geometry. Initially, five separate craters were cross-sectioned in this fashion. A digital image of each cross-section was then created, and the 2 -D crater geometry was then hand-digitized to create a table of XY position for each crater. A 2 nd order polynomial (parabolic) was fitted to the data using a least-squares approach. The differences between the fit equation and the actual data were fairly significant, and easily large enough to account for the errors found in the 3 -D fits. The differences between the curve fit and the actual data were consistent between the caters. This consistency suggested that the differences were due to the fact that a parabola did not sufficiently define the generic crater geometry. Fourth and 6 th order equations were then fitted to each crater cross-section, and significantly better estimates of the crater geometry were obtained with each fit. Work is presently underway to determine the best way to make use of this new parametric crater definition...|$|R
40|$|Circular Polarisation Ratio (CPR) mosaics from Mini-SAR on Chandrayaan- 1 and Mini-RF on LRO {{are used}} to study craters near to the lunar north pole. The look {{direction}} of the detectors strongly affects {{the appearance of the}} crater CPR maps. Rectifying the mosaics to account for parallax also significantly changes the CPR maps of the crater interiors. It is shown that the CPRs of crater interiors in unrectified maps are biased to larger values than crater exteriors, because of a combination of the effects of parallax and incidence angle. Using the LOLA Digital Elevation Map (DEM), the variation of CPR with angle of incidence has been studied. For fresh craters, CPR ∼ 0. 7 ∼ 0. 7 with only a weak dependence on angle of incidence or position interior or just exterior to the crater, consistent with dihedral scattering from blocky surface roughness. For anomalous craters, the CPR interior to the crater increases with both incidence angle and distance from the crater centre. Central crater CPRs are similar to those in the crater exteriors. CPR does not appear to correlate with temperature within craters. Furthermore, the anomalous polar <b>craters</b> have diameter-to-depth <b>ratios</b> that are lower than those of typical polar craters. These results strongly suggest that the high CPR values in anomalous polar craters are not providing evidence of significant volumes of water ice. Rather, anomalous craters are of intermediate age, and maintain sufficiently steep sides that sufficient regolith does not cover all rough surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} constraints are known from Pioneer Venus data: the lack of a system of spreading rises, indicating distributed deformation rather than plate tectonics; and the high gravity/topography ratio, indicating the absence of an asthenosphere. In addition, the high depth/diameter <b>ratios</b> of <b>craters</b> on Venus indicate that Venus probably has no more crust than Earth. The problems of the character of tectonics and crustal formation and recycling are closely coupled. Venus appears to lack a recycling mechanism as effective as subduction, but may also have a low rate of crustal differentiation because of a mantle convection pattern that is more distributed, less concentrated, than Earth's. Distributed convection, coupled with the nonlinear dependence of volcanism on heat flow, would lead to much less magmatism, despite only moderately less heat flow, compared to Earth. The plausible reason for this difference in convective style is the absence of water in the upper mantle of Venus. We have applied finite element modeling to problems of the interaction of mantle convection and crust on Venus. The main emphasis has been on the tectonic evolution of Ishtar Terra, as the consequence of convergent mantle flow. The early stage evolution is primarily mechanical, with crust being piled up on the down-stream side. Then the downflow migrates away from the center. In the later stages, after more than 100 m. y., thermal effects develop due to the insulating influence of the thickened crust. An important feature of this modeling is the entrainment of some crustal material in downflows. An important general theme in both convergent and divergent flows is that of mixing vs. stratification. Models of multicomponent solid-state flow obtain that lower-density crustal material can be entrained and recycled, provided that the ration of low-density to high-density material is small enough (as in subducted slabs on Earth). The same considerations should apply in upflows; a small percent of partial melt may be carried along with its matrix and never escape to the surface. Models that assume melt automatically rising to the crust and no entrainment or other mechanism of recycling lower-density material obtain oscillatory behavior, because {{it takes a long time}} for heat to build up enough to overcome a Mg-rich low-density residuum. However, these models develop much thicker crust than consistent with estimates from <b>crater</b> depth/diameter <b>ratios...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of infra red femtosecond laser-induced aerosols are studied for monazite (LREE, Th (PO(4))) ablation and correlations are established with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) signals. Critical parameters are tested within wide ranges of values {{in order to}} cover the usual laser ablation -ICP-MS analysis conditions: pulse energy (0. 15 <E(0) < 1 mJ/pulse), pulse width (60 <T< 3000 fs), ablation time (t <= 10 min) and transport length (l <= 6. 3 m). Transmission electron microscopy reveals that aerosols are made of agglomerates of - 10 nm particles and 20 - 300 nm phosphorus depleted condensed spherical particles. These structures are not affected by any laser ablation parameter. Particle counting is performed using electronic low pressure impaction. Small changes on particle size distribution are noticed. They may be induced either by a peak of ablation rate in the first 15 s at high fluence (larger particles) or the loss of small particles during transport. We found {{a positive correlation between}} I (ICP-MS mean signal intensity in cps) and N (particle density in cm(- 3)) when varying E(0) and t, suggesting that N is controlled by the irradiance (P(o) in W. cm(- 2)). Elemental ratio measurements show a steady state signal after the initial high ablation rate (mass load effect in the plasma torch) and before a late chemical fractionation, induced by poor extraction of bigger, early condensed spherical particles from the deepening crater. Such chemical fractionation effects remain within uncertainties, however. These effects can be limited by monitoring E(0) to shorten the initial transient state and delay the attainment of an unfavorable <b>crater</b> aspect <b>ratio.</b> Most adopted settings are for the first time deduced from aerosol characteristics, for infra red femtosecond laser ablation. A short transport (l< 4. 0 in) limits the agglomeration of particles by collision process along the tube. Short T is preferred because of higher P(o), yet no benefit is found on ICP-MS signal intensity under 200 fs. Under such pulse widths the increased particle production induces more agglomeration during transport, thereby resulting in higher mass load effects that reduce the ionization efficiency of the plasma torch. Thus, pulse energy must be set to get an optimal balance between the need for a high signal/background ratio and limitation of mass load effects in the plasma torch...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh-resolution images {{reveal that}} {{numerous}} pit craters {{exist on the}} surface of Mars. For some pit <b>craters,</b> the depth-to-diameter <b>ratios</b> are much greater than for ordinary craters. Such deep pit craters are generally considered to be the results of material drainage into a subsurface void space, which might be formed by a lava tube, dike injection, extensional fracturing, and dilational normal faulting. Morphological studies indicate that the formation of a pit crater might be triggered by the impact event, and followed by collapse of the ceiling. To test this hypothesis, we carried out laboratory experiments of impact cratering into brittle targets with variable roof thickness. In particular, the effect of the target thickness on the crater formation is studied to understand the penetration process by an impact. For this purpose, we produced mortar targets with roof thickness of 1 – 6 cm, and a bulk density of 1550 kg/m 3 by using a mixture of cement, water and sand (0. 2 mm) in the ratio of 1 : 1 : 10, by weight. The compressive strength of the resulting targets is 3. 2 ± 0. 9 MPa. A spherical nylon projectile (diameter 7 mm) is shot perpendicularly into the target surface at the nominal velocity of 1. 2 km/s, using a two-stage light-gas gun. Craters are formed {{on the opposite side of}} the impact even when no target penetration occurs. Penetration of the target is achieved when craters on the opposite sides of the target connect with each other. In this case, the cross section of crater somehow attains a flat hourglass-like shape. We also find that the crater diameter on the opposite side is larger than that on the impact side, and more fragments are ejected from the crater on the opposite side than from the crater on the impact side. This result gives a qualitative explanation for the observation that the Martian deep pit craters lack a raised rim and have the ejecta deposit on their floor instead...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} project describes the key mission and systems engineering trade-offs {{involved in the}} end-to-end design of an orbiting mission to the Moon, using a "Smaller, Faster, Cheaper" mission approach. This approach is extended to enable {{the design of a}} new payload - within the management, cost, schedule, and physical constraints - of the low cost lunar orbiter mission. The payload is designed to image the Moon's permanently dark regions that are believed to contain water ice. To determine the best cost reduction management and engineering approach, the principles for reducing space mission cost are examined and planetary missions are assessed in terms of cost and risk drivers. 'Interplanetary' trajectories and attaining orbit around another body are shown to be the major risk areas encountered by traditional planetary missions. In addition to this, programme management is highlighted as an emerging high risk area for smaller, faster cheaper planetary missions. The preliminary mission design, covering lunar transfer, spacecraft and ground station is described. A 400 kg, three-axis stabilised, lunar orbiter, capable of delivering 20 kg of payload into a low lunar polar orbit is designed. The ground segment comprises one (possibly two) low cost ground stations, linked via the Internet. Images, raw data and telemetry can also be accessed via the Internet. The design-to-launch timeframe spans three years and the total mission cost target of $ 20 Million is met. The spacecraft is compatible with a range of existing lunar payloads, but the prime mission requirement will be to return images of the Moon's permanently dark craters for the first time. In order to design a low cost payload for imaging the Moon's permanently dark regions, the areas likely to contain the water ice are first characterised. The best and worst case lighting conditions for imaging are then calculated for these regions. The amount of light reaching a crater floor {{is a function of the}} <b>crater</b> depth-diameter <b>ratio,</b> solar irradiance incidence angle and local topography. The limiting case is shown to be imaging under starlight illumination only, which is modelled and estimated between 5 to 10 µW/m 2 over the 350 to 900 nm spectral band. These ultra-low light level conditions have led to identification and evaluation of several solutions in terms of both signal-tonoise ratio performance and development within the constraints of the smaller, faster, cheaper programme. This is achieved using a charge coupled device (CCD) camera employing a commercial sensor and optics. Large format Charge Injection Devices and Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductors (Active Pixel Devices) were identified as promising emerging technologies. The baseline low light level imager solution is a CCD array operated in Time Delay Integration mode in order to provide optical images from areas within permanent shadow. An intensified CCD offers a back up solution. The research demonstrates that a low cost lunar mission is technically feasible and additionally, that it is possible to meet a specific (if modest) application target through `smaller, faster, cheaper' payload design. It provides an approach that meets key challenges of planetary exploration at very low cost that can potentially be applied to other near Earth targets...|$|R

Image displacements in the radar images that are caused by the relief of landforms provide several methods of estimating this relief: (1) monoscopic measurements of foreshortening of landforms that are symmetrical in the plane of the look-direction of the radar (includes radial symmetry); (2) stereoscopic measurements of parallax in same-side image pairs (cycles 1 - 2 and 3); and (3) measurements of parallax in opposite-side image pairs (cycles 1 - 2 and/or 2 - 3). Success in methods 2 and 3 (especially 3) depends on identifying conjugate image points in the two images. Here, we report our preliminary results for five impact craters, seven small volcanic edifices, and two lava flows. The three methods mentioned above lead to the interesting result that Venusian impact <b>craters</b> have depth-diameter <b>ratios</b> like those on Mars rather than those on Earth, but some appear partly filled. Our results for de Lalande and Melba also suggest filling, but there may be other causes for their relatively small depth-diameter ratios.

Relief/diameter <b>ratios</b> for our <b>cratered</b> cones are about the same as those of Icelandic lava shields; some Venusian cones resemble the Martian shields of Mareotis-Tempe and Ceraunius Fossae, but the Venusian relief diameter ratios are larger.

Measurements of coating material properties and turning wear tests in annealed tool steel Sverker 21, stainless steel 316 L, grey cast iron V 314 and nodular cast iron SS 0727 were performed. The cutting temperatures were estimated from FEM-simulations. To find the dominant wear mechanism and identify the properties that are most important for the resistance against that particular wear, a correlation analysis was performed together with a wear study using LOM, SEM and EDS. The results show that relations between cutting performance and mechanical properties and/or composition of the coatings can be established. The FEM-simulations suggested that the peak tool temperature was highest, ~ 750 °C, for turning in 316 L and lowest for turning in Sverker 21, ~ 300 °C. Turning in cast iron resulted in temperatures around 500 - 550 °C. A mechanism for the growth of the crater on inserts tested in stainless steel 316 L is proposed. Wear due to thermo-mechanical load and adhesion are believed to be the dominating wear mechanisms. The performance of the tool showed a high correlation to the composition of the coatings, with a decreased tool life for higher Al-contents. The reason for this might lie in an increased brittleness of these coatings, accelerating formation of lateral cracks above the <b>crater.</b> Calculated <b>ratios</b> of bulk and shear modulus suggests an increased brittleness for higher Al-contents. A higher tendency to stick to the work piece material might also contribute to a decrease in tool life. An Increased Al-content could also drive the formation of c-AlN to h-AlN, causing even higher wear rates. The coatings with higher substrate bias showed an enhanced performance, even though the crack pattern was worsened for these variants. The reason for the enhanced performance seen for these variants might instead originate in an enhanced adhesion to the substrate. In the flank wear resistance test in Sverker 21 the Al-content proved to be important, with an improved performance for higher Al-contents. In contrast to the test in 316 L, a change in bias or hardness had no effect on the performance in this test. Scratch patterns on the flank supports that an abrasive wear mechanism is present, but no correlation between hardness and tool life could be obtained. Either some other material property than hardness is of importance for the abrasive resistance in this test, or another wear mechanism, occurring simultaneously with abrasion, is the wear rate deciding. The second part of this thesis work was to evaluate the ability of a quantum mechanical computational method, density functional theory, to predict material properties. The method predicts the lattice parameters and bulk moduli in excellent agreement with experimental values. The method also well predicts other elastic properties, with results consistent with reference values. There seems to be a constant shift of about 50 - 100 GPa between the calculated elastic modulus and the experimentally measured values, probably originating in contributions from grain boundaries, texture, stresses and defects present in the real coatings, and possibly also in errors in the experimental method due to an influence from the substrate. The calculated hardness values did not follow the trend of an increased hardness for TiAlN compared to TiN, which is seen in experiments...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{radiation}} {{has maintained}} entry {{in his capacity}} as a contactless working tool into many industrial applications in the field of laser material processing like drilling or cutting of material. In the field of chemical analysis by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) laser setups are used routinely e. g. for testing for mixed-up components of pipes. This work bridges the two fields of defined material ablation and chemical analysis by LIBS. Time and spatially modulated Nd:YAG laser radiation is used to ablate effectively scaled low-alloy steel surfaces and to analyse simultaneously. By using triple pulse bursts the depth penetration can be enhanced by a factor of up to 6 in comparison to single laser pulses taking the same total laser burst energy. For several elements the necessary ablation depths are estimated for a representative analysis at the scale side of the production control samples. Some elements can be analysed in the upper surface layer whereas e. g. for the element carbon a depth of at least 200 µm has to be removed. By using double pulse bursts the value of 55. 2 rel. -% for the relative standard deviation of the procedure of carbon calibration at the scale side without prior material ablation can be reduced to a value of 2. 8 rel. -% after removing a surface layer with a thickness of approx. 300 µm. The first time in the field of LIBS tailored crater geometries were generated by a 3 D laser scanner and optimised scan strategies which lead to smaller crater debris in comparison to locally fixed laser radiation. Interactions between plasma and crater walls and with it falsified plasma compositions by scale material are reduced analysing {{in the middle of the}} produced crater. For an adequate analysis in a laser generated <b>crater</b> aspect <b>ratios</b> of smaller than 1 are to be aspired. Calibration measurements showed that the LOD values for many elements are lower than 10 µg/g up to an analysis depth of about 300 µm. With increasing number of evaluated laser pulses of up to 3000 on each sample position the LOD values are significantly improved, e. g. for Ti to 1 µg/g. Using the curve-of-growth theory conclusions can be made concerning the self-absorption of emission lines. By means of a double logarithmic plot of calibration functions the linear section can be separated from the non-linear one showing self-absorption. With calibrations in sections the analytical performance can be improved by a factor of up to 3. For the analysis of scaled steel samples a calibration method is developed using in a first step double pulse bursts. Double pulse bursts lead to an effective scale ablation and simultaneously to an analysis of elements which are already contained representatively in the upper scale layer. In the second step single laser pulses are focused onto the same sample position leading to smaller plasmas and therefore smaller self-absorption. In this way the use of several analyte lines for covering bigger concentration ranges of one element can be disclaimed. On-site measurements in a steel mill and in a hot strip rolling mill were carried out for testing the results in the industrial practice. For the test in the steel mill a laser system was built up for the combination of ablation and analysis of scaled low alloy steel samples analysing automatically the samples at different sample positions. Two methods are used for calibration. In a first step double pulse bursts and in the second step single laser pulses are taken for ablation and analysis. During the test phase the optical elements in the laser trace were not cleaned. By means of referencing and periodical recalibrations a relative standard deviation of the procedure of 2. 3 rel. -% is achieved for the element Mn. The drift behaviour of the intensities can be reduced by using reference lines which lie in a similar wavelength range as the analyte line. Thereby the ambient gas emission line Ar 415. 85 nm is proved to be most suitable for the analyte line Al 394. 4 nm. For the on-site measurements in the hot strip rolling mill LIBS analysis at up to 520 °C warm steel coils were carried out concerning the testing for mixed-up components. Seven different coils were measured by a water-cooled measuring head constructed especially for the analysis of warm coils. The setup including a 5 m long fibre optics was optimised for a high transmission of UV light in the wavelength range of about 190 nm. With this setup the accuracies of warm coils lie in a comparable range as for chilled scaled samples...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} hydro-morphological {{investigations}} of channel and valley networks {{of the inner}} rims of Newton and Bakhuysen Crater on Mars, while focusing on the northeastern inner rim of Newton Basin. Image data (HRSC, CTX, MOLA, HiRISE, MOC), digital elevation models (MOLA, HRSC), calculation of discharge, runoff and potential thawing rates, and fluvial-statistic methods with qualitative and quantitative reference to the morphology of the fluvial systems {{were used for the}} analyses. The investigated channels and valleys at the northeastern inner rim of Newton Crater are characterized by a high degree of complexity and integration of the tributaries. These dendritic systems reach stream orders of up to 5 and channel/valley densities between 0. 05 km^- 1 and 0. 32 km^- 1 at the Noachian-Hesperian-Boundary up to the Late Hesperian. Their bifurcation ratios vary between 2 to 5 and their stream length ratios yield 1 to 4. As terrestrial river systems show values in the same order, erosive processes on Early Mars can assumed to be quite similar. The unbalanced longitudinal profiles indicate that the channels did not evolve to the maturity level. The lack of balance of erosion, transport, and sedimentation, indicates sporadic drainage. The flood peaks in Newton range between 145 m³/s and 1, 200 m³/s at the mouths. The mean discharge rates are about 10 m³/s to 230 m³/s. This corresponds to runoff rates of some centimeters per day (peak discharge rates) and some millimeters per day (mean discharge rates). River meandering was mainly suppressed. Rather, fluvial sections alternate with single stream channels within well preserved valleys and segments of anastomosing fluvial structures within inner mountain plains. A potential alluvial fan or delta could not be determined unambiguously due to insufficient resolution of the data. In contrast to Newton Crater, stream orders up to 4 have been determined at the inner rim of Bakhuysen Crater. The channel/valley densities vary between 0. 46 km^- 1 and 0. 6 km^- 1. Hence, they are roughly twice as high as those of Newton <b>Crater.</b> The bifurcation <b>ratios</b> vary between 2 and 4 in medium-sized networks (stream order 3) and up to 5 for the largest systems (stream order 4). Their stream length ratios usually range between 1 and 2 and, thus, correspond to the lower field of the Newton Crater measurements. Conclusions can be drawn that erosion processes occurred in a similar way at other locations on Mars and at other times up to Early Amazonian. This is proved by age determinations of fluvial deposits. Longitudinal profiles of the Bakhuysen channels are likewise unbalanced as the Newton ones. Due to the smaller catchments of Bakhuysen Crater (< 400 km²), peak and mean discharge rates reach lower values. Largest catchment areas show peak discharge values of 200 m³/s to 290 m³/s and mean discharge rates of 20 m³/s to 30 m³/s. These runoff rates range in the same dimension as those of Newton Crater. In general, there is hardly evidence for sedimentation of material in inner mountain plains. Thus, the material was transported into the crater which is documented by deposits in the northeast of Bakhuysen. The formation of the channels and valleys is explained by a local thermodynamic circulation model generated by the orography. Snowfall in high altitudes and accumulation of snow and ice in nivation hollows or at elevated areas over long periods cause thawing and melt water runoff during warmer periods (interglacial). The determination of potential thawing rates yields maximum runoff rates of some centimeters per day. They have the same dimension as those runoff values, which were calculated from the discharge rates, deduced from catchment area size. A rapid incision of the channel and valley networks was enabled by the effect of the “eisrinde” and “thermal erosion”. The observations and calculations show that channel and valley networks on Mars can evolve intensively in relative short time periods under cold climate conditions...|$|R
