40|$|The C-coil {{recently}} {{installed on}} the DIII-D tokamak was developed to reduce the error fields created by imperfections in the location and geometry of the existing coils used to confine, heat, and shape the plasma. First results from C-coil experiments include stable operation in a 1. 6 MA plasma with a density less than 1. 0 {times} 10 {sup 13 } cm{sup {minus} 3 }, nearly a factor of three lower density than that achievable without the C-coil. The C-coil has also been used in magnetic braking of the plasma rotation and high energy particle confinement experiments. The C-coil system consists of six individual saddle coils, each 60 {degree} wide toroidally, spanning the midplane of the vessel with a vertical height of 1. 6 m. The coils are located at a major radius of 3. 2 m, just outside of the toroidal field coils. The actual shape and geometry of each <b>coil</b> <b>section</b> varied somewhat from the nominal dimensions due to {{the large number of}} obstructions to the desired coil path around the already crowded tokamak. Each <b>coil</b> <b>section</b> consists of four turns of 750 MCM insulated copper cable banded with stainless steel straps within the web of a 3 in. x 3 in. stainless steel angle frame. The C-coil structure was designed to resist peak transient radial forces (up to 1, 800 Nm) exerted on the coil by the toroidal and ploidal fields.

40|$|Using {{a remote}} video camera, the {{internals}} of a low-level waste evaporator tank (termed 2 A 2, type 304 L stainless steel construction, {{known to have}} failed steam coils) were inspected. This inspection revealed at least three rather substantial holes as opposed to crack- or pit-like leak sites near the nominal solution level position on one particular steam coil. This section {{was removed from the}} evaporator vessel, and subsequent hot cell examination revealed extensive general corrosion on the process side of the coil with little or no attack on the steam side. Hot cell metallography confirmed intense general corrosion on the process side and, in addition, revealed shallow intergranular attack at the leading edge of corrosion. No pits or cracks were detected in this section of the steam coil.

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{cooling system}} for the muon collider will consist of a 200 meter long line of alternating field straight solenoids interspersed with bent solenoids. The muons are cooled in all directions using a 400 mm long section liquid hydrogen at high field. The muons are accelerated in the forward direction by about 900 mm long, 805 MHz RF cavities in a gradient field that goes from 6 T to - 6 T in about 300 mm. The high field section in the channel starts out at an induction of about 2 T in the hydrogen. As the muons proceed down the cooling channel, the induction in the liquid hydrogen section increases to inductions as high as 30 T. The diameter of the liquid hydrogen section starts at 750 mm when the induction is 2 T. As the induction in the cooling section goes up, {{the diameter of the}} liquid hydrogen section decreases. When the high field induction is 30 T, the diameter of the liquid hydrogen section is about 80 mm. When the high field solenoid induction is below 8. 5 T or 9 T, niobium titanium coils are proposed for generating. the magnetic field. Above 8. 5 T or 9 T to about 20 T, graded niobium tin and niobium titanium coils would be used at temperatures down to 1. 8 K.

Approximately 10, 000 samples will be acquired for each coil. The 10, 000 readings will be averaged to produce one lower-noise value for each coil. This will be repeated for each coil in the array in a sequential manner. The total corrosion image for the sector will be built from the individual coil data. (b) Corrosion larger than the operational portion of the array board will be measured using a grid technique. Uniquely identified areas in the grid will overlay a corroded area, and data collected for each area will be connected by the display and assessment software to form a composite image for the corroded area.

Part of the NED activities is a design study of different possible dipole configurations which is shared amongst the collaborating institutes. This thesis covers the electromagnetic design study of an 88 mm large bore superconducting 15 T dipole magnet with a <b>coil</b> cross <b>section</b> in cos-theta-layer design. Based on analytically describable geometries the sources of multipole errors are studied and elementary estimations of the magnet are carried out, e. g., the required amount of superconductors or the influence of the iron yoke thickness on the field quality. The magnet cross section for NED is optimized by means of the CERN field computation program ROXIE. The preliminary NED design serves as starting point for the <b>coil</b> cross <b>section</b> optimization with respect to field quality and a radial positioning of the conductor blocks. Due to the high field of magnetic induction, the surrounding iron yoke saturates for high transport currents and the multipole errors vary with excitation. In order to reduce the variation, modifications of the iron yoke shape are studied, like, e. g., holes punched into the yoke laminations, a change of the outer yoke contour or an inner contour of elliptical shape. For an elliptically shaped inner iron yoke contour the <b>coil</b> cross <b>section</b> is again optimized resulting in the Reference Design V. 2 for the NED collaboration.

40|$|Using {{synthetic}} polypeptides {{as a model}} system, {{the theories}} of helix-coil transition were developed {{into one of the}} most beautiful and fruitful subjects in macromolecular science. Understanding the folding behaviors of polypeptides are critical for the rational design of polypeptide based systems and the comprehension of protein folding which is vital in achieving many biological functionalities. The classic models proposed by Schellman and Zimm-Bragg more than 50 years ago, differ in the assumption on whether the configuration of multiple helical sequences separated by random <b>coil</b> <b>sections</b> is allowed or not in a longer polypeptide chain. Zimm also calculated the critical chain lengths that facilitate such interrupted helices. The experimental validation of the prediction, however, was not carefully examined at that time, partially due to the difficulty in making longer polypeptides with narrow molecular weight distribution. Surprisingly, not many comprehensive studies about the folding of polypeptides were conducted in the past 50 years. Here, this dissertation work will present a step by step approach to understand the folding behaviors of polypeptide containing macromolecules. First, a semi-quantitative method was developed to understand the folding behavior of linear polypeptide and polypeptide grafted comb like polymers. It is found that the method is able to predict the length of the contiguous hydrogen bond network or helical sequence of linear polypeptide while fails to explain the folding behavior of the polypeptide side chain in the comb like architectures and the deviation of the folding behavior is caused by the side chain interactions due to the congested local environment. Second, we systematically examine the helix-coil transition and folding cooperativity of linear polypeptide using the quantitative model method. We find that for longer chains, polypeptides do exist as interrupted helices with scattered <b>coil</b> <b>sections</b> even in helicogenic solvent conditions, as predicted in Zimm-Bragg’s model. The critical chain lengths that facilitate such interrupted helices, however, are substantially smaller than Zimm’s original estimation. In addition, we find there might exist intramolecular interactions between different sections of the interrupted helices in the longer chains. Then we started to investigate the folding behavior of polypeptides in more complex architectures. We modified Zimm-Bragg model to study folding behavior of polypeptide contain macromolecules induced by temperature and solvent simultaneously. While the helix-coil transition of linear polypeptides can be described by the model, the folding of grafted polypeptide chains in the comb macromolecules cannot be accurately predicted by the existing theories, due to the complicated side chain interactions between grafted polypeptides in the comb macromolecules. New statistical mechanics treatment needs to consider the possible “tertiary” interactions of polypeptides in these complex architectures. In the end, the bulk properties and morphologies of polypeptide based fibers/films were preliminarily explored to understand the intra- and inter-molecular interaction without the solvent interaction...|$|R
