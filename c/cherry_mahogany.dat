Benches are occasionally made using more exotic woods like purpleheart and teak - though the expense is high. The choice of wood is not as important as the integrity of the design - cross grain construction and inadequate joinery typically have a more destructive effect than the use of a less-than-ideal wood.|$|E

50|$|Lyptus is {{the trade}} {{name of a}} wood made from a hybrid of two species of Eucalyptus tree, Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla.

Lyptus trees can be harvested for lumber in approximately 15 years, much sooner than woods from cooler climates.|$|E

5000|$|In an 1884 article, Rau {{stated that}} he {{preferred}} cameras with Euryscope lenses and <b>cherry</b> or <b>mahogany</b> cases, oxalate-developed plates, and a Loring finder (for capturing moving subjects). His photographs were typically sold as stereo cards or lantern slides, the latter of which Rau described as the most [...] "pleasurable" [...] branch of photography. For his railroad company panoramics, he used a modified Moessard camera with a Ross 15 in portable symmetrical lens, 18 in orthochromatic film, and a rail car equipped with a darkroom and developing facilities. [...] He printed many of his railroad company photographs on albumen paper to evoke an earlier era, as most photographers had abandoned albumen by the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|Warren and his wife's primary {{residence}} was at Ludington, Michigan. They {{received a}} fully furnished Victorian style home from Warren's parents {{when they were}} first married. The home was one door east and had recently been remodeled and updated. Warren later built a home on the west side on Ludington Ave in 1905. This three-story neoclassical style mansion was built of Roman pressed brick and trimmed with Bedford limestone. It had a steam heating system, a pulley-operated draft system to provide cooling, and chandeliers of gas and electricity. The interior consisted of <b>mahogany,</b> <b>cherry,</b> walnut, white maple, oak, and hickory. It is currently a Bed & Breakfast lodge.|$|R
5000|$|The Mormon {{furniture}} exhibit contains furniture on {{loan from}} the Historical Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Most of the furniture pieces are made of pine, since hardwoods were scarce {{in the time of}} the pioneers. However, special coats of paint were used to give the pine furniture the appearance of oak, <b>cherry,</b> <b>mahogany,</b> birds eye, maple, walnut, and other hard woods. Most of the furniture was based on patterns from the East such as Empire, Federal, and Gothic Revival. However, Utah furniture was generally simpler and heavier than the styles it imitated.

50|$|Wooden {{supports}} {{depending on}} what kind of object they are used for are made from hard and soft woods. Some types of woods that artists use are poplar, beech, spruce, pine, chestnut, <b>cherry,</b> <b>mahogany,</b> and cypress. Wooden supports are susceptible to several kinds of deterioration. These include insect infestation, fluctuations in humidity/temperature causing warping and cracking, and structural damages. Cradling was previously used to correct warping by thinning the original structural support and then adhering the cradle to the reverse side of the support. However, it has become widely understood that cradling can be harmful to the paint and ground layers. Conservators today instead work to preserve what remains of the wood support rather than making corrections.|$|E

2500|$|A wand {{is made by}} a wandmaker who {{is learned}} in wandlore, the study of wands. Wands are {{handcrafted}} from high-quality woods, or [...] "wandwoods", which are capable of sustaining magic (e.g. holly, yew, ebony, vinewood, <b>mahogany,</b> <b>cherry,</b> oak, etc.). A core is then inserted {{into the middle of}} the wand from top to bottom, which gives it its power to generate magical effects. Common cores include phoenix tail feathers, unicorn tail hairs, and dragon heartstrings. Veela hair is also used, but less commonly. In the Deathly Hallows, the Elder Wand is described as the only wand with a core made from the tail hair of a Thestral. The only wand shop seen in the books is Ollivanders. Garrick Ollivander is a wandmaker who has an eidetic memory concerning wands, as well as the ability to identify the distinguishing features of a wand. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Ollivander is seen to evaluate two foreign wands: Viktor Krum's, whose wand was crafted by Gregorovitch, was unusually thick and had a dragon's heartstring core; Fleur Delacour's, created by an unknown wandmaker, was made of rosewood with a core of Veela hair. Ollivander believes Veela hair produces [...] "temperamental" [...] wands and does not use it.|$|R
40|$|Citation: Ward, Catherine N. Wood {{finishing}} {{and home}} furnishing. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: The growth in popular favor of bare wood floors {{is a part}} of the sensible movement for beauty, simplicity and utility in home decoration. Always the owner of a polished floor takes pride in it. Not the pride one would take in a beautiful rug or carpet. But a floor usually is treated under the supervision of the owner who watches it grow into a thing of beauty, and with increasing pleasure observes it gain new mellow luster as the years go by. It is a personal possession, a personal triumph, and a thing of which to feel justly proud. The housekeeper who is to care for these floors should have a thorough understanding of their treatment. In order to obtain any degree of excelency it is necessary to gain as much knowledge as possible of the materials used for furniture, floors and woodwork. They may be classified into two groups, the Hardwood, and Soft wood. Oak, ash, maple, walnut, <b>mahogany,</b> <b>cherry</b> and beech being classed as hard wood and white pine, yellow pine, hard pine, spruce, poplar, birch, and bass-wood as soft wood. Woods differ greatly in wearing quality; those which have a resinous substance well distributed throughout its structure do not decay when exposed to the weather as do the woods containing a soluble gum. It is better to use a wood that has had the sap soaked out of it than that which has been dried with the sap in the tissue, as moisture will have a decaying effect...|$|R
