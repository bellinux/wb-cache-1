50|$|As they do {{not have}} to produce {{structural}} compounds such as cellulose for leaves, stems, or roots, and because they can be grown floating in a rich nutritional medium, microalgae can have faster growth rates than terrestrial crops. Also, they can convert a much higher fraction of their biomass to oil than conventional crops, e.g. 60% versus 2-3% for soybeans. The per unit area yield of oil from algae is estimated to be from 58,700 to 136,900 L/ha/year, depending on lipid content, which is 10 to 23 times as high as the next highest yielding <b>crop,</b> <b>oil</b> palm, at 5,950 L/ha/year.|$|E
50|$|Microstegium vimineum can be {{controlled}} with pre-emergent herbicides targeted for crabgrass, in areas where native grasses subject to damage are not present in quantities sufficient to make herbicide application too undesirable. Post-emergent controls can also be considered. Some herbicides that target crab grass contain calcium acid methanearsonate, a chemical that contains the element arsenic. In the USA, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ranked arsenic as number 1 in its 2001 Priority List of Hazardous substances at Superfund sites. Surfactants should be added to herbicides for better control, unless noted. Non-ionic surfactants are considered less damaging for other plant life, while <b>crop</b> <b>oil</b> containing surfactant is often considered somewhat more effective in killing grasses. Glyphosate {{has been found to}} be effective in controlling Microstegium vimineum by using as little as a half-percent of the concentrate in water. Being a non-specific herbicide, however, its effectiveness can come with damage to desirable plant life. Glyphosate also binds to soil phosphate, potentially causing a reduction in phosphate available for the remaining plant life. In addition to herbicides, hand weeding and mowing can be used for removal, in circumstances where such methods are appropriate. As this grass is an annual, in order to be effective, mowing must be performed before the plants go to seed.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Spray {{adjuvants}} {{are often}} applied to crops {{in conjunction with}} agricultural pesticides in order to boost {{the efficacy of the}} active ingredient(s). The adjuvants themselves are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are therefore subject to minimal scrutiny and toxicological testing by regulatory agencies. Honey bees are exposed to a wide array of pesticides as they conduct normal foraging operations, meaning that they are likely exposed to spray adjuvants as well. It was previously unknown whether these agrochemicals have any deleterious effects on honey bee behavior. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An improved, automated version of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay {{with a high degree of}} trial-to-trial reproducibility was used to measure the olfactory learning ability of honey bees treated orally with sublethal doses of the most widely used spray adjuvants on almonds in the Central Valley of California. Three different adjuvant classes (nonionic surfactants, <b>crop</b> <b>oil</b> concentrates, and organosilicone surfactants) were investigated in this study. Learning was impaired after ingestion of 20 µg organosilicone surfactant, indicating harmful effects on honey bees caused by agrochemicals previously believed to be innocuous. Organosilicones were more active than the nonionic adjuvants, while the <b>crop</b> <b>oil</b> concentrates were inactive. Ingestion was required for the tested adjuvant to have an effect on learning, as exposure via antennal contact only induced no level of impairment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A decrease in percent conditioned response after ingestion of organosilicone surfactants has been demonstrated here for the first time. Olfactory learning is important for foraging honey bees because it allows them to exploit the most productive floral resources in an area at any given time. Impairment of this learning ability may have serious implications for foraging efficiency at the colony level, as well as potentially many social interactions. Organosilicone spray adjuvants may therefore contribute to the ongoing global decline in honey bee health...|$|E

40|$|Field and {{greenhouse}} {{studies were}} conducted in 2007 and 2008 to evaluate the foliar efficacy of saflufenacil on horseweed (Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq.). In the field, saflufenacil applied alone at the lowest rate (25 g/ha) resulted in less control than all other herbicide treatments that included saflufenacil. The addition of glyphosate to 25 g/ha of saflufenacil increased the level of control over either herbicide applied alone. However, the addition of glyphosate to 50 g/ha of saflufenacil or greater was not beneficial because saflufenacil alone provided at least 95 % control. Overall, horseweed height {{at the time of}} herbicide application had very little effect on the efficacy of saflufenacil applied alone or in combination with glyphosate. 	Application variables can enhance the foliar activity of saflufenacil. In the greenhouse, saflufenacil combined with glyphosate provided greater control than saflufenacil applied alone on both glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant horseweed populations. Regardless of horseweed population or glyphosate, saflufenacil had greater activity when <b>crop</b> <b>oil</b> concentrate rather than nonionic surfactant was used as the adjuvant. Decreasing light level within 24 hours of herbicide application resulted in greater saflufenacil activity. Applying saflufenacil in a pH 5 spray solution resulted in greater activity than pH 7 or pH 9. Although effects from saflufenacil applied under different temperatures were evident in early timings, there were no lasting effects on the efficacy of saflufenacil. 	Saflufenacil had significant activity on both glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant horseweed. Under certain conditions when complete control of horseweed is not achieved, such as low application rates, large target weeds, and varying environmental conditions, application variables including glyphosate tank-mixtures, <b>crop</b> <b>oil</b> concentrate, low spray solution pH, and low light level may increase the level of horseweed control from saflufenacil...|$|E
