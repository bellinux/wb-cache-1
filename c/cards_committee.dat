It was created by Decipher, Inc., which also produced the Star Trek Customizable Card Game and The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game. The game was produced from December 1995 until December 2001. Operation and oversight of the game was then taken over by a Decipher created volunteer group called the Star Wars Customizable <b>Card</b> Game Players <b>Committee.</b> To date, the Players Committee, or PC, still runs the game and creates new cards known as [...] "virtual cards" [...] that are released online in PDF format, and can then be printed and played with. SW:CCG can also be played online: Holotable.com is the official Player Committee platform.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study focuses upon Credit Cards and a proposed verification method {{to reduce the}} risk of fraudulent use. It is anticipated that the proliferation and growing use of credit cards will require the use of security concepts offering built-in point of use protection that is automatic and reliable. A suggested concept is the use of a combined electronic credit card and a memory device. The proposed verification technique combines a user electronic credit card and memory number along with a simple imprinter which would be operated by the person accepting the credit card. Credit cards have become a widely accepted instrument of credit in the United States, and are a prime mover in the trend toward a 2 ̆ 2 cashless society 2 ̆ 2. It is estimated that there are 300 million cards in use today; growing at a rate of about 20 percent per year. Their increased usage and acceptance portends considerable change in credit instruments of many segments of the business world. It is also anticipated that the problem of theft and unauthorized use will increase in proportion equal to or greater than the card growth. Thus, credit card user verification will become a most important factor in the trend toward a cashless society. In anticipation of the credit card user verification problem, the American Bankers Association established a Credit <b>Card</b> Verification <b>Committee</b> in 1967 under the direction of Mr. Norman McClave, Jr., a Senior Vice President of Chicago Northern Trust Company, and Mr. Bernard Ellis of the American Bankers Association. On July 1, 1967 a Verification Criterion was written. It established two levels of identification, the present 2 ̆ 2 honest face 2 ̆ 2 level which would accept the same risks as are now prevailing using a credit card which carries only a name, and a second level which would minimize or eliminate the risks by introducing an additional verification techinque to be used in conjunction with the present 2 ̆ 2 honest face 2 ̆ 2 level. The American Bankers Association suggested verification requirements include public acceptance, permanency, self-contained (single card), no duplication, machine processable without the help of any other individual, 100...|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{deals with}} the {{conflicts}} that exist between Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW) and Associated Jehovah’s Witnesses for Reform on Blood (AJWRB) in relation to blood transfusion. JW is a group that does not take blood transfusion even in life-threatening situations, and AJWRB is a splinter group from the JW group that {{does not support the}} idea of refusing the blood transfusion. The Witnesses justify their stand on the biblical scriptures where it is written that we cannot eat blood as it is sacred and possesses life. The Witnesses also believe that if we receive blood in any form, they will not achieve resurrection after the death whereas AJWRB believe that they can achieve resurrection even after receiving the blood. In this thesis, my primary objective is to explore the kinds of existing conflicts and to check the possibility of syncretism between them. For the theoretical aspects in this thesis, I am using the “Actor-Network Theory” to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} existing conflicts as well as the notion of “modes of syncretism” developed by John et al to locate the nature of possible syncretizing processes. My research is based on the empirical study of the official websites of the JW and AJWRB groups and their respective publications. They have been putting their views and arguments on the websites and publishing brochures and journals to spread their respective standpoints about the blood transfusion. In terms of the methodology, I am using the qualitative data analysis where the texts are explored for its contents, and findings are discussed and analyzed empirically. In this thesis, I found not only the conflicts between them, but also that there are different modes of syncretism that are already taking place. My conclusion from the research is that apart from the main conflict regarding the blood transfusion, the two groups have engaged in many issues such as interpretations of the Bible, blood components, blood <b>card,</b> Hospital Liaison <b>Committees,</b> blood infections and diseases, disfellowship, overlapping of the rights of JW and doctors and bloodless treatments. By comparison of the debates from these two groups, it is clear that their logics of arguments and activities are already getting syncretized. Thus, syncretism is a byproduct of their efforts to minimize the conflicts...|$|R
