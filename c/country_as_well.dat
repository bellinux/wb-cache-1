5|$|Both {{teams were}} each given 12,000 tickets – the {{remaining}} 6,000 tickets were released, for purchase to the Swedish people. However, Stuttgart {{decided to send}} 11,000 of their 12,000 tickets back to UEFA, due to the German club's supporters finding it difficult {{to make their way}} to the <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as the absence of air flights available. Subsequently, none of the unsold tickets were granted for Chelsea and its followers; the consequences proved worse, when the side announced that they had issued tickets alone for those, who had ordered the more higher-priced package.|$|E
5|$|In December 1946, the {{government}} of Camille Huysmans inaugurated a medal to be awarded to {{former members of the}} resistance and bestowed various other benefits on other members, including pensions and a scheme of state-funded apprenticeships. Individuals were accorded military rank equivalent to their status in the movement during the war, entitling them to title and other privileges.

5|$|The pieces {{relating}} to Ireland {{are those of}} a public nature; in which the Dean appears, as usual, in the best light, because they do honour to his heart {{as well as to}} his head; furnishing some additional proofs, that, though he was very free in his abuse of the inhabitants of that <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> natives as foreigners, he had their interest sincerely at heart, and perfectly understood it. His sermon upon Doing Good, though peculiarly adapted to Ireland and Wood's designs upon it, contains perhaps the best motives to patriotism that were ever delivered within so small a compass.|$|E
5|$|Though {{concentrated}} in London, the outbreak affected {{other areas of}} the <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> Perhaps the most famous example was the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas but the cost to the village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.|$|E

5|$|Fischbach {{returned}} to the NIH in 1998 when he was named director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), {{a division of the}} NIH that supports research on the brain and nervous system. While he was director, Fischbach oversaw a staff of more than 700 and an annual budget of about $800 million. This money was used to support research by private and public organizations across the <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as scientists working in labs at NINDS. Fischbach accomplished many things while director of NINDS, one of which being helping to shape national policy on important neurological research issues. He received great praise for his time as director from both Harold Varmus, former director of the NIH and current director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and Richard Klausner, former director of the NCI. Fischbach left NINDS is 2001 when he was named Columbia University's Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Indonesian {{government}} announced the aviation deregulation policy, {{which makes it}} easier to acquire a permit to establish a new airline company. The policy was meant to stimulate air transportation investments and increase air-travel business in the <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as to serve and stimulate tourism industry in the region. As a result, many new airlines began to spring up in Indonesia, among them Lion Air (est. 1999), Sriwijaya Air (est. 2003), Adam Air (operating from 2002 to 2008), and Batavia Air (operating from 2002 to 2013). The deregulation also spurred the low-cost carrier service in Indonesia. Previously, air travel service was dominated by well-established airlines such as Garuda Indonesia and Merpati.|$|E

Other facilities include two banks, a library, a Post Greenland office and a small hospital/health center with 19 beds.|$|E
5|$|Odense is Funen's most {{important}} industrial and commercial centre, and the city's central location in Denmark makes {{it one of}} the national convention and congress centres. Enterprises include the Albani Brewery, ABB (Asea Brown Boveri), Kansas Workwear (clothing), Plus Pack (canning and containers) as well as manufacturers in the electrical sector. In recent years there has been a general trend from manufacturing into the service sector. By 2002, 51% of the workforce was employed by the service sector while only 13% were working in industry. Lindø Wharf, once Denmark's largest shipbuilding facility, has now been converted into Lindø Industrial Park specialising in the production and storage of components for the offshore industries, creating a variety of new tenants. GASA, a large horticultural centre, supplies fruit, vegetables, flowers and plants to most of the <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as for export.

5|$|Since the 1960s, {{populations of}} the Caucasian jungle cat living along the Caspian Sea and in the Caucasus range states have been rapidly declining. Only small populations persist today. There has been no record in the Astrakhan Nature Reserve in the Volga Delta since the 1980s. The jungle cat is rare in the Middle East. In Jordan, it is highly {{affected}} by the expansion of agricultural areas around the river beds of Yarmouk and Jordan rivers, where farmers hunted and poisoned jungle cats for attacking poultry. It is also considered rare and threatened in Afghanistan. India exported jungle cat skins in large numbers, until this was banned in 1979; some illegal trade, however, continues in the <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as in Egypt and Afghanistan.|$|E

The ship left Veracruz in July and spent the next several months cruising off the Dominican Republic and Haiti to monitor the political situations in the neighboring countries. She returned to Norfolk on 24 September; by this time, World War I had broken out in Europe, though the United States initially remained neutral.|$|E
5|$|The Icelandic {{horse is}} a breed of horse {{developed}} in Iceland. Although the horses are small, at times pony-sized, most registries for the Icelandic {{refer to it}} as a horse. Icelandic horses are long-lived and hardy. In their native country they have few diseases; Icelandic law prevents horses from being imported into the country and exported animals are not allowed to return. The Icelandic displays two gaits in addition to the typical walk, trot, and canter/gallop commonly displayed by other breeds. The only breed of horse in Iceland, they are also popular internationally, and sizable populations exist in Europe and North America. The breed is still used for traditional sheepherding work in its native <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as for leisure, showing, and racing.|$|E

Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document {{on the grounds of}} alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|To {{encourage}} {{the creation of}} Rovering in the U.S., J. S. Wilson travelled from the UK to oversee a Wood Badge course in May 1936 at Schiff. Hillcourt was a participant in that first course and four days later, he was the senior patrol leader for the second course. He received his Wood Badge beads in 1939 and was appointed as the deputy camp director for Wood Badge. After World WarII, Wood Badge was revived and Hillcourt was the Scoutmaster for a test course begun on July 31, 1948, at Schiff and the first standard course at Philmont Scout Ranch. As the national director of training, Hillcourt wore five Wood Badge beads, a tradition that has been discontinued in the U.K. Scout Association, however other countries still continue {{the use of the}} five Wood Badge Beads and are still worn by the National Volunteer Leader of Wood Badge Training of each <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as by special decree of Gilwell Park today.|$|E
