50|$|If M. citrina {{arrived in}} the Pacific {{with the help of}} man there are several possibilities. It is {{unlikely}} to survive in ballast water but may have been transported in the sea chest of a vessel, a recess on the hull <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a <b>grill</b> and used for the intake of sea water for ballast, firefighting, engine cooling and other purposes. Sea chests house a community of organisms that would be unlikely to survive as fouling animals on the vessel's hull. M. citrina may have {{arrived in the}} Pacific in one of these, perhaps via the Northwest Passage. Being a cold water species, it is unlikely this species would have arrived via the Caribbean Sea and Panama Canal where the water temperature would be outside the tunicate's survival range.|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the design of the {{production}} of kettle <b>grill</b> <b>lid</b> from steel 11 305 (1. 0338) with a constant wall thickness of 1 mm and a series of 10 000 pcs/year. For the selected method of manufacture by conventional drawing, technological calculations were performed. Depending on the diameter of the blank, maximum force and other parameters, the tool and the machine were designed. The tool is a single-operation drawing tool with a blank holder and a rib around the perimeter. These functional parts, together with the drawing punch and drawing die, are made of surface-treated cementitious steel 14 220 (1. 7131). The drawing tool is clamped into a CBA 250 hydraulic press with a nominal force of 2 500 kN, where the blank holder is controlled by an additional device {{at the bottom of the}} press...|$|R
