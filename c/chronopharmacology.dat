However, mouse and patient data show that lifestyle, sex, genetics, drugs, and cancer can modify both host circadian clocks and metabolism pathways dynamics, and thus the optimal timing of drug administration. The mathematical modeling of <b>chronopharmacology</b> could indeed help moderate optimal timing according to patient-specific determinants. Here, we combine in vitro and in silico methods, in order to characterize the critical molecular pathways that drive the <b>chronopharmacology</b> of irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor with complex metabolism and known activity against colorectal cancer. Large transcription rhythms moderated drug bioactivation, detoxification, transport, and target in synchronized colorectal cancer cell cultures. These molecular rhythms translated into statistically significant changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics according to in vitro circadian drug timing. The top-up of the multiple coordinated <b>chronopharmacology</b> pathways resulted in a four-fold difference in irinotecan-induced apoptosis according to drug timing.

40|$|Background and objectives: In <b>chronopharmacology</b> the {{biological}} rhythm variations caused by drug administration is assessed. Evaluation {{of the time}} of drug administration and the qualitative and quantitative effects of reactions to drugs is called chronopharmacodynamics. In this study, we assessed the chronopharmacodynamics of intrathecal co-administration of sufentanyl and bupivacaine in surgical operations of lower extremities. Methods: In 2006, patients aged 20 - 50 with ASA physical status of I and II, who underwent surgical operation of lower extremities were entered into this prospective study. The patients received a slow intrathecal injection of 10 μg sufentanyl and 15 mg bupivacaine into subarachnoid of third and fourth lumbar spaces in 30 seconds. After the operation, the time of first pain sensation and the visual analogue scale (VAS) score, as the measure of severity of pain, were recorded. Results: 115 patients were studied in this project. The pain-free interval was considered as the time between injection and patient’s demand for pain relief. This interval was 746 (± 322) minutes. The average score of pain severity on VAS at the time of demand for pain relief was 24. 7 (± 9. 3). The average pain-free duration in patients injected about noon or at midnight was significantly longer than the pain-free interval of other patients.

A significant circadian sinusoidal rhythm in the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl was observed. Variations were observed for peak analgesic effect, duration of effect, and the occurrence of hyperalgesia. A peak in pain relief occurred late in the afternoon (5 : 30 pm) and a trough {{in the early morning hours}} (5 : 30 am). The difference between the peak and trough in pain relief corresponds to a difference in VAS of 1. 3 &ndash; 2 cm.

The goal of chronotherapy is to administer treatments {{at the time of}} day that enhances both their effectiveness and tolerance. This review intends to (1) provide the theoretical rationale behind the use of aminoglycosides during extended interval schedule chronotherapy in clinical practice and (2) target the underlying molecular mechanisms of renal toxicity, the main unwanted side effect. Previous reports suggest that aminoglycoside therapy may benefit from a chronopharmacological approach. Temporal variations in the renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and several clock-dependent molecular mechanisms contributing to the daily changes in electrolyte and water urinary excretion have been reported. Daily differences in aminoglycoside toxicity and kinetic disposition have been found in laboratory animals and human patients. Nephrotoxicity and renal cortical accumulation are higher when drugs are administered during the rest phase than during the active phase. Active translocation of aminoglycosides into renal cells is mediated by the megalin/cubilin receptor complex located at the luminal epithelial cell membrane.

As a result, many mechanisms of diseases and drug effects are controlled by the circadian timing system. Thus, the tolerability of nearly 500 medications varies by up to fivefold according to circadian scheduling, both in experimental models and/or patients. Moreover, treatment itself disrupted, maintained, or improved the circadian timing system {{as a function of}} drug timing.

40|$|Determining {{the optimal}} {{temporal}} pattern of drug administration represents {{a central issue}} in <b>chronopharmacology.</b> Given that circadian rhythms profoundly affect the response {{to a variety of}} anticancer drugs, circadian chronotherapy is used clinically in cancer treatment. Assessing the relative cytotoxicity of various temporal patterns of administration of anticancer drugs requires a model for the cell cycle, since these drugs often target specific phases of this cycle. Here we use an automaton model to describe the transitions through the successive phases of the cell cycle. The model accounts for the progressive desynchronization of cells due to the variability in duration of the cell cycle phases, and for the entrainment of the cell cycle by the circadian clock. Focusing on the cytotoxic effect of 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), which kills cells exposed to this anticancer drug during the S phase, we compare the effect of continuous infusion of 5 -FU with various circadian patterns of 5 -FU administration that peak at either 4 a. m. 10 a. m. 4 p. m. or 10 p. m. The model indicates that the cytotoxic effect of 5 -FU is minimum for a circadian delivery peaking at 4 a. m. -which is the profile used clinically for 5 -FU-and is maximum for continuous infusion or a circadian pattern peaking at 4 p. m.

We evaluated the pattern of seizure occurrence in patients with well-localized mTLE and hypothesized that peak seizure frequency would occur in the afternoon, and that this pattern would not be altered by age, gender, or seizure focus. MethodsWe retrospectively identified consecutive mTLE patients with a seizure-free outcome following anterior {{temporal lobe}}ctomy from 1993 to 2004 with video-EEG captured seizures. We recorded and plotted the 24 -h clock time for each seizure and performed cosinor analysis. SAS Proc GLIMMIX was used to fit the linearized transform of the cosinor model. Negative binomial regression fitted by the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method was also performed to estimate and compare the mean seizure rates over a 24 -h day. ResultsSixty mTLE patients monitored between 2 and 16 days were analyzed. Mean (standard deviation), median number of seizures per subject were 10. 47 (7. 86), 9. 00.

40|$|<b>Chronopharmacology</b> {{studies the}} effect of the timing of drug {{administration}} on drug effect. Here, we measured the influence of 4 timing moments on fentanyl-induced antinociception in healthy volunteers. Eight subjects received 2. 1 μg/kg intravenous fentanyl at 2 pm and 2 am, with at least 2 weeks between occasions, and 8 others at 8 am and 8 pm. Heat pain measurements using a thermode placed on the skin were taken at regular intervals for 3 hours, and verbal analog scores (VAS) were then obtained. The data were modeled with a sinusoid function using the statistical package NONMEM. The study was registered at trialregister. nl under number NTR 1254. A significant circadian sinusoidal rhythm in the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl was observed. Variations were observed for peak analgesic effect, duration of effect, and the occurrence of hyperalgesia. A peak in pain relief occurred late in the afternoon (5 : 30 pm) and a trough {{in the early morning hours}} (5 : 30 am). The difference between the peak and trough in pain relief corresponds to a difference in VAS of 1. 3 – 2 cm. Only when given at 2 am, did fentanyl cause a small but significant period of hyperalgesia following analgesia. No significant changes were observed for baseline pain, sedation, or the increase in end-tidal CO 2. The variations in fentanyl’s antinociceptive behavior are well explained by a chronopharmacodynamic effect originating at the circadian clock in the hypothalamus. This may be a direct effect through shared pathways of the circadian and opioid systems or an indirect effect via diurnal variations in hormones or endogenous opioid peptides that rhythmically change the pain response and/or analgesic response to fentanyl...|$|E
40|$|Background: While the {{research}} and treatment focus of biological aspects of depression has traditionally centered on neutrotransmitters disturbances, there has been relatively little attention paid to the chronobiological aspects of depression that offer rapid acting chronotherapeutis and from recently also an innovative circadian rhythms resynchronizing antidepressant. Objective: This article discusses chronobiological aspects of psychiatric treatment, particularly related to depression. It is concerned with chronotherapeutics and pharmacological interventions to resychronize circadian rhythms, particularly focused on agomelatine, an innovative antidepressant targeting melatonergic M 1 /M 2 and serotonergic 5 -HT 2 c receptors. Discussion: Depression can be explained as dysfunction at the nexus of the body, brain and mind, three mutually very dependent components, associated through circadian pace makers at the molecular, cellular, physiological and behavioral levels. Mental disorders, particularly depression, are common in people with circadian rest-activity cycle disturbances and sleep-wake problems. The circadian rest-activity and sleep-wake cycle disturbances are risk factors for developing and recurrence of mental disorders as well as, what is very important, they are associated with worse outcome. The interrelationships between circadian rhythm disturbances and depression is very complex, and the fundamental question is whether they trigger depression or whether these disturbances arise {{as a consequence of}} the disease. However, both depression and circadian rhythm disturbances may have a common aetiology: a decreased cellurar resilience associated with lower resistance to stressful events. Treating depression pharmacologicaly through the restoration of circadian rhythms may open a new era of superior management of depression and other mental disorders. Conclusion: Chronotherapeutic strategies that reset the internal clock may have specific advantage for the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. There is still a lot of research to be done on utilising chronotherapeutic principles in clinical practice, particularly regarding the specific indications. Agomelatine seems to be an promising resynchronizing agent expanding the field of <b>chronopharmacology</b> and inducing new treatment strategy...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the long}} history of sleep and {{epilepsy}} research, the re-lationship between the two remains poorly understood (2, 3). An abundance of evidence suggests a bidirectional relation-ship between sleep and epilepsy, where sleep disorders are common comorbidities in individuals with epilepsy; and sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS) in particular, may provide a physiologi-cal milieu for epileptiform activity. Sleep is also critical in post-encoding evolution including a range of sleep-dependent memory processes, from simple stabilization of memories to the discovery of insights. The chronobiology of sleep results in the need to understand the <b>chronopharmacology</b> of antiepi-leptic drug therapy in individuals with epilepsy. At the 2011 Merritt-Putnam Symposium, the dynamic symbiotic relation-ship between sleep and epilepsy was explored. Objectives of the symposium were to 1) identify distin-guishing clinical and EEG features of nocturnal seizures and parasomnias, which allow accurate diagnosis; 2) understand how sleep disturbances can exacerbate epilepsy and epilepsy can adversely alter sleep; 3) review common pathophysiologi-cal mechanisms between sleep and epilepsy; 4) recognize the consequences of nocturnal seizures and epileptiform discharg-es on cognition; and 5) learn to manage nocturnal seizures and epileptiform activity using current treatment options. The symposium addressed one of the NIH research bench-marks: Area III: Prevent, limit, and reverse the comorbidities associated with epilepsy and its treatment (4). Specifically, the topics aimed to prevent or limit other adverse consequences occurring in people with epilepsy, identify the range and frequency of sleep disorder subtypes associated with epilepsy, identify the influence of sleep disorders on the incidence of seizures, and identify the influence of sleep disorders on at least one comorbidity of epilepsy. In this review, highlights of the conference are presented. In addition, slides from the individual talks are available at th...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) for irinotecan <b>chronopharmacology</b> {{was investigated in}} female B 6 D 2 F 1 mice. A three-fold 24 h change in the mRNA expression of Abcb 1 b was demonstrated in ileum mucosa, with a maximum at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 15 (p < 0. 001). No rhythm was found for abcb 1 a in ileum mucosa, or for Abcb 1 a/b in Glasgow osteosarcoma (GOS), a mouse tumor cell line moderately sensitive to irinotecan. Non-tumor-bearing mice received irinotecan (50 mg/kg/day i. v. × 4 days) as a single agent or combined with P-gp inhibitor PSC 833 (6. 25 mg/kg/day i. p. × 4 days) at ZT 3 or ZT 15, respectively corresponding to the worst or the best irinotecan tolerability. Endpoints involved survival, body weight change and hematologic toxicity. Antitumor efficacy was studied in GOS-bearing mice receiving irinotecan (25, 30 or 40 mg/kg/day × 4 days) and +/− PSC 833 at ZT 3 or ZT 15, with survival, body weight change, and tumor growth inhibition as endpoints. Non-tumor bearing mice lost an average of 17 % or 9 % of their body weight according to irinotecan administration at ZT 3 or ZT 15 respectively (p < 0. 001). Dosing at ZT 15 rather than ZT 3 reduced mean leucopenia (9 % vs 53 %; p < 0. 001). PSC 833 aggravated irinotecan lethal toxicity from 4 to ~ 60 %. In tumor-bearing mice, body weight loss was ~ halved in the mice on irinotecan or irinotecan–PSC 833 combination at ZT 15 as compared to ZT 3 (p < 0. 001). PSC 833 –irinotecan at ZT 15 increased tumor inhibition by ~ 40 % as compared to irinotecan only at ZT 15. In conclusion, P-gp was an important determinant of the circadian balance between toxicity and efficacy of irinotecan...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{alterations}} in Biological Clock responses {{have been reported}} following sidereal time changes (e. g., Jet-lag), and exposure to microgravity (e. g., daytime sleepiness). Additionally, light reduces circulating melatonin (spectral specificity greatest between 450 - 500 nm). It was hypothesized that LEDs can replace the current light sources used in zero gravity and terrestrial research laboratories because of their small size, low mass, low energy consumption and long functional life. This report evaluates the capacity of LEDs to entrain the circadian system of rats as judged by measurement of overt behavioral circadian rhythms (activity, feeding, drinking). These data were collected in highly controlled environments similar to the shuttle Animal Enclosure Modules. Two groups were compared: control - animals exposed to standard cool-white fluorescent lights, and test - animals exposed to LEDs with a spectral power distribution matching the fluorescent lights. Gross locomotor activity, feeding and drinking frequencies were continuously monitored and stored at 10 minute intervals. Animals {{were exposed to the}} following photoperiods: 28 days of 12 L: 12 D, 19 days of 24 L: 0 D and 16 days of 12 L: 12 D. Light intensities tested varied between 0. 1 to 100 lux. Rats received food and water ad libitum, and temperature and humidity were controlled throughout the study. The general health status of all rats was acceptable for each day of this study. No incidents of aggressive behavior were observed. Growth, locomotor activity, food and water consumption were comparable for all groups of animals, i. e, the circadian characteristics of the animals under these conditions were comparable. These results indicate that LED arrays are as effective in maintaining circadian rhythm stability as the commonly used cool-white fluorescent light sources. LEDs with their flexible spectrum, low energy requirements and minimal heat production have advantages for some <b>chronopharmacology</b> studies and for microgravity animal habitats...|$|E
40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are widely}} used for their analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, NSAIDs commonly induce gastrointestinal toxicity by mechanisms that are incompletely understood, and the efficacy and side effects of these drugs exhibit significant inter-individual variability, which is partially explained by pharmacogenetics. ^ The vertebrate intestinal microbiota have a highly diverse enzymatic system and hence have been implicated in the metabolism of various xenobiotics, including clinically important drugs. The composition of intestinal microbiota exhibits considerable inter-individual differences, and dysbiosis {{has been associated with}} the pathogenesis of many diseases. ^ The present study is designed to elucidate the interactions between the microbiota and indomethacin, an NSAID that inhibits cyclooxygenases (COX) - 1 and 2. At a dose that caused small intestinal damage, orally administered indomethacin was distributed in the circulation and in the intestinal tract, and suppressed the production of both COX- 1 and COX- 2 derived prostaglandins in vivo. Deep sequencing analysis showed that indomethacin altered the composition and diversity of the large intestinal and fecal microbiota, shifting it towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Depletion of the intestinal microbiota by antibiotic treatment increased indomethacin elimination, and decreased its half-life and volume of distribution. This involves the de-glucuronidation mediated by the β-glucuronidase-expressing bacteria in the intestinal microbiota. Therefore, the intestinal microbiota may be a potential source of inter-individual variability in the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of indomethacin. ^ This study also found that the total fecal microbial load, as well as the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes oscillated during the light-dark cycle. This oscillation requires a functional host circadian clock, since deletion of Bmal 1, a gene encoding a core molecular clock component, abolished this rhythmicity. The fecal microbiota composition was also altered by Bmal 1 -deletion. In addition, the relative abundances of several β-glucuronidase-expressing bacteria oscillate diurnally, suggesting the involvement of intestinal microbiota in the <b>chronopharmacology</b> of indomethacin. ^ The indomethacin-microbiota interactions described here provide candidate mechanisms for pathogenesis of GI toxicity, individualized drug responses, as well as the circadian variation of drug kinetics and effects. ...|$|E
40|$|Bj&ouml;rn LemmerInstitute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ruprecht-Karls-University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, GermanyAbstract: The {{cardiovascular}} system is highly organized in time. Blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral resistance, pressure, and vasodilating hormones display pronounced circadian variations. New data presented here demonstrate also sex-dependent differences in vasodilating hormones, with higher NO&chi; excretion in females than males and a steeper early morning rise in norepinephrine in males, whereas the 24 -hour {{blood pressure and}} heart-rate profiles were not different. Various antihypertensive drugs were investigated in crossover studies &ndash; morning versus evening dosing &ndash; in hypertensive patients; however, consistent data were only described for angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor blockers. Whereas in dippers ACE inhibitors had a superdipping effect when dosed at night, {{no difference in the}} blood pressure lowering effect or on the 24 -hour blood pressure profile was found with calcium channel blockers after morning and evening dosing. In nondippers, the calcium channel blockers isradipine and amlodipine transformed nondippers into dippers, similar after evening dosing. The effects of AT 1 -receptor blockers {{are similar to those of}} ACE inhibitors. Also, diuretics are able to normalize non dipping behavior. Moreover, a circadian phase dependency in their pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated for various cardiovascular-active drugs, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, oral nitrates, and ACE inhibitors, modified by the galenic formulation. There is evidence that in hypertensive dippers, antihypertensive drugs should be given during early morning hours, whereas in non dippers it can be necessary to add an evening dose or even to apply a single evening dose in order not only to reduce high blood pressure, but also to normalize a disturbed non dipping 24 -hour blood pressure profile.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the reliability of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) 's Medical Subject Headings((R)) (MeSH) thesaurus for electronic indexing and retrieval of published chronobiologic papers. A sample set of 228 recent chronobiologic references was downloaded from the MEDLINE((R)) 's database together with all MeSH entries associated with them. The following descriptors were analyzed among the headings of obvious chronobiologic relevance: chronobiology, chronobiology disorders, biological clocks, circadian rhythm, chronotherapy, drug administration schedule, periodicity, seasons, sleep disorders/circadian rhythm, and time factors. A comparison was made between the number of references identified by each heading and the number of articles actually pertinent to the same heading (as ascertained after reading each article of the sample set). This made possible an assessment of consistency (retrieved number not less than actual number) and accuracy (retrieved number not greater than actual number) of the usage of each MeSH entry. By reading each article, it was also possible to identify common chronobiologic concepts not yet associated with specific MeSH headings. In the preselected set of chronobiologic references, seasons identified all articles pertinent to seasonal variations and rhythms. However, chronobiology disorders missed 97. 6 % of its pertinent articles; periodicity, 95. 2 %; chronobiology, 87. 7 %; chronotherapy, 70 %; time factors, 62. 3 %; and sleep disorders/circadian rhythm, 47. 4 %. Drug administration schedule missed 40 % of the chronotherapeutic articles and identified 15 % of the chronopharmacologic articles; biological clocks missed 24. 1 % of its pertinent articles and wrongly identified 8. 3 % of the retrieved articles; and circadian rhythm missed 2. 7 % of all circadian studies and wrongly identified 8. 2 % of the articles it retrieved. When used to search chronobiologic articles in the entire MEDLINE database, drug administration schedule, seasons, and time factors appeared to lack sufficient specificity to produce accurate results. Some common chronobiologic concepts were found not to be associated with any specific MeSH heading, namely, chronoepidemiology, <b>chronopharmacology,</b> chronotoxicology, chronotype, entrainment, and masking. For common chronobiologic concepts and definitions, the use of available MeSH headings appears to often yield inconsistent and inaccurate results; moreover, the MeSH thesaurus remains incomplete...|$|E
