40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{would like to}} focus on family films in {{exploring}} their orgin raw form as the family filmmakers left the rolls, cartridges, or memory cards of family film chronicles. An {{important aspect of the}} intact records is a potencionality that stems from thoughtless structure composition, unclear principles, a high degree of randomness in filmed scenes and the overall effort in shooting moments of the family life with all the "errors" which the author often avoided to take family snapshots. Thus the raw record with its shortcomings I perceive as an adequate study of its basic assumptions and possible interpretations - in its differences from any other discipline of film - and possible approximation to what we call <b>creative</b> <b>documentaries...</b>|$|R

40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} travel documentaries. It {{presents}} the genre's basic definitions and briefly describes its {{history from the}} beginning of cinematography up to now, with a special focus on current Czech and foreign TV series. Filming and post-production dramaturgical rules and production limits are described in the case study of television series Na cestě, and their resulting impact on the show's traits is analyzed. The outcomes of television rating and viewer satisfaction measurements are also dealt with; moreover, based on the available data, a viewer profile is outlined, attempting to deduce what his visions and expectations are. As a contrast with TV production, the paper includes two <b>creative</b> <b>documentaries,</b> which characteristics also fit the travel genre: Notebook from China, by Danish director Jorgen Leth, and Šimon Špidla's Into Oblivion. The study compares their style and ways of narration, draws a comparison with series' features, and aims to answer whether or not the conditions of TV series production enable creative travel filmmaking...|$|R
