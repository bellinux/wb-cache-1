40|$|This study {{examined}} the signaling strength, or marketing power, {{of the most common}} qualifications of entry-level biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs) in Texas, based on stated hiring preferences of BMET managers, using order ranking of fictitious resumes. This study also sought to determine whether certification status, education background, military training background as a BMET, or type of employer [hospital or ISO] of the hiring manager had an effect on hiring preference for applicant qualifications of associate degree, military training as a BMET, or certified biomedical equipment technician (CBET) certification candidacy. Participants were asked to rank 16 fictitious resumes representing the most common qualifications of entry-level BMETs and to fill out a background questionnaire regarding their education, military, certification, and employer. The number of times each resume ranked in first place was tabulated and inter-rater reliability was calculated. Resumes with qualifications of associate degree versus military training as a BMET were compared at three levels of work experience. A chi-square test for independence was <b>conducted</b> for <b>the</b> <b>comparisons</b> <b>to</b> determine whether work experience influenced preference. Chi-square tests were also conducted for comparisons of associate degree with candidacy for CBET certification versus associate degree and military training with CBET candidacy versus military training. No statistically significant results were found for the chi-square tests, indicating that work experience did not significantly influence participant preferences for the compared qualifications. BMET hiring managers indicated a preference for combinations of qualifications rather than any single qualification. Correlations in hiring managers' educational background, certification status, military training as a BMET, type of employer, and preference for applicant qualifications were examined. Statistically significant correlations were found between participants' preference for associate degree or military training and level of education, military training background, and type of employer. Statistically significant correlations were also found between participants' preference of military training with CBET candidacy over military training alone and military training as a BMET background as well as certification background...|$|R
40|$|To {{screen for}} {{potential}} efficacy and assess feasibility {{and safety of}} dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) {{as a treatment for}} Sjögren's syndrome (SS). A 24 -week randomized, double-blinded, pilot trial of oral DHEA (200 mg/day) versus placebo was <b>conducted.</b> <b>The</b> primary <b>comparison</b> was <b>to</b> a hypothesized 20 % placebo response rate. If 14 consecutive subjects on DHEA did not respond, a Phase III trial would be considered futile. A placebo group of 14 subjects was planned to verify placebo response rate and estimate sample size required for a definitive trial. Response criteria required 20 % improvement in at least 2 of 3 domains. Analysis of covariance was used to adjust for baseline differences and for stratified randomization. Outcome measures included visual analog scale questionnaires for dry eye and dry mouth symptoms, lissamine green ocular dye staining and Schirmer I tests, stimulated salivary flow, IgG, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Randomization resulted in 14 DHEA and 14 placebo group subjects. At baseline, mean +/- SD for DHEA versus placebo groups were Schirmer I tests 4. 5 +/- 4. 5 versus 5. 4 +/- 6. 1 mm/ 5 minutes; Van Bijsterveld score 5. 3 +/- 2. 1 versus 5. 5 +/- 2. 2; unstimulated saliva 0. 03 +/- 0. 05 versus 0. 04 +/- 0. 10 ml/minute; IgG 1, 699 +/- 749 versus 1, 712 +/- 621 g/dl; and ESR 40 +/- 31 versus 44 +/- 28 mm/hour. Apart from changes over the trial in dry mouth symptoms, no significant differences were noted between the DHEA and placebo groups for dry eye symptoms, objective measures of ocular dryness, stimulated salivary flow; IgG, or ESR. Four DHEA and one placebo group patient dropped out because of adverse effects. Although 7 subjects met response criteria in the DHEA group, 5 met the criteria in the placebo group, and {{there was no significant difference}} between groups. DHEA showed no evidence of efficacy in SS. Without evidence for efficacy, patients with SS should avoid using unregulated DHEA supplements, since long-term adverse consequences of exposure to this hormone are unknow...|$|R
40|$|The ratio {{method of}} {{estimation}} in sample surveys {{involves the use of}} estimators for population parameters which are linear functions of the ratio of dependent random variables. Only large sample approximations for the bias and sampling variance are available for measuring the accuracy of ratio estimators. This study is concerned with three aspects of the properties of ratio estimators as they are used in sample surveys;First, using a theorem of Cramer, regarding the asymptotic distribution of functions of sample moments for random samples from joint continuous distributions f(x,y) having finite first and second moments, {{it was found that the}} ratio of the sample means was asymptotically normally distributed with mean equal to the ratio of the true means and variance given by the usual approximate formula. It is noted that the argument of Fisher for obtaining interval statements about the true quantity can be used, if the t distribution can be assumed to hold for samples from finite populations. This assumption is probably fairly realistic;Second, exact expressions for the bias and variance of ratio estimators have been obtained under various assumptions regarding the joint distribution of the variables sampled. In particular these assumptions restricted the types of regression and conditional variance relationships exhibited by f(x,y). For the variance laws considered and the mean square regression of y on x linear, it was found that exact expressions for the bias and variance of ratio estimators depend on the existence of the first and second moments of the distribution of the reciprocal of the sample mean of the denominator variable. The usual approximate formula for the variance was then compared with the exact expressions when f(x) followed the Pearson Type III and the truncated binomial distributions. For these distributions and whenever the regression and variance relationships considered prevail, the sample size required to achieve reasonable accuracy with the approximate variance formula depends on the magnitude of the coefficient of variation of the denominator variable of the ratio estimator. The larger this coefficient the slower is the convergence of the approximation to the exact variance expression;Third, a systematic <b>comparison</b> of <b>the</b> ratio estimator with other possible methods of estimation using the information available on a supplementary variable was <b>conducted.</b> <b>The</b> <b>comparison</b> was restricted <b>to</b> situations in which specific conditions on the form of the regression and on the residual variance law were satisfied by the joint distribution of the variables involved. The ratio {{method of estimation}}, as a general method of estimation, was found to compare favorably...|$|R
