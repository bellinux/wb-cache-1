5|$|Seton Hall {{announced}} {{the formation of}} two additional academic units in 2015 – the School of Medicine and the College of Communication and the Arts. The medical school, {{which is expected to}} open in 2017 in partnership with Hackensack University Health Network, will be one of six Catholic medical schools in the United States and should address a shortage of primary <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> in New Jersey and the surrounding region. The College of Communication and the Arts was a department in the College of Arts and Sciences before being elevated in the summer of 2015.|$|E
5|$|There are 89hospitals in Virginia listed {{with the}} United States Department of Health and Human Services. Notable {{examples}} include Inova Fairfax Hospital, the largest {{hospital in the}} Washington Metropolitan Area, and the VCU Medical Center, located on the medical campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. The University of Virginia Medical Center, part of the University of Virginia Health System, is highly ranked in endocrinology according to U.S.News & World Report. Virginia has a ratio of 127 primary <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> per 10,000 residents, which is the 16th highest nationally. Virginia was one of five states to receive a perfect score in disaster preparedness according to a 2008 report by the Trust for America's Health, based on criteria such as detecting pathogens and distributing vaccines and medical supplies.|$|E

30|$|The primary <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> {{may not be}} {{familiar}} {{with some of the}} radiological terminology and a clear decisive report is important. The reporting style may need to be modified accordingly. In some countries the patient has direct access to the report transmitted to the primary <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> which means that technical and clinical explanations must be included in the report as well as clear conclusions and advice for strategy. In certain systems the primary <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> has limited access to the images and, therefore, relies on the report {{to a greater extent than}} specialist colleagues. This may, however, change with internet access to digital images.|$|R
25|$|Levomepromazine is {{frequently}} prescribed and valued worldwide in palliative care medicine for its multimodal action, to treat intractable nausea or vomiting, and for severe delirium/agitation {{in the last}} days of life.

25|$|There is {{currently}} a shortage of primary <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> (and also other primary care providers) due to several factors, notably the lesser prestige associated with the young specialty, the lower pay, and the increasingly frustrating practice environment.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the association between}} ex-prisoner primary <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> contact within 1 month of prison release and health service utilisation in the 6 months following release. Design: A cohort from the Passports study with a mean follow-up of 219 (± 44) days postrelease. Associations were assessed using a multivariate Andersen-Gill model, controlling {{for a range of}} other factors. Setting: Face-to-face, baseline interviews were conducted in a sample of prisoners within 6 weeks of expected release from seven prisons in Queensland, Australia, from 2008 to 2010, with telephone follow-up interviews 1, 3 and 6 months postrelease. Participants: From an original population-based sample of 1325 sentenced adult (≥ 18 years) prisoners, 478 participants were excluded due to not being released from prison during follow-up (n= 7, 0. 5 %), loss to follow-up (n= 257, 19. 4 %), or lacking exposure data (n= 214, 16. 2 %). A total of 847 (63. 9 %) participants were included in the analyses. Exposure: Primary <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> contact within 1 month of follow-up as a dichotomous measure. Main outcome measures: Adjusted time-to-event hazard rates for hospital, mental health, alcohol and other drug and subsequent primary <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> service utilisations assessed as multiple failure timeinterval data. Results: Primary <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> contact prevalence within 1 month of follow-up was 46. 5 %. One-month primary <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> contact was positively associated with hospital (adjusted HR (AHR) = 2. 07; 95 % CI 1. 39 to 3. 09), mental health (AHR= 1. 65; 95 % CI 1. 24 to 2. 19), alcohol and other drug (AHR= 1. 48; 95 % CI 1. 15 to 1. 90) and subsequent primary <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> service utilisation (AHR= 1. 47; 95 % CI 1. 26 to 1. 72) over 6 months of follow-up. Conclusions: Engagement with primary <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> services soon after prison release increases health service utilisation during the critical community transition period for ex-prisoners.

25|$|To provide {{culturally}} sensitive patient-centered <b>care,</b> <b>physicians</b> should treat each patient as an individual, recognizing and respecting {{his or her}} beliefs, values and care seeking behaviors.

25|$|However, as of 2004, {{according}} to the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association (CHPCA), hospice palliative care was only available to 5-15% of Canadians, with available services having decreased with reduced government funding. At that time, Canadians were increasingly expressing a desire to die at home, but only two of Canada's ten provinces were provided medication cost coverage for care provided at home. Only four of the ten identified palliative care as a core health service. At that time, palliative care was not widely taught at nursing schools or universally certified at medical colleges; there were only 175 specialized palliative <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> in all of Canada.|$|E
25|$|Article 13 of the Law of Cohesion regulates {{characteristics}} {{of health care}} offered in Spain by medical specialists, which is provided {{at the request of}} primary <b>care</b> <b>physicians.</b> This may be in-patient hospital care or out-patient consultation at specialist centers or day hospitals. It includes care, diagnosis, therapy, rehabilitation and certain preventive care, as well as health promotion, health education and prevention of illness whose nature makes it appropriate to handle at this level. Specialized care guarantees the continuity of integrated patient care once the capabilities of primary care have been exhausted and until matters can be returned to that level. Insofar as patient condition allows, specialized care is offered in out-patient consultation and in day hospitals. As of 2010, Spain recognizes fifty distinct medical specialties.|$|E
