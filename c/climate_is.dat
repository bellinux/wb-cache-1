5|$|A region's <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> {{generated}} by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere.|$|E
5|$|An oceanic (or maritime) <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} found {{along the west}} coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. A steppe is a dry grassland. Subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.|$|E
5000|$|In the Köppen climate system, polar <b>climates</b> <b>are</b> {{defined as}} the warmest {{temperature}} of any month is below 10 C (50 F). Polar <b>climates</b> <b>are</b> further divided into two types, tundra climates and icecap climates: ...|$|R
50|$|Throughout the Ancestral Puebloan {{cultural}} eras {{the most}} important resource was water. In the lowlands the <b>climate</b> <b>was</b> an arid land of juniper and sage. At about 6000 ft in elevation the <b>climate</b> <b>was</b> a moister land of pinyon trees.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} vegetation of Mediterranean <b>climates</b> <b>are</b> the garrigue in the Mediterranean Basin, the chaparral in California, the fynbos in South Africa and the Chilean scrubland in Chile.

5|$|Its <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> cold, dry {{and very}} sunny, {{with high levels}} of {{ultraviolet}} radiation. Licancabur is not covered by glaciers, and vegetation such as cushion plants and shrubs are found lower on its slopes. Chinchillas were formerly hunted on the volcano.|$|E

50|$|Stirellus bicolor is {{a species}} of {{leafhopper}} native to North America. Two color forms are known. Adults found during the summer in hot <b>climates</b> <b>are</b> typically iridescent with prominent black stripes. Specimens in cooler <b>climates</b> <b>are</b> drab with translucent wings. The two varieties were originally thought to be separate species.|$|R
5|$|Minnesota's winters are {{the setting}} of several {{television}} programs and Hollywood films, including the 1996 film Fargo which features the backdrop of a Minnesota winter, but {{like most of the}} characters in the movie, the <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> portrayed as bleak and inhospitable.|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the role of}} parental behaviors on sport performance anxiety. Measures of trait anxiety, parental pressure, and parent-initiated motivational <b>climate</b> <b>were</b> administered to youth swimmers throughout the season. High parental pressure within either a low mastery or a high ego motivational <b>climate</b> <b>was</b> associated with {{the highest levels of}} anxiety at all time points. An early-season, high-pressure/low-mastery combination was also associated with relative increases in anxiety over the season, whereas high pressure within a high mastery <b>climate</b> <b>was</b> associated with relative decreases. Results indicate that parental pressure can have differential effects depending upon motivational climate...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this survey was to {{describe}} the democratic atmosphere of classrooms of the schools applying school-based management. Questionnaires were distributed to 116 teachers and 1511 students of 16 primary schools. The results show that (1) the democratic <b>climate</b> <b>was</b> of moderate level, (2) more variation of democratic <b>climate</b> <b>was</b> found at the student level than at the school level, (3) factors influencing such a <b>climate</b> <b>were</b> students gender, parents level of education, family learning support, teachers gender, teachers level of education and teaching experience, and (4) schools applying school-based management outperformed compared to those not applying it...|$|R

5|$|Aberdaron {{is noted}} for {{low levels of}} air pollution. The Gwynedd State of the Environment Report in 2004 found levels of sulfur dioxide, {{nitrogen}} dioxide and carbon monoxide very low, and particulates to be low. It {{is one of the}} few sites in the United Kingdom for golden hair lichen, a striking bright orange lichen that is very sensitive to air pollution. The <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> relatively mild and, because of the Gulf Stream, frosts are rare in winter.|$|E
5|$|As part of Romblon, Banton is {{classified}} under Type III of the Corona climatic classification system. This type of <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> {{described as having}} no prominent wet or dry seasons. The wet season, which usually occurs from June to November can extend up to December during {{the onset of the}} southwest monsoon. The dry season from January to May may sometimes have periods of rainfall or even inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{territorial}} on {{the breeding}} grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs {{stay in their}} territory throughout the year where the <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently temperate.

40|$|A {{field study}} and an {{experimental}} study examined relationships among organizational variables and various responses of victims to perceived wrongdoing. Both {{studies showed that}} procedural justice climate moderates the effect of organizational variables on the victim’s revenge, forgiveness, reconcil-iation, or avoidance behaviors. In Study 1, a field study, absolute hierarchical status enhanced forgiveness and reconciliation, but only when perceptions of procedural justice <b>climate</b> <b>were</b> high; relative hierar-chical status increased revenge, but only when perceptions of procedural justice <b>climate</b> <b>were</b> low.

40|$|The {{effects of}} both peer-created and coach-created motivational climate on team {{cohesion}} was studied {{in a sample}} of 136 youth athletes. Task-involving aspects of both peer-and coach-created motivational <b>climates</b> <b>were</b> found to be positively related to team cohesion. Coach-created ego-involving <b>climate</b> <b>was</b> negatively related to team cohesion, most significantly attraction to group-task (ATG-T) cohesion. Peer-created ego-involving motivational <b>climate</b> <b>was</b> significantly, negatively related to group integration-task (GI-T) cohesion. Peer-created motivational climate accounted for variance above and beyond the influence of coach-created motivational climate on team cohesion.

5|$|Buenos Aires {{is located}} in the humid {{subtropical}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). Due to the maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, its <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> temperate with extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) being rare. Thus, cold air coming directly from the south are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and warmer than winds from the southwest (which are not moderated by it).|$|E
5|$|<b>Climate</b> <b>is</b> {{a measure}} of the {{long-term}} trends in the weather. Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.|$|E
5|$|<b>Climate</b> <b>is</b> the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|E
