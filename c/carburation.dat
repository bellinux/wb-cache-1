The new three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission with torque converter replaced the Roto HydraMatic used since 1961. Also new to the option list for 1965 on all B-body cars was a four-speed manual transmission with Hurst floor shifter, which was a seldom-ordered offering.|$|E
25|$|Air Marshal Sholto Douglas {{expressed}} {{concerns that the}} Merlin-engine Spitfires were coming {{to the end of}} their developmental life, whereas the Fw 190 was only just beginning its career. At the time, he feared the enemy held the technological edge. Douglas determined that the Fw 190 was superior to the Spitfire V and also concluded that the Spitfire IX was also inferior in the climb and acceleration owing to negative G <b>carburation.</b> Douglas' fears would prove overly-pessimistic. The Spitfire IX would prove a clear match for the Fw 190A and the Griffon-engined Spitfire XIV would hold the edge on the type. In 1942 several tests were conducted by RAF pilots at the Royal Aircraft Establishment.|$|E
25|$|Born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, Amm was a {{motorcycle}} dealer and managed a workshop in his hometown. He began racing {{when he was}} 17years old. After the purchase of an AJS motorcycle shortly {{after the end of}} the Second World War, Amm started grasstrack racing near Salisbury and finished last in his first race. The next season the AJS motorcycle was replaced with a Triumph motorcycle. The purchase of a brand new Norton motorcycle allowed Amm to enter the prestigious 1949 Port Elizabeth 200 Motor-Cycle Race in South Africa and despite breaking the lap-record he finished in 17th place when the clutch started to slip. Again entering the 1950 Port Elizabeth 200, Amm finished in 1st place for the 500cc race and set a new lap record of 95.86mph. Another win followed in the 500cc class for the 1951 Port Elizabeth 2000 Race despite suffering <b>carburation</b> problems. After these successes the Salisbury Motor-Cycle Club helped with his passage to compete in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Wankel engines run {{very hot}} on the {{ignition}} and exhaust side of the engine's trochoid chamber, whereas the intake and compression parts are cooler. Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water cooling system, with Garside reasoning that provided the power did not exceed , air-cooling would suffice. Garside cooled {{the interior of the}} rotors with filtered ram-air. This very hot air was cooled in a plenum contained within the semi-monocoque frame and afterwards, once mixed with fuel, fed into the engine. This air was quite oily after running through the interior of the rotors, and thus was used to lubricate the rotor tips. The exhaust pipes become very hot, with Suzuki opting for a finned exhaust manifold, twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings and silencers with heat shields. Garside simply tucked the pipes out of harm's way under the engine, where heat would dissipate in the breeze of the vehicle's forward motion. Suzuki opted for complicated multi-stage <b>carburation,</b> whilst Garside choose simple carburetors. Suzuki had three lube systems, whilst Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system which was fed to both the main bearings and the intake manifolds. Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth, however with rough patches at 4,000rpm; Garside opted for a turbine-smooth twin-rotor motor. Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame, but Garside put his rotors as low as possible to lower the center of gravity of the motorcycle.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike races {{such as the}} TT Formulae, or Moto-Cross, {{where two}} and four strokes had {{different}} engine size limits in the same class, until 2002 GP racing set the upper limit the same for both types of engines in all its classes. After that, MotoGP gave the four-strokes a 490cc advantage over the two-strokes. A 2 stroke engine produces power with every rotation of the crank, where as the 4 stroke engine produces power every second rotation. In theory, a 500cc 2stroke produces the same power as a 1000cc 4 stroke, however there are many {{differences between the two}} configurations. <b>Carburation</b> vs fuel injection, engine mapping, power/torque curves, and throttle response are a few major differences.|$|E

2500|$|Lambert {{stopped the}} work {{at this stage of}} {{fabrication}} and shipped the non-working engine and incomplete automobile to a small machine shop that he owned in Ohio City. This way he could then devote his personal attention to the engine and automobile when he could from his businesses he was running there. The automobile consisted of two clutches and two chains, which were connected to a jack shaft. The two clutches gave two speeds forward and there was no reverse speed used. The single front wheel of the tricycle designed automobile was steered by a foot lever and a hand lever. This direct steering method provided that the arms could be rested and the steering done by the feet, and vice versa. One item that needed to be solved for completion and a working engine was a means of <b>carburation.</b> Lambert heard of a means of vaporizing gasoline by Gottlieb Daimler of Germany. He went to New York to see the engine that was operating a boat. After seeing this complicated carburetor Lambert developed what he called the [...] "vaporizer." [...] This was a simpler carburetor than Daimler's, which he was then able to get the engine working the way he intended it to. The automobile was completed soon after he had it Ohio City.|$|E

50|$|William Boddy of Motor Sport {{commented that}} the {{difficulty}} with sleeve valves was lubrication.

Attempts to tow-start invariably led to sleeve-driving link breakage if not damage to the sleeves. There was also difficulty in timing the sleeves once pistons had been out of the block and also synchronising <b>carburation</b> and ignition between the two banks of cylinders.|$|E

Six were re-engined with Cadillac Eldorado V-8 units; one of these was reportedly raced.|$|E
5000|$|A {{carburetor}} (American English) or carburettor (British English; see spelling differences) is {{a device}} that blends air and fuel for an internal combustion engine in the proper ratio for combustion. It is sometimes colloquially shortened to carb in the UK and North America or carby in Australia. To carburate or carburet (and thus <b>carburation</b> or carburetion, respectively) is to blend the air and fuel or to equip (an engine) with a carburetor for that purpose. A buret or burette is equipment for measuring liquids accurately.|$|E
50|$|Wankel engines run very hot, so Garside {{gave this}} {{air-cooled}} motor additional interior air-cooling. Air was drawn through a forward-facing filter situated {{to provide a}} ram air effect. This air was channelled initially to the rotating 'crankshaft', through {{the interior of the}} two rotors, then entered a large pressed-steel plenum before entering the combustion chambers via twin carburettors. The plenum (which doubled as the bike's semi-monocoque frame) enabled the transfer of much of the heat to the surrounding atmosphere. The <b>carburation</b> process further reduced temperatures via the heat of evaporation.|$|E
50|$|The {{negative}} {{reaction to the}} Standard Scout {{and the failure of}} the Motoplane {{led to the creation of}} the Sport Scout of 1934, with a light frame, girder forks, improved <b>carburation</b> and alloy cylinder heads.

5000|$|In the film, Mitchum drove a souped-up black 1951 Ford two-door sedan (which {{was later}} repainted gray) with a custom tank {{in the back}} for moonshine liquor and a Ford V8 with three two barrel carburators but after a run in with the law, it was sold and {{replaced}} with a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500 two-door sedan with the same alterations excluding the engine <b>carburation.</b> The 1951 Ford was modified with a 1949 hood and 1950 grill and front bumper {{as well as the}} rear 1951 taillight chrome trim removed and 1949/1950 taillights installed.|$|E
50|$|The Lancia {{engineers}} made {{changes to}} the engines fitted to the Beta range.

In addition the mounting points on the engine block were different so as {{to allow for the}} transverse installation as opposed to the longitudinal installation utilised by the rear-wheel-drive Fiats. For these reasons the engines are not interchangeable between Betas and contemporary Fiats such as the Fiat 132.|$|E
