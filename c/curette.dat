2500|$|Following any biopsies, an endocervical {{curettage}} (ECC) {{is often}} done. The ECC utilizes a long straight <b>curette,</b> a Soft-ECC <b>curette</b> employing fabric to simultaneously collect tissue or a cytobrush (like a small pipe-cleaner) to scrape {{the inside of}} the cervical canal. The ECC should never be done on a patient who is pregnant. Monsel's solution is applied with large cotton [...] {{to the surface of the}} cervix to control bleeding. This solution looks like mustard and turns black when exposed to blood.

40|$|Although root {{instrumentation}} {{has been}} accepted {{as the most important}} cause-related treatment of periodontal diseases, repeated scaling and root planing may over time result in substantive loss of tooth substance and increased sensitivity of the teeth. In an effort to minimize these side effects of therapy, non-root substance removing <b>curettes</b> have been developed. However, the clinical effects of such plastic <b>curettes</b> with regard to the control of the periodontal infection has not yet been established. The aims of this study were, therefore, to compare the effects of root instrumentation using plastic <b>curettes</b> (Universal Perio Soft Sealer®, Hawe-Neos Dental, Bioggio, TI, Switzerland) versus conventional steel <b>curettes</b> on the periodontal conditions during supportive periodontal therapy. 40 subjects participated in this parallel, randomized, double blind, prospective longitudinal clinical study following active peridontal therapy. 20 subjects served as a control group and were treated with conventional steel <b>curettes</b> during a supportive periodontal care visit (SPT). The other 20 subjects, the experimental group, were treated using plastic <b>curettes</b> during a similar SPT visit. Clinical parameters, such as bleeding on probing (BOP) and probing pocket depth (PPD), were assessed at baseline and 3 - 6 months later at the next regular SPT visit. In addition, the BOP percentage was determined 10 days following baseline. The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment modalities regarding BOP and PPD at any observation time. Both treatments were effective in reducing the BOP percentage which ranged from 17 - 42 % at baseline by about 40 % after 10 days (mean BOP baseline: 26 %, mean BOP after 10 days: 16 %). This clinical study suggests that non-root substance removing <b>curettes</b> may be valuable instruments for periodontally treated patients during maintenance care, thus minimizing trauma on the hard structures of the teeth. © Munksgaard 1999. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Ten samples from each group were used for analysis of root morphology and the other 10 were used for analysis of adhesion of blood components on root surface.

No statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) among groups were found as to the adhesion of blood components on root surface.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the surface scratch resistance of titanium implant abutments and cementum to evaluate the impact of scaling with metal <b>curettes</b> on both surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A standard in vitro force of 14 N was used to assess the scratch width and depth created by <b>curettes</b> on extracted human tooth roots and titanium implant abutments. Scratch width and depth were analysed using a stereomicroscope and non-contact surface profilometry. RESULTS: The mean force applied during test scaling procedures by experienced volunteer operators was 14 N. Mechanical scaling using this force in vitro of cementum produced a mean scratch width of 59. 4 [*]±[*] 1. 9 μm, N[*]=[*] 20, and scratch depth of 0. 86 [*]±[*] 0. 03 μm, N[*]=[*] 20, compared to the titanium abutments' mean scratch width of 30. 8 [*]±[*] 1. 9 μm, N[*]=[*] 6, and scratch depth of 0. 34 [*]±[*] 0. 02 μm, N[*]=[*] 6. These differences were statistically significant (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Although there a number of factors in the clinical situation which are not easily reproducible in vitro, this proof-of-principle in vitro study is the first to confirm quantitatively that titanium abutments had a significantly greater scratch resistance than cementum when metal <b>curettes</b> were used on these surfaces. This information should be considered, especially if there is a preferred choice of metal instruments for effective dental prophylactic procedures for the maintenance of titanium dental implants. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinical dogma suggests that titanium implant abutment surfaces should not be instrumented with metal instruments due to scratching of the surface. However, since cementum is softer than titanium, the logic of this tenet seems flawed. This study demonstrated {{for the first time that}} titanium abutments undergo less scratch damage during scaling with metal <b>curettes</b> than does cementum. Metal <b>curettes</b> may be used on titanium abutments with as much confidence as for root planing on natural teeth. P. M. Anastassiadi, C. Hall, V. Marino, P. M. Bartol...|$|R
