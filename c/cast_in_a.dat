5|$|During the Palladian revival {{period in}} Ireland, even quite modest mansions were <b>cast</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> neo-Palladian mould. Palladian {{architecture}} in Ireland subtly {{differs from that}} in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – perhaps because it was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium {{was used}} by the Manhattan Project as a neutron reflector, and as a {{component}} of modulated neutron initiators. Only one firm produced it commercially in the United States, Brush Beryllium in Lorain, Ohio. The Ames Project began working on a production process in December 1943, reducing beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic magnesium and a sulphur booster. The main difficulty with working with beryllium was its high toxicity. A closed bomb was used to minimize the possibility of producing toxic beryllium dust. The process worked, but the high temperatures and pressures created by the magnesium sulphide meant that it was potentially explosive. An alternative was then developed using beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic calcium and a lead chloride booster. The metal was <b>cast</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vacuum. Research was still ongoing when the war ended.|$|E
