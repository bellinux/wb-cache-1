25|$|Three {{conditions}} must {{be present}} for oil reservoirs to form: a source rock rich in hydrocarbon material buried deep enough for subterranean heat {{to cook it}} into oil, a porous and permeable reservoir rock for it to accumulate in, and a <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> (seal) or other mechanism that prevents it from escaping to the surface. Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake {{with a layer of}} water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as reservoirs) by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an oil field forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.|$|E
2500|$|The last {{event that}} may have been a factor was that Nolan took command on July 6 of Fort Concho. Grierson had to go east to attend urgent family duties. Almost {{immediately}} came orders for the command to go after the Indian raiders. Nolan had already sent C Troop out, so he then went out with A Troop, leaving only one officer and sixteen men at Fort Concho. [...] Now en route north-eastward along the <b>cap</b> <b>rock,</b> Nolan encountered a former scout who reported over 100 Comanche on the Llano Estacado near the head of the North Concho River with a large herd of horses and other stock. That was to be Nolan's goal.|$|E
30|$|Despite {{the absence}} of {{regional}} <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Lower Paleozoic for the entire Tazhong Low Rise, several sets of effective local <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> are well preserved on the Northern Slope. Of these the best is the Ordovician mudstone of the Sangtamu Formation; {{the second is the}} Silurian Red Mudstone Member of the Tatairtag Formation and the marl of the Ordovician Lianglitag Formation; and the third is the gray mudstone of the Silurian Kepingtag Formation. The dense limestone of the Ordovician Yingshan Formation and the gypsum of the Middle Cambrian have shown initial sealing capacity. These effective <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> are closely related to the distribution of Lower Palaeozoic hydrocarbons in the Tazhong Low Rise. With well-preserved Sangtamu Formation mudstone and its location close to migration pathways, rich Lower Paleozoic hydrocarbon accumulation {{can be found on the}} Northern Slope. Vertically, most of the reserves are distributed below the Sangtamu Formation mudstone; areally, hydrocarbons are mainly found in the areas with well-developed Sangtamu Formation mudstone and Lianglitag Formation marl. Burial history and hydrocarbon charging history show that the evolution of Lower Palaeozoic <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> controlled the accumulation of hydrocarbon in the Tazhong Low Rise. Take the Red Mudstone Member of the Tatairtag Formation and Sangtamu Formation mudstone for examples: 1) In the hydrocarbon charging time of the Late Caledonian — Early Hercynian, with top surfaces at burial depths of over 1, 100 m, the <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> were able to seal oil and gas; 2) During the intense uplifting of the Devonian, the <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> with top surfaces at burial depths of 200 – 800 m and 500 – 1, 100 m respectively were denuded in local areas, thus hydrocarbons trapped in earlier time were degraded to widespread bitumen; 3) In the hydrocarbon charging time of the Late Hercynian and Himalayan, the top surfaces of the <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> were at burial depths of over 2, 000 m without intense uplifting and denudation thereafter, so trapped hydrocarbons were preserved. Based on <b>cap</b> <b>rocks,</b> the Ordovician Penglaiba Formation and Lower Cambrian dolomite could be potential targets for exploration on the Tazhong Northern Slope, and combined with hydrocarbon migration, less risk would be involved.|$|R
30|$|The greater {{heat flow}} in rift-related {{sedimentary}} basins enhances rapid {{transformation of the}} organic matter, and the high seismic activity enables the migration of newly formed liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. However, the active rift regime {{is not good for}} the formation of strong <b>cap</b> <b>rocks,</b> which is detrimental to the formation of major oil and gas fields. Conditions favorable for the generation of strong <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> only arise during the fading stages of rift orogenesis, conditions like those on the eastern African shelf and the South Caspian basin today. In both those locations, regional <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> can be formed. In addition, roof structures there are good for the accumulation of hydrocarbons, and rift-related tectonic activity is minor.|$|R

2500|$|About 20,000 years ago, {{the area}} was covered by the Superior Lobe of the Laurentide ice sheet, which left the St. Croix moraine on the Twin Cities as it receded. [...] Later the Grantsburg Sublobe of the Des Moines Lobe also covered the area. These thick layers of ice cut through the Platteville {{limestone}} <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> with tremendous force, forming tunnel valleys, and released glacial meltwater. The result {{was a series of}} troughs in the limestone, which were filled by glacial till and outwash deposit as the glaciers receded. [...] Sometimes the sediment would be mixed with huge chunks of ice, which would leave voids, or kettles, in the soil. These kettles later filled with water and became Lake Como and Lake Phalen.|$|E
2500|$|Allsup loaded a wagon with {{supplies}} and barrels of water. With fifteen men he proceeded {{and climbed the}} <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> and went straight to Doubles Lakes and on August 4 he had a happy reunion with Nolan and his men. Allsup reported that Umbles had arrived at Bull Creek, and related what he had said. Several other soldiers {{who had been with}} Umbles told what had happened over the last few days. [...] Nolan and Cooper began to realize that their problems were not over. Men had deserted and would have to be dealt with. [...] Nolan wrote a message and sent it toward Fort Concho with two riders. The message was a general condition of his command and a warning to distrust anything Umbles and the men with him had to say.|$|E
2500|$|Nolan {{had left}} Fort Concho on July 10, 1877 {{with a force}} of 63 {{officers}} and men for a scout on the Staked Plains. They were looking for Mescalero Apache and Comanche who were out raiding. Nolan's route took him past the Llano's eastern rugged <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> northwest toward Bull Creek. [...] Nolan was following a route he had followed northwest in 1875. During that scout he had followed an Indian trail into the Llano Estacado region until the trail grew cold and he turned back. He had been threatened with court-martial {{because he was not}} aggressive enough on that scout. Cooler heads prevailed, but Nolan had been deeply shamed by the event. [...] His future patrolling was considered aggressive and the 1877 scout into the area was going to be no exception.|$|E

30|$|The {{onset of}} oil {{expulsion}} in the studied source rocks was after deposition of related <b>cap</b> <b>rocks,</b> {{which allows the}} accumulation of generated hydrocarbons in the available reservoirs.|$|R
30|$|Among {{the factors}} that {{controlled}} the formation and distribution of the PLP giant oil and gas fields, the size and hydrocarbon generation potential of the hydrocarbon source rocks determines the quantity of hydrocarbon generated in petroliferous basins; the sealing ability of regional <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> after oil and gas accumulation {{and the ability to}} maintain the sealing ability determine the amount of oil and gas accumulation. Therefore, the effective development of source <b>rocks</b> and <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> facilitates the development of giant oil and gas fields, where hydrocarbon is controlled by source and <b>cap</b> <b>rocks.</b> Paleo-uplifts and slopes are favorable tectonic belt structures for the large-scale accumulation of oil and gas; specifically, these structures control hydrocarbon accumulation. The development of high-quality reservoirs determines the specific sites for oil and gas reservoirs and also controls the reservoirs. Therefore, by analyzing the controlling factors at these three levels, it is possible to make a meaningful prediction for favorable areas in PLP oil and gas exploration.|$|R
2500|$|Nolan and Harvey {{combined}} commands made a dry camp on {{the evening}} of July 19. This was where Nolan discovered the lack of water rationing of his men.

30|$|The main {{factors that}} control the {{formation}} and distribution of the ancient marine carbonate giant oil and gas fields are large-scale efficient hydrocarbon kitchens, favorable hydrocarbon accumulation zones, large-scale high-quality reservoirs, and large areas of high-quality <b>cap</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R
30|$|The highest {{concentrations}} {{of oil and}} gas should be expected to be formed after the second accumulation of hydrocarbons, accumulations that form after the covering of rift-related sediments by later marine deposits. These large concentrations are formed by regionally distributed reservoirs and <b>cap</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R
25|$|These {{hydrocarbon}} deposits, {{collected in}} porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable <b>cap</b> <b>rocks,</b> comprise commercial oil fields.

40|$|Abstract. The Afghan-Tajik Basin is an intermontane {{depression}} {{between the}} mountain ranges of Gissar and Pamirs, and Jurassic system and Tertiary system {{are rich in}} large oil & gas resources. In order to assure sustainable supply of oil & gas from Central Asia, we deeply researched hydrocarbon geology characteristics and resource potentials. The basin belongs to paralic sedimentary environment, and develops 3 sedimentary strata: Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary. Afghan-Tajik Basin develops 3 main source rocks including clastic rocks of Jurassic, carbonate rocks of Cretaceous and mudstone rocks of Eocene. The basin develops 2 plays: Jurassic-Cretaceous play is gas containing one, and Tertiary play is oil containing one. Plaster stone and salt rock of upper Jurassic are regional <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> of Jurassic-Cretaceous gas pool, and creaming mudstone and muddy limestone of Cretaceous and Tertiary are regional or partial <b>cap</b> <b>rocks.</b> Migration and accumulation of hydrocarbon occur in the late Cretaceous and early Pliocene epoch. Afghan-Tajik Basin has larger exploration potentials, and residual resources are 2. 4 × 108 t. The potential zones are as follows, south part of basin, oil-gas structures of post-salt, reef limestone of pre-salt, and litho-stratigraphic traps...|$|R
40|$|Bathymetric and {{conventional}} multichannel seismic surveys offshore Nicaragua and Costa Rica have revealed numerous mud mounds beneath which the generally widespread BSR {{is not well}} imaged. However, many of the mounds are partially capped by patches of authigenic carbonate crusts, {{so it was not}} clear if the semitransparent seismic facies and the apparent gaps in the BSR beneath the mounds are real or due to poor normal-incidence seismic penetration through the <b>cap</b> <b>rocks.</b> To address these problems, a high-resolution seismic survey was carried out over the continental slope of the Nicaraguan Pacific margin using a deep towed multichannel seismic streamer (DTMCS) along with a sidescan sonar system (DTS) to image submarine mud mounds and the associated BSR. The proximity of the very short (39 m active length) but high-resolution 17 channel streamer to the seafloor of the deep towed system allows greatly improved lateral resolution whereas the relatively large sourcereceiver offset allows the undershooting of the <b>cap</b> <b>rocks.</b> For the first time our data show that the BSR in many cases continues but rises beneath the mounds. This is consistent with the advection of deep warm fluids and thus increased heat flow through the mounds. The occurrence of mud mounds seems to be controlled by the locations of faults...|$|R
