5|$|Models of how Siletzia formed are of {{two general}} types: (1) Formation well {{offshore}} (possibly as seamounts, like the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, or a hotspot at a spreading ridge, like Iceland) and then accretion to the continent; (2) formation inshore, {{on or near}} the <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> (perhaps as a result of transcurrent extension, or of a slab window).

5|$|Texas is {{the southernmost}} {{part of the}} Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. The {{continental}} crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico.

5|$|Wells, et al., {{alternately}} {{suggested that}} as a terrane at {{the margin of the}} continent was pushed over the Yellowstone hotspot, it was rifted away from the continent by the upwelling magma, which then formed the Siletzia basalts. This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction, or by kinematic effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the <b>continental</b> <b>margin.</b> One such effect is the formation of a slab window (or slab gap) which would allow increased upwelling of magma.|$|E
5|$|Together with Mount Adams, Mount Rainier, and Mount St. Helens, the Goat Rocks volcano {{is part of}} a {{triangle}} of volcanoes, an arrangement not found elsewhere in the Cascades. This may be related to a mid-crust zone with abnormally high electrical conductivity, the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC), which is not well understood by geologists. Scientists from the United States Geodynamics Committee hypothesized in 1994 that this anomaly is associated with the thrust of a large deposit of sedimentary rock against a <b>continental</b> <b>margin.</b> However, Hill et al. (2009) dismiss this view as it proves inconsistent with maps made from magnetotelluric readings of the area. Instead, they propose that the anomaly is linked to the region's volcanism, which has caused partial melting of the crust.|$|E

5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of {{topographical}} features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in the Idaho Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away. Geodetic surveys show that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E
25|$|The Farallon Plate {{continued}} to subduct {{under the new}} <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> of Western Canada after the Insular Plate and Insular Islands collided with the former <b>continental</b> <b>margin,</b> supporting a new chain of volcanoes on the mainland of Western Canada called the Coast Range Arc about 100million years ago during the Late Cretaceous epoch. Magma ascending from the Farallon Plate under the new <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> burned their way upward through the newly accreted Insular Belt, injecting huge quantities of granite into older igneous rocks of the Insular Belt. At the surface, new volcanoes were built along the <b>continental</b> <b>margin.</b> The basement of this arc was likely Early Cretaceous and Late Jurassic age intrusions from the Insular Islands.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian {{portion of}} the Pacific Northwest began forming during the early Jurassic period {{when a group of}} active {{volcanic}} islands collided against a pre-existing <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> and coastline of Western Canada. These volcanic islands, known as the Intermontane Islands by geoscientists, were formed on a pre-existing tectonic plate called the Intermontane Plate about 245million years ago by subduction of the former Insular Plate to its west during the Triassic period. This subduction zone records another subduction zone called the Intermontane Trench under an ancient ocean between the Intermontane Islands and the former <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> of Western Canada called the Slide Mountain Ocean. This arrangement of two parallel subduction zones is unusual in that very few twin subduction zones exist on Earth; the Philippine Mobile Belt off the eastern coast of Asia {{is an example of a}} modern twin subduction zone. As the Intermontane Plate drew closer to the pre-existing <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> by ongoing subduction under the Slide Mountain Ocean, the Intermontane Islands drew closer to the former <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> and coastline of Western Canada, supporting a volcanic arc on the former <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> of Western Canada. As the North American Plate drifted west and the Intermontane Plate continued to drift east to the ancient <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> of Western Canada, the Slide Mountain Ocean began to close by ongoing subduction under the Slide Mountain Ocean. This subduction zone eventually jammed and shut down completely about 180million years ago, ending the arc volcanism on the ancient <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> of Western Canada and the Intermontane Islands collided, forming a long chain of deformed volcanic and sedimentary rock called the Intermontane Belt, which consists of deeply cut valleys, high plateaus, and rolling uplands. This collision also crushed and folded sedimentary and igneous rocks, creating a mountain range called the Kootenay Fold Belt which existed in far eastern British Columbia.|$|E

25|$|After the {{sedimentary}} and {{igneous rocks}} were folded and crushed, {{it resulted in}} the creation of a new continental shelf and coastline. The Insular Plate continued to subduct under the new continental shelf and coastline about 130million years ago during the mid Cretaceous period after the formation of the Intermontane Belt, supporting a new continental volcanic arc called the Omineca Arc. Magma rising from the Omineca Arc successfully connected the Intermontane Belt to the mainland of Western Canada, forming a chain of volcanoes in British Columbia that existed discontinuously for about 60million years. The ocean lying offshore during this period is called the Bridge River Ocean. It was also during this period when another group of active volcanic islands existed along the newly built continental shelf and coastline. These volcanic islands, known as the Insular Islands, were formed on the Insular Plate by subduction of the former Farallon Plate to its west during the early Paleozoic era. As the North American Plate drifted west and the Insular Plate drifted east to the <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> of Western Canada, the Bridge River Ocean began to close by ongoing subduction under the Bridge River Ocean. This subduction zone eventually jammed and shut down completely 115million years ago, ending the Omineca Arc volcanism and the Insular Islands collided, forming the Insular Belt. Compression resulting from this collision crushed, fractured and folded rocks along the <b>continental</b> <b>margin.</b> The Insular Belt then welded onto the <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> by magma that eventually cooled to create a large mass of igneous rock, creating a new <b>continental</b> <b>margin.</b> This large mass of igneous rock is the largest granite outcropping in North America.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of listric normal faults {{in the formation}} of sedimentary basins is becoming increasingly more obvious. Based on reflection seismic sections and surface observations, the following genetic types may be differentiated: - listric normal faults involving the basement that are associated with some crustal attenuation. Such faults occur during the formation of rifts that often precede the formation of passive <b>continental</b> <b>margins</b> (e. g., Gulf of Biscay, Galicia Bank); - superficial soft-sediment listric normal faulting related to deltaic systems and/or to drifting sequences associated with the subsidence of passive <b>continental</b> <b>margins</b> (e. g., Gulf of Mexico); - listric normal faulting associated with the genesis of accretionary wedges of active <b>continental</b> <b>margins</b> (e. g., Colombia); - syn- and post-orogenic faulting associated with the stretching and shearing of orogenic systems and parts of their foreland (e. g., Great Basin). The role of normal faulting in the evolution of "geosynclines" and folded belts (e. g., the Alps) is better understood in the light of observations on <b>continental</b> <b>margins</b> and late orogenic basins...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the deep {{structure}} and evolution of passive <b>continental</b> <b>margins</b> {{is important for the}} understanding of rifting processes and the formation of associated sedimentary basins. Since the classical models of McKenzie (1978) and Wernicke (1985), understanding how passive <b>continental</b> <b>margins</b> form, that is to say mainly the way that continental lithosphere is thinned leading to subsidence, remains one of the main challenges in the Earth sciences. Many recent observations and discoveries have modified our basic views of margin formation. The conservational models paradigm (i. e., simple shear, pure shear, or polyphase models), which exclude exchanges between lower continental crust and upper mantle and which are usually proposed to explain lithospheric stretching and consequent crustal thinning of passive <b>continental</b> <b>margins,</b> fail to completely explain al...|$|R
5000|$|Though the {{continental}} shelf {{is treated as}} a physiographic province of the ocean, it {{is not part of}} the deep ocean basin proper, but the flooded margins of the continent. [...] Passive <b>continental</b> <b>margins</b> such as most of the Atlantic coasts have wide and shallow shelves, made of thick sedimentary wedges derived from long erosion of a neighboring continent. Active <b>continental</b> <b>margins</b> have narrow, relatively steep shelves, due to frequent earthquakes that move sediment to the deep sea.|$|R
25|$|There is yet no {{consensus}} on the mechanics of emplacement, {{the process by which}} oceanic crust is uplifted onto continental margins despite the relatively low density of the latter. All emplacement procedures share the same steps nonetheless: subduction initiation, thrusting of the ophiolite over a <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> or an overriding plate at a subduction zone, and contact with air.|$|E
25|$|Ophiolite assemblages in the Alps {{and some}} other collisional {{mountain}} belts are not formed during subduction, but rather represent the thinned margin of the continent that forms during rifting and continental drift. This incipient ocean crust remains locked to the <b>continental</b> <b>margin</b> when the ocean basin closes, emplacing the incipient ocean crust into the collision zone.|$|E
25|$|After the {{vigorous}} convergent plate mountain-building {{of the late}} Paleozoic, Mesozoic tectonic deformation was comparatively mild.

50|$|Two very {{different}} approaches to estimate the total turnover of organic carbon or oxygen (respiration) at the deep sea floor gave very similar results.
