500|$|The {{second season}} begins eight {{hours after the}} escape, {{focusing}} mainly on the eight escapees. Series creator Paul Scheuring describes the second season as [...] "The Fugitive times eight" [...] and likens it to the [...] "second half of The Great Escape." [...] The fugitives split up and journey to locations across {{the country with the}} authorities close behind them as they each pursue their individual goals. Brad Bellick gets fired from the prison where he worked as the main guard and chases after the inmates himself for the reward money. Several of the escapees reunite in search of a large cache of money buried long ago by another Fox River inmate, Charles Westmoreland. Federal agent Alexander Mahone is assigned to track down and capture the eight fugitives, but is revealed to be working for The Company, which wants all eight men dead. When Sara discovers her father, Governor Frank Tancredi, has been killed, she meets with Michael, remaining with him as the brothers try to bring down now-President Reynolds, a <b>Company</b> <b>member.</b> To ensure the brothers' safety, Sara allows herself to be arrested and faces trial. During the trial, the testimony of former Secret Service agent Paul Kellerman, who used to work for The Company-controlled President, exonerates Lincoln and Sara. Half of the escapees are killed or recaptured, but the brothers make it to Panama. Michael, T-Bag, Mahone, and Bellick are arrested by the Panamanian authorities and imprisoned at the Penitenciaría Federal de Sona.|$|E

2500|$|... 1952 saw {{the birth}} of the {{tradition}} of closing the outdoor season with a ceremony in which many if not all of the 500-member company enter the darkened theater carrying candles and a <b>company</b> <b>member</b> selected for the honor speaks Prospero’s words from Act IV Scene I of the Tempest beginning, “Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air…” On completion of the speech all extinguish the flames and file silently out of the theatre.|$|E
2500|$|The {{travel to}} Brussels {{was not without}} incident. Irving was {{informed}} that the Workshop would need to fund its own travel to get to Belgium. After weeks of fund-raising and while the company was still in New York, he received word {{that it would be}} “inadvisable” for a particular stage manager [...] to travel on to Brussels. The opaque State Department communications left Irving and Blau to speculate while officials would not go on record that perhaps some liberal activity had brought negative attention down on the respected <b>company</b> <b>member.</b> The Workshop protested but in the end, feeling a responsibility to San Franciscans who had provided travel funds, proceeded to Brussels with Pointer replacing the stage manager for the occasion.|$|E

2500|$|Her alumni {{included}} many future celebrities, such as Eartha Kitt, who, as a teenager, won {{a scholarship to}} her school and later became one of her dancers {{before moving on to}} a successful singing career. Dunham and Kitt collaborated again in the 1970s in an Equity Production of the musical [...] "Peg" [...] based on the Irish play [...] "Peg [...] "O My Heart". Dunham <b>Company</b> <b>member,</b> Dana McBroom-Manno was selected as a featured artist in the show which played on the Music Fair Circuit. Others who attended her school included James Dean, Gregory Peck, Jose Ferrer, Jennifer Jones, Shelley Winters, Sidney Poitier, Shirley MacLaine and Warren Beatty. Marlon Brando frequently dropped in to play the bongo drums, and jazz musician Charles Mingus held regular jam sessions with the drummers. Known for her many innovations, Dunham developed a dance pedagogy, later named the Dunham Technique, that won international acclaim and that is now taught as a modern dance style in many dance schools.|$|E
2500|$|Mistress of Ceremonies of the USA IBC, Anna-Marie Holmes, passed Tidwell's {{application}} videotape to Kevin McKenzie, {{artistic director}} of the elite American Ballet Theatre (ABT). Upon viewing it, McKenzie suggested to John Meehan (the ABT Education Director) that he offer Tidwell a place in the ABT Studio Company (its apprentice wing). Just two months later, Tidwell joined the Studio Company - without an audition - and soon after, in May 2003, he was promoted into their corps de ballet just before the ABT's 2003 season began at the Metropolitan Opera House. He performed many works in the classical ballet repertory, and although only a corps member, he was given soloists roles in Le Spectre de la Rose and the peasant pas de deux from Giselle. Tidwell was a <b>company</b> <b>member</b> of the ABT's 2003 production of the Swan Lake that was later broadcast on the program Great Performances: Dance in America and released on DVD. [...] Despite his success, he was beginning to find the unremitting rigors of being in a company confining. Tidwell left the ABT in 2004, shocking the dance world and those who knew him.|$|E
2500|$|Technically speaking, {{shareholders}} {{have very}} few rights in the Companies Act 2006, because only {{in a handful of}} places are [...] "shareholders" [...] (those who invest capital in a company) expressly identified as the subject of rights. Instead, [...] "members" [...] have rights in UK company law. Anybody can become a <b>company</b> <b>member</b> through agreement with others involved in a new or existing company. However, because of the bargaining position that people have through capital investment, shareholders typically are the only members, and usually have a monopoly on governance rights under a constitution. In this way, the UK is a [...] "pro-shareholder" [...] jurisdiction relative to its European and American counterparts. Since the Report of the Committee on Company Law Amendment, chaired in 1945 by Lord Cohen, led to the Companies Act 1947, as members and voters in the general meeting of public companies, shareholders have the mandatory right to remove directors by a simple majority, while in Germany, and in most American companies (predominantly incorporated in Delaware) directors can only be removed for a [...] "good reason". Shareholders will habitually have the right to change the company's constitution with a three quarter majority vote, unless they have chosen to entrench the constitution with a higher threshold. Shareholders with support of 5 per cent of the total vote can call meetings, and can circulate suggestions for resolutions with support of 5 per cent of the total vote, or any one hundred other shareholders holding over £100 in shares each. Categories of important decisions, such as large asset sales, approval of mergers, takeovers, winding up of the company, any expenditure on political donations, share buybacks, or a (for the time being) non-binding say on pay of directors, are reserved exclusively for the shareholder body.|$|E
