40|$|Abstract: Double Data Rate Synchronous DRAM (DDR SDRAM) {{has become}} a {{mainstream}} memory of choice in design due to its speed, burst access and pipeline features. The DDR SDRAM is an enhancement to the conventional SDRAM running at bus speed over 75 MHz. The DDR SDRAM (referred to as DDR) doubles the bandwidth of the memory by transferring data twice per cycle on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal. The designed DDR Controller supports data width of 64 bits, Burst Length of 4 and CAS (<b>Column</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Strobe)</b> latency of 2. DDR Controller provides a synchronous command interface to the DDR SDRAM Memory along with several control signals. In this paper, the implementation {{has been done in}} Verilog HDL by using Xilinx ISE 9. 2 i and Modelsim 6. 4 b...|$|E
5000|$|Page mode DRAM {{was later}} {{improved}} {{with a small}} modification which further reduced latency. DRAMs with this improvement were called fast page mode DRAMs (FPM DRAMs). In page mode DRAM, [...] was asserted before the <b>column</b> <b>address</b> was supplied. In FPM DRAM, the <b>column</b> <b>address</b> could be supplied while [...] was still deasserted. The <b>column</b> <b>address</b> propagated through the <b>column</b> <b>address</b> data path, but did not output data on the data pins until [...] was asserted. Prior to [...] being asserted, the data out pins were held at high-Z. FPM DRAM reduced tCAC latency.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{receiver}} for a scalable multiple-access inter-chip link that communicates binary activity between two-dimensional arrays fabricated in deep submicron CMOS. Recipients are identified by row and <b>column</b> <b>addresses</b> but these addresses are not communicated simultaneously.

An entire burst is written to a row in parallel; this increases communication capacity with integration density. Rows are written one by one but bursts are not processed one at a time.

We synthesized an asynchronous implementation by performing a series of program decompositions, starting from a high-level description.

5000|$|Page mode DRAM {{is a minor}} {{modification}} to the first-generation DRAM IC interface which {{improved the}} performance of reads and writes to a row by avoiding the inefficiency of precharging and opening the same row repeatedly to access a different column. In Page mode DRAM, after a row was opened by holding [...] low, the row could be kept open, and multiple reads or writes could be performed {{to any of the}} columns in the row. Each column access was initiated by asserting [...] and presenting a <b>column</b> <b>address.</b> For reads, after a delay (tCAC), valid data would appear on the data out pins, which were held at high-Z before the appearance of valid data. For writes, the write enable signal and write data would be presented along with the <b>column</b> <b>address.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To be precise, EDO DRAM begins {{data output}} on the falling edge of , {{but does not}} stop the output when [...] rises again.

50|$|With {{asynchronous}} DRAM, {{the time}} delay between presenting a <b>column</b> <b>address</b> and receiving {{the data on}} the output pins is constant.

25|$|The {{drawback}} of {{the older}} fast column access method was that a new <b>column</b> <b>address</b> had to be sent for each additional dataword on the row.
