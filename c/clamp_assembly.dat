He had a slight problem with the <b>clamp</b> <b>assembly</b> but had the connectors demated by 11:17 pm EST. Thornton held the array in place {{so that it would}} not drift freely after being detached. The solar arrays weigh 160 kg and are 5 m long when folded. The astronauts dismounted the damaged array at 11:40 pm EST above the Sahara (during a nighttime pass to minimize electrical activity), and Thornton held the array until the next daylight pass (approximately 12 min) before throwing it overboard at 11:52 pm EST over Somalia. The jettison during daylight allowed the astronauts and flight controllers to accurately track its position and relative velocity. The release by Thornton imparted zero velocity to the arrays and then the orbiter did a small burn to put some distance between it and the array. The array, moving away from Endeavour at 5 ft/s, separated about 11 to 12 mi each orbit. [...] The crew then installed a new array, (finishing around 1:40 EST) and rotated the telescope 180 degrees. They then replaced the second solar array which was stowed away for return to ESA. After the 6.5 hour EVA, successful functional tests were performed by the Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC) on four of HST's six gyros. [...] Gyros 1 and 2 were not able to be tested due to the orientation of the telescope and were tested during the crew sleep period Monday afternoon (6 December 1993).|$|E
40|$|The Escherichia coli clamp loader, γ complex (γ 3 δδ′λψ), catalyzes ATP-driven {{assembly}} of β clamps onto primer-template DNA (p/tDNA), enabling processive replication. The {{mechanism by which}} γ complex targets p/tDNA for <b>clamp</b> <b>assembly</b> is not resolved. According to previous studies, charged/polar amino acids inside the clamp loader chamber interact with the double-stranded (ds) portion of p/tDNA. We find that dsDNA, not ssDNA, can trigger a burst of ATP hydrolysis by γ complex and <b>clamp</b> <b>assembly,</b> but only at far higher concentrations than p/tDNA. Thus, contact between γ complex and dsDNA is necessary and sufficient, but not optimal, for the reaction, and additional contacts with p/tDNA likely facilitate its selection as the optimal substrate for <b>clamp</b> <b>assembly.</b> We investigated whether a conserved sequence—HRVW 279 QNRR—in δ subunit contributes to such interactions, since Tryptophan- 279 specifically cross-links to the primer-template junction. Mutation of δ-W 279 weakens γ complex binding to p/tDNA, hampering its ability to load clamps and promote proccessive DNA replication, and additional mutations in the sequence (δ-R 277, δ-R 283) worsen the interaction.

50|$|The Columbia tong test ammeter (illustrated) is {{an example}} of the iron vane type, used for {{measuring}} large AC currents up to 1000 amperes. The iron jaws of the meter direct the magnetic field surrounding the conductor to an iron vane that is attached to the needle of the meter. The iron vane moves in proportion to the strength of the magnetic field, and thus produces a meter indication proportional to the current. This type of ammeter can measure both AC and DC currents and provides a true RMS current measurement of non-sinusoidal or distorted AC waveforms. Interchangeable meter movements can be installed in the <b>clamping</b> <b>assembly</b> to provide various full-scale current values up to 1000 amperes. The iron vane is in a small cylinder that is inserted in a space at the hinged end of the clamp-on jaws. Several jaw sizes are available for clamping around large conductors and bus bars up to 4+1/2 in wide.

Unlike other REV genes, which encode DNA polymerases and an associated subunit, REV 6 {{has been found to}} be identical to POL 30, which encodes proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the subunit of the homotrimeric sliding clamp, in which the rev 6 - 1 mutation produces a G 178 S substitution.

40|$|The beta sliding clamp encircles DNA and enables processive {{replication}} of the Escherichia coli genome by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The clamp loader, gamma complex, assembles beta around DNA in an ATP-fueled reaction. Previous {{studies have shown}} that gamma complex opens the beta ring and also interacts with DNA on binding ATP. Here, a rapid kinetic analysis demonstrates that gamma complex hydrolyzes two ATP molecules sequentially when placing beta around DNA. The first ATP is hydrolyzed fast, at 25 - 30 s(- 1), while the second ATP hydrolysis is limited to the steady-state rate of 2 s(- 1). This step-wise reaction depends on both primed DNA and beta. DNA alone promotes rapid hydrolysis of two ATP molecules, while beta alone permits hydrolysis of only one ATP. These results suggest that beta inserts a slow step between the two ATP hydrolysis events in <b>clamp</b> <b>assembly,</b> during which the clamp loader may perform work on the clamp. Moreover, one ATP hydrolysis is sufficient for release of beta from the gamma complex. This implies that DNA-dependent hydrolysis of the other ATP is coupled to a separate function, perhaps involving work on DNA. A model is presented in which sequential ATP hydrolysis drives distinct events in the clamp-assembly pathway. We also discuss underlying principles of this step-wise mechanism that may apply to the workings of other ATP-fueled biological machines...|$|E

Each structure had a triangular lattice array with 60 inner sapphire rods and 24 outer copper rods sandwiched between copper disks. The dielectric PBG band gap map allows the unique feature of overmoded operation in a TM_{ 02 } mode, with suppression of both lower order modes, {{such as the}} TM_{ 11 } mode, as well as higher order modes. The use of sapphire rods, which have negligible dielectric loss, required inclusion of the dielectric birefringence in the design.

40|$|A novel {{concept to}} {{generate}} miniature shockwaves in a safe, repeatable, and controllable manner in laboratory confinements using an in situ oxyhydrogen generator {{has been proposed}} and demonstrated. This method proves to be more advantageous than existing methods because there is flexibility to vary strength of the shockwave, {{there is no need}} for storage of high pressure gases, and there is minimal waste disposal. The required amount of oxyhydrogen mixture is generated using alkaline electrolysis that produces hydrogen and oxygen gases in stoichiometric quantity. The rate of oxyhydrogen mixture production for the newly designed oxyhydrogen generator is found to be around 8 ml/s experimentally. The oxyhydrogen generator is connected to the driver section of a specially designed 10 mm square miniature shock tube assembly. A numerical code that uses CANTERA software package is used to predict the properties of the driver gas in the miniature shock tube. This prediction along with the 1 -D shock tube theory is used to calculate the properties of the generated shockwave and matches reasonably well with the experimentally obtained values for oxyhydrogen mixture fill pressures less than 2. 5 bars. The miniature shock tube employs a modified tri-clover <b>clamp</b> <b>assembly</b> to facilitate quick changing of diaphragm and replaces the more cumbersome nut and bolt system of fastening components.

40|$|DIII-D {{has been}} {{operating}} {{for the last year}} with limited volt-second capabilities due to structural failure of a conductor lead to one of the ohmic heating (OH) solenoids. The conductor failure was due to poor epoxy impregnation of the overwrap of the lead pack, resulting in copper fatigue and a water leak. A number of structural analyses were performed to assist in determining the failure scenario and to evaluate various repair options. A fatigue stress analysis of the leads with a failed epoxy overwrap indicated crack initiation after 1, 000 cycles at the maximum operating conditions. The failure occurred in a very inaccessible area which restricted design repair options to concepts which could be implemented remotely. Several design options were considered for repairing the lead so that it can sustain the loads for 7. 5 Vs conditions at full toroidal field. A clamp, along with preloaded banding straps and shim bags, provides a system that guarantees that the stress at the crack location is always compressive and prevents further crack growth in the conductor. Due to the limited space available for the repair, it was necessary to design the clamp system to operate at the material yield stress. The primary components of the clamp system were verified by load tests prior to installation. The main body of the clamp contains a load cell and potentiometer for monitoring the load-deflection characteristics of the clamp and conductors during plasma operation. Strain gages provides redundant instrumentation. If required, the preload on the conductors can be increased remotely by a special wrench attached to the <b>clamp</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute’s (MBARI’s) 4000 meter {{remotely}} operated vehicle (ROV), Tiburon operates directly off a double helically wound steel cable {{without the use of}} a clump weight. On dives between 1500 and 4000 meters, rotationally induced hockles or tight bends in the umbilical cable have intermittently occurred. The hockles have the potential to disable and possibly even lose Tiburon. In an effort to compensate for this problem, MBARI engineers are designing a rotation sensor that clamps on the cable near the sections where hockles have occurred. A magnetic compass will take the heading of the cable and send the processed information acoustically back to the ship or vehicle. This information will appear on the ROV pilot’s display screen so that the ROV pilot can compensate for any rotation or misalignment before hockles occur. This paper describes the mechanical design and analysis of the umbilical cable rotation sensor. The goals of the mechanical design are to house the electronics and batteries in a safe and clean environment, incorporate the housings in a hydrodynamically balanced cable <b>clamp</b> <b>assembly</b> and allow for easy attachment and removal from the umbilical. The final design met all of the necessary mechanical and operational requirements {{with the exception of the}} size and weight of the assembly, which was dictated largely by the Sonardyne acoustic hardware.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} first high power tests of a hybrid {{photonic}} band gap (PBG) accelerator structure. PBG structures can support a single electromagnetic mode, thus damping higher-order modes (HOMs) generated by wakefields. We have designed, built and successfully tested a 17. 14 GHz hybrid PBG (HPBG) structure containing both dielectric and metallic elements. Dielectric elements have low loss {{and the potential}} to survive high surface electromagnetic fields. The HPBG structure was constructed as a triangular lattice array with sapphire rods inside and copper rods outside sandwiched between copper plates. The lattice parameter and the rod pattern were adjusted to excite a high-Q TM 0 2 mode and to suppress HOMs. This overmoded operation is a unique and novel feature of the hybrid design. The design included the birefringence of sapphire. Simulations showed relatively high surface fields at the triple point where sapphire, copper and vacuum meet {{as well as in}} any gaps between components in the <b>clamped</b> <b>assembly.</b> Three structures were tested with later structures designed to sequentially reduce the surface electric field. The third structure used sapphire rods with pin extensions at each end and obtained the highest gradient of 19 MV/m, corresponding to a surface E field of 78 MV/m, with a breakdown probability of 5 x 10 1 /pulse/m in 45 -ns pulses. Operation above 20 MV/m gradient led to runaway breakdowns with extensive light emission and eventual damage. For all three structures, multipactor light emission was observed at gradients well below the breakdown threshold. Breakdown damage was found at the triple point where surface fields peaked. The deposition of copper onto sapphire resulting from breakdowns might eventually degrade the cavity quality. This research indicated that multipactor triggered at the triple point limited the operational gradient of the hybrid structure. These experiments represent the first high power tests of a hybrid PBG structure. The gradient achieved of 19 MV/m is the highest achieved with a dielectric structure. The gradient was found to be limited by multipactor and breakdown. The overmoded cavity with relatively large beam apertures might still find applications at high frequency or in high current transmission. by JieXi Zhang. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} RAD 9 A-HUS 1 -RAD 1 (9 - 1 - 1) {{complex is}} a heterotrimeric clamp that promotes checkpoint signaling and DNA repair by {{functioning as a}} scaffold at DNA damage sites. While activation of the ATR checkpoint kinase via 9 - 1 - 1 /TOPBP 1 interactions is well established, less is known about checkpoint signaling-independent roles of 9 - 1 - 1. The 9 - 1 - 1 complex is thought to recruit DNA repair proteins from various repair pathways to damage sites via hydrophobic domains on the outer surface of the clamp. However, the molecular mechanisms and the physiological significance of these interactions remain mostly unknown. I hypothesize that 9 - 1 - 1 has a direct role in DNA repair that is coordinated with ATR checkpoint signaling to maintain genome integrity. This dissertation aims to elucidate the importance of checkpoint signaling-independent functions of HUS 1 and the 9 - 1 - 1 complex using molecular and genetic approaches. First, we conducted the first comprehensive structure/function study of HUS 1 by testing the ability of HUS 1 mutants with various targeted mutations to complement the genotoxin sensitivity of Hus 1 -deficient fibroblasts. In this study, we elucidated functional residues of HUS 1 that drive <b>clamp</b> <b>assembly,</b> DNA interactions, and downstream effector functions. Importantly, we found two hydrophobic pockets on the HUS 1 outer surface that may serve as HUS 1 -effector interaction domains that are separable from the checkpoint activation function of 9 - 1 - 1. These results indicate that, once properly loaded onto damaged DNA, the 9 - 1 - 1 complex executes multiple, separable functions that promote genome maintenance. We also investigated the functional relationship between 9 - 1 - 1 complex and the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway by analyzing genetic interactions between Hus 1 and Rad 54. Previous studies suggested that Hus 1 may {{play an important role}} in double strand break (DSB) repair, and Rad 54 -/- mice are mildly perturbed for HRR. We found that simultaneous Hus 1 and Rad 54 defects in mice and cultured cells caused synergistic effect on spontaneous and genotoxin-induced genomic instability, as well as male subfertility. These findings reveal Hus 1 may directly participate in DSB repair pathways to respond to DNA damaging stresses. Together, these studies provide insights into novel functions of HUS 1 that underlie a successful DNA damage response, which potentially could be exploited for targeted anticancer therapy. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|E

40|$|Finite element (FE) {{modelling}} {{techniques have}} become a popular tool for exploring welding and clamping sequence dependence in sheet metal assemblies. In the current paper, the dimensional variability associated with different <b>assembly</b> <b>clamping</b> sequences is investigated with a FE contact modelling approach implemented in the commercial code Abaqus. A simplified channel section assembly consisting of a top hat and bottom plate is the case study investigated. Expected variation modes of bow and twist were used to simulate key variability sources in the main structural component under investigation; the top hat of the channel section. It was found that final assembly variability can change considerably depending on clamp sequence selection. It was also found that different clamp sequences can control particular modes of variation better than others, {{and that there is}} not one particular clamping sequence that is the best for containing all variation modes. An adaptable assembly process is therefore suggested, where given the shape of input components the best available clamping sequence is selected. Comparison of the performance of the proposed adaptable clamping sequence to traditional fixed clamping sequences shows improvements for the dimensional control of variability in non-rigid components. While introducing such a method in production would require inspection of each component being assembled and investigation of the alternative clamping sequences, given access to fast and detailed dimensional inspection technology such as optical coordinate measuring machines (OCMM 2 ̆ 7 s), the approach shows promise for future application. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl 2 ̆ 2 channel is an ATP-binding cassette protein, comprising two transmembrane domains, two nucleotide binding domains (NBD 1, NBD 2) and a regulatory (R) domain. Channel gating {{is controlled by}} R-domain phosphorylation and by A T P binding and/or hydroysis at the NBDs. Exon 13 of the C F T R gene encodes residues 590 to 830, originally ascribed to the R domain. Here, CFTR channels were severed near likely N- or C-terminal boundaries of NBD 1 or the R domain. Channel activity, assayed via two-microelectrode voltage <b>clamp</b> monitored successful <b>assembly</b> of pairs of channel segments as the sever point was systematically shifted along the primary sequence. Substantial activity indicated successful assembly; such constructs were further studied in excised patches, by correlating macroscopic and single-channel kinetics. The C-terminus of N B D 1 was found to extend beyond residues 590 and lies between residues 622 and 634, while the N-terminus of N B D 1 lies between residues 432 and 449. In excised patches, channels severed just before (between a. a. s 432 and 433) or after N B D 1 (between residues 633 and 634) displayed the usual hallmark characteristics of wild-type (WT) CFTR: requirement of phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) and exposure to A T P for gating, ability to be locked open by pyrophosphate or AMPPNP, small single-channel conductances, and high apparent affinity of channel opening by although bursts of 1 - 633 plus 634 - 1480 channels were - 40...|$|R
40|$|In this work, it was {{determined}} that with increasing weld pitch, the occurrence of a 2 ̆ 01 clazy S 2 ̆ 01 d defect in the weld nugget of friction stir welded (FSWed) AA 6061 became increasingly pronounced, though its impact on the bend performance of the weld was negligible. For a fixed weld pitch of 0. 48, the effect of gap, i. e. the spacing between two sheets at the butt joint interface, on the joint quality of AA 6061 was evaluated in terms of the welding defects, microstructure, hardness and bend performance. Fully penetrated welds without metallurgical defects such as wormholes were obtained up to a joint gap of 0. 5 mm. Though the overall microhardness and bend performance of the welds remained unaffected until a joint gap of 0. 8 mm, the decrease in the forge force during FSW beyond a joint gap value of 0. 5 mm may represent a more critical limit in regards to the industrial application of the process; this is especially important when applying force control during processing to ensure a constant shoulder penetration in the material for addressing practical considerations, such as thickness variations in the <b>assembly,</b> <b>clamping</b> distortions and tool wear. Based on these results and using force amplitudes recorded during the welding experiments, a robotic scenario was synthesized with an appropriate operational window for continuous-path friction stir butt welding (FSBW) of 3. 18 -mm-thick sheets clamped to a 1 m 7 1 m horizontal welding table. An appropriate industrial robot model was selected and the associated geometric workcell layout was developed for this application. This scenario was implemented in a physical prototype and used to successfully produce 1 -m-long FSWed assemblies that exhibited good tensile mechanical performance.
