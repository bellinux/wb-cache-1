40|$|In {{conventional}} {{models of}} galactic and cluster <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> widespread <b>cooling</b> (mass dropout) {{is assumed to}} avoid accumulation of unacceptably large central masses. This assumption is often criticized because the observed mass of cooled gas and newly formed stars are {{much less than the}} cooling rates imply. Moreover, recent XMM observations have failed to find spectral evidence for locally cooling gas. This remarkable discovery has revived the notion that <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> do not <b>cool</b> in the manner previously assumed, but are instead heated by some process such as an intermittent or low-level AGN in the central galaxy. To explore this hypothesis, we consider the gas-dynamical consequences of heated galactic <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> under many different heating scenarios without specifying the detailed physics of the heating process. We have been unable to find a single acceptable heated flow in reasonable agreement with wellobserved hot gas temperature and density profiles. Even for poor fits to the observations, these models require finely tuned heating scenarios. Idealized flows in which radiative cooling is perfectly balanced by global heating are grossly incompatible with observations. Flows heated by central feedback often result in eposidic cooling that is associated with quasi-cyclic changes in the hot gas density profile; at present there is no observational evidence for this. Paradoxically, when <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> are centrally heated (or pressurized), they experience spontaneous non-linear compressions that result in spatially widespread cooling instabilities. Therefore, spectral evidence for cooling gas is expected in either traditional <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> with ad hoc mass dropout or in heated <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> without the dropout assumption...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The cooling cores of {{clusters}} of galaxies {{are among the}} brightest thermal X-ray line sources in the universe. High resolution X-ray spectra would allow individual line fluxes to be measured. The fluxes of low ionization X-ray lines in <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> should be directly proportional to the cooling rate at relatively cool temperatures, and {{could be used to}} determine whether large amounts of gas are really cooling out of the X-ray band (below ∼ 10 6 K). By comparing the fluxes of many X-ray lines, we could determine the amounts of gas at different temperatures and densities. This would allow one to test the idea that <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> are highly inhomogeneous, as required to explain their surface brightness profiles. High resolution X-ray spectra can be used to determine velocities in the hot gas in <b>cooling</b> <b>flows.</b> If the gas is homogeneous, significant inflow velocities are expected. However, if the gas is as inhomogeneous as we currently believe, the inflow velocities are likely to be rather low (vr ∼ < 30 km s− 1). The hot gas in <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> is probably strongly turbulent, and turbulence is likely to be more important than either inflow or thermal broadening in determining the shapes of lines.

50|$|A <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> occurs {{according}} to {{the theory that the}} intracluster medium (ICM) in the centres of galaxy clusters should be rapidly cooling at the rate of tens to thousands of solar masses per year. This should happen as the ICM (a plasma) is quickly losing its energy by the emission of X-rays. The X-ray brightness of the ICM is proportional to the square of its density, which rises steeply towards the centres of many clusters. Also the temperature falls to typically a third or a half of the temperature in the outskirts of the cluster. The typical predicted timescale for the ICM to cool is relatively short, less than a billion years. As material in the centre of the cluster cools out, the pressure of the overlying ICM should cause more material to flow inwards (the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow).</b>|$|E

40|$|Arguments {{against the}} {{existence}} of large-scale <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> in clusters of galaxies are presented. The evidence for <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> is all circumstantial, consisting of observations of cool gas or hot gas with a radiative cooling time less than the Hubble time, or a central peak in the X-ray surface brightness profile. There is no evidence for large quantities (several tens to several hundreds of solar masses per year) of matter actually flowing anywhere. On the contrary, several lines of evidence suggest thaat <b>cooling</b> <b>flows,</b> if they exist, must be suppressed by one to two orders of magnitude from the values implied by simple estimates based on the radiative cooling time of the X-ray emitting gas. Two heat sources which might accomplish this, thermal conduction and relativistic particles, are considered, and {{an alternative to the}} standard model for <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> is presented: an accretion flow with feedback wherein the accretion of gas into a massive black hole in the central galaxy generates high energy particles that heat the gas and act to limit the accretion...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{suggested that}} star formation quenching in galaxies {{is related to}} galaxy structure. Here we propose a new mechanism to explain the physical origin of this correlation. We assume that while quiescent galaxies are maintained quenched by a feedback mechanism, <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> in the hot halo gas can still develop intermittently. We study <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> in a large suite of around 90 hydrodynamic simulations of an isolated galaxy group, and find that the flow development depends significantly on the gravitational potential well in the central galaxy. If the galaxy's gravity is not strong enough, <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> result in a central cooling catastrophe, supplying cold gas and feeding star formation to galactic bulges. When the bulge grows prominent enough, compressional heating starts to offset radiative cooling and maintains <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> in a long-term hot mode without producing cooling catastrophe. Our model thus describes a self-limited growth channel for galaxy bulges, and naturally explains the connection between quenching and bulge prominence. In particular, we explicitly demonstrate that M_*/R_ eff^ 1. 5 is a good structural predictor of quenching. We further find that the gravity from the central supermassive black hole also affects the bimodal fate of <b>cooling</b> <b>flows,</b> and predict a more general quenching predictor to be M_ bh^ 1. 6 M_*/R_ eff^ 1. 5, which may be tested in future observational studies.

50|$|Plasma {{in regions}} of the cluster, with a cooling time shorter than {{the age of the}} system, should be cooling due to strong X-ray {{radiation}} where emission is proportional to the density squared. Since the density of the ICM is highest towards the center of the cluster, the radiative cooling time drops a significant amount. The central cooled gas can no longer support the weight of the external hot gas and the pressure gradient drives what is known as a <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> where the hot gas from the external regions flows slowly towards the center of the cluster. This inflow would result in regions of cold gas and thus regions of new star formation. Recently however, with the launch of new X-ray telescopes such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, images of galaxy clusters with better spatial resolution have been taken. These new images do not indicate signs of new star formation on the order of what was historically predicted, motivating research into the mechanisms that would prevent the central ICM from cooling.|$|E
40|$|We examine recent {{developments}} in the cluster <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> scenario following recent observations by Chandra and XMM-Newton.

Combining this result {{with the lack of}} spectroscopic evidence for gas below one-third of the ambient cluster temperature is strong evidence that the gas is heated intermittently. While the old steady-state isobaric <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> model is incompatible with recent observations, a "moderate <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> model", in which the gas undergoes intermittent heating that effectively reduces the age of a <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> is consistent with observations.
