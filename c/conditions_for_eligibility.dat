30|$|Key {{labor market}} {{characteristics}} that developing countries should consider when designing their UI programs are the “non-discrete” nature of unemployment {{and the fact}} that the poor are less than proportionally represented among the unemployed. Under these circumstances, an OECD-style UI program inhibits self-protection as a response to unemployment, imposes high costs of monitoring continuing eligibility, and brings regressive redistribution. To respond to these problems, we propose that the design of UI should be changed to exempt informal sector work from disqualifying <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> continuing <b>eligibility,</b> simplify conventional monitoring of continuing eligibility, and rely exclusively on employer and worker contributions as sources of financing, that is, refrain from using government subsidies for financing UI benefits.|$|R

5000|$|The {{health care}} system in the United States is made up of both public and private insurers, with the private sphere {{generally}} dominating in providing coverage. Despite this, the federal government remains important given its role in determining public health benefits—for instance, Medicaid, the United States health program for families and individuals of low income. Although Medicaid previously serviced immigrants, welfare reform policies such as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) in 1996 implemented stricter <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>eligibility.</b> This legislative move largely shifted responsibility for immigrant health care from the federal government to the state and local levels; as such, its impact varies across states. Generally, the provisions of PRWORA prevent immigrants from accessing federal benefits like the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) until after they have held lawful permanent residency for five years (except in cases of emergency). [...] In response, some states have implemented their own programs expanding health coverage to immigrants and other low-income groups; among these include states of Illinois, New York, the District of Columbia, and some counties in California. These services differ accordingly, with some providing the same coverage as Medicaid or SCHIP, while others limit coverage to specific categories of immigrants. Conversely, other states like Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and Virginia, have implemented laws that further restrict noncitizens' access to health care. Legislation of similar nature include the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which requires proof of identity and U.S. citizenship from all those applying for/renewing Medicaid coverage.|$|E

30|$|One {{potential}} {{issue with}} {{our use of}} a DiD empirical approach is that the reforms to skilled migration policy may have influenced the composition of migrants through the Family and Skill Streams. It is possible, for example, that increasing the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>eligibility</b> of the GSM visa category encouraged some individuals {{to apply for a}} visa through the Family Stream. We cannot test for this sort of phenomenon, as we do know which Family Stream migrants would have applied through the GSM category prior to the shift in policy. Nevertheless, we expect that this consideration—to the extent that it exists—is likely to dampen the estimated treatment effects with which we are concerned.|$|E

40|$|I. 	The HEFCE {{proposal}} to mandate immediate repository deposit of articles as a <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> REF is excellent. If adopted and effectively implemented, it {{will serve as}} a model for OA mandates worldwide. It will also reinforce and complement the RCUK OA mandates, providing it with a uniform compliance monitoring and verification mechanism. II. 	The immediate-deposit mandate should apply to the refereed, accepted version of peer-reviewed research articles (or refereed conference articles). III. 	The deposit should be in the author’s institutional repository, immediately upon acceptance for publication. Acceptance date is determinate; publication date is variable and indeterminate and may lag acceptance by as much as two years. IV. 	Access to the deposit should be immediately OA where possible, or, where deemed necessary, it can be made Closed Access if the publisher requires an OA embargo. V. 	Repositories should implement the eprint request Button that allows individual users to request – and others to provide – one copy for research purposes with one click each. VI. 	Once any allowable embargo period elapses, OA deposits can be accessed, read, searched, linked, downloaded, printed out, stored, and locally data-mined by individual users, as well as harvested and indexed for Boolean search by harvesters like Google. This makes license policy less urgent. Further re-use rights will come when OA mandates have made OA universal. VII. 	What is crucial is that the deposit should be made at time of acceptance, time-stamped as such, with a copy of the acceptance letter to serve as the date marker. VIII. 	Unlike articles, monographs are not all author give-aways, published solely for research impact rather than royalty outcome; and researchers need to have exclusive first data-mining rights on the data they collect. So monograph and data deposit should only be recommended for the time being, not mandatory; access to the deposits can be set as Closed Access. IX. 	The start date <b>for</b> 2020 REF <b>eligibility</b> should be immediately after the 2014 REF, not two years afterward. X. 	The target should be 100 % compliance. Exceptions can be dealt with on a case by case basis: It would be a great mistake to stipulate a percentage compliance figure instead. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:On May 1 st 2004, 10 Central and Eastern European (CEE) {{countries}} {{joined the}} EU and became fully eligible for communitarian financial support. While the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>eligibility</b> are the same, at regional level CEE territories {{are provided with}} very different socioeconomic settings. In particular, different regions are differently endowed with what has been labelled ‘territorial capital’, so that the endowment of public and private, material and immaterial assets significantly varies across regions, including infrastructure, private capital, human and social capital. This set of territorial conditions, enabling economic development to take place, is here assumed to impact the outcome of cohesion policies as well. This paper is hence aimed at assessing the role of specific territorial conditions on the efficient implementation of cohesion policies in CEE NUTS 3 regions. The analysis points out the mechanisms through which the endowment of specific territorial assets affects the outcome of Cohesion policies. It appears that for {{a large number of}} territorial capital assets, increasing returns are present and regions more endowed with specific types of territorial capital are more able to gain from policy investment in related fields...|$|E
