25|$|Certain {{phenomena}} in quantum mechanics, such as quantum entanglement, might give the superficial impression of allowing <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> faster than light. According to the no-communication theorem these phenomena {{do not allow}} true communication; they only let two observers in different locations see the same system simultaneously, without any way of controlling what either sees. Wavefunction collapse {{can be viewed as}} an epiphenomenon of quantum decoherence, which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and all of its environment. Since the underlying behaviour does not violate local causality or allow FTL it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real or apparent.|$|E

2500|$|Wiener {{believed}} that <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is essentially negentropic – it resists entropy –, because {{it relies on}} organizational structures. There {{are two kinds of}} possible disorganizational forces, passive and active: [...] "Nature offers resistance to decoding, but it does not show ingenuity in finding new and undecipherable methods for jamming our communication with the outer world" [...] (pp.35–36). Nature's passive resistance is in contrast to active resistance, like that of a chess opponent. This is similar to Einstein's view, expressed in his famous comment: [...] "The Lord is subtle but he is not vicious".|$|E

The nature of social networks allows for faster diffusion of information than through organizational sources. The internet has changed the way we view, use, create, and store information, now it is time to re-evaluate the way we share and spread it.|$|E
2500|$|Information theory {{studies the}} quantification, storage, and <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> [...] It was {{originally}} proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled [...] "A Mathematical Theory of Communication". Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include lossless data compression (e.g. ZIP files), lossy data compression (e.g. MP3s and JPEGs), and channel coding (e.g. for {{digital subscriber line}} (DSL)). Its impact has been crucial {{to the success of}} the Voyager missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones, the development of the Internet, the study of linguistics and of human perception, the understanding of black holes, and numerous other fields.|$|E
2500|$|Information theory {{studies the}} transmission, processing, extraction, and {{utilization}} of information. Abstractly, {{information can be}} thought of as the resolution of uncertainty. In the case of <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> over a noisy channel, this abstract concept was made concrete in 1948 by Claude Shannon in his paper [...] "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", in which [...] "information" [...] is thought of as a set of possible messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the channel noise. Shannon's main result, the noisy-channel coding theorem showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the channel capacity, a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent.|$|E

In 1983 she established the White House Outreach Working Group on Central America to help increase private sector understanding of Reagan's policies, including working with, among many other individuals and groups, the American Security Council Foundation, to produce anti-Sandinista propaganda (what she would call [...] "truth-telling") films, and the [...] Council for National Policy to produce materials that revealed the Marxist–Leninist orientation of the Sandanista movement. [...] Among those groups that participated in the Outreach Group effort was the AFL-CIO because [...] "the Sandinistas were against free labor unions."
