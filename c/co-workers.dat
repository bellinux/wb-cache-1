40|$|In {{an age of}} {{flattened}} hierarchies and networked organizations, lateral {{processes in}} organizations take on added significance. <b>Co-worker</b> assistance refers to a key aspect of lateral relations: workers’ helping behaviour {{in relation to their}} immediate colleagues. Using data from a Dutch survey of public sector and related service employees, we develop and test a model of <b>co-worker</b> assistance. We argue that reciprocity facilitates management-induced <b>co-worker</b> assistance and that this depends on the extent of workers’ organizational commitment. This in turn is influenced by the manner in which management exercises control over employees. We find evidence for organizational commitment acting as a partial mediator between <b>co-worker</b> ssistance and bureaucratic control, <b>co-worker</b> control, and facilitative supervision respectively. Group cohesion, forged by workers independent of management, has a strong direct effect on <b>co-worker</b> assistance and a particularly strong effect when interacting with <b>co-worker</b> control. We also find that <b>co-worker</b> control is more strongly related to <b>co-worker</b> assistance where tasks are more interdependent...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} convincingly shown that employees' family lives can affect their work outcomes. We {{investigate}} whether family-to-work conflict (FWC) {{experienced by the}} employee also affects the turnover intention of a <b>co-worker.</b> We predict that the employee's FWC {{has an effect on}} the <b>co-worker's</b> turnover intention through the crossover of positive and negative work attitudes. Using a sample of 154 <b>co-worker</b> dyads, we found that the employee FWC was positively related to <b>co-worker</b> turnover intention through the crossover of (reduced) work engagement. Results show that family matters at work, affecting employee. In addition, employee's job engagement was positively related to his (her) <b>co-worker</b> job engagement and it was negatively related <b>co-worker</b> turnover intention and employee's FWC was not positively related to <b>co-worker</b> turnover intention trough the crossover of (reduced) feelings of engagement...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Industrial Psychology) The study {{examines}} the antecedents of job satisfaction, {{focusing on the}} influence of <b>co-worker</b> relations (work role fit, <b>co-worker</b> support, supervisor support, norm adherence and self- consciousness), and psychological safety. The primary research objective was to examine the levels of job satisfaction experienced by academics. Respondents from a higher education institution were asked to complete an online survey containing, the Minnesota Job Satisfaction Questionnaire and an extract from the Workplace Characteristics Questionnaire compiled by May, Harter, & Gilson (2004). The results report relatively high levels of job satisfaction for both intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction. Significant differences in perceived job satisfaction were obtained for age, qualification type and staff classification. Psychological safety and <b>co-worker</b> relations reported a predictive relationship with job satisfaction (intrinsic and extrinsic). Work role fit, <b>co-worker</b> support and supervisor support were positively associated with psychological safety; adherence to <b>co-worker</b> norms and self-consciousness were negatively associated. The mediation analysis revealed that psychological safety mediates the relationship between <b>co-worker</b> relations and job satisfaction. Psychological safety mediates the influence of <b>co-worker</b> relations’ variables (<b>co-worker</b> support and self-consciousness) and intrinsic job satisfaction fully. Work role fit had a strong effect on both intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction. Psychological safety partially mediated the relationship for both <b>co-worker</b> support and supervisor support, and extrinsic job satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|<b>Co-worker</b> {{support has}} {{received}} an increasing {{amount of attention}} recently due to the positive effects it can have in the workplace. It can increase job satisfaction and {{has been found to}} help reduce work stress. As both of these are possible antecedents of intention to quit, this study investigated employee perceptions of perceived <b>co-worker</b> support and its effect on job satisfaction, work stress and intention to quit. It was theorised that <b>co-worker</b> support would have a positive relationship with job satisfaction and negative relationships with work stress and intention to quit. <b>Co-worker</b> support was also hypothesised to act as a moderator variable in the relationship between job satisfaction and intention to quit and the relationship between work stress and intention to quit. Participants completed a questionnaire which included measures of <b>co-worker</b> support, job satisfaction, work stress and intention to quit. In a sample of ninety-eight retail employees <b>co-worker</b> support was found to have a significant relationship with job satisfaction and intention to quit, however no direct relationship was found between <b>co-worker</b> support and intention to quit. On this occasion, no moderating effects were found. These findings emphasise the need for organisations {{to be aware of the}} importance of <b>co-worker</b> support...|$|R
