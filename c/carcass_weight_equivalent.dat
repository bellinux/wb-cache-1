Recovery increases carbon sequestration into the soil and can potentially avoid deforestation; thereby reducing emissions intensity (EI), but only at increased investment cost per unit of area. We develop a multi-period linear programming (LP) model for grazing beef production planning to represent a typical Cerrado stocking and finishing beef farm. We compare economic and environmental performance of two alternative optimized pasture management approaches relative to the traditional practice (TRP), {{which is based on}} restoring pasture after a full degradation cycle of 8 years. The scenarios considered the differencemade by access to subsidized credit through the Low Carbon Agriculture program (“Programa ABC”). The model estimates EI using upstream life cycle assessment (LCA), and dynamically estimates soil organic carbon (SOC) changes as a function of pasture management. The results show net present values (NPV) ranging from− 67 Brazilian reals per hectare-year (R$·ha− 1 ·yr− 1) to around 300 R$·ha− 1 ·yr− 1, respectively for traditional and optimized pasture management strategies. Estimated EI of the TRP is 9. 26 kg CO 2 equivalent per kg of <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> <b>equivalent</b> (kg CO 2 e/kg CWE) relative to 3. 59 kg CO 2 e/kg CWE for optimizedmanagement.

40|$|Variable eating {{quality was}} {{identified}} as a major contributor to declining Australian beef consumption in the early 1990 s. The primary issue was the inability to predict the eating quality of cooked beef before consumption. A R&D program funded by industry and Meat and Livestock Australia investigated the relationships between critical control points along the supply chain, cooking methods and beef palatability. These relationships were underpinned by extensive consumer taste panels. Out of this R&D grew the Meat Standards Australia (MSA) voluntary meat grading system which aimed at predicting consumer palatability scores of cooked beef. Quality was defined on the basis of one of four grades. The grading model predicts consumer scores for 135 ‘cut by cooking method’ combinations for each graded carcass. The MSA system commenced in 1999 / 2000 and at present some 850, 000 cattle are graded annually, about 25 % of the total domestic kill. This paper first describes the evolution of the MSA grading scheme and its adoption by industry. Next, evidence is presented relating to consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for guaranteed eating quality, the premiums that Australian consumers have actually paid for MSA graded cuts, {{and the extent to which}} premiums paid by consumers are transmitted back along the value chain to cattle producers. WTP data collected during exit surveys from taste panels in Australia, the United States, Japan and Ireland showed that consumers were willing to pay more for premium quality. However, whilst MSA has the capacity for four quality grades, it is mostly used to simply discriminate between ungraded and graded product (ie 3 star or better). A survey of Australian beef retailers and wholesalers suggested that from 2004 / 05 to 2007 / 08, beef consumers were prepared to pay around $ 0. 32 /kg extra for MSA branded beef on a <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> <b>equivalent</b> basis. Retailers kept about $ 0. 06 /kg and wholesalers kept about $ 0. 12 /kg. The remaining $ 0. 14 /kg was passed back to cattle producers. Despite accelerated use of MSA in the wholesale trade, visibility at retail is generally low. It is being used predominantly to support private brand initiatives or to underpin existing channel partner offers. The paper concludes by discussing two case studies of business models that small niche beef retailers have developed to further capture the benefits from the MSA scheme through introduction of private brands. In summary, the MSA innovation has resulted in a higher degree of accuracy in the ability to predict beef eating quality for consumers. This has improved consumer choice, opportunities for value adding, and sufficient transmission of the premiums paid by consumers for graded cuts to provide real incentives for beef producers to supply MSAcompliant cattle.

A total of 60 animals with <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> ranging between 4 and 8 kg were used. Carcass conformation, commercial joints, tissues measurements and proportions, carcass pH, meat colour and meat texture were evaluated. Sex had a significant effect on carcass composition and males had higher bone and less intermuscular fat and kidney knob and channel fat proportion than females.

40|$|The {{live cattle}} and beef markets of Canada and the United States are well {{integrated}} and highly interdependent, {{but in an}} unequal fashion. This paper assesses the role of trade agreements and domestic policies in increasing market integration and analyses the impact of remaining barriers to integration. In this paper, we use integration {{in the context of}} forming or blending markets into a whole. When the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) was implemented in 1989, tariffs on both live cattle and beef were reduced and within a few years many were eliminated. In 1996, the United States imported 1. 5 million head of slaughter and feeder cattle from Canada, nearly a sixfold {{increase in the number of}} cattle imported prior to CFTA, which numbered 262, 091 in 1987. However, live cattle imports are still extremely small compared to the U. S. market, with imports of live cattle in 1996 (<b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> <b>equivalent)</b> constituting around 4 percent of U. S. beef consumption. The United States is a much more important market for Canada than vice versa, with 60 percent of Canada's beef exports destined to the United States in 1996, but only 16 percent of U. S. beef exports destined to Canada. As impediments to trade between Canada and the United States were removed, north-south trade increased. As the feedlot and packing industries in Alberta expand, it is anticipated that fewer Canadian slaughter cattle will be exported to the United States. In fact, U. S. feeder cattle may be exported to Alberta. Subsidies for beef producers in Canada have been significantly higher than for the United States, at times twice as high, although the level of support for beef and veal is lower than that for other commodities. Both the United States and Canada protect their domestic industries through tariffs, although this protection will decline moderately with the implementation of the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement. Both countries subsidize their industries through provision of inspection services, research and advisory programs, and marketing and promotion programs; however, the importance of these government policies varies between countries. Canada has eliminated a number of programs previously used to assist the beef industry, including an insurance program, the National Tripartite Stabilization Program. The United States does not have a regular program of income support for stockgrowers. The United States does have several programs that promote beef exports. To the extent that export promotion programs result in higher U. S. market prices, they may also increase U. S. imports of live cattle and beef from Canada. Due to the large size of the United States market relative to Canada, it is commonly argued that cattle and beef prices are determined in the U. S. market, with Canadian prices reflecting differences in exchange rates and transportation costs. U. S. slaughter prices were found to be an extremely important determinant of Canadian slaughter prices. A weaker relationship was found between U. S. and Canadian barley prices. Mutual recognition of the equivalency of U. S. and Canadian meat grading systems has not occurred and this has ramifications for U. S. -Canadian trade in beef. Canadian packers are forced to sell beef at greatly reduced prices in the United States, resulting in lower boxed beef exports to the United States and higher exports of carcasses than would occur with grade equivalency. The same is true for U. S. packers. Because U. S. beef cannot be sold into the eastern Canadian market without a large reduction in price, the U. S. beef industry is deprived of a lucrative outlet for the lean beef that is preferred in eastern Canada. The increasing level of integration in Canadian and U. S. cattle and beef markets has been accompanied by a corresponding increase in their interdependence. Policymakers in both countries must recognize that domestic and export policies need to account for open borders between the two countries, limiting the choice of policies available to achieve a particular goal. Transportation costs will always limit the choice of packers that producers can sell to. However, within these bounds, a single market means that there are more choices for producers. The beef industries in both the United States and Canada are increasingly dependent on export markets, particularly the Pacific Rim. Both countries have a mutual interest in increasing access to third country markets. Integration of U. S. and Canadian live cattle and beef markets is well advanced, and it is perhaps the most integrated market of the major agricultural commodities. Supply management of the Canadian dairy, egg, and poultry industries and the implementation of high tariffs after the removal of quotas have prevented integration in those markets. For grains, marketing institutions and systems in Canada prevent complete market integration. For cattle and beef, the lack of trade barriers and relative unimportance of government intervention in the sector have facilitated movement toward a single market. live cattle trade, U.

40|$|The {{objective}} of {{study was to}} evaluate of carcass production of PO beef cattle based on measurement of heart girth, body condition score (BCS), and slaughter weight. It was conducted in the slaughtering house at Mersi Purwokerto city. The materials {{for this study were}} 60 heads of male PO breed cattle. Simple random sampling was used for taking samples. Data was analyzed by using multiple regression equation {{to determine the effects of}} heart girth, BCS, and slaughter <b>weight</b> on <b>carcass</b> <b>weight.</b> The potency of carcass relative growth was assessed with Huxley allometric equation. The result showed that heart girth did not differ significantly (P> 0. 05), BCS had significant effect (P< 0. 01) on <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> and percentage, and slaughter weight had significant effect (P< 0. 01) on <b>carcass</b> <b>weight.</b> Relative growth of <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> to slaughter weight had a high potential (b= 1. 136), otherwise relative growth of carcass proportion to slaughter weight had a less potential (b= 0. 136).

40|$|Crossbreeding of Holstein–Friesian {{dairy cows}} with both early {{maturing}} (e. g. Aberdeen Angus (AA)) and late maturing (e. g. Belgian Blue (BB)) beef breeds is commonly practised. In Ireland, genetic merit for {{growth rate of}} beef sires is expressed as expected progeny difference for <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> (EPDCWT). The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the progeny of Holstein–Friesian cows, sired by AA and BB bulls of low (L) and high (H) EPDCWT for performance and carcass traits. A total of 118 spring-born male progeny from 20 (9 AA and 11 BB) sires (8 L and 12 H) were managed together from shortly after birth to about 19 months of age. They were then assigned to one of two mean slaughter weights (560 kg (light) or 620 kg (heavy)). Following slaughter, carcasses were graded for conformation class and fat class, the 6 th to 10 th ribs joint was dissected as an indicator of carcass composition, and samples of subcutaneous fat and musculus longissimus were subjected to Hunterlab colour measurements. A sample of m. longissimus was also chemically analysed. Slaughter and <b>carcass</b> <b>weights</b> per day of age for AAL, AAH, BBL and BBH were 747, 789, 790 and 805 (s. e. 10. 5) g, and 385, 411, 427 and 443 (s. e. 4. 4) g, respectively. Corresponding <b>carcass</b> <b>weight,</b> kill-out proportion, <b>carcass</b> conformation class (scale 1 to 5) and carcass fat class (scale 1 to 5) values were 289, 312, 320 and 333 (s. e. 4. 0) kg, 516, 522, 542 and 553 (s. e. 3. 5) g/kg, 2. 5, 2. 4, 3. 0 and 3. 1 (s. e. 0. 10), and 3. 4, 3. 5, 2. 9 and 2. 8 (s. e. 0. 11). There were few breed type 3 genetic merit interactions. Delaying slaughter date increased slaughter <b>weight,</b> <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> and all measures of fatness. It also reduced the proportion of <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> in the hind quarter and the proportions of bone and muscle in the ribs joint. None of these effects accompanied the increase in <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> due to higher EPDCWT. It is concluded that BB have superior production traits to AA. Selection of sires for higher EPDCWT increases growth rate, kill-out proportion and <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> of progeny with little effect on carcass or muscle traits. The extra <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> due to higher EPDCWT is more valuable commercially than a comparable <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> increment from a delay in slaughter date because it comprises a higher proportion of muscle. peer-reviewe...|$|R

The data set consisted of 18, 387 body and 1, 730 carcass records, {{as well as}} full pedigree information collected over four generations. Variance and covariance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood fitting a multi-trait animal model. Across generations, estimates of heritability for body and <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> traits were moderate and ranged from 0. 14 to 0. 19 and 0. 17 to 0. 21, respectively. Body trait heritabilities estimated for females {{were significantly higher than}} for males whereas <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> trait heritabilities estimated for females and males were not significantly different (P > 0. 05). Maternal effects for body traits accounted for 4 to 5 % of the total variance and were greater in females than in males. Genetic correlations among body traits were generally high in the mixed sexes. Genetic correlations between body and <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> traits were also high. Although some issues remain regarding the best statistical model to be fitted to GFP data, our results suggest that selection for high harvest body weight based on breeding values estimated by fitting an animal model to the data can significantly improve mean body and <b>carcass</b> <b>weight</b> in GFP...|$|R
