25|$|The outsole is {{the layer}} in {{direct contact with}} the ground. Dress shoes often have leather or resin rubber outsoles; casual or work-oriented shoes have outsoles made of natural rubber or a {{synthetic}} material like polyurethane. The outsole may comprise a single piece, or may be an assembly of separate pieces, often of different materials. On some shoes, the heel of the sole has a rubber plate for durability and traction, while the front is leather for style. Specialized shoes will often have modifications on this design: athletic or so called <b>cleated</b> shoes like soccer, rugby, baseball and golf shoes have spikes embedded in the outsole to improve traction.|$|E

One such text attacked the poet laureate Octavian Goga, accusing him and other Transylvanian refugees of hoarding bureaucratic positions in the Kingdom of Romania. In a 1913 piece, Arghezi targeted scholar Ioan Bianu for allegedly mismanaging the Romanian Academy Library: [...] "From his longjohns and his <b>cleated</b> boots, Mr. Bianu has jumped straight into the aristocracy and [...] turned our library [...] into his own, Transylvanian, empire.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} relationship between <b>cleat</b> spacing, <b>cleat</b> height and coal banding texture for Queensland Permian age coals of different rank, four of which are presented here. Whereas relationships between <b>cleat</b> frequency and rank, and with coal type or grade, {{have been reported in}} the past, relationships between the spacing and height among the different kinds of <b>cleats</b> are not quantitatively established. For other layered sedimentary rocks, joint or fracture spacing relates directly to both bed thickness and rock strength. Coal is similar to other layers rocks. Four major classes of <b>cleats</b> were distinguished, which were separate data populations when <b>cleat</b> spacing was plotted against <b>cleat</b> height; master <b>cleats,</b> single vitrain layer <b>cleats,</b> multiple vitrain layer package <b>cleats,</b> and durain (dull coal) <b>cleats.</b> Understanding the relationship between <b>cleat</b> height and spacing for specific coals, and the specific kinds of <b>cleats</b> within those coals, will lead to more accurate predictions of <b>cleat</b> density and hence coal permeability. This can improve modelling and prediction of methane gas deliverability in coal seams. In the Australian Permian coals studied, narrowly spaced <b>cleats</b> exist at all ranks, but the distribution of <b>cleat</b> spacing with <b>cleat</b> height is what varies for specific <b>cleat</b> classes. <b>Cleat</b> spacing was found to be directly proportional to <b>cleat</b> height in most cases...|$|R
40|$|The Pliocene Sajau coals of the Berau Basin {{area have}} a {{moderately}} to highly developed <b>cleat</b> system. Mostly the <b>cleat</b> fractures are well developed in both bright and dull bands, and these <b>cleats</b> are generally inclined or {{perpendicular to the}} bedding planes of the seam. The presence of <b>cleat</b> networks/fractures in coal seam is the important point in coalbed methane prospect. The 3 D X-ray computed tomography (CT) technique was performed to identify <b>cleats</b> characteristics in the Sajau coal seams, such as the direction of coal <b>cleats,</b> geometry of <b>cleat,</b> and <b>cleats</b> mineralization. By CT scan imaging technique {{two different types of}} natural fractures observed in Sajau coals have been identified, that is, face <b>cleats</b> and butt <b>cleats.</b> This technique also identified the direction of face <b>cleats</b> and butt <b>cleats</b> as shown in the resulting 3 D images. Based on the images, face <b>cleats</b> show a NNE-SSW direction while butt <b>cleats</b> have a NW-SE direction. The crosscutting relationship indicated that NNE-SSW <b>cleats</b> were formed earlier than NW-SE <b>cleats.</b> The procedure also identified the types of minerals that filled the <b>cleats</b> apertures. Based on their density, the minerals are categorized as follows: very high density minerals (pyrite), high density minerals (anastase), and low density minerals (kaolinite, calcite) were identified filling the <b>cleats</b> aperture...|$|R
40|$|Characterisation of the <b>cleat</b> network {{serves as}} the basis for {{estimating}} the hydraulic and mechanical seam properties which in turn are fundamental for flow and geomechanical modelling in the context of underground coal mining. <b>Cleat</b> and <b>cleat</b> network geometry can be described as a function of frequency, aperture, size, orientation relative to in situ stresses, connectivity and porosity, with mineralised and un-mineralised <b>cleats</b> occurring. To describe these properties, CT-scans of core samples of a Bowen Basin coal in central Queensland, Australia, are analysed. A unique image processing workflow method is introduced to extract the key statistical parameters of perpendicular butt and face <b>cleats</b> present in a two-dimensional image. As face and butt <b>cleats</b> have different characteristics, the presented method distinguishes face <b>cleats</b> and butt <b>cleats</b> by direction and present detailed data for both <b>cleat</b> types. The results comprise <b>cleat</b> length, apertures, sizes, intensities, densities, shape parameter, spacing, orientation and connectivity and are therefore more comprehensive than previous <b>cleat</b> descriptions. Three generally different <b>cleat</b> geometries are considered within this study, one sample shows perpendicular face and butt <b>cleats,</b> the second two sets of face <b>cleats</b> intersected by butt <b>cleats</b> and the third parallel face <b>cleats</b> only...|$|R

Mr. Freeze also has a new design for the DLC featuring <b>cleated</b> boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm of his suit. In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds Penguin trying to backstab Mr. Freeze into giving him what Freeze is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Mr. Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold, and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze, and that Boyle is in possession of Mr. Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife. Batman later confronts and defeats Mr. Freeze. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voice-over states that Mr. Freeze, Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police.|$|E

40|$|The natural {{vertical}} fracture sys tem in bituminous coalbeds {{is called}} <b>cleat.</b> <b>Cleat</b> orientation commonly controls {{the direction of}} mining with major development paralleling the face <b>cleat.</b> Previous researchers have categorized the origin of <b>cleat</b> as endogenetic, relating the origin of <b>cleat</b> to compaction and coalification, and exogenetic, relating the origin of <b>cleat</b> to tectonic forces. In the coalbeds studied for this report {{it was found that}} tectonic forces were the controlling factor of <b>cleat</b> formation. Face <b>cleats</b> were formed as extension fractures during structural deformation, and butt <b>cleats,</b> as release fractures during erosion and uplift. The face <b>cleat</b> of the Pittsburgh coalbed rotates from N 8020 W in north- western West Virginia to N 5720 W in southwestern Pennsylvania; the face <b>cleat</b> maintains a perpendicular orientation to the shifting axial trend of local structures. <b>Cleat</b> orientation in other bituminous coalbeds in Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, and Central Pennsylvania showed a similar relationship to local structure. Directional permeability of coal is directly related to <b>cleat.</b> Holes drilled perpendicular to the face <b>cleat</b> yield from 2. 5 to 10 times the amount of gas released as compared with holes drilled perpendicular to the butt <b>cleat...</b>|$|R

40|$|Coal {{reservoir}} {{quality in}} the Ferron Sandstone Member of the Mancos Shale, and in the Fruitland Formation is dependent on coal <b>cleat</b> characteristics. Coal reservoir permeability increases {{as a result of}} high <b>cleat</b> density. From careful outcrop examination, we were able to identify several factors that increase <b>cleat</b> density. Vitrain coal typically has the highest fracture density as a result of having well-developed face <b>cleats</b> and conchoidal fractures. Clarain coal contains face and butt <b>cleats.</b> <b>Cleat</b> density in clarain is also controlled by mechanical layer thickness. As mechanical layer thickness decreases, <b>cleat</b> density increases. Durain and fusain coals typically contain no welldeveloped <b>cleat</b> system, although their presence can affect mechanical layer thickness in adjacent coals, as they may form bounding units. <b>Cleat</b> density increases in the damage zone of faults and in the hinge-line of folds. Cleat-controlled reservoir permeability has beneficially affected methane production in one portion of the Drunkards Wash Gas Field, Utah, and appears to have negatively influenced methane production in the coalbed methane field...|$|R
40|$|Examination {{of several}} coalbeds in Walker County, Ala., Cambria, Greene, and Fayette Counties, Pa., and Raleigh and Wyoming Counties, W.

50|$|Lacrosse <b>cleats</b> are {{characterized}} by having a high support for the ankle, and appear most similar to American Football <b>cleats.</b> A raised platform material surrounding the ankles is specific to the motions of players in the game.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the role of shoe height in the context of American football <b>cleats.</b> Eighteen adult males (28. 4 ± 1. 9 years, 182. 3 ± 0. 6 cm, 75. 7 ± 1. 6 kg) performed four football drills (60 -yd dash, 54 -yd cutting drill, 5 - 10 - 5 drill [pro agility drill], and ladder jumping drill) in low-top, mid-top, and high-top American football <b>cleats.</b> Drill-specific performance outcomes were measured after each drill, and the subjects’ ankle range-of-motion (dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, eversion, inversion) and perception of the footwear (comfort, heaviness, stability) were assessed before and after each drill sequence. Performance outcomes were not influenced by shoe height. The high-top <b>cleat</b> limited dorsiflexion and inversion, but not plantarflexion or eversion, compared to low-top and mid-top <b>cleats.</b> Athletes rated the high-top <b>cleats</b> as less comfortable and heavier than either the low-top or mid-top <b>cleats,</b> but perceived the mid-top and high-top <b>cleats</b> to be equally stable to each other, and both more stable than the low-top <b>cleats.</b> Range-of-motion and performance scores did not change as a result of acute exercise. These findings suggest that high-top <b>cleats</b> may limit ankle motions associated with injury without deleteriously influencing performance, though athletes may not perceive the high-top <b>cleats</b> as favorably as low- or mid-top <b>cleats...</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>cleat</b> {{compressibility}} of coal {{is a key}} parameter that is extensively used in {{modeling the}} coal reservoir permeability for Coal Bed Methane (CBM) recovery. <b>Cleat</b> compressibility is often determined from the permeability measurement made at different confining pressures but with a constant pore pressure. Hence, this parameter ignores the sorption strain effects on the <b>cleat</b> compressibility. By using the transient pulse decay (TPD) technique, this study presents the results from a laboratory characterization program using coal core drilled from different bedding directions to estimate gas permeability and coal <b>cleat</b> compressibility under different pore pressures while maintaining effective stress constant. <b>Cleat</b> compressibility was determined from permeability and sorption strain measurements that are made at different pore pressures under an effective stress constant. Results show that the <b>cleat</b> compressibility of coal increases slightly {{with the increase of}} pore pressure. Moreover, the <b>cleat</b> compressibility of Sample P (representing the face <b>cleats</b> in coal) is larger than that of Sample C (representing the butt <b>cleats</b> in coal). This result suggests that <b>cleat</b> compressibility should not be regarded as constant in the modeling of the CBM recovery. Furthermore, the compressibility of face <b>cleats</b> is considerably sensitive to the sorption-induced swelling/shrinkage and offers significant effects on the coal permeability...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cleats</b> (fractures, joints) are {{discontinuities}} in coals, including lignites. They {{are important}} in mining activity because of their gas and water permeability in hard coal, and mainly because of their water permeability in lignites. As opposed to hard-coal <b>cleats,</b> lignite <b>cleats</b> have not been studied in detail before. The present contribution does so, using as an example the 1 st Middle-Polish Lignite Seam (MPLS- 1) in the Jóźwin IIB opencast mine in central Poland. It should be mentioned here that any remarks in the present contribution concerning MPLS- 1 refer exclusively to this lignite seam in the Jóźwin IIB opencast mine. The investigated discontinuities consist of two sets, i. e. the face and butt <b>cleats,</b> which are roughly oriented NW–SE and NE–SW, respectively. The mean spacing of the face <b>cleats</b> is ~ 12. 4 cm, while the mean spacing of the butt <b>cleats</b> is ~ 12. 8 cm. The maximum average aperture is ~ 4. 9 mm for the face <b>cleats</b> and ~ 4. 1 mm for the butt <b>cleats.</b> The <b>cleat</b> spacing and aperture do {{not depend on the}} lignite thickness, but the <b>cleat</b> spacing increases with increasing mineral-matter and xylite content, whereas the aperture increases when the contents decrease. The regional folding and local salt diapirism tentatively explain the formation of the orthogonal system of the lignite <b>cleats,</b> partly because of the parallelism of the face <b>cleats</b> and the major tectonic directions in central Poland...|$|R

50|$|The steps {{themselves}} are solid, one piece, die-cast aluminum or steel. Yellow demarcation lines are sometimes added {{to indicate their}} edges. In most escalator models manufactured after 1950, both the riser and the tread of each step is <b>cleated</b> (given a ribbed appearance) with comb-like protrusions that mesh with the comb plates {{on the top and}} bottom platforms and the succeeding steps in the chain. Seeberger escalators featured flat treads and smooth risers; other escalator models have <b>cleated</b> treads and smooth risers. The steps are linked by a continuous metal chain that forms a closed loop. The front and back edges of the steps each have two wheels, the rear of which are set further apart and fit into the trailer-wheel track while the front set have narrower axles and fit the step-wheel track.|$|E
