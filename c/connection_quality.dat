Ofcom tested typical speeds of broadband services provided by most ISPs in the UK, including BSkyB, BT, Tiscali, AOL, TalkTalk, Plusnet, O2 and Orange.

The varying <b>connection</b> <b>quality</b> results from adaptive resource sharing mechanisms of these networks addressing the time varying data throughput requirements of a varying number of users.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{different}} capabilities and <b>connection</b> <b>qualities</b> typically characterizes receivers of mobile television services. Receiver driven layered multicast (RDLM) offers an efficient way for providing different capabilities over such a broadcast channel. Scalable video coding (SVC) allows for the transmission of multiple video qualities within one media stream. Using SVC generates a video bit stream with various inter layer dependencies due to references between the layers. This work proposes a layeraware forward error correction (L-FEC) approach in combination with SVC. L-FEC increases robustness {{of the more important}} layers by generating protection across layers following existing dependencies of the media stream. The L-FEC is integrated as an extension of a Raptor FEC implementation in a DVB-H broadcast system.

Currently, there is no relevant methodology for a comprehensive evaluation of timetables in general and no selected indicators for evaluating the <b>connection</b> <b>quality</b> on a transport network.

30|$|The {{modification}} of cell service areas {{also has an}} impact on network <b>connection</b> <b>quality.</b> As a result of traffic steering, a user might not be served by the closest base station, providing the minimum pathloss, which might impair <b>connection</b> <b>quality.</b> Although adaptive modulation and coding in LTE partly alleviates this problem, the link adaptation capability is limited. Therefore, traffic steering must be performed carefully to keep Quality-of-Service in a satisfactory level. This is important in indoor scenarios, where coverage holes and severe fading may exist due to wall obstructions and multi-path reflections. For this reason, operators often prefer to keep femtocell power settings on the default (i.e., maximum) values in the absence of precise method to predict propagation losses in indoor environment.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores positive {{communication in}} the workplace; namely, that communication which constitutes <b>quality</b> <b>connections</b> and positive relationships associated with positive organizational climate. High <b>quality</b> <b>connections</b> and positive relationships {{are some of the}} most important dynamics in work life and key to developing a respectful, affirming work climate. By coding their communicative elements, this study develops a new communicative model of positive relationships and <b>quality</b> <b>connections</b> at work which synthesizes contemporary models from the fields of organizational behavior, psychology, and organizational communication. It demonstrates the applicability of this new model with empirical evidence from working professionals’ stories and establishes the model’s link to organizational climate. 	Using an interpretive approach, I conducted 21 interviews with a diverse group of working adults about their best-work experiences. At the time of their best work experiences, working professionals ranged in age from 17 to 57, were employed in 11 different countries, and worked in nine industry sectors; 60 percent were managers. Qualitative content data analysis was utilized to analyze participants’ interviews. Findings provide convincing empirical evidence supporting the initial five proposed dimensions from past models and suggest two other dimensions absent from past models, positive spiral and adventure. These dimensions are key to <b>quality</b> <b>connections</b> and positive relationships at work. Thus, I propose the following dimensions for a new communicative model of positive relationships and <b>quality</b> <b>connections</b> at work: inclusion, instrumental, sensemaking, positive spiral, transparency, generative emotional resources, and adventure.

30|$|In this study, several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} for traffic sharing in an enterprise LTE femtocell scenario. The methods are based on tuning handover margins and/or femtocell transmit power by fuzzy logic controllers. Simulation results in several scenarios {{have shown that the}} proposed methods can decrease call blocking, but some of them deteriorate network <b>connection</b> <b>quality</b> significantly. Having identified interference from the originally congested femtocell as an important limitation, the variation of handover margins has been restricted. Thus, part of the congestion relief effect is achieved while <b>connection</b> <b>quality</b> is kept almost unaltered. Once limitations of simple {{methods have been}} characterized, combined strategies have been designed to overcome the limitations of individual approaches.
