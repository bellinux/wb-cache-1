40|$|Sheep, like humans, show a bias {{in favour}} of the left visual ¢eld when discriminating {{familiar}} faces. This, in humans, {{is thought to be}} caused by a right hemisphere dominance for processing faces involving the temporal cortex. We have directly investigated inter-hemispheric di¡erences in face-processing in sheep by re-cording the frequencies and response pro¢les of single cells in the temporal cortex which respond selectively to faces. While there was no evidence for increased frequencies of face-sensitive neu-roneswithin theright temporal cortex, or their relative selectivity for individual faces, there was a pronounced response latency di¡erence between the two hemispheres. The cells in the left hemisphere responding selectively to particular faces did so up to 400 ms later than those in the right and with a greater degree of temporal variability between cells. No hemispheric latency di¡er-ences were found, however, in other cells responding to general visual stimuli or tomany faces. The data suggest that, while specia-lised face-sensitive neural circuits in the right hemisphere may {{play a key role in}} the rapid (o 200 ms) identi¢cation and discrimi-nation of facial identity, those on the left may be involved more with slower processes associated with integrating the emo-tional or mnemonic <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition.</b> NeuroRepor...|$|E

40|$|Murine polyomavirus (Py) {{infection}} initiates by the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> {{cell membrane}} molecules containing terminal sialic acid (SA) residues through specific binding pockets formed {{at the major}} capsid protein VP 1 surface. VP 1 Pockets 1, 2, and 3 bind terminal SA, Gal, and second branched SA, respectively. The <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> on viral cell entry remains elusive. In this work, we show that preincubation of Py with soluble compounds within Pocket 1 (N-acetyl or N-glycolyl neuraminic acids) increases Py cell binding and infectivity in murine 3 T 6 fibroblasts. In contrast, Gal does not significantly alter Py binding nor infectivity, whereas sialyllactose, in Pockets 1 and 2, decreases cell binding and infectivity. Binding experiments with Py virus-like particles confirmed the direct involvement of VP 1 in this effect. To determine whether such results could reflect VP 1 conformational changes induced by SA binding, protease digestion assays were performed after pretreatment of Py or virus-like particles with soluble receptor fragments. Binding of SA with the VP 1 Pocket 1, but not of compounds interacting with Pocket 2, {{was associated with a}} transition of this protein from a protease-sensitive to a protease-resistant state. This effect was transmitted to the minor capsid proteins VP 2 and VP 3 in virus particles. Attachment of Py to cell monolayers similarly led to a VP 1 trypsin-resistant pattern. Taken together, these data present evidence that initial binding of Py to terminal SA induces conformational changes in the viral capsid, which may influence subsequent virus cell entry steps.

In contrast, sites under positive selection shifted from one longitudinal sample to the next in short-term progressors.

40|$|Magnaporthe oryzae is {{the causal}} agent of rice blast disease, a devastating problem worldwide. This fungus has caused {{breakdown}} of resistance conferred by newly developed commercial cultivars. To address how the rice blast fungus adapts itself to new resistance genes so quickly, we examined chromosomal locations of AVR-Pita, a subtelomeric gene family {{corresponding to the}} Pita resistance gene, in various isolates of M. oryzae (including wheat and millet pathogens) and its related species. We found that AVR-Pita (AVR-Pita 1 and AVR-Pita 2) is highly variable in its genome location, occurring in chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and supernumerary chromosomes, particularly in rice-infecting isolates. When expressed in M. oryzae, most of the AVR-Pita homologs could elicit Pita-mediated resistance, even those from non-rice isolates. AVR-Pita was flanked by a retrotransposon, which presumably contributed to its multiple translocation across the genome. On the other hand, family member AVR-Pita 3, which lacks avirulence activity, was stably located on chromosome 7 in {{a vast majority of}} isolates. These results suggest that the diversification in genome location of AVR-Pita in the rice isolates is a <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> by Pita in rice. We propose a model that the multiple translocation of AVR-Pita may be associated with its frequent loss and recovery mediated by its transfer among individuals in asexual populations. This model implies that the high mobility of AVR-Pita is a key mechanism accounting for the rapid adaptation toward Pita. Dynamic adaptation of some fungal plant pathogens may be achieved by deletion and recovery of avirulence genes using a population as a unit o...|$|R

40|$|Loneliness {{among young}} people is a growing problem in the Danish society today. Not only is {{loneliness}} an un-pleasant feeling, {{in the long term}} it can also cause severe consequences for the individual. This thesis studies loneliness among young Danish people. It is based on qualitative interviews with seven young people at the age of 19 to 27 years old. These seven people constitute the empirical foundation. A qualitative analysis, parted in three, is being thoroughly examined on the basis of social psychology. The first part points out how the interviewees describe loneliness and how they tackle it. The second part investigates how loneliness in the youth {{can be seen as a}} <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> tendencies in the postmodern society. Finally, the third part analyzes the importance of meeting other young people who also have experiences with loneliness. To make this assessment I apply critical theory from Axel Honneth and social psychology from George Herbert Mead. Furthermore the theoretical frame is being supplemented with modernity theorists as Lars Dencik, Rasmus Willig og Carsen René Jørgensen. One of the conclusions is that the individual has a need for recognition to achieve a positive sense of the self and creation of identity. Loneliness can therefore be considered a <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>recognition.</b> Another conclusion is that it is of great importance to the interviewees to meet other young people with whom they share the feelings of loneliness. Finally, a third conclusion is that the individualistic tendencies in the western world today, lead to the assumption that loneliness is a taboo which is often considered an individual concern.

40|$|The Polycomb repressive {{complexes}} PRC 1 and PRC 2 play {{a central}} role in developmental gene regulation, functioning, at least in part, by catalyzing specific histone modifications, H 2 AK 119 u 1 and H 3 K 27 me 3, respectively. The hierarchical model of Polycomb recruitment proposes that PRC 2 is recruited to target loci by sequence specific factors and/or non-coding RNAs, and that PRC 1 recruitment occurs subsequently as a <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> H 3 K 27 me 3 by the PRC 1 subunit CBX. However, non-canonical PRC 1 complexes, defined by the presence of different PCGF subunits, lack the CBX subunit and are therefore recruited independently of PRC 2 activity. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that H 2 AK 119 u 1 catalyzed by non-canonical PRC 1 can directly recruit PRC 2, establishing a reverse model of Polycomb recruitment. I analyzed Polycomb recruitment using a classical model system, X chromosome inactivation mediated by Xist RNA. Previous reports suggested that Polycomb recruitment to the inactive X chromosome is initiated by a direct interaction of PRC 2 subunits with Xist RNA, and that PRC 1 is then recruited via interaction of the CBX subunit with PRC 2 mediated H 3 K 27 me 3. This model has been challenged, since it does not account for all experimental observations. In this thesis, I provide evidence that Polycomb recruitment by Xist RNA is initiated by deposition of H 2 AK 119 u 1 by noncanonical PRC 1 complexes. PRC 2 is therefore recruited indirectly, presumably by binding to H 2 AK 119 u 1. I also show that all non-canonical PRC 1 complexes are enriched on the inactive chromosome, albeit with different dynamic behaviors. PCGF 3 - and PCGF 5 -PRC 1 complexes, which have a slower dynamics on the inactive chromosome as determined by FRAP, are necessary for the initiation of Polycomb domain formation on the inactive chromosome, presumably through direct recruitment by Xist RNA or through an adaptor protein that mediates this interaction. Subsequent enrichment of other non-canonical PRC 1 complexes relies predominantly on H 2 AK 119 u 1 recognition by RYBP/YAF 2, which also contributes to the enrichment of the more dynamic fraction of PCGF 3 - and PCGF 5 -PRC 1 complexes on the inactive chromosome. Altogether, these observations overturn existing models for Polycomb recruitment by Xist RNA, and thereby, provide new insights into the dynamics and mechanisms for Polycomb recruitment by non-coding RNAs. </p...|$|R

The present situation where computer games are classified according {{to the needs of the}} entities trading in copyright contradicts the principle of clarity and certainty of law. The article presents the adverse effects (to a limited extent concerning the remuneration for the so called inserts) triggered by sub-categorizing computer games as audiovisual works. It cannot be ruled out that the copyright collective management organizations will begin vindication of dues for compensation for the reproduction of works – computer games on copies designated for own personal use directly from the publishers of computer games. The Author of the article by pointing out the possible <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> computer games as audiovisual works takes a position that in this regard it is also necessary to amend the provisions of copyright law.

This definition, with its reference point in the natural law, sidesteps self-referential definitional frameworks and anchors the orientation {{of the rule of law}} within the ultimate and essential goal of all law, namely to promote and guarantee the dignity of the human person and the common good.” ...|$|R

The research goal of this project is to find the right balance between the effort necessary from the user to learn a new or artificial language and the resulting benefit of robust communication between a robot and the user as a direct <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> optimized speech <b>recognition.</b> To measure the first criteria we have explored two methods to evaluate language learnability, namely Language Tests and analyzing expressed emotions during interaction in an artificial language. Our results indicate that both have potential in being used as measurement tools for evaluating the learnability of artificial languages...|$|R
