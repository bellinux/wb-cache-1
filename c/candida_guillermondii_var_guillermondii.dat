40|$|This article {{reports the}} results on the {{composition}} and antifungal effect of volatile extracts obtained from the aerial parts of Sardinian wild fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and by hydrodistillation (HD). The extracts were analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry for qualitative composition and gas chromatography-flame ionisation detector to establish the percentage of constituents. The main components were fenchone (7. 1 % vs. 8. 8 %), estragole (34. 9 % vs. 42. 6 %) and (E) -anethole (24. 6 % vs. 43. 4 %) in the SFE and HD extract, respectively. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured according to the reference Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth macrodilution protocols. Minimum lethal concentrations were determined by subsequent subculturing of the same cell suspensions in solid medium. The essential oil was more active against Candida albicans, whereas the supercritical fluid extract possesses higher activity against <b>Candida</b> <b>guillermondii</b> and Cryptococcus neoformans, with MIC values of 0. 32 μL/mL...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} the conjunctival fungal flora {{and to determine}} the susceptibility of 2 isolated molds to antifungal drugs in samples of 64 healthy horses (128 eyes) from the national stud in Switzerland. Procedure: Conjunctival cytobrush samples were collected from both eyes of 64 ophthalmologically normal horses and subsequently cultured on Sabouraud’s agar medium. Growing fungi were identified and counted. E-tests or broth microdilution tests for Aspergillus fumigatus and Eurotium amstelodami were carried out to determine antifungal drug sensitivity. These species had previously been detected in samples from eyes with keratomycosis in Switzerland. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B and miconazole were recorded to evaluate drug sensitivity. Results: Eleven genera of fungi were identified. The most common fungal genera were Alternaria, Rhizopus, Cladosporium and Eurotium. Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. were isolated frequently, while no Fusarium spp. was found. In only 2 cases yeasts were identified as <b>Candida</b> <b>guillermondii.</b> For certain fungal species bedding and housing (indoor vs. outdoor) appeared to influence their prevalence. Susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus and E. amstelodami showed consistently best results with low MICs for voriconazole. High MICs for fluconazole were detected for all tested fungi while MICs for itraconazole, amphotericin B and miconazole were variable. Conclusions: A large range of fungal mold species was identified including A. fumigatus and E. amstelodami, which have been causative agents of keratomycosis in Switzerland. Best in vitro susceptibility results for these two species were obtained for voriconazole. Support: ECVO Research Grant 201...|$|R
40|$|Blood stream infections (BSIs) remain one of {{the major}} causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality for patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the present study, we evaluated the incidence and characteristics of BSI within 1 year after allogeneic HSCT in 269 consecutive adult patients who received antibacterial prophylaxis with levofloxacin. Cumulative incidence of BSI was 12 % (95 % confidence interval, 8 - 16 %). Bacteria were responsible for 30 out of the 32 BSI, while fungi were responsible for 2 episodes of BSI. The median onset of BSI was day 8 (range 1 - 328 days) post transplant, and 66 % of BSI occurred before neutrophil recovery. Gram-positive organisms accounted for 60 % (n= 18) of bacteremia, and gram-negative isolates for 40 % (n= 12) of the cases. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most commonly isolated gram-positive pathogens (53 % of the cases), while Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated gram-negative bacteria (58 % of the cases). Candida albicans and <b>Candida</b> <b>guillermondii</b> were isolated from patients with candidemia. Resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQ) was common with 13 % of gram-positive isolates being susceptible to FQ, while 50 % of the gram-negative rods were susceptible to FQ. Crude mortality and mortality attributable to BSI were both 3 % (1 of 32). In conclusion, our data suggest that despite the emergence of antibiotic resistance, FQ prophylaxis may be considered an appealing approach in allogeneic HSCT recipients and is also worth evaluating in randomized studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundCurrently {{there is}} an urgent need to develop new classes of {{antimicrobial}} agents with different mechanisms of action from conventionally antibiotics used for the control of pathogenic microorganisms. The acylpolyamine called VdTX-I was isolated from the venom of the tarantula Vitalius dubius, and first described with activity as an antagonist of nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the antimicrobial activity found in the venom of the spider, with emphasis on the toxin VdTX-I. MethodsAntimicrobial assays were performed in 96 well plates culture against 14 micro-organisms (fungi, yeasts and bacteria), which were tested concentrations from 0. 19 to 100 μM of VdTX-I. After qualitative analysis, dose-response curve assays were performed in bacterial kill curve using MTT reagent and hemolytic assay. ResultsThe antimicrobial activity of the VdTX-I toxin was observed in 12 tested species of Candida, Trichosporiun, Staphylococcus and Micrococcus. The toxicity had a dose-response at 3. 12 µM – 100 μM in <b>Candida</b> albicans, <b>Candida</b> <b>guillermondii,</b> Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli. VdTX-I took about 5 min to inhibit bacterial growth, which was faster than streptomycin. The toxin showed no hemolytic activity between 0. 19 and 100 μM. At 2. 5 µg/mL of toxin it was observed no growth inhibition against a mammalian cell lineage. ConclusionsThe VdTX-I toxin has a significant antimicrobial activity, with broad spectrum, and is experimentally inert to mammalian blood cells. General SignificanceThis paper explores the antimicrobial potential of the spider toxin VdTX-I, which can provide a new model to design new antimicrobial drugs...|$|R
40|$|Platelet microbicidal protein (PMP) is {{released}} from platelets {{in response to}} thrombin stimulation. PMP is known to possess in vitro bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and viridans group streptococci. To determine whether PMP is active against other intravascular pathogens, we evaluated its potential fungicidal activity against strains of Candida species and Cryptococcus neoformans. Anionic resin adsorption and gel electrophoresis confirmed that the fungicidal activity of PMP resided in a small (approximately 8. 5 -kDa), cationic protein, identical to previous studies of PMP-induced bacterial killing (M. R. Yeaman, S. M. Puentes, D. C. Norman, and A. S. Bayer, Infect. Immun. 60 : 1202 - 1209, 1992). When assayed over a 180 -min period in vitro, the susceptibilities of these fungi to PMP varied considerably. Generally, Candida albicans strains (mean survival, 33. 5 % +/- 6. 9 % [n = 6]) as well as isolates of Candida glabrata (mean survival, 50. 8 % +/- 2. 9 % [n = 2]) were the most susceptible to killing by PMP, while <b>Candida</b> <b>guillermondii</b> and <b>Candida</b> parapsilosis were relatively resistant to PMP-induced killing. Compared with C. albicans, C. neoformans was relatively resistant to the fungicidal activity of PMP, with a mean survival among the isolates studied of 77. 4 % +/- 12. 4 % (n = 6). Against C. albicans, PMP-induced fungicidal activity was time dependent (range, 0 to 180 min), PMP concentration dependent (range, 10 to 150 U/ml), and inversely related to the fungal inoculum (range, 5 x 10 (3) to 1 x 10 (5) CFU/ml). Scanning electron microscopy of PMP-exposed C. albicans and C. neoformans cells revealed extensive surface damage and collapse, suggesting that the site of PMP fungicidal action may directly or indirectly involve the fungal cell envelope...|$|R
40|$|Fungi {{appear to}} be unique in their {{requirement}} for a third soluble translation elongation factor. This factor, designated elongation factor 3 (EF- 3), exhibits ribosome-dependent ATPase and GTPase activities that are not intrinsic to the fungal ribosome but are nevertheless essential for translation elongation in vivo. The EF- 3 polypeptide has been identified {{in a wide range}} of fungal species and the gene encoding EF- 3 (YEF 3) has been isolated from four fungal species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, <b>Candida</b> albicans, <b>Candida</b> <b>guillermondii,</b> and Pneumocystis carinii). Computer-assisted analysis of the predicted S. cerevisiae EF- 3 amino acid sequence was used to identify several potential functional domains; two ATP binding/catalytic domains conserved with equivalent domains in members of the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) family of proteins, an amino-terminal region showing significant similarity to the E. coli S 5 ribosomal protein, and regions of predicted interaction with rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. Furthermore, EF- 3 was also found to display amino acid similarity to myosin proteins whose cellular function is to provide the motive force of muscle. The identification of these regions provides clues to both the evolution and function of EF- 3. The predicted functional regions are conserved among all known fungal EF- 3 proteins and a recently described homologue encoded by the Chlorella virus CVK 2. We propose that EF- 3 may play a role in the ribosomal optimization of the accuracy of fungal protein synthesis by altering the conformation and activity of a ribosomal ''accuracy center,'' which is equivalent to the S 4 -S 5 -S 12 ribosomal protein accuracy center domain of the E. coli ribosome. Furthermore, we suggest that EF- 3 represents an evolving ribosomal protein with properties analogous to the intrinsic ATPase activities of higher eukaryotic ribosomes, which has wider implications for the evolutionary divergence of fungi from other eukaryotes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Onychomycosis of the fingernails and toenails is {{generally}} caused by dermatophytes and yeasts. Toenail mycoses involve mainly dermatophytes but when Candida is also involved, the strain most commonly isolated worldwide is C. albicans. Aims: To determine Candida strains prevailing in onychomycosis. Materials and Methods: A retrospective, observational and descriptive study of fungal cultures retrieved from the registry of the microbiology laboratory of the Pontificia Universidad Católica was performed. Specimens obtained from patients attending the healthcare network between December 2007 and December 2010 was analyzed. Statistical Analysis: A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Results: Candida was retrieved from 467 of 8443 specimens (52 % fingernails and 48 % toenails). Cultures were negative in 5320 specimens (63. 6 %). Among Candida-positive cultures, parapsilosis {{was the most}} commonly isolated strain with 202 cases (43. 3 %). While isolates of <b>Candida</b> <b>guillermondii</b> were 113 (24. 2 %), those of Candida albicans were 110 (23. 6 %), those of spp. were 20 (4. 3 %) and there were 22 cases of other isolates (4. 71 %). Among the 467 patients with positive cultures for Candida, 136 (29, 1 %) were men and 331 (70, 9 %) were women. All patients were older than 18 years old. Clinical files were available for only 169 of the 467 patients with positive cultures for Candida. For those, age, gender, underlying illnesses and use of immunossupresive agents during the trial was reviewed. Conclusions: The present study shows that both C. parapsilosis as well as C. guillermondii appear as emerging pathogens {{that would be in}} fact taking the place of C. albicans as the most commonly isolated pathogen in patients with Candida onychomycosis. The relative percentage of C parapsilosis increases every year. Identification of Candida strains as etiological agents of nail candidiasis becomes relevant to the management both nail as well as systemic candidiasis, in view of the resistance to conventional treatments readily reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Food {{processing}} industries typically produce {{large quantities}} of high strength organic wastewater. The standard approach for such wastewater would be anaerobic pretreatment. However, the wastewater from the Quaker Oats Company located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa USA contained furfural, which {{was found to be}} toxic to anaerobic microorganisms.;In this study, batch and continuous laboratory scale experiments were performed to investigate the treatment of furfural-based wastewater using aerobic yeast. Three yeasts, <b>Candida</b> <b>guillermondii,</b> C. tropicalis, and C. utilis, were first studied in batch tests. All yeast cultures could lower the COD in the wastewater by more than 90 %.;As the work was done under non-aseptic conditions, bacterial growth also occurred. Much of the work focused on finding operational conditions to minimize bacterial growth. At a pH of 4. 5, the maximum specific growth rate, mu max, of C. utilis and bacteria were 0. 13 h- 1 and 0. 03 h- 1 and the value of half-saturation coefficient for substrate, Ks, were 160 mg COD/L and 12 mg COD/L, respectively. Accordingly, when substrate concentrations were higher than 30 mg COD/L, yeast grew faster than bacteria.;Yeast cultivation in continuously stirred aerobic reactors was studied with different yeast cultures. The effect of the age of the yeast or solids retention time (SRT) on reactor performance was investigated initially. SRT values of 1. 0, 1. 3, 1. 5, 1. 75, and 2 days were investigated and the reactors were controlled at a constant pH of 4. 5 and temperature of 35 °C. C. tropicalis and C. utilis and mixed cultures of these two yeast were used. The results showed that an SRT of 1. 5 days was optimal to treat wastewater, maintain the yeast culture, and minimize bacterial contamination. All three yeast cultures could remove COD from the wastewater up to 90 % at this SRT.;Subsequently, the effect of temperature on yeast performance was studied. C. tropicalis and C. utilis were studied in separate reactors. Two reactors were run at temperatures of 25, 30, 35, and 40 °C. The SRT and pH were controlled at 1. 5 day of 4. 0 respectively. The results indicated that the optimum operating temperature in terms of removal efficiency, yeast biomass yield, and prevention of bacterial contamination was 30 °C. Under these conditions, both C. tropicalis and C. utilis could remove COD by 90 %.;Finally, the effect of pH on yeast performance was investigated. C. tropicalis and C. utilis were studied in separate reactors. The reactors were operated at different pH values, i. e. 3. 0, 3. 5, 4. 0, 4. 5, 5. 0, and 5. 5. The SRT and temperature of 30 °C were controlled at 1. 5 days and 30 °C respectively. The higher pH increased the removal efficiency. Bacterial contamination was significant at pH values of 5. 0 and 5. 5. Therefore, the optimum pH range in terms of treatment efficiency, yeast biomass yield, and preventing bacterial contamination was between 4. 0 and 4. 5. At this pH range, more than 90 % COD removal was accomplished in both reactors...|$|R
