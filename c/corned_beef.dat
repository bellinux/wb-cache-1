5|$|Local mainstays of Cleveland's cuisine {{include an}} {{abundance}} of Polish and Central European contributions, such as kielbasa, stuffed cabbage and pierogies. Cleveland also has plenty of <b>corned</b> <b>beef,</b> with nationally renowned Slyman's, on the near East Side, a perennial winner of various accolades from Esquire Magazine, including being named the best <b>corned</b> <b>beef</b> sandwich in America in 2008. Other famed sandwiches include the Cleveland original, Polish Boy, a local favorite found at many BBQ and Soul food restaurants. With its blue-collar roots well intact, and plenty of Lake Erie perch available, the tradition of Friday night fish fries remains alive and thriving in Cleveland, particularly in church-based settings and during the season of Lent. Ohio City {{is home to a}} growing brewery district, which includes Great Lakes Brewing Company (Ohio's oldest microbrewery); Market Garden Brewery next to the historic West Side Market and Platform Beer Company.|$|E
5|$|Many pre-Code films {{dealt with}} the {{economic}} realities of a country struggling to find its next meal. In Blonde Venus (1932), Marlene Dietrich's character resorts to prostitution to feed her child, and Claudette Colbert's character in It Happened One Night (1934) gets her comeuppance for throwing a tray of food onto the floor by later finding herself without food or financial resources. Joan Blondell's character in Big City Blues (1932) reflects that as a chorus girl she regularly received diamonds and pearls as gifts, but now must content herself with a <b>corned</b> <b>beef</b> sandwich. In Union Depot (1932), Douglas Fairbanks Jr. puts a luscious meal as {{the first order of}} business on his itinerary after coming into money.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{permitted}} the POWs to build septic systems and irrigation ditches throughout the prisoner {{side of the}} camp. An onsite commissary was available to sell items such as bananas, eggs, coffee, notebooks, and cigarettes. Recreational activities allowed for baseball, horseshoes, and ping pong matches. In addition, a 3,000-book library was allowed (much of which {{was provided by the}} Red Cross), and films were shown occasionally. A bulldog was kept by the prisoners, and served as a mascot for the camp. Each year around Christmas, the Japanese guards gave permission for the Red Cross to donate a small box to each of the prisoners, containing items such as <b>corned</b> <b>beef,</b> instant coffee, and tobacco. Prisoners were also able to send postcards to relatives, although they were censored by the guards.|$|E

Some, like American-style <b>corned</b> <b>beef,</b> are highly seasoned and often considered delicatessen fare.|$|E
25|$|In postwar Aberdeen (1964) a {{large-scale}} (>400 cases) outbreak of typhoid occurred, caused by contaminated <b>corned</b> <b>beef</b> {{which had been}} imported from Argentina. The <b>corned</b> <b>beef</b> was placed in cans and because the cooling plant had failed, cold river water from the Plate estuary was used to cool the cans. One of the cans had a defect and the meat inside was contaminated. This meat was then sliced using a meat slicer in a shop in Aberdeen, {{and a lack of}} cleaning the machinery led to spreading the contamination to other meats cut in the slicer. These meats were then eaten by the people of Aberdeen who then became ill.|$|E

25|$|In Mandatory Palestine, {{demand for}} kosher canned meats {{increased}} as Spam became more popular during World War II. Canned meat was briefly mentioned during wartime from 1939–43, but the true boom in kosher canned meat came in 1945. This is when kosher canned meat became the key item in Europe's Jewish war victim relief packages. Then in 1946, the Chicago Kosher Sausage Manufacturing Company registered a patent for a kosher canned meat product called Breef. Made of beef, Breef {{has a similar}} texture to Spam but tastes like <b>corned</b> <b>beef.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2017, Hawaii {{was plagued}} by a rash of thefts of Spam. Spam had long been a target of thieves in Hawaii, but the {{magnitude}} of the thefts ramped up, with incidents in which multiple cases of Spam were stolen at once. Local retailers believe organized crime was involved. This came alongside increases in thefts of some other retail goods, such as <b>corned</b> <b>beef</b> and liquor. The president of the retail merchants of Hawaii attributed the rise in retail thefts to a recent change in criminal law, which raised the threshold at which a theft would lead to felony charges by approximately $400.|$|E
25|$|Among American-born {{citizens}} of Polish ancestry, roughly 50% report eating Polish dishes, and many can name {{a variety of}} Polish foods unprompted. Whereas over 60% of Italian Americans reported eating Italian food {{at least once a}} week, less than 10% of Polish Americans ate Polish food once a week. This figure is still a higher occurrence than Irish Americans, who can only name a few traditional Irish foods (typically <b>corned</b> <b>beef</b> and cabbage), and only 30% report eating Irish food each year. Even fewer English, Dutch, and Scottish Americans can report that they eat ethnic cuisine regularly.|$|E
500|$|Under Charles Carnan Ridgely, Hampton {{reached its}} peak of [...] in the 1820s.

Santa Anna sent more couriers to Gaona and Filisola to urge them to hurry; Filisola was still at the Rio Grande.|$|R
25|$|In 1917, the United States entered World War I {{and farmers}} {{as well as}} all Iowans {{experienced}} a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since {{the beginning of the war}} in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity. Along with farmers everywhere, they were urged to be patriotic by increasing their production. Farmers purchased more land and raised more <b>corn,</b> <b>beef,</b> and pork for the war effort. It seemed that no one could lose as farmers expanded their operations, made more money, and at the same time, helped the Allied war effort.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the 2nd (British) Battalion of the Imperial Camel Corps joined Arab irregulars in a raid {{east of the}} Jordan. They first {{captured}} and destroyed the railway station at Mudawara, finally cutting the Hejaz Railway, and then mounted a reconnaissance near Amman, scattering <b>corned</b> <b>beef</b> tins and documents as proof of their presence. Lawrence sent agents to openly buy up huge quantities of forage in the same area. As a final touch, British newspapers and messages were filled with reports of a race meeting to take place on 19 September, the day on which the attack was to be launched.|$|E

25|$|Tonga {{is notable}} for its high obesity rates with over 90% of the {{population}} being overweight. Consequently, many Tongan islanders have {{an increased risk of}} heart disease, diabetes and other obesity related diseases which place the nation's health service under considerable strain. Much of this is related to the nation's cultural love of food and eating as well as the modern influx of cheap and high-fat content meat, with <b>corned</b> <b>beef</b> and lamb belly remaining firm favourites in Tongan cuisine. Despite being a highly obese population, there is little stigma attached to being overweight as one might find in many Western civilizations. Like a great number of South Pacific cultures, large bodies are often revered, though there is growing acknowledgment of the health risks involved.|$|E

25|$|In {{every year}} since 1991, March has been proclaimed Irish-American Heritage Month by the US Congress or President due to the date of Saint Patrick's Day. Christian {{denominations}} in the United States observing this feast day include the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Protestant Episcopal Church, and the Roman Catholic Church. Today, Saint Patrick's Day is widely celebrated in America by Irish and non-Irish alike. For most Irish-Americans, this holiday is both religious and festive. It {{is one of the}} leading days for consumption of alcohol in the United States, as individuals are allowed to break their Lenten sacrifices for the day in order to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day. The consumption of artificially colored green beer is a common celebration. Green Beer Day, for instance, is a tradition among students at Miami University (Miami of Ohio), dating to 1952; the day has been held on the Thursday before spring break due to the fact that Saint Patrick's Day often occurs during the spring recess. The holiday has been criticized for promoting over-indulgence in alcohol, resulting in drunk driving, property damage, absenteeism, public urination and vomiting, and other ill effects. A notable difference between traditions widely observed in the United States versus those of Ireland is the consumption of <b>corned</b> <b>beef,</b> which is not a traditional Irish dish, but rather one that was adopted by the new immigrants upon their arrival in the 19th Century.|$|E
