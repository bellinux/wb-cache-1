40|$|It is {{well known}} that most of {{learning}} in educational institutions is assessment driven. The Department of Health & Chiropractic is faced with assessment issues different to a majority of other Departments within the university. We have taken the opportunity offered by the Leadership and assessment; Strengthening the Nexus Project to initiate a bottom-up approach to assessment across various subjects within this Department. Participatory Action Research (PAR) offers an excellent avenue for a collegial approach to this issue. The objectives of this sub-project are to: i) Increase awareness of scholarship in teaching and learning with particular reference to assessment amongst the academics of the Department; ii) Initiate and facilitate the practice of reflective assessment, and iii) Develop ‘best practice’ assessment strategies within the department of health & chiropractic. The features that are distinctive to this department are the need to facilitate learning in the psychomotor as well as cognitive domains. Assessing psychomotor skills generally requires a criterion-referenced approach. However, the Department is placed within the paradigm of a norm-referenced University system. This creates a number of challenges. These challenges and the implications of these to the teaching and learning practice within the Department will be discussed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this phenomenological study was to {{describe}} and interpret the common, shared meanings {{of the experience of}} aged care nursing {{from the perspective of the}} registered nurse working in a nursing home. There are insufficient registered nurses being attracted into aged care, with resulting difficulties in maintaining regular staffing levels in nursing homes. Previous studies conducted in Australia have predominantly used quantitative research methods to investigate various influences QD the recruitment and retention of aged care nurses. These studies do not take into account the practitioners 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their experience of aged care nursing. A purposive sample of 15 registered nurses was interviewed and the resulting data were analysed using phenomenology to identify thematic structures of the experience of aged care nursing. The NUD. IST qualitative data analysis software package was used as an analysis tool. Significant statements were coded, patterns and relations between categories were identified and the categories were clustered into conceptual, hierarchical themes. Four major themes emerged as being central to the experience of aged care nursing-Gratification, Rapport, Non-productivity and Conflict. While constraints and obstacles to productivity and personal and political conflict may be seen as the negative aspects of aged care, these experiences were relieved by uplifting events described within the framework of resident care and rapport, and <b>collegial</b> support. The <b>nature</b> of aged care nursing is both complex and ambiguous but nurses have readily identified the interwoven threads of the experience.

40|$|Throughout Africa, {{the dual}} {{influences}} of globalisation and decentralisation are increasingly gaining a foothold. As a result, agricultural production {{has become a}} high-risk activity, a situation made worse by two key handicaps: natural disasters and the disorganised state of producers. Against that, {{there is a strong}} demand for quality products and we should find ways to meet it. Where can we find the tools to do so? Farmers need to have access to knowledge and know-how if they are to succeed in improving their production, both in terms of quality and quantity. They have long been hindered by traditional methods of agricultural extension work characterised by being either contractual, such as the trial-and-demonstration model, or consultative, making much of trying to take endogenous knowledge into account. These models were managed {{in the hands of the}} trainers and did not properly involve farmers. It is little wonder that they either failed, or had rather mediocre results. Today, another model is emerging, which is <b>collegial</b> in <b>nature,</b> characterised by a sharing approach. In this, farmers have become partners and they are involved in all steps of decision-making. In our work in Benin, the national research services have followed this line and have come out with a new methodological tool: the village-level participatory approach (VPA). It brings together the stakeholder partners: farmers, growers, fisherfolk, fish-farmers, herdsmen, foresters, rural women, NGOs and development associations at all levels of the process. They are involved in analysing constraints on the land, improving agricultural production systems and in natural resource management. This has, in turn, helped to strengthen the extension system, and to arrive at a participatory method of planning development activities. The village-level participatory approach has four basic components: a general diagnosis of the situation; an analysis of the problems at hand and identification of solutions; planning; and setting up a consultative committee. This consultative committee is open to all levels of occupation, and it has captured the interest of farmers in no uncertain way. They know exactly what they want, and they have caught on that their future was in their hands. The programme started in Benin in 1998. Today it covers more than 1, 000 villages across the country and in 77 sub-prefectures. It works through multi-disciplinary teams and has a rigorous system of monitoring and evaluation. After three years of experience, it can be safely said the level of awareness on the part of the farmers has evolved. They are now fully devoted to their work, well-accustomed to their tasks and receptive to new ideas. Now it is a question of helping them to be better protected against pre- and post-harvest diseases and attacks, including in the area of storage. They are prepared to take risks, to work hard and to throw themselves at their work with great determination. No programme, no study, no development plan can even contemplate being objective from now on without following this project, that much is clear. The idea behind decentralisation is that it is local communities which manage their own affairs, under the supervision of the State. If this process is to succeed, we need to make sure that the bodies of governance are closer to the governed, and that decision-making bodies are transferred to the levels of government and administration which are closest to the field. As a phenomenon, decentralisation is well established in Europe, and it has also made great progress in Africa. Here, in countries such as Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia it has given an important impetus to rural development, which has moved forward as a result. In other countries, those with a centralised form of government such as Benin, the day of decentralisation has also arrived. The government has taken all the necessary steps, legal, social and institutional, to move into decentralisation mode. The government is playing its role as guide, monitor and regulator, and large-scale information campaigns are underway. At the forefront of all this, the VPA has taken the lead in already encouraging producers to manage their own affairs. Despite these moves, it has to be admitted that rural development is a fragile and vulnerable practice, and it needs locally elected representatives and their advisers to meet certain conditions. They have to play the game fair and square with their constituents and be accountable for their activities and decisions. It should be possible to achieve local sustainable development through the strategy of decentralisation, if it makes use of the VPA. Then we can confront the problems of poverty and open a new path towards rural development at the grassroots. This is an opportunity which we must not miss.

30|$|The WoWt {{procedures}} formalized in {{this study}} were always established through a systematic, daily collective discussion designed to determine the most appropriate level of care for each hospitalized patient. End-of-life care in France is legally framed under the French law 2005 – 370 of April 22, 2005 relating to Patients’ rights and to the end of life (so called Leonetti’s law), which authorizes the withholding or withdrawal of curative therapies when deemed “useless, disproportionate or to have no other effect than solely the artificial preservation of life” [14]. Continuing such treatment with no hope of cure or benefit would equate to an unreasonable obstinacy, especially for patients who are no longer able to express their wishes. In this setting, the law stipulates that any WoWt decision may only be taken after a formal procedure of collegial debates. Obtaining an external opinion from an independent consultant is a compulsory part of the procedure. In addition to medical factors, the Leonetti’s law stipulates that the discussions must integrate the patient’s wishes voiced or written in advance directives, the opinion of the trusted person (if appointed), {{as well as that of}} the family and close relations. All proceedings and decisions taken during discussions are recorded in the patient’s medical file. Despite the <b>collegial</b> <b>nature</b> of the procedure, the physician in charge of the patient remains liable for the final decision. Once a life-support withdrawal decision has been made, delivering comfort care becomes priority. While the technical environment of our ICU does not offer optimal conditions for a quiet end-of-life, therapies from this point exclusively focus on relieving pain, anxiety, and discomfort—what needs to be done when there is nothing more to be done.|$|E

A qualitative approach, {{in the form of a}} case study, was adopted for the research. Data was collected by means of interviews, observation and the analysis of historical documents. A pilot study assisted with the identification of key themes and potential avenues of information. The comprehensive narrative indicates the use of appropriate means of qualitative data reduction, analysis and display. The NDIE B. Ed course differs from traditional B. Ed courses. Within the present context of teacher education in Pakistan, the study showed that the course was innovative in terms of its curriculum content; teaching and assessment methods; provision and use of educational resources; approach to school experience and teaching practice and the <b>collegial</b> <b>nature</b> of staff/student relationships. The respondents perceived the institute to be making a positive impact with respect to the implementation of change or innovation in teacher education, teacher socialization and educational leadership and formation within the Catholic Church in Pakistan. The importance of both the personal and professional development components of teacher education courses in raising the self esteem and confidence of teachers was indicated by the study's findings. The data provided by the respondents indicated that innovation is possible within the constraints of a traditional teacher training course and identifies the importance of establishing networks to support and maintain change initiatives and develop educational leadership.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this thesis}} is {{investigate}} if the Norwegian Supreme Court exhibits a state friendly nature when they vote in dissenting civilian cases {{where one of the}} litigants is the state in the time period 1991 - 2012. The state friendly hypothesis holds that the state tends to win more cases than private litigants, and that this tendency can't be explained by only the legal aspects of a case. Therefore this thesis will explore the non-legal factors that are apt to influence how a justice votes. Some of these factors are the ideology of the justice, measured by appointing government, the personal traits of the justice, factors connected to the case and the influence of the <b>collegial</b> <b>nature</b> of the court. This {{can be summed up in}} the research question: What factors influences the Supreme Court Justices in dissenting cases where the state is one of the litigants. There are several theoretical models for analysing the voting behaviour of the Supreme Court. The most central of these models in this thesis is the Attitudinal Model. The thesis features an in-depth discussion on why the Attitudinal Model is applicable for research on the Norwegian Supreme Court To test the hypothesis, the thesis utilises a logistical regression model consisting of 509 justice-observations. The optimal model for analysing hierarchical data, a multilevel model could not be used in this analysis because this model is not applicable when only analysing dissenting cases. The lack of multilevel analysis made panel effects mostly impossible to determine. The results of the analysis show that justices appointed by social-democratic governments are statistically more likely to vote in favour of the state than justices appointed by non-social democratic governments. The results also showed that former occupation in the Legislation Department was had an especially strong positive effect for voting for the state, while being a former law professor had a negative effect. In addition the results showed that the degree of state friendliness varied between different areas of the law...|$|E
40|$|Appellate courts, {{which have}} the most control over legal doctrine, tend to operate through collegial (multimember) {{decision}} making. How does this collegiality affect their choice of legal doctrine? Can decisions by appellate courts be expected {{to result in a}} meaningful collegial rule? How do such collegial rules differ from the rules of individual judges? We explore these questions and show that collegiality has important implications for the structure and content of legal rules, {{as well as for the}} coherence, determinacy, and complexity of legal doctrine. We provide conditions for the occurrence of these doctrinal attributes in the output of collegial courts. Finally, we consider the connection between the problems that arise in the collegial aggregation of a set of legal rules and those previously noted in the collegial application of a single, fixed legal rule. A lone judge deciding all cases herself could face a task overwhelming in practice, but straight-forward in theory—she could simply decide all cases as she saw fit according to whatever rule she thought correct. Judges on a collegial (multimember) court, however, face further challenges that inhere in collegiality itself. One possible challenge is the application of existing legal rules. Kornhauser and Sager noted back in 1986 that ‘‘traditional theories of adjudica-tion are curiously incomplete,’ ’ in that they treat judging only as a solitary act, and ignore the <b>collegial</b> <b>nature</b> of most appellate courts. 1 They showed that if the judges on a collegial court are applying a single, fixed legal rule, and if they disagree over the legal subfindings in a case, then it matters how they aggregate their judgments over those subfindings under the fixed legal rule. This result was later named the Doctrinal Paradox, and it inspired a growing body of literature on collegial application of a fixed legal rule, spanning legal theory, social choice theory, and deliberative democratic theory (e. g., Chapman 1998...|$|E

A two-part questionnaire was used to survey the sample of physicians. The first part contained demographic variables whereas the second part contained attitudinal statements based on Moore's criteria of professionalism, reasons for referral, the common treatment modalities that is referred and suggestion on how to improve the professional image of physiotherapist. Three hundred and fifty questionnaires were distributed and two hundred and nine were returned. Out of'this total, 116 (66 %) subjects were from Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (HUKM) and 93 (44 %) from Hospital Kota Kinabalu (HKK). The results indicated that the responding doctors viewed the physiotherapists as possessing some degree of professionalism, 52 % (65) from HUKM and 68 % (63) from HKK, however there was relatively less agreement with the professional aspect of knowledge, skills and autonomy of judgment posed by the physiotherapist. There was a common perception of doctors towards physiotherapy image with more <b>collegial</b> <b>nature</b> among doctors in HKK than those in HUKM. The priority for treatment modalities referred are 66 % (77) chest physiotherapy in both hospitals, 54 % (61) exercises and mobilizations in HUKM and 45 % (53) in HKK, use of 15 % (17) electrotherapy agents in HUKM while 22 % (26) in HKK and less referral on wax therapy with 3 %(3) in HUKM and 8 % (7) in HKK and lastly 2 % (2) in HUKM and 3 % (3) in HKK on hydrotherapy.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} case characteristics {{on the behavior of}} Norwegian Supreme Court justices when the state appears as a party in civil cases. Acting as the highest court of appeal, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction in all areas of law, and hears cases that raise matters of principle beyond the actual case itself, where the law is unclear. Statistically, the Supreme Court decides cases in favor of the state more often than private party litigants. This fact has led to debate within the legal community, over whether or not the court is placing greater emphasis on the state's interests than what follows from the legal doctrine. While research on Norwegian Supreme Court justices has produced important insights about the effects of individual justice characteristics, little is known about how aspects of the actual cases affects judicial behavior. Here, I investigate variables connected to case categories and importance, results from lower courts, the character of the different parties and their legal counsel. Using a multilevel model that control the effects of these case characteristics against panel effects connected to the <b>collegial</b> <b>nature</b> of the court, and also includes the individual characteristics of the justices, all 834 cases with 4170 justice votes between 1963 and 2014 are analyzed. Firstly, the results show that the history of the case matters: In cases where the state party won in both the District Courts and the Courts of Appeal, the justices are more probable to vote in favor of that party. This effect is not evident for private parties with the same case history. Secondly, the Ministry of Finance is identified as a uniquely strong plaintiff. Differently from other actors, an appeal from the Ministry of Finance increases the probability of the justices to vote in favor of the state. Additionally, the analysis confirms the existence of panel effects and individual effects on the Supreme Court: In panels where justices with former employment with the Legislation Department make up the majority, all justices are more likely to vote in favor of the state. Individual justices with former employment with the Legislation Department or the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, interim justices and former lower court justices are more likely to vote for the state party. Former law professors and the chief justices are more likely to vote in favor of the private party. Although a growing field of research, the Norwegian Supreme Court is still severely understudied...|$|E
40|$|Professors Currie and Goodman {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of the}} variables that must be isolated and weighed in determining the optimum forum for judicial review of administrative action. While the backdrop for {{this study is the}} caseload crisis presently confronting the federal courts of appeals, their discussion illuminates the requisites for optimum judicial review generally. Failing to perceive any compelling reason to single out administrative cases for review in separate courts, the authors argue against the creation of special administrative appeals courts. Even if such courts were to enjoy broad subject matter jurisdiction over the most demanding aspects of the agency review caseload, countervailing considerations, such as the danger of improper influence on the appointment process and the loss of the judges 2 ̆ 7 generalist perspective, outweigh the perceived benefits of uniformity, expertise and relief for the regional courts of appeals. As to the optimal forum within the present system of district courts and courts of appeals, the authors divide their discussion into three categories of agency action. With respect to formal agency determinations, the authors generally favor direct appellate court review, except where diversion to the district courts in the first instance is necessary to reduce an appellate workload which has grown to such proportions that it threatens the <b>collegial</b> <b>nature</b> of circuit court decisionmaking; and among two-tier systems, the authors suggest that discretionary appellate review be limited to areas generating a burdensome volume of appeals, involving issues or interests of relative insignificance and not bearing a potential for biased or misguided trial court decisions. Informal rulemaking, generally involving issues of legal importance which are likely to ultimately reach the courts of appeals in any event, is presumptively appropriate for direct appellate review. Despite the absence of a trial-type record, the courts of appeals will not have to engage in extensive factfinding, for any factual issues will increasingly be determined on the basis of materials before the agency, and any need for new factual information will be rare and obtainable by methods short of a judicial trial. In the case of informal. adjudication, however, the absence of a formal adjudicative record justifies a presumption in favor of initial district court review. Informal rulemaking is distinguished, for the issues arising from informal adjudication are likely to involve questions of specific fact, there is little guarantee of any meaningful record for review, and a larger proportion of such determinations are relatively unimportant and unlikely to be taken to the courts of appeals. The authors recognize that direct circuit court review may be appropriate if review is limited to reconstruction of the record before the agency and there is therefore no significant factfinding burden...|$|E
