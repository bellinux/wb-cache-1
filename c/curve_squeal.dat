In this paper, a general squeal model is presented, {{which is based}} on the interrelationship between the wheel/rail contact forces and their responses, in the longitudinal, lateral, vertical and spin directions. Using the parameters of steady-state curving behaviour of a passenger vehicle for a range of curve radii, the general <b>curve</b> <b>squeal</b> model can predict the occurrence of squeal at all four wheel/rail contacts in a bogie.

40|$|Operational {{noise is}} an {{increasingly}} important issue for the rail industry. One source of operational noise is <b>curve</b> <b>squeal,</b> a high pitched screech noise that can occur when trains traverse curves in the track. <b>Curve</b> <b>squeal</b> {{is one of the}} Australian rail industry’s top noise mitigation priorities, on account of the acute levels of noise it generates, together with the large number of populated locations near curves. This paper provides an overview of many of the <b>curve</b> <b>squeal</b> investigations and trials that have been carried out in Australia, and summarises the lessons learnt and the patterns observed. Observations suggest that the majority of <b>curve</b> <b>squeal</b> effects can be categorised into one of three types. Importantly, the techniques for investigation and effective treatment can differ significantly between the types. The first type, referred to in this paper as “friction controlled”, is normally relatively moderate <b>curve</b> <b>squeal</b> associated with a small proportion of the passing rolling stock (typically less than 10 % of axles). Noise can be very substantially reduced (or even eliminated) by changes in top of rail friction characteristics, either due to the deliberate introduction of a friction modifier, or due to changes in tribology that can be brought about by environmental conditions (fluctuations in meteorological conditions or the presence of foreign material, such as brake dust or pollen). It is the latter effect that causes one of the defining features of this category of <b>curve</b> <b>squeal,</b> namely that it exhibits what appears, on first inspection, to be random variation.

In this paper an outline of these methods is given and the underlying considerations are explained. The EU TSI regulation limiting noise emission of new rail vehicles does not yet specify limits for <b>curve</b> <b>squeal</b> or braking noise, which are both relevant noise sources but not easy to characterise reliably due to their variability.

The existing UIC trackside test is taken as basis using the percentage exceedance indicator L 10. For braking noise, improvements to the existing trackside measurement standard are proposed, taking the variety of potential noise sources and their variable position and operating condition into account. The measurement quantity, positioning and braking operation are the main topics.

40|$|The noise {{emission}} of wheels {{plays an important}} role in <b>curve</b> <b>squealing,</b> therefore it is important to know how and at which frequencies they vibrate. Wheels, due to the abrasion, need to have regular maintenance reprofiling and this causes the diameter of the wheels to reduce. This article deals with the effect that this diameter reduction has on the frequencies associated with the eigenforms of a wheel. Using the finite element method (FEM) a wheel is modeled and the numerical results are validated by full scale measurements of the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the wheel. The diameter variation is then introduced into the FEM model of the wheel in order to calculate the shift of the eigenfrequencies for given eigenforms. This study has verified that the frequency associated to a specific eigenform may considerably shift during the life of a wheel. Frequency variations up to 12 % have been found. This indicates that in investigating the <b>curve</b> <b>squealing,</b> the diameter of the wheel has to be taken into account because of its influence on the wheel’s vibrational characteristics...|$|R

In {{contrast}} to frequency-domain models, time-domain models are able to capture the nonlinear and transient nature of <b>curve</b> <b>squeal.</b> However, these models are computationally expensive due to requirements for fine spatial and time discretization.

A validation of the tangential point-contact model against Kalker's transient variational contact model reveals that the point-contact model performs well within the squeal model up to at least 5 kHz. The proposed squeal model is applied to investigate the influence of lateral creepage, friction and wheel/rail contact position on squeal occurrence and amplitude.

40|$|The {{existence}} of a wheel–rail friction coefficient {{that depends on the}} slip velocity has been associated in the literature with important railway problems like the <b>curving</b> <b>squeal</b> and certain corrugation problems in rails. Rolling contact models that take into account this effect were carried out through the so-called Exact Theories adopting an exact elastic model of the solids in contact, and Simplified Theories which assume simplified elastic models such as Winkler. The former ones, based on Kalker’s Variational Theory, give rise to numerical problems; the latter ones need to adopt hypotheses that significantly deviate from actual conditions, leading to unrealistic solutions of the contact problem. In this paper, a methodology based on Kalker’s Variational Theory is presented, in which a local slip velocity-dependent friction law is considered. A formulation to get steady-state conditions of rolling contact by means of regularisation of the Coulomb’s law is proposed. The model allows establishing relationships in order to estimate the global properties (creepage velocities vs. total longitudinal forces) through local properties (local slip velocity vs. coefficient of friction) or vice versa. The proposed model shows a good agreement with experimental tests while solving the numerical problems previously mentioned...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} of {{introducing}} falling friction coefficients into curving simulations for studying <b>curve</b> <b>squeal</b> noise is presented. Generation of squeal {{at the wheel of}} a railway vehicle in a curve is caused by unstable vibration, caused in turn by a lateral wheel/rail force which reduces with increasing lateral creepage. To model vehicle <b>curve</b> <b>squeal,</b> the wheel/rail tangential force in the curving simulation is calculated by a modified version of FASTSIM, which uses a sliding velocity-dependent friction characteristic. Using the falling friction characteristics, a UK passenger vehicle is modelled with SIMPACK. Curving behaviour is simulated for a range of curve radii and cant deficiencies.

The time-domain model is based on a Green's functions approach and uses a convolution procedure to obtain the system response. To ensure comparability, the same submodels are implemented in both squeal models. The wheel model includes a single flexible wheel and accounts for inertia effects due to rotation adopting Eulerian coordinates. The track is modelled using the moving element method technique corresponding to a finite element mesh that travels with the vehicle speed. Coulomb's law with a constant friction coefficient is applied to model the local friction characteristics in the contact zone. The frictional instability arises due to geometrical coupling.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an active}} control technique that combats oscillations driven by dry friction forces. Dry friction {{can act as}} the excitation mechanism for some high amplitude oscillations; <b>curve</b> <b>squeal</b> from trains is a well known and notorious example. Another, more elementary, example is the oscillation of a mass [...] spring system sliding on a moving belt. A model which predicts the stability behaviour of this system is presented. The model is then extended to include an active control system. The active control system is a feedback loop which consists of the following components. A transducer senses the velocity of the mass. The transducer output is passed to a filter, then to a phase shifter which applies an adjustable phase-shift, to a variable-gain amplifier, and finally to a shaker which {{is attached to the}} mass. The shaker exerts a control force in the tangential direction, and this force superimposes on the friction force. The stability behaviour of the controlled system is analyzed in two ways: by calculation of the complex eigenfrequencies and by considerations based on a balance equation for the oscillatory energy. The di#erences between this form of active control and conventional anti-vibration methods are discussed.

40|$|<b>Curve</b> <b>squeal</b> is {{commonly}} attributed to self-excited vibrations of the railway wheel, which arise {{due to a}} large lateral creepage of the wheel tyre {{on the top of}} the rail during curving. The phenomenon involves stick/slip oscillations in the wheel/rail contact and is therefore strongly dependent on the prevailing friction conditions. The mechanism causing the instability is, however, still a subject of controversial discussion. Most authors introduce the negative slope of the friction characteristic as a source of the instability, while others have found that squeal can also occur in the case of constant friction due to the coupling between normal and tangential dynamics. As a contribution to this discussion, a detailed model for high-frequency wheel/rail interaction during curving is presented in this paper and evaluated in the case of constant friction. The interaction model is formulated in the time domain and includes the coupling between normal and tangential directions. Track and wheel are described as linear systems using pre-calculated impulse response functions that are derived from detailed finite element models. The nonlinear, non-steady state contact model is based on an influence function method for the elastic half-space. Real measured wheel and rail profiles are used. Numerical results from the interaction model confirm that stick/slip oscillations occur also in the case of constant friction. The choice of the lateral creepage, the value of the friction coefficient and the lateral contact position on the wheel tread are seen to have a strong influence on the occurrence and amplitude of the stick/slip oscillations.

To verify these results, a new method to measure the lateral and normal force simultaneously was developed on a test rig, so as to determine the friction-creep curves. To investigate the effect of relative humidity on squeal and friction creep curves, the relative humidity inside the acoustic enclosure of test rig was adjusted under controlled conditions of 50 %, 70 % and 90 %. The test rig results show that the lateral adhesion ratio decreases slightly with the increase of relative humidity and that squeal is more likely in high relative humidity.

Lateral friction forces are induced on the wheel–rail contact area (typically stick-slip forces). Due to nonlinearities of friction forces, a transient analysis of the lateral creepage of the wheel is performed by using an axi-harmonic model. Results give a reduced number of excited modes. It is shown that squealing modes have 3, 4 and 5 nodal diameters. These results agree with experimental investigations of squeal noise measurements.

40|$|<b>Curve</b> <b>squeal</b> {{is a type}} of {{railway noise}} that may arise when a railway vehicle negotiates a {{relatively}} tight curve. A single frequency, corresponding to a wheel mode, dominates the radiated sound, which makes squeal a very tonal noise. The high number of tight curves in cities and urban areas, its tonal nature and high noise levels make squeal a significant source of noise pollution. The rising awareness of the impact of noise on public health increases the need to address the squeal problem. Consequently, there is an increased need for practical simulation tools. In this thesis, a computationally fast squeal model formulated in the time domain is proposed. The computational efficiency is achieved by modelling the tangential contact with a point-contact model, which considers the contact variables globally. The friction model and the contact compliance are defined in a rigorous manner using Kalker's variational theory. Validation results show that the contact model is valid up to at least 5 kHz. The proposed model is further extended to include the effects of spin creepage, contact angle and two-point wheel/rail contact. Spin creepage is treated as a contact property with its influence included in the friction model. Additionally, the model is also extended with an existing model for sound radiation from the railway wheel. Parameter studies show a strong influence of parameters that influence the dynamics coupling responsible for squeal: the contact angle, friction and the wheel/rail contact position. These parameters influence both squeal occurrence, amplitudes and frequency. Spin, however, influences only squeal amplitudes. With the wheel being a significant factor in <b>curve</b> <b>squeal,</b> the influence of the wheel modal damping is also investigated. To mitigate squeal in a specific case, all modes that are susceptible to squeal in that case have to be damped. Otherwise, squeal may shift to another mode and develop even higher amplitudes. The amount of modal damping required to prevent squeal is relatively low. Finally, a two-point wheel/rail contact case is analysed. Results show that squeal can occur on curve-outer wheels. The two-point-contact case is relatively complicated: squeal {{is the result of a}} combination of the dynamic interplay of the two contact points and the presence of two closely spaced wheel modes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Curve</b> <b>squeal</b> {{is a type}} of {{railway noise}} that may arise when a railway vehicle negotiates a {{relatively}} tight <b>curve.</b> <b>Squeal</b> is common in curves of a radius lower than 200 meters. A single frequency dominates the radiated sound, which makes squeal a very tonal noise. The high number of tight curves in cities and urban areas, the tonal nature and high noise levels, make squeal a serious source of noise pollution. The rising awareness of the impact of noise on public health increases the need to address the squeal problem. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} practical squeal simulation tools. The aim of this thesis is to develop a computationally fast squeal model in the time domain suitable for practical use. For this purpose, an existing squeal model is modified. The tangential contact is modelled using a point-contact model, which considers the contact variables in a global manner. This is in contrast to Kalker’s variational contact model which discretizes the contact area into elements. The friction model and contact compliance are defined in a stringent way in relation to Kalker’s model. In this way, the point-contact model is able to describe the transition of contact conditions from full stick to full slip. Although the proposed contact model is steady-state, it performs well at high frequencies. An upper limit of applicability of at least 5 kHz was found in the validation of the contact model within the squeal model. Compared to the classical validation with prescribed motion, the inclusion of the system dynamics puts different demands on the contact model. This indicates that contact models should be validated/compared in conditions that replicate their specific application as closely as possible. The engineering model is completed by implementing an existing model for sound radiation from the railway wheel, the implementation of which is validated against BEM results. A parameter study involving lateral creepage, wheel/rail contact position and friction is performed using the proposed squeal model. The investigated parameters show a strong influence on squeal occurrence and amplitudes. With the wheel being an important factor in squeal, the influence of the wheel modal damping is also investigated. Results indicate that increasing only the damping of the mode excited in squeal may not be sufficient. Squeal may then occur involving another mode with another frequency and amplitude. The amount of modal damping required to prevent squeal is relatively low...|$|E
40|$|<b>Curve</b> <b>squeal</b> {{noise is}} of growing {{concern for the}} railway {{industry}} as rail systems become more widespread in densely populated areas. In response to the pressure to minimise environmental pollution, there is a demand for {{a deeper understanding of}} the phenomenon and to develop a methodical approach to managing the wheel-rail system. Under curving, the wheel and the rail are subject to creep forces due to relative motion (creepage) within the contact region. In tight curves, these creep forces can cause unstable vibration of the wheel, leading to the radiation of squeal noise. The occurrence and characteristics of this are governed by the configuration of the creepages at the wheel-rail contact, which can have longitudinal, lateral and spin components. It follows that the representation of creepage is important in modelling the mechanisms of squeal noise behaviour. An investigation is presented into how the relationship between lateral creepage and creep force is affected when a component of longitudinal creepage is introduced. A 1 : 3 scale laboratory test rig has been modified to simulate contact conditions with controlled levels of lateral and longitudinal creepage, and to measure the salient system parameters. The experimental results are presented and discussed here...|$|E

Top of rail wheel squeal belongs {{to the family of}} selfinduced vibrations and originates from frictional instability in curves between the wheel and the rail under predominantly saturated lateral creep conditions. In small radius curves, saturated lateral creep conditions occur due to the steering of railway wheelsets with large angles of attack. Given the large curve radius and the utilisation of self-steering bogies on the Sishen-Saldanha Iron Ore railway line, <b>curve</b> <b>squeal</b> is a highly unexpected result for the 1000 m radius curved railway line. This is because curving of bogies in large radius curves are achieved without high wheelset angles of attack leading to saturated creep conditions. An experimental and analytical investigation was carried out to identify the mechanisms influencing the generation of wheel squeal in large radius curves. Simultaneous measurement of sound pressure and lateral wheel-rail forces were made during regular train service in one of the two 1000 m radius curves at Elands Bay to characterise the bogie curving behaviour for tonal noise due to wheel squeal occurring in the large radius curve. The lateral force curving signature not only reveals the levels of lateral wheel-rail forces required for bogie curving, but also whether the bogie is curving by means of the creep forces generated at the wheel-rail interface only or if contact is necessitated between the wheel flange and rail gauge corner to help steer the bogie around the curve. The test set-up consisted of two free field microphones radially aligned at equivalent distances towards the in – and outside of the curve in line with a set a strain gauge bridges configured and calibrated to measure the lateral and vertical forces on the inner and outer rail of the curve. This test set-up allowed the squealing wheel to be identified from the magnitude difference of the sound pressures recorded by the inner and outer microphones in combination with comparing the point of frequency shift of the squeal event due to the Doppler Effect with the force signals of the radially aligned strain gauge bridges. From the experimental phase of the investigation, it was found that wheel squeal occurring in the 1000 m radius curve at Elands Bay is characteristic of empty wagons and is strongly related to the squealing wheel’s flange/flange throat being in contact with the gauge corner of the rail. Here high levels of spin creepage associated with high contact angles in the gauge corner lead to high levels of associated lateral creepage necessary for squeal generation. This is in contrast to lateral creepage due to high wheelset angles of attack being the key kinematic parameter influencing squeal generation in small radius curves. Furthermore, the amplitude of wheel squeal originating from the passing of empty wagons was found to be inversely proportional to the level of flange rubbing on the squealing wheel i. e. increased flange contact on the squealing wheel brings about a positive effect on squeal control. Contrary to the empty wagons which are characterised by tonal <b>curve</b> <b>squeal,</b> loaded 4 wagons requiring contact between the wheel flange and rail gauge corner in the 1000 m curve was characterised by broadband flanging noise. It was concluded from measurements that flange contact occurring under high lateral forces for steady state curving of loaded wagons provides the complete damping necessary for squeal control. The <b>curve</b> <b>squeal</b> noise that originated from the passing of empty wagons in the Elands Bay curve could further be classified according to the frequency at which the squeal event manifested itself in the curve, i. e. low frequency audible (0 – 10 kHz), high frequency audible (10 – 20 kHz) and ultrasonic squeal (> 20 kHz). The vast majority of low frequency audible squeal events recorded in the 1000 m Elands Bay curve occurred at approximately 4 kHz and originated from the low rail/trailing inner wheel interface, whilst the vast majority of high frequency audible squeal events occurred in the frequency range between 15 and 20 kHz and originated from both the high rail/leading outer wheel and low rail/trailing inner wheel interfaces...|$|E
40|$|Curve {{squealing}} {{noise of}} railroad vehicles {{has been researched}} for over four decades. To describe this phenomenon, several models have been developed. An increasing stick-slip motion between the wheel and the rail {{is assumed to be}} a key component for the occurrence of squealing. Nevertheless, the circumstances necessary to initiate, uphold and amplify the stick-slip motion in this case are not yet fully described,and existing models need validation. However, due to the non-linear nature of the phenomenon as well as its dependency on a large number of parameters, precise in-situ measurements are difficult to conduct. This Master’s Thesis describes the conception, design and construction of a test rig to create and measure <b>curve</b> <b>squeal</b> noise. A conception of the basic setup is done using knowledge about comparable rigs built. A rig with two interacting wheels, one of them functioning as the rail, is targeted. To ensure the functionality as a test-rig for validating existing simulation-based models, certain settings of the rig need to be changeable. These settings, including for example applied normal force, creepage and rolling speed, are quantified in a parameter study. A wide range of input parameters is used in a repeated time-domain simulation of the interaction, and the number of squealing occurrences is evaluated. A 3 D model of the rig necessary to provide the contact with the found set of parameters is developed. All parts involved are described and drawings are generated. The structural safety of critical parts is calculated...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Tramway {{has become}} a serious urban noise source in densely {{populated}} areas. The disturbance from squealing noise is significant. <b>Curve</b> <b>squeal</b> is the very loud, tonal noise emitted by tram operation in tight radius curves. Studies had reported a relationship between noise levels and health effects, such as annoyance, sleep disturbance, and elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Materials and Methods: This study aimed to analyze the wheel squeal noise along the tramway line in Košice, Slovakia, review the effects on human health, and discuss its inclusion in the design method. To observe {{the influence of a}} track curve on noise emission, several measurement points were selected, and the noise emission was measured both in the curve and in the straight lines employing the same type of permanent way. Results: The results in the sections with the radius below 50 [*]m were greatly affected by the presence of a squeal noise, while the resulting noise level in the sections with the radius above 50 [*]m depended on their radius. The difference between the average values of LAeq with and without the squeal in the measurement points with the radius below 50 [*]m was 9 [*]dB. The difference between the measurements in the curve sections with the radius below 50 [*]m and those in the straight line was 2. 7 [*]dB. Conclusion: The resulting noise level in general was influenced by the car velocity and the technical shape of the permanent way. These results can be used in noise prognoses and in the health effect predictions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the possible causes of wheel squeal on Roslagsbanan, a narrow gauge (891 mm) suburban railway system in Stockholm, Sweden. Simulation of the dynamic behaviour of vehicles negotiating curves {{was carried out by}} means of the Swedish multibody simulation software GENSYS [1]. Wheel squeal may arise due to insufficient radial steering capability of the vehicles in curves causing too high levels of creep (relative sliding) in the wheel/rail-contact. Based on this theory, an advanced model of the creep-creep force relation was introduced. In this model the creep force decreases after creep reaches a certain level, called critical creep. It is believed that wheel squeal occurs after the creep level exceeded the critical creep value. Measured rail profiles of the curve together with measured wheel profiles were used as wheel/rail geometry input data. Other interesting parameters for the simulations, such as friction coefficient, primary suspension stiffness and damping, vehicle speed, braking/acceleration were varied and their effects on the outcome were tested. Worn wheels on newly grinded and worn rails under dry conditions are most likely to generate <b>curve</b> <b>squeal.</b> We believe the long term solution for Roslagsbanan is to grind the rail profiles into a shape more similar to the 50 E 3 with inclination 1 / 40. This will give a more even wheel wear over the whole wheel surface. However, curves below ca 300 m cannot be negotiated without wheel squeal, why all curves on the track tighter than ca 300 m have to be lubricated...|$|E
