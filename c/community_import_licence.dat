50|$|In August 1966 the Gibbs' sought Government {{consent to}} obtain an <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> for their proposal. They {{proposed}} to build 3,000 cars per annum, with production commencing in mid-1968. Jack Marshall, was the then Minister of Trade and Industry, whose consent was sought. He declined their request {{on the grounds that}} New Zealand was suffering from falling export prices at the time, which was causing a balance of trade problem for the Government. Other established car manufacturers were having the <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> reduced and the granting of a licence to another manufacturer was seen as counter-productive.|$|R

Phil Holloway, the then-Minister for Industries and Commerce under Prime Minister Walter Nash during the Second Labour Government. Holloway was not happy with the innuendo that he was involved in issuing <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> in a questionable way, and sued the paper for defamation.

He sold his bicycle parts and yarn factories and moved to Mumbai. In 1981, he purchased <b>importing</b> <b>licences</b> from exporting companies in Punjab. He then imported thousands of Suzuki Motors's portable electric-power generators from Japan. The importing of generators was suddenly banned by the then Indian Government.|$|R
50|$|The project {{commenced}} in Autumn 1966 when Alan {{moved to}} Auckland {{to join with}} his brother Ian, owner of Anziel Limited, in the venture. The Gibbs' also needed an <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> for the assembly plant, parts, and materials. Because of its use of fibreglass bodywork Reliant Motor Co of England was approached for a suitable design. This was to maximise the quantity of local product in the manufacture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{formation}} of Databank {{came at a}} time when computer systems were a scarce and expensive commodity in New Zealand, with the import of computers being restricted by the then government's prevailing highly regulatory economic policy. Computers could only be <b>imported</b> under <b>licence.</b> The executive management of the BNZ (Bank of New Zealand) wanted to obtain a computer and establish a computerised system to enable the automation of the processing of its banking transactions and customer accounting. Computerisation was deemed as the only way to proceed if the increasing cheque transaction volumes were to be accommodated in timely fashion. The other, smaller banks were approaching the point where they would face a similar situation. However, the NBNZ (National Bank of New Zealand) {{was the only one that}} happened to have a computer <b>import</b> <b>licence.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Production {{began in}} an old flour store in Devon Street, New Plymouth. The aim was to make 120 {{machines}} a year, but demand was higher after a flurry of articles in magazines and newspapers about the bike. Some were sold to Borneo and the New Hebrides. [...] Problems soon arose with the government refusing to issue an <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> for the engines and brake hubs. While negotiations continued between Callender and the government, Callender sent {{a photo of the}} bike along with Hillary, Mulgrave, and himself to Suzuki in Japan. Suzuki turned the photo into a giant poster on their Tokyo Motor Show stand along with a replica of the bike. In 1966 the government issued the <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> to allow enough parts to build the 120 bikes per year. By that time Callender had decided to sell the business to Motor Components of Waitara. Motor Components planned to sell 1,000 bikes per year, but by then Suzuki had commenced production of its own specialised machine. They in turn were followed by the other major Japanese motor cycle manufacturers. Production at the Waitara plant stopped in the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of sales was overestimated; in 1956, 525 Vanajas were sold and in March 1957, the volume {{for the whole}} year was estimated to reach about 400units.

The company blamed the government's <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> bureaucracy for the problemit was difficult to get diesel engines from abroad. In the following month, over 30 Vanajas that were otherwise ready were awaiting diesel engines. The economy improved in 1959.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{follows the}} work of H. Uzawa (1965) and R. E. Lucas (1988) by {{presenting}} an endogenous growth model with human capital accumulation as the engine of growth. Agents make time allocation decisions in an economy where quantitative restrictions are employed in the trade regime. Agents may allocate time to obtain valuable <b>import</b> <b>licences.</b> The effect of this activity on the growth rate {{is found to be}} dependent upon whether agents specialize in the rent-seeking activity. When agents do not specialize, the rent-seeking activity reduces growth by reducing the incentive to accumulate productive human capital. ...|$|R
50|$|After 1976, the zoo {{suffered}} from {{competition with the}} much larger Ocean Park. On 31 July 1993, the zoo was closed. This decision was hastened by the Hong Kong Government refusing <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> for new animals, it has since been redeveloped for residential purposes. Most of the remaining animals were sent to Xili Lake Wild Animal Park (now called Safari Park Shenzhen) in Shenzhen. Concern has subsequently been expressed about their welfare in view of criticism of the Safari Park's standards of animal care. The Saltwater Crocodiles remained at the Park until it closed in 1997 and were then taken to Shek Kwu Chau.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses an overlapping-generations {{framework}} {{to model the}} allocation of <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> of intermediate goods according to firm capacity. It shows that this method of allocation encourages rent-seeking and also thereby improves welfare compared with a method that does not allow rent-seeking. A. O. Kreuger (1975, 1974) and J. N. Bhagwati and P. Desai (1970) describe how Turkey and India have allocated imports {{on the basis of}} firm capacity, which led to rent-seeking through overexpansion of capacity. J. N. Bhagwati and T. N. Srinivasan (1980) first recognized the possibility that rent-seeking may actually improve welfare {{in the presence of a}} distortion, as it does in this paper. ...|$|R

50|$|The Morris Marina was {{a popular}} car on the New Zealand market, {{imported}} by the New Zealand Motor Corporation. Imports began with built-up British-sourced saloons and coupes (in 1.3- and 1.8-litre forms) in 1971. Local assembly of Australian-sourced (E-Series engines) models began in 1972 {{after the release of}} the Marinas there. Six-cylinder models were added in 1973. In 1974, before the termination of Leyland Australia's manufacturing operations, local assembly switched to British-sourced models again in saloon, estate, van and pick-up forms. Batches of fully built UK-sourced cars also came in 1973 and 1974 when the government allowed additional <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> due to the inability of local assembly plants to keep pace with demand for new cars.|$|R
50|$|This {{generation}} of Prince was also assembled in New Zealand by Steel Brothers in Christchurch but was now badged as a Nissan Gloria {{though it was}} still imported by Croyden Motors, a separate company to Datsun importer Nissan-Datsun NZ Ltd. A total of 900 Prince and Nissan Glorias were built in NZ Mark Webster, 2002, p144 which corresponds to the annual low-volume <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> allocation of 300 CKD units a year under government policy of the time. Following the merger of Prince and Nissan in Japan, the Gloria in NZ effectively was replaced by Nissan-Datsun imports of Japanese-assembled Datsun 2300 Personal Six sedans and, later, imported 240C and locally assembled 260C sedans.|$|R

40|$|This ban {{comes into}} force with {{immediate}} effect on Friday 22 July 2011. Phenazepam is a benzodiazepine which is currently not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (1971 Act) in the UK. Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs's advice: The UK Government has received independent expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) that phenazepam is sufficiently harmful to justify an immediate import ban under the Open General <b>Import</b> <b>Licence</b> pending its control as a Class C drug under the 1971 Act. The ACMD’s assessment reports that phenazepam is being marketed as a so called ‘legal high’ product, particularly on the internet. It {{has been identified as}} being a potent member of the benzodiazepine family causing harms such as amnesia and drowsiness that may potentially proceed to a coma with respiratory depression. Whilst phenazepam has been recognised to have limited medicinal properties, it is not prescribed in the UK for treatment neither does it have a UK marketing authorisation. Further, it has no legitimate commercial or industrial uses in the UK. This amendment to the Open General <b>Import</b> <b>Licence</b> will remain in place until such time as it is revoked. This will likely occur when phenazepam is fully controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 where it will be a criminal offence to unlawfully import, export, supply, offer to supply, possess with intent to supply and be in simple possession of this substance without a licence or lawful authority.
