500|$|On graduation, Born {{was obliged}} to perform his {{military}} service, which he had deferred while a student. He found himself drafted into the German army, and posted to the 2nd Guards Dragoons [...] "Empress Alexandra of Russia", which was stationed in Berlin. His service was brief, as he was discharged early after an asthma attack in January 1907. He then travelled to England, where he was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and studied physics for six months at the Cavendish Laboratory under J. J. Thomson, George Searle and Joseph Larmor. After Born returned to Germany, the Army re-inducted him, and he served with the elite 1st (Silesian) Life Cuirassiers [...] "Great Elector" [...] until he was again medically discharged after just six weeks' service. He then returned to Breslau, where he worked {{under the supervision of}} Otto Lummer and Ernst Pringsheim, hoping to do his habilitation in physics. A minor accident involving Born's black body experiment, a ruptured <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>hose,</b> and a flooded laboratory, led to Lummer telling him that he would never become a physicist.|$|E

The {{variable}} flow <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system can achieve energy saving benefits just like variable primary flow {{chilled water system}} for central air conditioning system.

The article pointed out explicitly that the realization of {{variable flow}} technology for <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system must construct two control loops, one for <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> supply temperature the other for return temperature, further more discussed control strategies for two control loops.

40|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>water</b> {{systems are}} used to remove excess heat from a {{chemical}} process to the atmosphere. The primary components of these systems are the cooling tower and the heat exchanger network. There is a strong interaction between these individual components, thus their performances are interrelated. Most published {{research in this area}} has focused mainly on optimization of the individual components i. e. optimization of heat exchanger network or optimization of the cooling towers. This approach does not optimize the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system as a whole. Previous research work in which a holistic approach was used is limited to <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems with single <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> source. This work presents a technique for integrated optimization of complex <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems. The system under consideration consists of multiple cooling towers each supplying a set of heat exchangers. A superstructural approach is employed to explore all possible combinations between the heat exchangers and the cooling towers. The <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> reuse opportunities within the heat exchanger networks are also explored. A detailed mathematical model consisting of the cooling towers and the heat exchanger networks model is developed. Two practical scenarios are considered and the mathematical formulations for Case I and II yield nonlinear programing (NLP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) structure respectively. Although the reuse/recycle philosophy offers a good debottlenecking opportunity, the topology of the associated <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network is more complex, hence prone to higher pressure drop than the conventional parallel design. This is due to an increased network pressure drop associated with additional reuse/recycle streams. Therefore, it is essential to consider pressure drop during the synthesis of <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> networks where the reuse/recycle philosophy is employed. The on-going research in this area is only limited to <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> networks consisting of a single <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> source. The common technique used is mathematical optimization using either superstructural or non superstructural approach. This work further presents a mathematical technique for pressure drop optimization in <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems consisting of multiple cooling towers. The proposed technique is based on the Critical Path Algorithm and the superstructural approach. The Critical Path Algorithm is used to select the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with minimum pressure drop whilst the superstructural approach allows for <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> reuse. The technique which was previously used in a <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with single source is modified and applied in a <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with multiple sources. The mathematical formulation is developed considering two cases. Both cases yield mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models. The cooling tower model is also used to predict the exit condition of the cooling tower given the inlet conditions from the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network model. The results show up to 29 % decrease in total circulating <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flowrate when the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system is debottlenecked without considering pressure drop. Consequently, the overall cooling towers effectiveness was improved by up to 5 %. When considering pressure drop the results showed up to 26 % decrease in total circulating water flowrate.

40|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>water</b> {{systems are}} {{generally}} designed {{with a set}} of heat exchangers arranged in parallel.

This manuscript presents a technique for grassroot design of <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system for wastewater minimization which incorporates the performances of the cooling towers involved. The study focuses mainly on cooling systems consisting of multiple cooling towers that supply a common set of heat exchangers.
