25|$|Many {{international}} classification societies have incorporated the Finnish-Swedish ice <b>class</b> <b>rules</b> {{to their own}} rulebooks and offer ice class notations that are recognized by the Finnish and Swedish authorities. These ice classes are, in turn, used by nations such as Estonia and Latvia to assign traffic restrictions. Since the ice <b>class</b> <b>rules</b> have been revised and amended several times over the years, a list of equivalent ice class notations is used to assign the correct official ice class for older vessels when they visit Finnish and Swedish ports. Although mainly used in the Baltic Sea, the Finnish-Swedish ice classes and the equivalent ice class notations from classification societies are sometimes used when discussing ships operating in other ice-infested seas of the world.|$|E
25|$|Developed {{especially}} for the 1958 World Gliding Championships, the SZD-22 Mucha Standard was a direct descendent of the IS-2 Mucha (Fly), from 1948, and SZD-12 Mucha 100, from 1953, with very similar lines and dimensions. The Mucha Standard was designed to the new Standard <b>class</b> <b>rules</b> which discarded the old Olympic 15-15-15 Span, Aspect Ratio, Area rule.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 a {{workgroup}} {{consisting of}} the Finnish Maritime Administration, Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard and the association of the Finnish shipowners began working on the new ice <b>class</b> <b>rules</b> in close co-operation with major classification societies. Shortly after the work started the Swedish Maritime Administration joined and the new regulations, published in 1971, {{became known as the}} Finnish-Swedish ice <b>class</b> <b>rules.</b> According to the new rules the requirements for a ship with ice class 1A, deadweight tonnage of 3,500 tons and engine output of 1,500hp were kept largely the same, but the requirements for ships of the lowest ice class, 1C, were increased considerably as in the past such ships had been essentially open-water vessels with a strengthened bow. The minimum requirements for the highest ice class, 1A Super, were lowered to make the ships more attractive to shipowners and the requirements for ships with deadweight tonnage below 3,500 tons were increased in all classes to steer shipowners towards bigger vessels that were deemed better for navigation in ice.|$|E

25|$|The Finnish-Swedish ice <b>class</b> <b>rules</b> of 1985 {{introduced}} {{changes to}} the hull dimensioning. The plastic deformation theory used in the previous rules was changed to elastic, and the load height was changed to more realistic.

In 2008 the rules regarding the dimensioning of the propulsion system were renewed.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s the {{expansion}} of the Finnish icebreaker fleet allowed navigation in more severe ice conditions, and the Finnish ice <b>class</b> <b>rules</b> published in 1965 introduced a new ice class, 1A Super, which was considerably stronger than the existing classes. Since ice class 1A was already exempted from the ice fees, the 50% reduction to lighthouse fees was given to ships of the new ice class. However, the additional requirements of the highest ice class were deemed excessive and only three such ships were built.|$|E

The vessel is built to the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, with special consideration for the dimensioning of the propulsion and hull {{to meet the requirements}} for icebreaking capability as the Finnish-Swedish ice <b>class</b> <b>rules</b> do not extend to icebreaking vessels.|$|E

25|$|While the Finnish-Swedish ice classes can be {{assigned}} to icebreakers {{for the purpose of}} collecting fairway fees, the rules are intended primarily for merchant ships operating under icebreaker escort. Because the engine output and the level of ice-strengthening in ships designed to operate independently in ice-infested waters, especially in the presence of multi-year ice, usually exceeds the requirements of the Finnish-Swedish ice <b>class</b> <b>rules,</b> the classification societies use different ice class notations, such as the IACS Polar Class, for icebreakers. The two highest Finnish-Swedish ice classes, 1A and 1A Super, are somewhat equivalent to the two lowest Polar Classes, PC 7 and PC 6, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The first Finnish {{statutory}} regulation for ships navigating in ice was given on 27 March 1890. It was primarily intended {{to increase the}} safety and set a number of requirements for passenger ships operating regularly in winter conditions. These included double bottom in way of the engines and boilers, construction {{according to the rules}} of Lloyd's Register or Bureau Veritas, at least five transverse watertight bulkheads, and sufficient damage stability to survive the flooding of two compartments without sinking. The last requirement is interesting because it {{was not included in the}} latter ice <b>class</b> <b>rules</b> and did not become mandatory again for ships partaking in international traffic until 1960.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} mining of <b>class</b> {{association}} <b>rules</b> with rough set approach.

We present an efficient algorithm for mining the finest <b>class</b> <b>rule</b> set inspired form Apriori algorithm, where the support and confidence are computed based on the elementary set of lower approximation included in the property of rough set theory. Our proposed approach has been shown very effective, where the rough set approach for class association discovery is much simpler than the classic association method...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new {{variant of}} Associative Classifier has been proposed. Most Associative Classifiers perform {{classification}} on <b>Class</b> Association <b>Rules</b> {{obtained from a}} complete set of Frequent Itemsets. The main disadvantage of associative classifiers is that huge number of <b>class</b> association <b>rules</b> are generated. Handling large set of <b>class</b> association <b>rules</b> is a challenging problem. In this paper, a new framework has been proposed which uses <b>class</b> association <b>rules</b> generated from {{a complete set of}} frequent generators. The classification rules thus obtained are smaller in size, lesser in total number and non-redundant in nature when compared to those obtained from classification rules generated by a complete set of frequent itemsets. Furthermore, the scalability of the classifier is ensured by the use of trie datastructure to store the set of frequent generators which directly represent the <b>class</b> association <b>rules</b> in this case. Experiments and comparison against classifiers like C 4. 5 and variants on imbalanced and balanced data confirm our claims...|$|R
25|$|For larger {{cellular}} automaton rule space, it is shown that <b>class</b> 4 <b>rules</b> are located between the class 1 and <b>class</b> 3 <b>rules.</b> This observation {{is the foundation}} for the phrase edge of chaos, and is reminiscent of the phase transition in thermodynamics.|$|R
25|$|The Finnish ice <b>class</b> <b>rules</b> {{published}} in 1932 introduced the ice classes 1A, 1B and 1C for ships strengthened for navigation in ice, ice class 2 for ships classified for unrestricted service but not strengthened for navigation in ice and ice class 3 for other vessels. Ice class 2 was further divided to two subclasses, 2A and 2B, and vessels {{were eligible for}} the former {{if they had a}} radio. Detailed minimum requirements, again as an additional percentage of the open water requirement, were given for the stem, shell plating at the waterline, stiffeners, rudder and rudder bearings, and the propulsion machinery. In the lowest ice class, 1C, the requirements were limited to the bow of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the biggest}} change to the {{previous}} Finnish ice <b>class</b> <b>rules</b> {{was the way the}} structural requirements were determined. Instead of percentages and experience the minimum requirements were based on plastic deformation theory and pressure loads determined from observations of past ice damages in the Baltic Sea. The ships were divided into three areas (bow, midship, aft) and the pressure loads were calculated for each area {{as a function of the}} ship's displacement and engine output. The rules regarding rudders, engines and the propulsion system were also changed accordingly, and the propulsion system was to be designed so that its strength increased towards the engine. This minimized the repair costs as the parts most likely to break, the propeller blades, were also the easiest and cheapest to replace. Furthermore, a minimum power requirement was given so that the ice-strengthened ships would be powerful enough to follow the icebreakers and not slow down the traffic.|$|E
