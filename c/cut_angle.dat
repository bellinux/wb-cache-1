The sooner we got hold of the young man and brought him along to calm her mother's agitation the better. She assented to my reasoning, and we crossed diagonally the Place de Theatre, bluish grey with its floor of slabs of stone, under the electric light, and the lonely equestrian statue all black in the middle. In the Rue de Carouge we were in the poorer quarters and approaching the outskirts of the town. Vacant building plots alternated with high, new houses. At the corner of a side street the crude light of a whitewashed shop fell into the night, fan-like, through a wide doorway. One could see from a distance the inner wall with its scantily furnished shelves, and the deal counter painted brown. That was the house. Approaching it along the dark stretch of a fence of tarred planks, we saw the narrow pallid face of the <b>cut</b> <b>angle,</b> five single windows high, without a gleam in them, and crowned by the heavy shadow of a jutting roof slope.|$|E

50|$|The {{side cut}} {{is located at}} the {{intersection}} of the side cut of jack rafters row and the pitch column on the Steel square. There is a row for the difference in length of jacks, 16 and 24 inch centers on the blade. The tangents are directly proportional for both centers.The tangent is in a base 12. The tangent x 12 = side cut of jack rafters. This corresponds to the side cut on the Steel square. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used on most angle measuring devises in construction. The tangent of hip, valley, and jack rafters are less than 1.00 in all pitches above 0°. An eighteen pitch has a side <b>cut</b> <b>angle</b> of 29.07° and a two pitch has a side <b>cut</b> <b>angle</b> of 44.56° for jack rafters. This is a variation of 15.5° between pitches.|$|E

50|$|Two {{types of}} quartz {{crystals}} exist: left-handed and right-handed. The two {{differ in their}} optical rotation but they are identical in other physical properties. Both left and right-handed crystals {{can be used for}} oscillators, if the <b>cut</b> <b>angle</b> is correct. In manufacture, right-handed quartz is generally used. The SiO4 tetrahedrons form parallel helices; the direction of twist of the helix determines the left- or right-hand orientation. The helixes are aligned along the z-axis and merged, sharing atoms. The mass of the helixes forms a mesh of small and large channels parallel to the z-axis. The large ones are large enough to allow some mobility of smaller ions and molecules through the crystal.|$|E
50|$|Japanese {{psychologist}} Shogu Imai {{experimented with}} {{different versions of}} the Wundt Illusion in 1960 to find out which combination of measurements creates the strongest illusion. He varied the inner and outer radius, the opening angle of the segment, and the angle of the ends. He also looked at whether the distance between the two shapes, or whether they are horizontally or vertically influences the strength of the illusion. Imai showed {{different versions of the}} illusion to a group of people and asked them to rate the perceived difference in size. Imai found that the maximum reported difference was about ten percent. He also found that the inner radius should be 60% of the outer radius to achieve the maximum effect. The ideal opening angle was found to be 80 degrees. The <b>cut</b> <b>angle</b> is most effective at zero degrees, which occurs when the line extends through the centre of the circle segments. He also found that the illusion is strongest when the segments are horizontal and that the ideal distance is just above each other. Overlapping the segments or moving them too far apart destroys the illusion. The figure below shows the ideal segments based on Imai's research.|$|E

FEA method was used to study the damage propagation and failure properties of stiffened composite panels with discrete-source damage. The influence of discrete-source damage on residual strength of the composite panel was also investigated. It has showed that there is high strain concentration at the notch tip. Based on different failure criteria, FEA method with progressive failure procedure was used to simulate the damage progression and failure procedure of the notched stiffened composite panel effectively. The global models were set up firstly to calculate the stress distribution and evaluate the residual strength of the panels with different <b>cut</b> <b>angles.</b> The local model was set up secondly to simulate the local damage and failure extending both in-plane and interface.

Angle defeated number seven ranked Hernandez and followed that up three weeks later by defeating number six ranked A.J. Styles. On the August 19 episode of Impact! the TNA World Heavyweight Championship was vacated and instead of continuing his climb, Angle was entered into an eight-man tournament for the title, defeating X Division Champion Douglas Williams in his first round match.
