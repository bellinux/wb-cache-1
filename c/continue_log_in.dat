25|$|Along many rivers {{the arid}} {{conditions}} have caused courses to be dammed to provide water for irrigation. These dams have caused concerns {{along with those}} caused by other activities. The Yaqui has been dammed with three large reservoirs along its course. The Río Grande de Santiago has also been dammed including the Aguamilpa dam begun in 1991 and the El Cajón Dam (Mexico) upstream from it. To provide irrigation water for farming the dry basin, the Nazas river was dammed in the 1930s and 40s. This {{has led to the}} former drainage lakes in the area drying up, and soil depletion from the elimination of the river as a source of soil.

Furthermore, there are increasing evidences that recruitment of trees might be endangered through events such as climate change, enhanced seed predation or fragmentation. In this study we assess various impacts of tree harvesting in a Dipterocarp lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia, already threatened by recruitment shortage. The results of the simulations of 56 different scenarios using the process-based forest growth model Formind 2. 0 were assessed. Formind 2. 0 {{is based on the}} calculations of the carbon balance of individual trees belonging to 13 different plant functional types. Desturbed recruitment leads to shifts in the abundances of species, to species loss, and to forest decline and dieback depending on the level of recruitment shortage. Forests under recruitment shortage lose their stability, additional disturbances like logging cause permanent and severe changes in tree species composition...|$|R

50|$|The Belize {{region in}} the Yucatan {{peninsula}} was never occupied by either Spain or Guatemala, even though Spain made some exploratory expeditions in the 16th century that served as its basis to claim the area; Guatemala simply inherited that argument to claim the territory, even though it never sent any expedition to the area after the Independence from Spain in 1821, due to the Central American civil war that ensued and lasted until 1860. On the other hand, the British had established a small settlement there {{since the middle of}} the 17th century, mainly as buccaneers quarters and then for fine wood production; the settlements were never recognized as British colonies even though they were somewhat {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Jamaican British government.

50|$|The {{most serious}} {{threats to the}} Balkan lynx are the low {{population}} size, habitat degradation, and poaching. Poaching affects the Balkan lynxes both directly and indirectly. Hunters that hunt the small wildlife and game indirectly harm the Balkan lynxes by restricting their source of food, such as roe deer, chamois, and hares. It is illegal to hunt Balkan lynxes {{but there has been}} evidence that there is a market for Balkan lynx fur. Also, some stuffed lynxes are seen as decorations in some restaurants in the countryside of Albania and Macedonia. Tourists resorts and recreational activities have little to no effects on the population, whereas sport hunting and ski resorts can disturb the population within the national parks, where the majority of the Balkan lynxes habitat. The degradation of habitat is primarily <b>in</b> Albania, where <b>logging</b> has taken its toll on the environment and negatively affects the Balkan lynx. Albania’s forests have been recovering from over exploitation since the 1800s. Although it is illegal to <b>continue</b> <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> the protected Balkan lynx habitat, it is still done and can potentially destroy the only habitat the Balkan lynx has. Because they have such low population density, it is difficult for mature adults to mate with each other. The population is separated into two different sub-populations in Albania and Macedonia, further hindering the mating process, although both populations were confirmed to be stabilized by the Balkan Lynx Recovery Programme. There is a slight worry with the expansion of the native Carpathian and reintroduced Dinaric lynx population that may threaten the genetic integrity of the Balkan lynx population. Public attitudes towards the Balkan lynx were also gauged through social science studies, indicating that they are mostly positive, although not very well known and have many misconceptions about its size, behavior, and ecology.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Generic fully {{automated}} Web-based self-management interventions are upcoming, for example, {{for the growing}} number of breast cancer survivors. It is hypothesized that the use of these interventions is more individualized and that users apply a large amount of self-tailoring. However, technical usage evaluations of these types of interventions are scarce and practical guidelines are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into meaningful usage parameters to evaluate the use of generic {{fully automated}} Web-based interventions by assessing how breast cancer survivors use a generic self-management website. Final aim is to propose practical recommendations for researchers and information and communication technology (ICT) professionals who aim to design and evaluate the use of similar Web-based interventions. METHODS: The BREAst cancer ehealTH (BREATH) intervention is a generic unguided fully automated website with stepwise weekly access and a fixed 4 -month structure containing 104 intervention ingredients (ie, texts, tasks, tests, videos). By monitoring [URL] requests, technical usage statistics were recorded for the intervention group of the randomized controlled trial. Observed usage was analyzed by measures of frequency, duration, and activity. Intervention adherence was defined as continuous usage, or the proportion of participants who started using the intervention and <b>continued</b> to <b>log</b> <b>in</b> during all four phases. By comparing observed to minimal intended usage (frequency and activity), different user groups were defined. RESULTS: Usage statistics for 4 months were collected from 70 breast cancer survivors (mean age 50. 9 years). Frequency of logins/person ranged from 0 to 45, total duration/person from 0 to 2324 minutes (38. 7 hours), and activity from opening none to all intervention ingredients. 31 participants <b>continued</b> <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> to all four phases resulting in an intervention adherence rate of 44. 3 % (95 % CI 33. 2 - 55. 9). Nine nonusers (13 %), 30 low users (43 %), and 31 high users (44 %) were defined. Low and high users differed significantly on frequency (P<. 001), total duration (P<. 001), session duration (P=. 009), and activity (P<. 001). High users <b>logged</b> <b>in</b> an average of 21 times, had a mean session duration of 33 minutes, and opened on average 91 % of all ingredients. Signing the self-help contract (P<. 001), reporting usefulness of ingredients (P=. 003), overall satisfaction (P=. 028), and user friendliness evaluation (P=. 003) were higher in high users. User groups did not differ on age, education, and baseline distress. CONCLUSIONS: By reporting the usage of a self-management website for breast cancer survivors, the present study gained first insight into the design of usage evaluations of generic fully automated Web-based interventions. It is recommended to (1) incorporate usage statistics that reflect the amount of self-tailoring applied by users, (2) combine technical usage statistics with self-reported usefulness, and (3) use qualitative measures. Also, (4) a pilot usage evaluation should be a fixed step in the development process of novel Web-based interventions, and (5) it is essential for researchers to gain insight into the rationale of recorded and nonrecorded usage statistics.
