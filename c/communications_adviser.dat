2500|$|Oliver [...] "Ollie" [...] Reeder (Chris Addison) – Series 1-4 – Ollie is {{a special}} adviser to the Secretary of State (formerly junior policy adviser). An Oxbridge {{graduate}} from Lincolnshire, he is arrogant, inept, inexperienced, somewhat gawky, and often inadvertently the cause of departmental mistakes. However, the minister often takes up his ideas believing them to be vote-winners. During series 1 it is revealed that he once {{had a relationship with}} journalist Angela Heaney (Lucinda Raikes) [...] who makes occasional appearances through the first three series. He was seconded to the Prime Minister's Office after he slept with opposition party worker Emma Messinger (Olivia Poulet) and was told to use his relationship to gather information on opposition party policy. He is described by Terri as [...] "a little bit morally bankrupt and massively self centred and a tiny bit dangerously unreliable". In series 4, he is an advisor to Nicola Murray in her capacity as Leader of the Opposition, but schemes with Malcolm to try and force her resignation. In the series conclusion, he takes over from Malcolm as his party's senior <b>communications</b> <b>adviser.</b>|$|E

Remarking that ‘if Stalin smiles at a visitor, the news is flashed to the world before the smile has left his face’, Gorman (1945 : v) alludes simultaneously to a quickening effect of mass media on the fortunes of politicians and to its supposed preference for demeanour over matters of substance. Jamieson (1996) and Franklin (2004) describe an emerging dynamic between the politicians, their <b>communications</b> <b>advisers,</b> industry lobbyists and media organisations, all vying to influence the ‘packaging’ of politics for public consumption...|$|R

50|$|Privilege {{attaches}} {{not just}} to <b>communications</b> with legal <b>advisers,</b> but also to communications with the employees of legal advisers, like clerks, secretaries and interpreters.

50|$|The {{privilege}} also {{attaches to}} <b>communications</b> between legal <b>advisers</b> and third parties gathering potential {{evidence at the}} instance of legal advisers for clients, {{for the purpose of}} litigation. An example would be where a legal adviser hires a private detective to obtain certain information for use in contemplated litigation. This is what Zeffertt et al. refer to as litigation privilege. This privilege only arises once the litigation is contemplated, unlike the ordinary type of legal professional privilege, which can come into existence prior to the contemplation of litigation.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the interim {{findings of the}} evaluation of the New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) Personal Adviser Service pilot. The aims of the evaluation are to assess how well the NDDP Personal Adviser Service helps people find, or remain in work, and to advise about what is effective in the programme and what is not. The report draws on research conducted {{during the first year of}} the pilot including: depth interviews with clients, Personal Advisers, and employers, a survey of clients and non-participants and labour market studies. Research is ongoing and further findings will be published in the future. The main findings were An active Personal Adviser Service had been established in each pilot area, and much has been achieved. There was evidence that take-up and awareness of the service could be increased. About a third of clients reported a mental health condition as their main health problem, and the same proportion had been out of the labour market for 5 years or more. Clients differ in terms of their motivation and readiness for work. High levels of satisfaction were recorded among clients though not all clients felt they were part of an ongoing programme of action. Clients appreciated the opportunity to discuss their employment prospects with experts, and welcomed the access to training, work experience and other services made available throughout the service. <b>Communications</b> between Personal <b>Advisers</b> were generally good, though sometimes clients felt frustrated when they thought they had received inadequate benefits advice or the options suggested were unsuitable. Employers said they required specialist advice, financial support, in work support and opportunities for work trials from the Personal Adviser Service. There were different views about whether these needs were met and about satisfaction with the service, though those who had contact with it were generally keen to continue to be involved...|$|R
40|$|In 1998, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “ “Commission”) {{released}} a style manual titled “The Plain English Handbook. ” The {{culmination of a}} drive by its Chairman, Arthur Levitt, the Handbook drew upon the rules of grammar, best industry practice, and even the support of billionaire Warren Buffett in calling for a layman 2 ̆ 7 s translation of corporate disclosure documents. To varying degrees, commentators noted {{the significance of the}} Handbook. Initial textual studies provided mixed results. The press marveled at its novelty but securities regulation experts were less sanguine, chiding Commission members for naming themselves “language czars of the universe. ” Meanwhile, the cause of corporate disclosure [...] amission long defined by federal case law [...] continued its second phase as the SEC, the courts, and stock issuers sought {{to strike a balance between}} financial expertise and consumer satisfaction. From this effort came the separate but related causes of evaluating substantive content and delivering it in good faith. These causes eventually morphed, however, forcing jurists to locate further authority animating the remedial securities laws. Consequentially the Handbook, at times, tipped this balance of corporate disclosure. Accordingly, this Article traces the gradual yet impressive growth in importance of a nearly 15 -year-old exhortation. To be sure, the authoritative value of a style manual is a topic of great moment: In the fall of 2012, changes implemented by the controversial federal healthcare law required insurers to publish marketing materials in “plain language. ” Further, the Commission itself is gradually expanding the Handbook 2 ̆ 7 s application to additional mutual fund disclosures, proxy materials, and investment <b>adviser</b> <b>communications.</b> Those commenting on the rule 2 ̆ 7 s primacy will undoubtedly note the lessons of indirect agency rulemaking. Of more immediate consideration, this Article seeks to examine the subtle means by which a call for simplicity may have become grounds for violations of securities law, in the eyes of the government and others. Ultimately, the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s continuing emphasis on simplicity begs the question of which shareholder communications are being read at all...|$|R
