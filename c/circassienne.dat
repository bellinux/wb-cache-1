50|$|Blondel's 1814 {{painting}} La <b>Circassienne</b> au Bain became infamous {{during the}} early part of the 20th century for being the subject of the largest claim for financial compensation made against the White Star line, for a single item of luggage lost by a passenger on the RMS Titanic.|$|E

50|$|Scribe {{died two}} weeks after the premiere of La <b>circassienne.</b> His {{libretto}} was used again in 1871 as the basis for a German-language operetta by Franz von Suppé. Suppé's setting, entitled Fatinitza, achieved great success which led to litigation by Scribe's widow.

50|$|Blondel's {{entry for}} the salon {{exhibition}} in November 1814 {{was a full}} sized figure painting, in oil on canvas, depicting a standing female figure, bathing in an idealised setting from classical antiquity.

50|$|La <b>Circassienne</b> au Bain, {{also known}} as Une Baigneuse, was a large Neoclassical oil {{painting}} from 1814 by Merry-Joseph Blondel depicting a life-sized young Circassian woman bathing in an idealized setting from classical antiquity. The painting was destroyed with {{the sinking of the}} RMS Titanic in 1912.

50|$|La <b>circassienne</b> (The Circassian Woman) is {{an opera}} (opéra comique) in three acts {{composed}} by Daniel Auber to a French-language libretto by Eugène Scribe based on Louvet de Couvrai's 1787 novel Une année de la vie du chevalier de Faublas. It was premiered on 2 February 1861 by the Opéra-Comique {{at the second}} Salle Favart in Paris. Set in Russia during the Russian-Circassian War, the opera was also known under the titles Morte d'amour (Died of Love), La révolte au Sérail (The Revolt in the Seraglio), Alexis, and Faublas.|$|E
5000|$|Aileen Ribeiro {{describes}} the polonaise as [...] "cut in four parts, {{two at the}} front and two at the back," [...] with the bodice closed at the top center front and sloping away at the sides, leaving a triangular gap that was filled by a false waistcoat. Sleeves could be three-quarter length or long, and various styles such as the Irish, Italian and French polonaise were described by contemporaries. [...] A variation on the robe à la polonaise was the robe à la <b>circassienne,</b> cut the same but trimmed with [...] "oriental" [...] tassels or fur.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{creation}} was Olga in Daniel Auber's La <b>circassienne,</b> premiered on 2 February 1861 by the Opéra-Comique at {{the second}} Salle Favart. [...] The Musical World (16 February) found her [...] "perfectly dazzling with grace and beauty in her three rich costumes, ... especially in the first act, in which her entrance enchanted the whole house." [...] Vocally, her portrayal in the quartet in the first act was [...] "charming and natural" [...] and in the challenging ballad à vocalises, grand air, and love duet of the third act, [...] "graceful and already brilliant" [...] without however being {{at the level of}} a Laure Cinti-Damoreau or Caroline Miolan-Carvalho.|$|E
5000|$|However, the opera's success {{proved to}} be short-lived. In October 1861 an adapted English version of La <b>circassienne</b> was given three {{performances}} by the Caroline Richings opera company in Philadelphia, but it received no performances in Europe outside France. It remained in the Opéra-Comique's repertoire for only one year {{with a total of}} 49 performances. In his reminiscences of an encounter with Auber shortly after the premiere, Wagner described it as [...] "an uncommonly childish piece of patchwork, scarcely credible as coming from its grey-haired author" [...] and wrote that Auber refused to talk about it, telling him [...] "Ah, let us leave the farces in peace!" [...] The opera's overture was still occasionally played as a concert piece in the late 19th century and was recorded in the 1970s by Arthur Dennington conducting the Modern Symphony Orchestra (released on the Rare Recorded Editions label).|$|E

5000|$|La <b>circassienne</b> {{was one of}} Auber's last operas, {{composed}} when he {{was nearly}} 80 years old. His librettist, Eugène Scribe, had been Auber's regular collaborator since 1823 and had written the libretto for his greatest success, Fra Diavolo. The opera was premiered by the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 2 February 1861 in a production directed by Ernest Mocker. In his review of the premiere for Le Ménestrel, Jacques Heugel praised the score as Auber's [...] "most youthful, clever, and refined music", admirably adapted to Scribe's witty libretto and demonstrating once again that he was [...] "the French musician par excellence". He went on to describe the opening night as [...] "a true success" [...] with the audience [...] "in raptures". An English vocal score translated by Thomas Oliphant was published shortly after the premiere as were numerous parlour music versions and instrumental fantasies on the score by various composers, including Eugène Ketterer.|$|E
