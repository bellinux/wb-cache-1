Another means of removing snow and ice is by heating the pavement itself so there is no build up. The pavement can either be heated by imbedding electric heating mats or running heated fluid or gas through embedded pipes. A new experimental way of heating pavement is to use the pavement itself as the electric heating element.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} the audiologic phenotype in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Study design: Observational study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: One hundred eighty-two patients with genetically confirmed OI, aged 3 to 89 years. Intervention: Diagnostic hearing evaluation through otoadmittance and acoustic stapedius reflex measurements, pure tone, and speech audiometry. Main outcome measure(s) : Prevalence, type, severity, symmetry, and audiometric {{configuration of the}} hearing loss in OI. Progression of hearing thresholds was determined by constructing age-related typical audiograms. Results: Approximately 52. 2 % of all OI patients demonstrated hearing loss unilaterally (7. 7 %) or bilaterally (44. 5 %). Pure <b>conductive,</b> <b>mixed</b> and pure sensorineural hearing losses were observed in 8. 5 %, 37. 8 % and 11. 6 % of OI ears, respectively. Multiple linear regression revealed that thresholds progressed by 0. 5 dB/year at 0. 25 kHz to 0. 8 dB/year at 0. 8 kHz in the ears with <b>conductive</b> or <b>mixed</b> hearing loss. Pure sensorineural hearing loss progressed by less than 0. 1 dB/year at 0. 25 kHz to 1. 2 dB/year at 8. 0 kHz. Audiometric configuration was predominantly flat (70. 5 %) in the ears with conductive/mixed loss, and sloping (50. 0 %) in those with pure sensorineural loss. Conclusions: Patients with OI {{are at risk for}} hearing loss. The hearing loss in OI may initiate at a young age and is progressive. However, the rate of progression, as well as the hearing loss severity, onset and configuration depend on the type of hearing loss, which may be conductive/mixed or pure sensorineural. For both types, age-related threshold audiograms are constructed and may help the clinician to estimate the course of the hearing loss in patients with OI. In addition, they may be valuable to distinguish between hearing loss associated with OI and other similar forms of hearing loss, such as in otosclerosis...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAfter {{more than}} 20 years of {{clinical}} experience in children, bone-anchored hearing aids, essentially BAHA®, {{have become the}} standard treatment for <b>conductive</b> or <b>mixed</b> hearing loss. Based on a general {{review of the literature}} and the authors’ own experience, this article reviews the use of bone-anchored hearing aids in children. The main indications for bone-anchored hearing aids are a minimum age of 5 years at the time of implantation and/or cortical bone thickness≥ 3 mm. Fixture loss is observed in 40 % of {{children under the age of}} 5 years versus 8 % for children aged 5 to 10 years and 1 % for children over the age of 10 years, i. e. identical to the rate observed in adults. Skin complications are similar to those observed in adults and must be prevented by parental education and regular follow-up. Surgery is generally performed in two stages or as a one-stage procedure for fixtures≥ 4 mm. The functional success rate, correlated with medium- and long-term use of BAHA® is about 96 %. BAHA® may be indicated in children with profound unilateral hearing loss following a trial period wearing a BAHA® headband for several weeks with the child's active participation. Sequential bilateral implantation requires complementary investigations and appears to provide improved perception in noise. This type of hearing aid provides an improvement of the quality of life of children with bilateral <b>conductive</b> and/or <b>mixed</b> hearing loss which should be further improved as a result of recent technical developments...|$|R

Percutaneous bone-conduction devices gave satisfactory hearing outcomes but were frequently complicated by soft tissue reactions. Transcutaneous bone conduction devices were developed {{in order to address}} some of the issues related to the skin-penetrating abutment. The aim {{of this article is to}} present a systematic review of the indications, surgical technique and audiological, clinical and functional outcomes of the BAHA Attract device reported so far. Methods A systematic computer-based literature search was performed on the PubMed database as well as Scopus, Cochrane and Google Scholar. Out of 497 articles, 10 studies and 89 reported cases were finally included in our review. Results The vast majority of implanted patients were satisfied with the aesthetics of the device scoring highly at the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, Glasgow Benefit Inventory and Client Oriented Scale of Improvement. Overall, hearing outcomes, tested by various means including speech in noise, free field hearing testing and word discrimination scores showed a significant improvement. Complications included seroma or haematoma formation, numbness around the area of the flap, swelling and detachment of the sound processor from the external magnet.

The secondary {{objective was to}} gather information regarding device fitting, as well as to refine surgical procedures. PATIENTS: Five German-speaking adults from 2 European study sites were implanted with a VSB using an FMT-PORP/TORP assembly and evaluated before and after surgery for air-and bone-conduction thresholds and speech recognition performance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluating the safety and efficacy of the VSB in combination with a PORP or TORP to treat <b>conductive</b> and <b>mixed</b> hearing loss. RESULTS: Residual cochlear hearing was unaffected by implantation with the device. Functional gain (measured as the difference between preoperative unaided and postoperative VSB-aided thresholds) could be calculated in 2 of 5 subjects, demonstrating that the VSB is effective in treating bone-conduction hearing losses of moderate/severe degree. Word recognition tests in quiet and noise showed good improvement in 3 of the cases. One patient experienced several other medical problems, making her audiological outcomes limited. One patient was excluded from the study owing to insufficient benefit and subsequently underwent revision surgery with FMT placement at the round window.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bone-anchored {{hearing aids}} (BAHAs) are {{indicated}} {{for people with}} <b>conductive</b> or <b>mixed</b> hearing loss who can benefit from amplification of sound. In resource limited health care systems, {{it is important that}} evidence regarding the benefit of BAHAs is critically appraised to aid decision-making. OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: To assess the clinical effectiveness of BAHAs for people with bilateral hearing impairment. TYPE OF REVIEW: Systematic review. SEARCH STRATEGY: Nineteen electronic resources were searched from inception to November 2009. Additional studies were sought from reference lists, clinical experts and BAHA manufacturers. EVALUATION METHOD: Inclusion criteria were applied by two reviewers independently. Data extraction and quality assessment of full papers were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second. Studies were synthesised through narrative review with tabulation of results. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included. Studies suggested audiological benefits of BAHAs when compared with bone-conduction hearing aids or no aiding. A mixed pattern of results was seen when BAHAs were compared to air-conduction hearing aids. Improvements in quality of life with BAHAs were found by a hearing-specific instrument but not generic quality of life measures. Issues such as improvement of discharging ears and length of time the aid can be worn were not adequately addressed by the studies. Studies demonstrated some benefits of bilateral BAHAs. Adverse events data were limited. The quality of the studies was low. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence is weak. As such, caution is indicated in the interpretation of presently available data. However, based on the available evidence, BAHAs appear to be a reasonable treatment option for people with bilateral <b>conductive</b> or <b>mixed</b> hearing loss. Further research into the benefits of BAHAs, including quality of life, is required to reduce the uncertainty. <br/...|$|R

In this application, a conductive concrete overlay is cast on top of a bridge deck for deicing and anti-icing. The mechanical and physical properties of the <b>conductive</b> concrete <b>mix</b> were evaluated in accordance with the ASTM and AASHTO specifications. ^ Two concrete slabs, 2 m by 2 m and 1. 2 m by 3. 6 m (7 ft x 7 ft and 4 ft x 12 ft), have been constructed with a 9 cm (3. 5 in.) conductive concrete overlay for conducting deicing experiments in the natural environment. Deicing experiments were conducted in five snowstorms during the winter of 1998 under two scenarios: deicing and anti-icing. Average power of about 591 W/m 2 (55 W/ft 2) was generated by the conductive concrete to prevent snow accumulation and ice formation. This power level is consistent with the successful deicing applications using electrical heating cited in the literature. The results showed that a conductive concrete overlay has the potential to become the most cost-effective bridge deck deicing and anti-icing method. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCONCLUSION: Bone {{conduction}} implants {{are useful}} in patients with <b>conductive</b> and <b>mixed</b> hearing loss for whom conventional surgery or hearing aids are no longer an option. They may also be used in patients affected by single-sided deafness. OBJECTIVES: To establish a consensus on the quality standards required for centers willing to create a bone conduction implant program. METHOD: To ensure a consistently high level of service and to provide patients with the best possible solution {{the members of the}} HEARRING network have established a set of quality standards for bone conduction implants. These standards constitute a realistic minimum attainable by all implant clinics and should be employed alongside current best practice guidelines. RESULTS: Fifteen items are thoroughly analyzed. They include team structure, accommodation and clinical facilities, selection criteria, evaluation process, complete preoperative and surgical information, postoperative fitting and assessment, follow-up, device failure, clinical management, transfer of care and patient complaints...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Otosclerosis {{is one of}} the commonest non infective {{causes of}} {{acquired}} deafness in adults’. ‘Otosclerosis’ literally means hardening of the ear. It is a primary and exclusive disease of otic capsule of human temporal bone. Otosclerosis is characterised by alternate phases of bone resorption and formation. If the location of bony changes produces evident clinical manifestations term “C linical Otosclerosis” is used. If bony changes are not translated into clinical manifestations, the term used is “histologica l Otosclerosis”. Antonio Valsalva in 1735 gave first description of ankylosis of stapes to margins of oval window. Von Troltsch in 1881 coined the term ‘Otosclerosis’. Politzer in 1893 first described Otosclerosis as a primary disease of otic capsule. Alth ough the clinical course of the disease is well documented, its aetiology remains unclear; thus, multiple theories are available. But none of them has established a definite cause. Otosclerosis usually manifests as a progressive <b>conductive</b> or <b>mixed</b> hearing loss occurring clinically to varying degrees in 0. 5...|$|R
