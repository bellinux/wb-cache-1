This mo-tion can be {{approximated}} with that of an inverted pendulum with discrete movements of the <b>contact</b> <b>point.</b> We <b>detail</b> here how to use the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) for selecting successive <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> in such a way that the centre of mass (COM) of the robot flexibly follows a predefined set of waypoints on a straight or curved trajectory, allowing it to move forward, stop and revert its direction of motion in stable way. The use of a fixed step cycle duration reduces the mathematical complexity and the computational load, ena-bling real-time updating of gait parameters in a microcontroller. ...|$|R

We study a geometry in which such edge states will manifest themselves in a qualitative manner through periodic oscillations in the magnetoconductance of a singly connected sample coupled to leads through narrow <b>point</b> <b>contacts.</b> <b>Detailed</b> calculations identify the parameters for which these oscillations {{are expected to be}} the strongest, and also show their robustness to disorder. Such oscillations {{can be used as a}} spectroscopic tool of the edge states. A large change in the device resistance at small B, termed giant edge magnetoresistance, can have potential for application. © 2009 The American Physical Society. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Contact state {{information}} is indispensable for performing skillful tasks {{in which an}} end-effector should be {{in contact with the}} environment. In previous work, the authors introduced the concept of a pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> that is useful for tasks involving contact as one expression of the contact state. In this paper, an extended definition of the pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> is proposed. The pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> is defined as the foot of the perpendicular from the nearest point on a reference object to the line on which the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> and external force vector lie. The system may estimate the contact state and its transitions by monitoring the pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> {{in spite of the fact}} that the pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> does not always denote the real <b>contact</b> <b>point.</b> Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our method, which is particularly valuable in providing an intuitive positional description of a contact state...|$|R

The two waves meet up at the last <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> because the first wave reflects off {{the opposite side of the}} last ball and it meets up at the last <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> with the second wave. Then they reverberate back and forth like this about 10 times until the first ball stops connecting with the 2nd ball.

40|$|The SureSmile®-sytem (Orametrix®, Richardson, Texas, USA) is an {{orthodontic}} treatment software. It uses virtual jaw models generated by intraoral scans (OraScanner®) {{of the patients}} situation for the orthodontic setup. The intraoral scans miss the surfaces of approximal tooth contacts due to optical limitations. These approximal surfaces are virtually reconstructed by the SureSmile®-software using idealized tooth templates (= SureSmile® theeth). The aim at {{this study was to}} evaluate the softbare-based reconstruction of the approximal situation regarding accuracy and dependence on thooth position. Eight upper and eight lower jaw models composed from extracted theeth were scanned with the OraScanner®. Furthermore all theeth were scanned separately (= original teeth) to compare the approximal surfaces of the original teeth with the SureSmile® teeth using the reverse engeneering software Rapidform® and GeoAnanlyzer®. In only 57. 7 % the approximal <b>contacts</b> <b>points</b> of the SureSmile® theeth matched the <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> of the original theeth (kappa= 0. 044). The SureSmile® software signification reconstructed more <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> between theeth of existing original theeth contacts (p< 0, 001). 416 approximal <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> were analyzed. The arithmetic mean of mesiodistal deviation of <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> of original theeth and SureSmile® teeth was 0. 099 mm with a maximum value of 0. 563 mm and a standard deviation of 0. 080 mm. With regard to clinical relevance all <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> differences between original theeth and SureSmile® teeth of 0. 1 mm or below were consideral matching <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> By applying this tolerance 58. 9 % of the approximal contacts were correctly rebuild by the SureSmile® software. Applying this level of tolerance 58. 9 % of the SureSmile® <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> were created identically to the original teeth. There were no significant differences neither in the univariate analysis nor in the multivariate analysis regarding to the location (upper or lower jaw) or region (anterior teeth, bicuspids, molars) ...|$|R
