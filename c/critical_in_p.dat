40|$|SummaryThe urothelium is a {{multilayered}} epithelium {{that serves}} as a barrier between the urinary tract and blood, preventing the exchange of water and toxic substances. It consists of superficial cells specialized for synthesis and transport of uroplakins that assemble into a tough apical plaque, one or more layers of intermediate cells, and keratin 5 -expressing basal cells (K 5 -BCs), which are considered to be progenitors in the urothelium and other specialized epithelia. Fate mapping, however, reveals that intermediate cells rather than K 5 -BCs are progenitors in the adult regenerating urothelium, that P cells, a transient population, are progenitors in the embryo, and that retinoids are <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>P</b> cells and intermediate cells, respectively, for their specification during development and regeneration. These observations have important implications for tissue engineering and repair and, ultimately, may lead to treatments that prevent loss of the urothelial barrier, a major cause of voiding dysfunction and bladder pain syndrome...|$|E

We first conduct a measurement study on a representative private BitTorrent site, examining how incentives influence user behavior. Our measurement study shows that, as compared with public torrents, a private BitTorrent site provides more incentive for users to contribute and seed. Second, we develop a game theoretic model and analytically show that the ratio mechanism indeed provides effective incentives. But existing ratio incentives in private BitTorrent sites are vulnerable to collusions. Third, to prevent collusion, we propose an upload entropy scheme, and show through analysis and experiment that the entropy scheme successfully limits colluding, while rarely affecting normal users who do not collude.

We found that p 21 proteolysis requires functional ubiquitin and Nedd 8 systems. Ubiquitinylated forms of p 21 and p 21 (K 0), a p 21 mutant missing all lysines, are detected in vivo and in vitro, showing {{that the presence of}} lysines is dispensable for p 21 ubiquitinylation. Instead, the free amino group of the N-terminal methionine of p 21 is a site for ubiquitinylation in vivo. Although wild-type p 21 is more abundantly ubiquitinylated than p 21 (K 0) mutant due to the presence of internal lysine residues, their rates of proteolysis are indistinguishable. These results demonstrate that proteasomal degradation of p 21 is regulated by the ubiquitin pathway and suggest that the site of the ubiquitin chain is <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> making <b>p</b> 21 a competent substrate for the proteasome...|$|R

To ensure the integrity, transaction records are signed by the witnesses and organized as a chronicle chain. With very limited data stored on the network, no peer can modify or discard these transaction records without being detected. Compared with other reputation systems, our design is more lightweighted in terms of reputation maintenance and retrieval. It is scalable since each transaction only involves a constant number of peers. By recording the raw transaction history, R-Chain can also be integrated with different trust models to prevent various attacks. ...|$|R

In this study, we have generated and analyzed p 37 (Ing 1) -deficient mice and primary cells to further explore the role of Ing 1 in the regulation of cell growth and p 53 activity.

40|$|A {{hallmark}} of behavior is that animals respond to environmental change by switching from one behavioral state to another. However, {{information on the}} molecular underpinnings of these behavioral shifts {{and how they are}} mediated by the environment is lacking. The ant Pheidole pallidula with its morphologically and behaviorally distinct major and minor workers is an ideal system to investigate behavioral shifts. The physically larger majors are predisposed to defend the ant nest, whereas the smaller minors are the foragers. Despite this predisposition, majors are able to shift to foraging according {{to the needs of the}} colony. We show that the ant foraging (ppfor) gene, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), mediates this shift. Majors have higher brain PKG activities than minors, and the spatial distribution of the PPFOR protein differs in these workers. Specifically, majors express the PPFOR protein in 5 cells in the anterior face of the ant brain, whereas minors do not. Environmental manipulations show that PKG is lower in the presence of a foraging stimulus and higher when defense is required. Finally, pharmacological activation of PKG increases defense and reduces foraging behavior. Thus, PKG signaling plays a <b>critical</b> role <b>in</b> <b>P.</b> pallidula behavioral shifts...|$|R

Looking for the mechanisms involved in this process, we demonstrate that the histone acetyl transferase Tip 60 directly interacts with RB and stimulates its degradation by the proteasome through acetylation of its C-terminus. Furthermore, and consistent with p 14 ARF-induced RB accumulation, we provide evidence that p 14 ARF prevents Tip 60 -mediated RB acetylation, therefore precluding its proteasomal degradation. Overall, our results identify a novel mechanism by which p 14 ARF controls the RB pathway to trigger its antiproliferative function...|$|R
40|$|The p 53 tumor {{suppressor}} {{regulates the}} cellular response to genetic damage through its {{function as a}} sequence-specific transcription factor. Among the most well-characterized transcriptional targets of p 53 is the mdm 2 oncogene. Activation of mdm 2 is <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> the <b>p</b> 53 pathway because the mdm 2 protein marks p 53 for proteosome-mediated degradation, thereby providing a negative-feedback loop. Here we show that the ATM-related TRRAP protein functionally cooperates with p 53 to activate mdm 2 transcription. TRRAP is a component of several multiprotein acetyltransferase complexes implicated in both transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. In support of a role for these complexes in mdm 2 expression, we show that transactivation of the mdm 2 gene is augmented by pharmacological inhibition of cellular deacetylases. In vitro analysis demonstrates that p 53 directly binds to a TRRAP domain previously shown to be an activator docking site. Furthermore, transfection of cells with antisense TRRAP blocks p 53 -dependent transcription of mdm 2. Finally, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate direct p 53 -dependent recruitment of TRRAP to the mdm 2 promoter, followed by increased histone acetylation. These findings suggest a model <b>in</b> which <b>p</b> 53 directly recruits a TRRAP/acetyltransferase complex to the mdm 2 gene to activate transcription.

The effects of HIPK 2 on p 53 are not observed with kinase deficient HIPK 2 mutants. However, HIPK 2 is not sufficient for phosphorylation of three crucial serine residues of p 53, suggesting that HIPK 2 -induced p 53 activation does not involve phosphorylation of p 53. Instead, HIPK 2 leads to a downregulation of p 53 -induced Mdm 2 protein and this may lead to stabilization of p 53. Overexpression of HIPK 2 does not lead to a change of Mdm 2 mRNA expression.

This case study tries to evaluate the effect of different utilization levels on species richness in Saral. Therefore three areas (Reference, Key and Critical region) were determined for this evaluation. Then species richness data were collected by Whittaker plot in ten replications for any region and these data were analyzed by factorial experiment. Finally treatment mean (plot size and three declared area) were compared by Duncan’s multiple range test. Results show that there are significant differences between treatments mean plot size and reference, key and <b>critical</b> regions <b>in</b> <b>P</b> but interaction effects (area × plot size) don’t have a significant difference. </p...|$|R
40|$|Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{technology}} can be naturally integrated with mobile agent technology in Internet applications, {{taking advantage of the}} autonomy, mobility, and efficiency of mobile agents in accessing and processing data. In this paper, we address the problem of protecting <b>critical</b> information <b>in</b> agentbased <b>P</b> 2 P Internet applications under two different scenarios. First, we assume the route of a mobile agent <b>in</b> the <b>P</b> 2 P system is fixed. Under this assumption, we propose the usage of an efficient parallel dispatch model where the agent's route is signcrypted at the first step and dispatched to each new peer to collect information. Then, we assume the route is not specified and we propose the usage of a modified multi-signcryption scheme to guarantee protection. Based on this second approach, a mobile agent determines the next peer to communicate with independently and information is collected dynamically in one round of visiting a group of peers. Security issues under the two proposed models are then discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{low-temperature}} {{thermal expansion}} of CeCoIn 5 single crystals measured parallel and perpendicular to magnetic fields B oriented along the c axis yields the volume thermal-expansion coefficient β. Considerable deviations of β(T) from Fermi-liquid behavior occur already within the superconducting {{region of the}} (B, T) phase diagram and become maximal at the upper critical field B^ 0 _c 2. However, β(T) and the Grüneisen parameter Γ are incompatible with a quantum critical point (QCP) at B^ 0 _c 2, but allow for a QCP shielded by superconductivity and extending to negative pressures for B < B^ 0 _c 2. Together with literature data we construct a tentative (p, B, T) phase diagram of CeCoIn 5 suggesting a quantum <b>critical</b> line <b>in</b> the (<b>p,</b> B) plane.
