5|$|Heavily {{built and}} {{characteristically}} smooth, the pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 Gaudí {{accepted}} a commission from Josep Maria Bocabella, promotor of the Sagrada Família, for an altar in the oratory of the Bocabella family, who had obtained {{permission from the}} Pope to have an altar in their home. The altar is made of varnished mahogany, with a slab of white marble in the centre for relics. It is decorated with plants and religious motifs, such as the Greek letters alpha and omega, symbol of the beginning and end, gospel phrases and images of Saint Francis of Paola, Saint Teresa of Avila and the Holy Family and closed with a <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> crimson embroidery. It {{was made by the}} cabinet maker Frederic Labòria, who also collaborated with Gaudí on the Sagrada Família.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is a <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese sleeper ray has {{an almost}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc wider than long. Two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{under the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The small, protruding eyes are immediately followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are small and placed close together, and between them is a <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin that overlaps the mouth. The protrusible mouth forms a short, transverse line and is surrounded by a deep groove. There are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw, arranged into bands; the teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns. Five pairs of short gill slits are located on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray has a soft, flabby body devoid of dermal denticles. It has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1.2 times {{as wide as}} long, with a nearly straight front margin {{and a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs visible beneath the skin. The eyes are small and followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles; the space from the spiracles to the snout tip is about 1.8 times the distance between the spiracles. There is a <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth, which is arched with deep furrows at the corners. The distance between the mouth and the snout tip is about equal to the mouth width, and three times that of the distance between the nostrils. There are 25–28 upper tooth rows and 19–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is tiny and smooth, with a single sharp cusp.|$|E
5|$|The crossback stingaree's {{pectoral}} fin disc is slightly wider than long and oval in shape, with the anterior margins nearly straight and converging {{at a very}} obtuse angle.

5|$|The {{deepwater}} stingray has a flabby body, with enlarged pectoral fins {{forming a}} disc usually {{longer than it}} is wide. The leading margins of the disc converge at a broad angle. The snout is thin and measures over six times {{as long as the}} diameter of the orbit; the snout tip protrudes slightly from the disc. The small eyes are positioned just ahead of the spiracles, which have angular posterior rims. The large, circular nostrils are placed close to the mouth, to which they are connected by a pair of broad grooves. Between the nostrils is a broad <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin with a strongly fringed posterior margin. The wide, straight mouth contains 32–60 tooth rows in either jaw, increasing in number with age. Each tooth is small with a low, blunt cusp; in adult males the teeth at the center are sharp and backward-pointing. The five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|The giant {{freshwater}} stingray has a thin, oval {{pectoral fin}} disc slightly longer than wide and broadest towards the front. The elongated snout {{has a wide}} base and a sharply pointed tip that projects beyond the disc. The eyes are minute and widely spaced; behind them are large spiracles. Between the nostrils is a short <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The small mouth forms a gentle arch and contains four to seven papillae (two to four large at the center and one to four small to the sides) on the floor. The small and rounded teeth are arranged into pavement-like bands. There are five pairs of gill slits on the ventral side of the disc. The pelvic fins are small and thin; mature males have relatively large claspers.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the finless sleeper ray is oval in shape; it is slightly wider than long in adults, and circular or longer than wide in juveniles. The small and bulging eyes are immediately followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles of roughly equal size. A pair of kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. A <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin, reaching the mouth, is present between the small, circular nostrils. The nostrils are connected to the corners of the mouth by a pair of grooves. The small mouth is gently arched and protrusible. The flattened teeth have hexagonal bases and are arranged into narrow bands. There are five pairs of short gill slits.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the mangrove whipray is very thick and oval in shape, measuring 0.9–1.0 times {{as wide as}} long. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at a broad angle on the snout tip. The medium-sized, widely spaced eyes are immediately followed by the spiracles. Between the long, thin nostrils is a short, broad <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The lower jaw is bow-shaped, and there are 0–5 papillae across {{the floor of the}} mouth. The teeth are arranged in a quincunx pattern and number 40–50 rows in the upper jaw and 38–50 rows in the lower jaw. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the ocellated electric ray is heart- or trowel-shaped and slightly wider than long. A pair of large, kidney-shaped electric organs are {{visible through the}} skin {{on either side of}} the head. The small eyes are followed by smaller spiracles, which have seven to ten small, rounded projections on their rims. The snout is broadly rounded, with each nostril divided into two openings by a strut. Between the nostrils is a <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin with a smooth to gently wavy posterior margin. The small mouth forms a transverse line; the edge of the lower jaw is scalloped, and when closed usually conceals the teeth. There are 14–16 tooth rows in each jaw. The small and pointed teeth become progressively longer and sharper towards the back, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. Five pairs of small gill slits are present on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the pink whipray is diamond-shaped and thick at the center, measuring about 1.1–1.2 times wider than long. The outer {{corners of the}} disc are angular. The snout forms a very obtuse angle, with the tip barely protruding. The small, widely spaced eyes are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is fairly small and surrounded by prominent furrows; the lower jaw has a small indentation in the middle. There are two large central and two tiny lateral papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The teeth are small and arranged into pavement-like surfaces. Five pairs of gill slits are located beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the porcupine ray is evenly oval, almost {{as wide as}} long, and very thick at the center, giving it a domed appearance. The {{tip of the snout}} is rounded and barely protruding. The small eyes are closely followed by much larger spiracles. Between the narrow nostrils is a skirt-shaped <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin; the posterior margin of the curtain is strongly fringed and overhangs the mouth. The mouth bears 3–5 papillae on the floor and prominent furrows at the corners. The area around the mouth, including the curtain, are heavily covered by more papillae. There are around 48 tooth rows in either jaw. The teeth are small and flattened. Five pairs of gill slits are located {{on the underside of the}} disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray has a thin, diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc roughly 1.2 times wider than long, with slightly concave leading margins and narrowly rounded outer corners. The snout forms an obtuse angle {{and has a}} pointed tip. The small, closely spaced eyes are followed by crescent-shaped spiracles. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin between them; the posterior margin of the curtain is fringed and forms two lobes. The small mouth is surrounded by papillae and bears prominent furrows at the corners. There are two papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The teeth number 33–38 rows in the upper jaw and 31–40 rows in the lower; the teeth are small and vary from pointed to blunt. The five pairs of gill slits are S-shaped. The pelvic fins are medium-sized and triangular with angular corners.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray has a thick {{pectoral}} fin disc wider {{than it is}} long, with a smoothly rounded outer margin. The eyes are of medium size and are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin between the oval nostrils, with a finely fringed trailing margin. The mouth is wide and curved, with faint furrows at the corners. There is a row of seven papillae on the floor, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 37–46 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 39–45 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small with a deep groove across the crown, and are arranged in a dense quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces.|$|E

5|$|The sparsely-spotted stingaree, white-spotted stingaree, or Dixon's stingaree (Urolophus paucimaculatus) is {{a species}} of {{stingray}} in the family Urolophidae, common off the southern Australian coast. Preferring sandy flats and seagrass beds, this benthic ray can be found from close to shore {{to a depth of}} at least , and tends to occur deeper in the northern portion of its range. Reaching a length of , this species has a broad, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc that is typically plain gray in color above with a V-shaped marking between the eyes. Individuals from southerly waters also generally exhibit a smattering of small, dark-edged white spots. This ray is further characterized by a distinctively bell-shaped <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin between the nostrils. Its tail has a skin fold running along either side and a leaf-shaped caudal fin, but no dorsal fin.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted {{stingray}} {{has a more}} or less diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc wider than long, with rounded outer corners. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on the fleshy snout, the tip of which barely protrudes from the disc. The small eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards the back. Between the nostrils is a bell-shaped <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> skin with a finely fringed trailing margin; only the Kapala stingaree (U.kapalensis) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The small mouth contains five or six papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor, most of which have forked tips. Additional small papillae are present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Battalion, 24th Infantry {{relieved}} the 1st Battalion in the Battle Mountain area on August 27, and 1st Battalion withdrew to reserve, {{except for}} C Company which remained on Battle Mountain {{as a part}} of Task Force Baker. The next day, August 28, North Korean attacks continued. That day, a North Korean company-sized attack struck between C and I Companies before dawn. That night, North Korean mortar fire fell on C Company on Battle Mountain. After midnight, a North Korean infantry force appeared in the rear area and captured the command post. Some men of C Company left their positions on Battle Mountain without firing when the attack began at 02:45 the next morning, August 29. The North Koreans then directed their attack toward E Company and overran part of its positions. Airdrops after daylight kept C Company supplied with ammunition, and a <b>curtain</b> <b>of</b> artillery fire, sealing off approaches from the North Koreans' main positions prevented substantial reinforcements from entering the fight. All day on August 29, artillery fire and air strikes racked the North Koreans occupying E Company's old positions. Then, in the evening, E Company counterattacked and reoccupied the lost ground.|$|E
