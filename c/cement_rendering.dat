500|$|There was a Presbyterian visiting preacher in Hagley, from Deloraine, Tasmania, from 1854. Services {{were held}} {{at this time in}} the Methodist Chapel. Regular Presbyterian {{services}} were being held by 1855, most likely in the original Church of England building. In the late 1870s, the old Church of England was purchased, along with the associated land, by the Presbyterian church for 265 pounds. The building was demolished in 1878 and construction of a new church was begun almost on the same site. During demolition and construction, Presbyterian services were again held at the Methodist chapel. The foundation stone was laid 18 March 1879 by which time the walls were already nearly complete. <b>Cement</b> <b>rendering</b> has hidden the stone and its location is uncertain. [...] Hagley Presbyterian Church's first services were held on 14 December 1879. A manse was built nearby in 1884.|$|E

50|$|Lamonby Hall, a Grade II listed building, is {{described}} as late 16th- or early 17th-century with 20th-century alterations. It is built of large blocks of sandstone rubble with <b>cement</b> <b>rendering</b> and a greenslate roof with bandedsandstone chimney stacks. After the Reformation, the hall {{is said to have}} included a Roman Catholic chapel. In the reign of Elizabeth, a certain Juliana Buckle of Yorkshire bought the hall on account of the chapel and kept a priest there {{for as long as it}} remained safe to do so. The chapel appears to be the origin of a piece of floral carving used in the large, segmental-arched main fireplace.|$|E
5000|$|... 'The Old Grey Mother' is {{an affectionate}} {{name for the}} school, {{referring}} to the older part of the current building, which is both very old (1789) and very grey, as the original beautiful sandstone was first cement rendered to prevent water ingress which then became stained over the 19th Century by the local industrial chimneys' smoke emissions. The Former Pupils' Association occasionally use this name in correspondence to members. The term [...] "Old Grey Mother" [...] was first used when the original sandstone front of the Headmaster's House {{was covered with a}} <b>cement</b> <b>rendering</b> which discoloured badly (due to industrial chimney discharges) until cleaned in the 1980s.|$|E

5000|$|In February 1934 {{work was}} begun on {{extending}} the abbey church, with eighty monks working continuously {{for four years}} on a project which saw the building lengthened from 90 feet to 220 feet. The architect was F.J Bradford of Leicester, who mirrored the western nave by Pugin, by continuing the church east by five bays, to make a nave for the laity and a monastic choir in the original nave. The site of the extension was a sloping platform of solid rock, which was blasted away {{on one side and}} filled in on the other with mass concrete to provide a level foundation for the building.A contemporary account noted that [...] "The interior finish affords an outstanding example of the craft of <b>cement</b> <b>rendering.</b> All walls have been given three coats, using water-repellent cement, the final coat being in a cream cement mixture.

5000|$|Originally {{an eight}} storeyed, timber frame {{brickwork}} {{construction in the}} Federation warehouse tradition, this building is set on a two storey podium of <b>cement</b> <b>render.</b> Plain brick piers, linked at each floor level by recessed horizontal bands of <b>cement</b> <b>render,</b> rise from above the podium. The corner piers are extended to block-like turrets above the roof line. The original plain brick parapet bore the name [...] "Perry Bros. Ltd.". This was removed in 1923 {{to make way for}} the addition of another storey between the turrets. The present parapet above the additional storey bears the name [...] "Perry House". The strong straight lines of the piers are relieved at both podium and turret levels by the use of arch and keystone elements. Bands of <b>cement</b> <b>render</b> on the turrets and upper storey provide an intensified echo of the banded effect on the main body of the building.|$|R
