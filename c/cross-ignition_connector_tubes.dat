However, thrombus formation at the interface between a <b>connector</b> and <b>tube</b> is still a potential source of thrombus-related complications that induce stroke or myocardial infarction. We aimed to develop a non-blood-contacting real-time method for visualizing thrombus formation, and to experimentally investigate the time-dependent phenomenon of thrombus formation at the interface between a <b>connector</b> and a <b>tube</b> in a medical device. An optical coherence tomography device with a center wavelength of 1330 nm was used to visualize thrombus formation during porcine blood circulation for 50 min in a closed 50 -mL circulation system isolated from ambient air. The thrombus formation sites at the interface between a <b>tube</b> and <b>connector</b> were visualized. The area of the thrombus formation at the interface between the inlet of the <b>connector</b> and the <b>tube</b> {{was found to be}} 0. 012 ± 0. 011 mm 2. Conversely, at the interface between the outlet of the <b>connector</b> and the <b>tube,</b> the area was found to be 0. 637 ± 0. 306 mm 2. Thus, significantly larger amounts of thrombus were formed at the outlet interface (p < 0. 01). The thrombus formation area at the outlet interface increased over time. Conversely, the area of thrombus formation showed repeated increasing and decreasing behavior at the inlet interface. Flow visualization with particle image velocimetry showed the presence of a flow separated area in the minimal flow phase at the inlet interface and a large recirculating slow flow region at the outlet interface in the minimal flow phase. These data suggested that the recirculating stagnant flow region contributed to thrombus growth. The method presented here was effective in quantitatively assessing time-dependent phenomena of thrombus formation at the connector-tube interface. The method may contribute to the assessment of thrombogenicity of a novel design of connector...|$|R

50|$|Performing {{perfusion}} culture experiments {{it always}} has to be considered that gas bubbles are forming during slow transport of culture medium.

Due to unknown reasons gas bubbles accumulate especially at material transitions between <b>tubes,</b> <b>connectors</b> and perfusion containers. First these gas bubbles are so small that they cannot be observed with the human eye, but during ongoing transport of culture medium they increase in size and are able to form an embolus that massively impedes medium flow. Within a culture container gas bubbles are leading to a regional shortage of medium supply and are causing breaks in the fluid continuum so that massive fluid pressure changes result.

The method addresses the previously unmet manufacturing challenges of matching the microfluidic footprint area {{to that of the}} photonics, and of robust bonding of microfluidic layers to biofunctionalized surfaces. We demonstrate the fabrication, in a single step, of a microfluidic layer in the recently introduced OSTE polymer, and the subsequent unassisted dry bonding of the microfluidic layer to a grating coupled silicon photonic ring resonator sensor chip. The microfluidic layer features photopatterned through holes (vias) for optical fiber probing and fluid connections, as well as molded microchannels and <b>tube</b> <b>connectors,</b> and is manufactured and subsequently bonded to a silicon sensor chip in less than 10 minutes. Combining this new microfluidic packaging method with photonic waveguide surface gratings for light coupling allows matching the size scale of microfluidics to that of current silicon photonic biosensors.

This problem arises in drug design where a particular structure is necessary to ensure proper protein-protein interactions. Our goal here is to solve the structure approximating IPF problem in 2 D and 3 D in HP models. As for the 2 D case, we consider a subclass of linear constructible structures designed by Gupta et. al 2004. These structures, called wave structures, are rich enough to approximate (although more coarsely) any given structure. We formally prove that protein sequence of any wave structure is stable under the HPC model. To prove the stability of wave structures we developed a computational tool, called 2 DHPSolver, which we used to perform the large case analysis required for the proofs. 2 DHPSolver {{can be used to}} prove the stability of any design in 2 D square lattice. For the 3 D case we introduce a robust class of protein structures, called tubular structures for 3 D hexagonal prism lattice. These structures are capable of approximating target 3 D shapes.

The median (range) duration of PEG feeding was 93 (3 - 785) days. The procedure was carried out for neurological indications in 76 % of cases (stroke 51 %) and 53 % of patients were severely malnourished (body mass index < 17 kg/m 2) at the time of referral. In 12 (16 %) patients swallowing recovered and the PEG was removed after a median (range) of 55 days (20 - 150).

40|$|Introduction and objectives: The AMS 800 TM is {{considered}} {{the gold standard for}} sphincter replacement. However, the one-ring design can erode the urethra and lead to severe complications. A mechanism that could alternatively compress successive segments of the urethra would limit such deleterious outcome. We report 12 weeks animal urethral tissue analysis following implantation of a new modular artificial sphincter. METHODS: The device is composed by three parts: the contractile unit, two rings and an integrated microprocessor. The contractile unit is made of Nitinol fibers. The rings are placed around the urethra to control the flow of urine by squeezing the urethra. They work in a sequential alternative mode and are controlled by a microprocessor connected to an external computer. The computer can reveal specific failure of device components. The device was impkanted in eight male sheep. The rings were positioned around the urethra and the control unit was placed 5 cm away. The device was working twenty hours per day; it was open 10 min. per hour to allow urination. The animals were sacrificed after 12 weeks. The urethra and the tissues surrounding the control unit were macroscopically and microscopically examined. Two transversal sections crossing the sphincter and two transversal sections crossing the urethra alone were obtained and stained with modified Paragon after resin embedding. Urethra was also embedded in paraffin. The first section was stained with safranin-hematoxylin-eosin, the second section was stained with Masson's Trichrome and the remaining eight sections were available for immunolabelling of the macrophages. Results: The chronic study went uneventful. No clinical infection or pain was observed. The computer registered no specific failure in ring function, Nitinol wires and <b>tube</b> <b>connectors.</b> At explantation, except for a slight grade of lymphocytes in two out of eight specimens, no urethral stricture or atrophy could be observed. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the absence of macrophages. Tissue structure and organization of the urethra with and without artificial sphincter were similar. No migration of the device was observed. Conclusions: The study clearly showed no tissue damage or inflammation of the urethra. Electronic design, preservation of urethral vascularisation and adjustability after implantation are the key ideas to improve the actual AUS.
