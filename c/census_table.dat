2500|$|The {{war years}} contributed to {{additional}} {{dramatic changes in}} city population. The presence of the Union Army attracted many fugitive slaves who escaped from surrounding rural plantations. So many sought protection behind Union lines that the Army set up contraband camps to accommodate them. The black population of Memphis increased from 3,000 in 1860, when the total population was 22,623, to nearly 20,000 in 1865, with most settling south of {{what was then the}} city limits. The white population was also increasing, but not to the same degree. After race riots against the blacks in 1866, thousands left the city. [...] The total population in 1870 was 40,220; the number of blacks had declined to 15,000 that year, or 37.4% of the total.(See <b>census</b> <b>table</b> in Demographics section.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The rapid {{demographic}} changes, {{added to}} the stress of war and occupation, and uncertainty about who was in charge, resulted in growing tensions between the Irish policemen and black Union soldiers following the war. In three days of rioting in early May 1866, the Memphis Riot erupted, in which white mobs made up of policemen, firemen, and other mostly ethnic Irish Americans, attacked and killed 46 blacks, wounding 75 and injuring 100 persons; raped several women, and destroyed nearly 100 houses while severely damaging churches and schools in South Memphis. Much of the black settlement was left in ruins. Two whites {{were killed in the}} riot. Many blacks permanently fled Memphis after the riot, especially as the Freedmen's Bureau continued to have difficulty in protecting them. Their population fell to about 15,000 by 1870, or 37.4% of the city, which then had a total population of 40,226.(See <b>census</b> <b>table</b> in Demographics section.) ...|$|E

50|$|As can be {{seen from}} the <b>census</b> <b>tables</b> below, the county lost {{population}} from 1910-1920, and from 1930-1970. Part of the outflow was related to the Great Migration, as millions of African Americans left the rural South and Jim Crow segregation for jobs and opportunities in the Midwest, North, and from World War II on, the West Coast. In addition, whites left rural areas for industrial jobs in the North as well, in cities such as Chicago and Detroit.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, due to {{industrial}} restructuring, the city lost many jobs and suffered difficult financial times, as did many upstate New York former manufacturing cities. The {{loss of employment}} caused Schenectady's population to decline by nearly one-third from 1950 into the late 20th century (see <b>Census</b> <b>table).</b> The early industries had left many sites contaminated with hazardous wastes. Such environmental brownfields have needed technical approaches for redevelopment.|$|E
50|$|Civil parishes {{are still}} used for some {{statistical}} purposes, and separate census figures are published for them.

(Refer to map:) The following individual parish population figures, giving a total population of 12,650 at the 2011 Census for the 13 Civil Parishes (1930 boundaries), were extracted from <b>Census</b> <b>Table</b> QS112SC using the interactive Standard Outputs system at the Scotland's Census website.|$|E
50|$|To seek better {{opportunities}} and escape {{the oppression of}} segregation, underfunded education, and disfranchisement, thousands of African Americans left Red River and other rural parishes in the Great Migration north and west. As {{may be seen in}} the <b>census</b> <b>table</b> below, most left from 1940-1970, when the parish had steep population decreases. Regional agricultural problems contributed to outmigration, especially after increasing mechanization in the 1930s reduced the need for laborers. At this time many African Americans from Louisiana went to California, where the defense industry associated with World War II was growing and workers were needed.|$|E
5000|$|To {{escape the}} oppression, many blacks left Statesboro and Bulloch County altogether, causing local {{businessmen}} {{to be worried}} about labor shortages for the cotton and turpentine industries.

40|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 18 th century, the first {{integral}} pop- ulation enumeration was held in the Netherlands during the Batavian Republic. It took over 30 years before the first official census was, by royal decree, organized and conducted in 1829, and was meant to be held from then onwards every ten years. The Dutch historical censuses are the only large scale, reliable statistical datasets available about the (demo- graphic, social and economic) history of the Netherlands, covering an all-encompassing geographical area for over two centuries (1795 – 1971). Not surprisingly, the currently preserved and digitized historical censuses are the most consulted historical statistics by researchers. However, the 2 288 <b>census</b> <b>tables</b> are highly disconnected and scarcely integrated in their current form. Meaningful information is still hidden in these miss- ing table-links, meaning that this wealth of information is not reaped to its full potential. In this paper we describe the lessons learnt in CEDAR 5, a project of the Computational Humanities Programme 6, to provide so- lutions to these integration problems. Our system leverages semantic technologies and Linked Data practices, which allow us to convert the <b>census</b> <b>tables</b> into a graph of fine-grained Linked Census Data. Using the distributed architecture of the Web, we interlink this graph with other online historical socioeconomic and demographic Linked Datasets. We use the information provided by these external links to guide the harmonization process in our dataset. At the same time, we investigate which historical classifications are not online yet following Web stan- dards, and we use our <b>census</b> <b>tables</b> (on demographic structures, housing types, occupational classes and statuses, and religious denominations) to urge the need of publishing these historical classifications on the Web. Such historical hubs could increase enormously the interoperability of other datasets. Finally, we propose a querying pipeline on the resulting harmonized census dataset to enhance the data exploration work by his- torians and social scientists and help answering their research questions...|$|R
5000|$|Following passage by Alabama of the 1901 {{constitution}} that disenfranchised most African Americans {{and tens of}} thousands of poor whites, the state legislature passed laws to impose Jim Crow and racial segregation. Due to this oppression and problems of continued violence by lynchings, many African Americans left Alabama in two waves of the Great Migration in the first half of the 20th century. They went to Northern and Midwestern industrial cities. Their mass departure is reflected in the lower rates of county population growth from 1910 to 1930, and from 1950 to 1970.

50|$|From {{a peak of}} {{population}} in 1910, the county had declined through 1990. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, particularly from 1910 to 1930, and from 1940 to 1970, it was affected by the Great Migration of blacks out of the segregated society for jobs and opportunities in Midwest and later, West Coast cities. From 1910 to 1920, the population declined more than 17%, as may be seen from the <b>Census</b> <b>table</b> at right. Particularly in the early 20th century, Blacks left to escape the oppression and violence associated with Jim Crow, lynchings, and their disenfranchisement after 1890. From 1940 to 1960, the population declined by more than 29%. Rural whites also left in those years, but a much greater number of African Americans migrated to other areas. After 1930 they became a minority in the county, comprising nearly 43% in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|By 1960 (as {{shown on}} <b>census</b> <b>tables</b> below), the {{population}} {{had declined to}} about 15,000 residents and continued to be about four-fifths majority black.

50|$|Following the {{repression}} {{of the civil rights}} era and a continuing poor economy, younger African Americans continued to leave the county, seeking jobs in bigger cities. The population declined more than 11 percent from 1960 to 1970, and further declines occurred to 1980 (see <b>census</b> <b>tables</b> below.) Because of the murders of Lee and Allen, voter registration efforts had stopped in the early 1960s. African Americans did not register until after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided federal protection and oversight. Today the county is majority white in population.|$|R

However, while Odisha is predominantly Hindu it is not monolithic. The state also has a Christian and Muslim minority. There is a rich cultural heritage in the state owing to Hindu faith. For example, Odisha is home to several Hindu saints.
