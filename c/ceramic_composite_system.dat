50|$|In the United Kingdom {{another line}} of ceramic armour {{development}} had been started in the early 1960s, meant to improve the existing cast turret configuration of the Chieftain that already offered excellent heavy penetrator protection; the research by a team headed by Gilbert Harvey of the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (FVRDE), therefore was strongly oriented at optimising the <b>ceramic</b> <b>composite</b> <b>system</b> for defeating shaped charge attack. The British system consisted of a honeycomb matrix with ceramic tiles backed by ballistic nylon, placed {{on top of the}} cast main armour. In July 1973 an American delegation, in search of a new armour type for the XM815 tank prototype, now that the MBT-70 project had failed, visited Chobham Common to be informed about the British system, the development of which had then cost about ₤6,000,000; earlier information had already been divulged to the US in 1965 and 1968. It was very impressed by the excellent shaped-charge protection combined with the penetrator impact damage limitation, inherent to the principle of using tiles. The Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground that year initiated the development of a version, named Burlington, adapted to the specific American situation, characterised by a much higher projected tank production run and the use of a thinner rolled steel main armour. The increased threat posed by a new generation of Soviet guided missiles armed with a shaped charge warhead—as demonstrated in the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, when even older-generation missiles caused considerable tank losses on the Israeli side—made Burlington the preferred choice for the armour configuration of the XM1 (the renamed XM815) prototype.|$|E

Ceramics are ideal materials for applications in extreme environments where stability under high temperatures, resistance to corrosion, and good mechanical strength are required. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>composites</b> offer novel solutions to circumvent issues and drawbacks seen in traditional single-phase materials {{by taking advantage of}} the unique properties offered by each constituent phase.

As an important example, in alumina-zirconia <b>ceramic</b> <b>composite</b> <b>system,</b> the incorporation of α-Al 2 O 3 into stabilized zirconia increases significantly the mechanical and thermal properties. In this work an alumina-zirconia ceramic composite have been prepared with different α-Al 2 O 3 contents from 10 to 95 wt % in order to investigate the enhancement in mechanical properties of this composite. The different composition were monitored by precise ultrasonic velocity measurements. In order {{to find out the}} factors affecting the variation in wave velocity, the ceramic composite have been characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the ultrasound velocity changed considerably with respect to the ceramic composite composition. Mainly, we studied the behavior of the physical material property hardness, an important parameter of the ceramic composite mechanical properties, with respect to the variation in the longitudinal and shear wave velocities. Shear wave velocities exhibited a stronger interaction with microstructural and substructural features as compared to that of longitudinal waves.

This is due to their beneficial mechanical properties i. e. high temperature strength, high hardness and ability to maintain its cutting edge shape at higher temperatures. Although a lot of works have focused on the effect of various sintering additives on the ZTA ceramic system, the effect of Magnesia (MgO) and Titania (TiO 2) on ZTA has not yet been studied. In this work, the physical properties of Zirconia Toughened Alumina (ZTA) ceramic composite with MgO and TiO 2 as additives were investigated. The composition of TiO 2 varied from 0 wt. % to 3. 5 wt. % whereby other materials such as Al 2 O 3, Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) and MgO were kept at constant weight percentage. Sintered samples were then tested and analyzed by XRD, Vickers hardness and high precision densimeter to investigate phase content, hardness value and densification respectively. Results showed that the solubility limit of TiO 2 in ZTA-MgO ceramic composites is at 2. 0 wt. %. Further addition of TiO 2 resulted in the formation of secondary phase known as Zirconium titanium oxide (Zr 0. 35 TiO 0. 65 O 2) which deteriorates the properties exhibited by ZTA-MgO-TiO 2 ceramic composites...|$|E
40|$|In certain applications, {{including}} {{high temperature}} or vacuum environments, liquid lubricants or greases are not stable. Solid lubricants are potentially suitable {{candidates for the}} reduction of friction and wear. Ceramic materials are a suitable candidate for harsh environments such as high temperatures and vacuum. Ceramic components are generally lubricated by thin solid films to achieve low friction and wear. The lifetime of such films is inevitably limited. By incorporating solid lubricant reservoirs into a hard ceramic matrix, friction and wear can be decreased during sliding by realizing a gradual replenishment of the soft solid lubricant to the surface. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the self-lubricating ability of the ceramic contact. In this thesis, a CuO doped zirconia composite has been chosen as a self-lubricating <b>ceramic</b> <b>composite</b> <b>system.</b> The tribological performance of the ceramic composite has been systematically investigated. To understand the self-lubricating ability of the composite, the friction behaviour has been studied at different temperature levels. First, dry sliding tests were conducted at room temperature using different loads and sliding velocities as well as countersurfaces. The wear mechanisms have been investigated using different characterization methods. At room temperature, 5 CuO-TZP only shows low friction and wear against an alumina countersurface. Similar dry sliding tests {{have been carried out}} at elevated temperatures. A coefficient of friction of 0. 35 and a specific wear rate less than 10 - 6 mm 3 /Nm were obtained at 600 °C for CuO-TZP sliding against an alumina countersurface. It has been found that a soft copper rich (third body) layer is formed at the interface between the sliding components. The formation of the soft layer as well as the wear mechanism has been explained. A physically-based model has been developed which includes the processes responsible for maintaining the soft third body layer at the interface. The model can predict the thickness of the third body layer under different tribological conditions in the mild wear regime. It can be concluded that the tribological performance of CuO-TZP under dry contact conditions strongly depends on the operational conditions...|$|E

40|$|NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is {{developing}} a variety of advanced SiC/SiC ceramic composite (ASC) systems that allow these materials to operate for hundreds of hours under stress in air at temperatures approaching 2700 F. These SiC/SiC composite systems are lightweight (approximately 30 % metal density) and, in comparison to monolithic ceramics and carbon fiber-reinforced ceramic composites, are able to reliably retain their structural properties for long times under aggressive gas-turbine engine environments. The key for the ASC systems is related first to the NASA development of the Sylramic-iBN Sic fiber, which displays higher thermal stability than any other SiC- based ceramic fibers and possesses an in-situ grown BN surface layer for higher environmental durability. This fiber is simply derived from Sylramic Sic fiber type that is currently produced at ATK COI Ceramics (COIC). Further capability is then derived by using chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) and/or polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) to form a Sic-based matrix with high creep and rupture resistance as well as high thermal conductivity. The objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to optimize the constituents and processing parameters for a Sylramic-iBN fiber reinforced <b>ceramic</b> <b>composite</b> <b>system</b> in which the Sic-based matrix is formed at COIC almost entirely by PIP (full PIP approach), (2) to evaluate the properties of this system in comparison to other 2700 F Sylramic-iBN systems in which the matrix is formed by full CVI and CVI + PIP, and (3) to examine {{the pros and cons of}} the full PIP approach for fabricating hot-section engine components. A key goal is the development of a composite system with low porosity, thereby providing high modulus, high matrix cracking strength, high interlaminar strength, and high thermal conductivity, a major property requirement for engine components that will experience high thermal gradients during service. Other key composite property goals are demonstration at high temperatures of high environmental resistance and high creep resistance, which in turn will result in long component life. Data are presented from a variety of laboratory tests on simple two-dimensional panels that examine these properties and compare the performance of the optimized full PIP system with those of the full CVI and CVI + PIP hybrid systems. Underlying mechanisms for performance differences in the various systems are discussed. Remaining issues for further property enhancement and for application of the full PIP approach for engine components are also discussed, as well as on-going approaches at NASA to solve these issues...|$|E
40|$|In {{comparison}} to current state-of-the-art metallic alloys, ceramic matrix composites (CMC) {{offer a variety}} of performance advantages, such as higher temperature capability (greater than the approx. 2100 F capability for best metallic alloys), lower density (approx. 30 - 50 % metal density), and lower thermal expansion. In {{comparison to}} other competing high-temperature materials, CMC are also capable of providing significantly better static and dynamic toughness than un-reinforced monolithic ceramics and significantly better environmental resistance than carbon-fiber reinforced composites. Because of these advantages, NASA, the Air Force, and other U. S. government agencies and industries are currently seeking to implement these advanced materials into hot-section components of gas turbine engines for both propulsion and power generation. For applications such as these, CMC are expected to result in many important performance benefits, such as reduced component cooling air requirements, simpler component design, reduced weight, improved fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, higher blade frequencies, reduced blade clearances, and higher thrust. Although much progress has been made recently in the development of CMC constituent materials and fabrication processes, major challenges still remain for implementation of these advanced composite materials into viable engine components. The objective of this presentation is to briefly review some of those challenges that are generally related to the need to develop physics-based computational approaches to allow CMC fabricators and designers to model (1) CMC processes for fiber architecture formation and matrix infiltration, (2) CMC properties of high technical interest such as multidirectional creep, thermal conductivity, matrix cracking stress, damage accumulation, and degradation effects in aggressive environments, and (3) CMC component life times when all of these effects are interacting in a complex stress and service environment. To put these computational issues in perspective, the various modeling needs within these three areas are briefly discussed in terms of their technical importance and their key controlling mechanistic factors as we know them today. Emphasis is placed primarily on the SiC/SiC <b>ceramic</b> <b>composite</b> <b>system</b> because of its higher temperature capability and enhanced development within the CMC industry. A brief summary is then presented concerning on-going property studies aimed at addressing these CMC modeling needs within NASA in terms of their computational approaches and recent important results.

40|$|A {{material}} {{having two}} or more distinct constituent materials or phases such that the integrated material has properties noticeably different from constituents is a composite material. For example in alumina-zirconia <b>ceramic</b> <b>composite</b> <b>system,</b> the incorporation of - Al 2 O 3 into stabilized zirconia changes the properties drastically. Ceramic materials traditionally have properties of high compressive strength, high wear resistance, high abrasion resistance {{and the ability to}} withstand high temperatures. But one major drawback with ceramic materials is their poor toughness. Zirconia, as a ceramic material, possess remarkable properties such as high melting point, inertness to chemicals, high hardness etc. It has an added advantage that when retained in the tetragonal form in the product during use it gets transformed to monoclinic zirconia and during this process of conversion it increases the toughness of the material- the process known as transformation toughening. This unique property of zirconia {{can also be used to}} improve the properties of other ceramic materials like alumina spinel, mullite etc. Transformation toughening is one of the best methods of improving the fracture toughness and strength of brittle ceramic materials. The stability of tetragonal zirconia phase (t-ZrO 2) is the main concern in these systems as it determines the stress required for the transformation and thus the resulting toughening achieved. Various combinations of constituent ceramic materials are taken such as Zirconia alumina, Zirconia spinel, Zirconia silicon carbide, Zirconia mullite etc. Objective of our work is to synthesize composite having 60 mol% Al 2 O 3 and 40 mol% ZrO 2 by sol-gel precipitation route. We are adopting this process because the distribution of the ZrO 2 particles must be uniform and the size should be slightly lower than the critical diameter at which spontaneous transformation takes place. Before starting this work, a thorough study has been made on the theory, mechanism and the research done by various authors. We have discussed the theory and mechanism of transformation toughening. If the crystal can be restrained from undergoing martensitic transformation during cooling from high temperature by the constraint imposed by the matrix, it can be considered in a metastable state. Should the elastic constraint be removed, as would be the case ahead of the tip in a propagating crack, then the crystal could transform, the shear strain developed would oppose the growth of the crack; it is this effect which is used to advantage in transformation toughening. In our project work we have prepared Alumina powder samples. For this we have adopted sol-gel precipitation route. In this process we have Zirconium oxy chloride and ammonium nitride salt for preparation of powder. From the salts clear solution is prepared. Then gel is formed by addition of ammonia solution which is 50 % dilute. This gel is dried in an oven drier. After drying the sample is ground to obtain powder. This dried powder is subjected to calcination at different temperatures starting from 300 °C to 1000 °C. Then the calcined powders are taken for phase analysis by XRD. We have observed presence of cubic phase in the temperature range of 600 °C to 800 °C. The disadvantage of cubic phase is that it makes the material prone to fracture. The strength of the sample increases but the toughness is very less. The cubic phase of zirconia is retained in the refractory material where very high strength is required. The tetragonal phase is observed in the temperature range of 800 C to 1000 °C. This tetragonal phase present in sample, while use transforms into monoclinic phase so the toughness of the material is increased. This process is known as “Transformation Toughening”. The monoclinic phase is generally unstable hence stabilizers a re required. It improves the toughness of the sample...|$|E

Monolithic ceramics exhibit a number of useful properties such as retention of strength at high temperatures, chemical inertness, and low density. However, the use of monolithic ceramics has been limited by their inherent brittleness and a large variation in strength. This behavior has motivated material scientists to reinforce the monolithic material with a ceramic fiber. The addition of a second ceramic phase with an optimized interface increases toughness and marginally increases strength.

The high stiffness, excellent thermal stability and chemical resistance of Al 2 O 3 make it practically a very important engineering material, and if we can overcome its brittleness issue, its applications will be much wider. Adding CNTs as a reinforcement to the Al 2 O 3 matrix to improve the toughness {{is one of the most}} promising methods. Similarly, GNPs have recently also been shown to be very promising for the same purpose. It has been demonstrated that by adding a mixture of the 2 D-GNPs and 1 D-CNTs into a polymer matrix, the toughest or strongest man-made ropes have been made. However, the homogenous dispersion of CNTs or GNPs is more of a challenge in a ceramic matrix than in polymeric matrices, owing to the tendency of CNT agglomerations and more steps are needed to completely transfer the useful properties of CNTs and GNPs into ceramics.

In the as-prepared condition the Nextel-Blackglas(TM) mini-tow composites had a mean tensile breaking load of 53 Newtons, a coefficient of variation of 26 %, and limited fiber pull-out. The Nextel(TM) composites were then heat-treated in air at 600 °, 800 °, and 1000 °C to determine oxidation stability. After 600 °C oxidation for 200 hours, the Blackglas(TM) Nextel(TM) composites retained 75 % of the as-prepared tensile break load with a fibrous fracture surface. Oxidation for 24 hours at 1000 °C and for 100 hours at 800 °C reduced the retained tensile breaking load by 47 % and 66 % respectively, showing reduced strain-to-failure and distinct embrittlement of the composite...|$|R

The properties of the raw materials used are described in the paper. The obtained ceramic bodies were burned at 1000 °C and 1050 °C temperatures, keeping at the highest burning temperature for 4  h. The analysis of physical-mechanical properties of composite ceramics (density, compressive strength, water absorption), its structural parameters (effective and total open porosity, reserve of pore volume, relative wall thickness of the pores and capillaries), and X-ray diffraction analysis was performed. The interdependencies between some structural parameters are described by empirical equations. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
