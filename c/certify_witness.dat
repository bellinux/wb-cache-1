Behringer had believed that since the units had passed stringent European CE standards, they would also comply with FCC verification requirements. According to Behringer, it had overlooked the differences in testing standards and procedures under FCC and European requirements and has since implemented a complete UL certified safety and EMC testing laboratory under the UL <b>certified</b> <b>witness</b> program, including an in-house audit and global regulatory review system.|$|R

40|$|Safeguarding online {{communications}} using {{public key}} cryptography is a well-established practice today, but with the increasing reliance on `faceless', solely online entities one of the core aspects of {{public key cryptography}} is becoming a substantial problem in practice: Who can we trust to introduce us to and vouch for some online party whose public key we see for the first time? Most existing certification models lack flexibility and have come under attack repeatedly in recent years, and finding practical improvements has a high priority. We propose that the real-world concept of a notary or <b>certifying</b> <b>witness</b> {{can be adapted to}} today's online environment quite easily, and that such a system when combined with peer-to-peer technologies for defense in depth is a viable alternative to monolithic trust infrastructures. Instead of trusting assurances from a single party, integrity certifications (and data replication) can be provided among a group of independent parties in a peer-to-peer fashion. As the likelihood of all such assurance providers being subverted at the very same time is very much less than that of a single party, overall robustness is improved. This paper presents the design and the implementation of our prototype online notary system where independent computer notaries provide integrity certification and highly-available replicated storage, and discusses how this online notary system handles some common threat patterns.

25|$|The Hebrew {{calendar}} is a lunisolar calendar, {{meaning that}} months {{are based on}} lunar months, but years are based on solar years. The calendar year features twelve lunar months of twenty-nine or thirty days, with an intercalary lunar month added periodically to synchronize the twelve lunar cycles with the longer solar year. (These extra months are added seven times every nineteen years. See Leap months, below.) The beginning of each Jewish lunar month {{is based on the}} appearance of the new moon. Although originally the new lunar crescent had to be observed and <b>certified</b> by <b>witnesses,</b> the moment of the true new moon is now approximated arithmetically as the molad, which is the mean new moon to a precision of one part.|$|R

50|$|Because Canada {{uses the}} {{accreditation}} {{model of a}} national accrediting authority, if an organisation tests a firestop in or for use in Canada, {{in accordance with the}} correct standard (ULC-S115), but is not accredited by the SCC, the test results cannot be used to in any approvals of field installations on Canadian construction sites. If, on the other hand, the test laboratory is also accredited for product certification, then before the test takes place, a follow-up or certification agreement is anticipated between the certifier and the submitter of the test who desires a rating or a listing. An inspector from the <b>certifying</b> organisation <b>witnesses</b> the manufacture of the product or products to be tested, and checks the manufacturing procedures against the process standard that is in place and by then on file with the certifying organisation. The process standard includes all information necessary to manufacture the product or products, including equipment descriptions, tolerances, chemical formulas and purchasing specifications for ingredients or components. The manufactured goods are sealed by the inspector and then shipped to the laboratory, where the contents are used to build the test specimen in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.|$|R

Certifying algorithms compute {{not only an}} output but also a <b>witness</b> <b>certifying</b> that the output is correct. A checker for a certify-ing algorithm is a simple program that decides whether the witness is correct for a particular input and output. Verification of checkers is feasible and leads to trustworthy computations. In previous work, we verified checkers from the al-gorithmic library LEDA using the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL as a backend to the automatic code verifier VCC. More recently, we showed that ver-ification {{can be carried out}} completely within Isabelle/HOL and compared this to the previous approach. We concluded that the more recent approach is more trustworthy with comparable efforts. Here we implement a shortest path checker algorithm for graphs with nonnegative edge weights in the imperative pseudo-code language Simpl. Moreover, we use the more recent framework and formally verify the checker using Isabelle/HOL. ...|$|R

6000|$|Under these circumstances, {{it may be}} {{imagined}} that {{the establishment of a}} scientific frontier between the earlier realm of supposed fact and the later of asserted delusion, had its difficulties; and torrents of theological special pleading about the subject flowed from clerical pens; until that learned and acute Anglican divine, Conyers Middleton, in his [...] "Free Inquiry," [...] tore the sophistical web they had laboriously woven to pieces, and demonstrated that the miracles of the patristic age, early and late, must stand or fall together, inasmuch as the evidence for the later is just as good as the evidence for the earlier wonders. If the one set are <b>certified</b> by contemporaneous <b>witnesses</b> of high repute, so are the other; and, in point of probability, there is not a pin to choose between the two. That is the solid and irrefragable result of Middleton's contribution to the subject. But the Free Inquirer's freedom had its limits; and he draws a sharp line of demarcation between the patristic and the New Testament miracles--on the professed ground that the accounts of the latter, being inspired, are {{out of the reach of}} criticism.|$|R
40|$|Let {mathcal B} be {{a linear}} space of {{matrices}} over a field {mathbb spanned by ntimes n matrices B_ 1, dots, B_m. The non-commutative rank of {mathcal B}$ is the minimum rin {mathbb N} such that there exists Uleq {mathbb F}^n satisfying dim(U) -dim({mathcal B} (U)) geq n-r, where {mathcal B}(U) :={mathrm span}(cup_{iin[m]} B_i(U)). Computing the non-commutative rank generalizes some well-known problems including the bipartite graph maximum matching {{problem and the}} linear matroid intersection problem. In this paper we give a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm to compute the non-commutative rank over any field {mathbb F}. Prior to our work, such an algorithm was only known over the rational number field {mathbb Q}, a result due to Garg et al, [GGOW]. Our algorithm is constructive and produces a <b>witness</b> <b>certifying</b> the non-commutative rank, a feature that is missing in the algorithm from [GGOW]. Our result is built on techniques which we developed in a previous paper [IQS 1], with a new reduction procedure that helps to keep the blow-up parameter small. There {{are two ways to}} realize this reduction. The first involves constructivizing a key result of Derksen and Makam [DM 2] which they developed in order to prove that the null cone of matrix semi-invariants is cut out by generators whose degree is polynomial {{in the size of the}} matrices involved. We also give a second, simpler method to achieve this. This gives another proof of the polynomial upper bound on the degree of the generators cutting out the null cone of matrix semi-invariants. Both the invariant-theoretic result and the algorithmic result rely crucially on the regularity lemma proved in [IQS 1]. In this paper we improve on the constructive version of the regularity lemma from [IQS 1] by removing a technical coprime condition that was assumed there...|$|R
