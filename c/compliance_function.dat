5000|$|Corporate {{headquarters}} {{is considered a}} business' most prestigious location. A corporation's headquarters may also bring prestige to the city it is located in and help attract other businesses to the area.

The corruption scandal, which began with a raid on the Siemens AG headquarters by over two hundred German police and investigators in November 2006 was concluded in December 2008 in a simultaneous settlement with the Munich public prosecutors office, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. On the same day, Siemens AG was confirmed as a “responsible contractor,” i.e. eligible to bid on government contracts, by the United States government. In the course of the investigations and settlement Siemens paid fines and incurred expenses exceeding $2.5 billion, but avoided much greater fines and debarment from governmental procurement programs around the world. For {{the first time in the}} history of the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United States Department of Justice recommended penalties lower than those prescribed by federal sentencing guidelines. Also for the first time, the Department recommended the appointment of a compliance monitor who was not an American lawyer.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on changes in the <b>compliance</b> <b>function</b> within major European banks and other {{financial}} intermediaries and on the effects of Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) implementation. Design/methodology/approach – The four areas of research seek to answer the following questions: Is the positioning of the <b>compliance</b> <b>function</b> “at the top” of the organizational structure? Are the roles attributed to the <b>compliance</b> <b>function,</b> their knowledge and their instruments consistent with their responsibilities? Do the methodologies applied follow a qualitative and/or a quantitative approach? Is the interaction between the <b>compliance</b> <b>function</b> inside and outside the structure appropriate to the goals of compliance? In total, 31 top international groups based in Europe were invited to take part in the research, 16 of them accepted. Findings – The authors observed a resolute adjustment to the regulations in terms of macrostructure and high levels of <b>compliance</b> <b>function</b> competences in investment services and business knowledge, with a low variation. The encouraging news coming out of the results of the research is the confirmation of the presence of a connection between the <b>compliance</b> <b>function</b> and both the system of values and of incentives. Originality/value – The paper's international sample offers a unique opportunity to highlight the critical areas of the <b>compliance</b> <b>function</b> within international groups, with growing operational complexity in a framework of principle‐based regulation...|$|E

Whereas there is no attempt to prescribe a uniform approach, a clear set of general principles is laid down for the role of the <b>compliance</b> <b>function</b> within banking organisations. Furthermore, recognition is given to the fact that diversity exists between banks with respect to their internal organisation of the <b>compliance</b> <b>function</b> and also to diversity in the legal and regulatory environment affecting the <b>compliance</b> <b>function</b> across jurisdictions.
