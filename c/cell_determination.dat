50|$|The {{determination}} {{of a cell}} to a particular fate {{can be broken down}} into two states where the cell can be specified (committed) or determined. In the state of being committed or specified, the cell type is not yet determined and any bias the cell has toward a certain fate can be reversed or transformed to another fate. If a cell is in a determined state, the cell's fate cannot be reversed or transformed. In general, this means that a cell determined to differentiate into a brain cell cannot be transformed into a skin <b>cell.</b> <b>Determination</b> is followed by differentiation, the actual changes in biochemistry, structure, and function that result in specific cell types.

5000|$|Cell fate {{specification}} or {{cell differentiation}} {{is a process}} where undifferentiated cells can become a more specialized cell type. Wnt signaling induces differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into mesoderm and endoderm progenitor cells. These progenitor cells further differentiate into cell types such as endothelial, cardiac and vascular smooth muscle lineages. Wnt signaling induces blood formation from stem cells. Specifically, Wnt3 leads to mesoderm committed cells with hematopoietic potential. Wnt1 antagonizes neural differentiation and {{is a major factor}} in self-renewal of neural stem cells. This allows for regeneration of nervous system cells, which is further evidence of a role in promoting neural stem cell proliferation.

40|$|Abstract. â€“ Background: Explanations for {{asymmetric}} {{patterns of}} diversification continue to challenge paleontologists and neontologists with competing hypotheses within genetic-development and ecological frameworks. In 1988, a hypothesis was proposed that tied a {{primordial germ cell}} (PGC) determination mechanism to clade (phyla) diversification. Two general mechanisms for PGC determination are recognized: one is termed induced because induction signals are required {{for the production of}} primordial germ cells. The other mechanism is cell-autonomous, i. e. determinative, because the cells that develop in response to specific cytoplasmic determinants in the oocyte are pre-destined to become PGCs. We revisited the hypothesis and analyzed phyla diversity with germ <b>cell</b> <b>determination</b> mechanisms and examined sister clade asymmetry. Results: After 25 years of additional data accumulation, the hypothesis that high levels of species diversification are associated with the induced mode is falsified, with the determinative mode revealed as associated with higher rates of diversification. The greater species numbers are significantly associated (ANOVA p> 0. 003) with the determinative mode. Analysis with appropriate sister clades is unanimous in showing the clade with the determinative mode has a significantly greater number of species relative to its induced sister clade. Conclusions: The primordial germ <b>cell</b> <b>determination</b> mechanism hypothesis explains asymmetrical species diversity and morphological disparity at the phylum level. We argue that the determinative mode of primordial germ <b>cell</b> <b>determination</b> is a constraint release that has enhanced evolvability and increased rates of speciation and morphological disparity among clades. Knowledge of the mechanism for extant theropods allows speculation that its sister clade, the Sauropodomorpha would have exhibited the induced mode.

How the diversity of cell types arise in appropriate places is one of the most fascinating and attractive research areas of plant biology. During the past several decades, due to the development of new molecular techniques and tools, advances in optical microscopy, and availability of whole genome information and mutants in the model plant Arabidopsis and other plants, great advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms involved in <b>cell</b> fate <b>determination</b> in plants. Multiple mechanisms are used to generate cellular diversity. Asymmetric cell division is one of the primary mechanisms. As an example, asymmetric cell division enables one stem cell to generate a stem cell daughter and a daughter with a distinct identity. Initially equivalent cells can also differentiate to generate different cell types. This mechanism has been clearly demonstrated in the formation of multiple cell types during epidermis development in the shoot and root. <b>Cell</b> fate <b>determination</b> is influenced by both intrinsic factors, i. e, developmental regulators, as well as extrinsic signals, i. e., environmental stimuli. By using model systems like stomata, trichome, root hair and shoot and root apical meristem cells, ligands, receptors and transcription factors have been found to regulate <b>cell</b> fate <b>determination.</b> However, the details of signaling cassettes responsible for <b>cell</b> fate <b>determination</b> remain largely unknown.

We have generated mutations at the gil locus by imprecise excision of the enhancer trap P-element. In the absence of gil, additional photoreceptors develop {{at the expense of}} pigment cells, suggesting an involvement of gil in <b>cell</b> <b>determination</b> during eye development. In addition, gil mutants show drastic effects on photoreceptor axon guidance and optic lobe development. In wildtype flies, photoreceptor axons grow from the eye disc through the optic stalk into the larval brain hemisphere, where retinal innervation is required for the normal development of the lamina and distal medulla. The projection pattern of these axons in the developing lamina and medulla is highly regular and reproducible. In gil, photoreceptor axons enter the larval brain but fail to establish proper connections in the lamina or medulla.

40|$|Posterior polar plasm of the Drosophila egg {{has been}} shown to {{function}} autonomously in germ <b>cell</b> <b>determination</b> after transplantation to either the anterior or mid-ventral region of the early embryo. By means of similar transplantations, we have tested the ability of polar plasm of Drosophila immigrans to induce the formation of pole cells in a Drosophila melanogaster embryo. After the transplantation of polar plasm, "hybrid" pole cells were found in which both pole cell-specific organelles, the polar granules and nuclear body, were structurally similar to those characteristic of the transplanted cytoplasm. In order to determine whether these hybrid cells can function as germ cell precursors, these cells were transplanted to the posterior tip of genetically marked embryos. Approximately 5 % of the flies obtained from embryos receiving potential pole cells produce offspring derived from the induced pole cells. This result demonstrates that polar plasm can function in interspecific species combinations and indicates that the molecular mechanisms of germ <b>cell</b> <b>determination</b> are conservative in evolution. Finally, in order to test whether there is any evidence for cytoplasmic inheritance of polar granules, embryos derived from hybrid pole cells were examined for their polar granule morphology.
