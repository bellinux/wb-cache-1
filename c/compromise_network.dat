Detailed techno-economic analysis of reserve provision from flexible demand is considered in this paper. A unit commitment/economic dispatch problem is set up that recognises demand side response (DSR) {{as a source of}} primary operating reserve (POR). Dispatch schedules are then verified with frequency stability assessments to quantify any changes in system performance. It has been demonstrated that while generally beneficial, utilization of DSR does not always improve system performance. Factors such as changes in plant dispatch (largest in-feed contingency can be greater) and flexible demand resource variability have been shown to limit the benefits of DSR under certain conditions. Actual activation of DSR for POR is also shown to <b>compromise</b> <b>network</b> integrity in some cases. All results are demonstrated using the Irish power system. ...|$|E

Filtering of unauthorized access attempts whilst maintaining low latency {{in order not to}} interfere and <b>compromise</b> <b>network</b> capacity and bandwidth has become a cause of major concern. Implementation of Intrusion Detection system thus comes into play.

In this paper, through a MU-MIMO testbed measurement, {{we found that}} the correlation between users ’ channels can severely <b>compromise</b> <b>network</b> throughput under a DoF-maximizing strategy.

The key challenge in Kardia lies in ef-ficiently determining which set of users to serve without knowing the channel state from all of them. We propose a lightweight mech-anism that enables APs to collaboratively infer the correlation be-tween users through precoded probing packets.

40|$|Abstract — Network {{survivability}} {{is fundamental}} to information security. Adversaries could <b>compromise</b> <b>network</b> functionality by attacking the physical layer, the medium access control (MAC) layer, or the network layer. Even though security mechanisms for the network layer have been extensively discussed, MAC layer security has not been deeply explored. Leveraging security flaws in the IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol and the salient features of a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), even an average person with limited knowledge of wireless networks can launch MAC-layer denial of service (DOS) attacks. In this paper, we study two types of MAC layer DOS attacks {{that can be easily}} employed by an average person: attacks launched from a single adversary by injecting enormous data flows into the network, and attacks launched from two colluding adversaries by sending enormous data flows directly to each other. We propose new counter measures to defend against these two types of DOS attacks. Since this paper focuses on MAC layer DOS attacks that could be easily executed by an average person, and compromising legitimate nodes is not an easy task, we only consider DOS attacks launched directly from adversaries, instead of from compromised nodes.

40|$|Wireless {{communications}} {{are vulnerable}} {{to the presence of}} errors during the network operation. These errors may be originated from different sources such as external electromagnetic interferences, obstacles in communication path, or even glitches in the communication circuitry. Such origins may lead the medium access control (MAC) layer to deviate from its normal operation (without presence of errors), forcing the execution of additional actions to maintain the network operational. The execution of such actions may imply the occurrence of periods of "communication silence", where the network, although not being failed, is not performing communications. These periods of ``communication silence" are dubbed network inaccessibility, which may induce inaccurate fault detections and deadline misses. Additionally, the occurrence of network inaccessibility may <b>compromise</b> <b>network</b> properties such as predictability, dependability, and timeliness. Thus, this report presents an exhaustive study about network inaccessibility, using the 802. 15. 4 standard as a case study.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{agents in}} a multi-agent system, each {{equipped with a}} Bayesian network model (BN) of its environment. We want the agents to reach consensus on one <b>compromise</b> <b>network,</b> {{which may not be}} identical to a single one of the BNs initially held by the agents, but rather a combination of aspects from each BN. The task can be characterized as the need for agents to agree on a spe-cific state (a BN) of a variable with an enormous state space (all possible BNs). The grandness of the task is reduced by the fact that BNs are composed of local relationships, and it should therefore be possible to reach the compromise by grad-ually agreeing on parts of it. In the metaphor of the variable, the agents should be able to agree on successively smaller subsets of the enormous state space. However, these same local relationship can interact, and understanding the extent to which partial agreements affect the possible final compromise is a highly complex task. In this work we suggest using formal argumentation as the reasoning mechanism for agents solving this task, and suggest an open-ended agora approach that ensures agents high quality compromises in an anytime fashion...|$|E

40|$|Attack graphs provide compact {{representations}} of the attack paths an attacker can follow to <b>compromise</b> <b>network</b> resources from the analysis of network vulnerabilities and topology. These representations are {{a powerful tool for}} security risk assessment. Bayesian inference on attack graphs enables the estimation of the risk of compromise to the system's components given their vulnerabilities and interconnections, and accounts for multi-step attacks spreading through the system. Whilst static analysis considers the risk posture at rest, dynamic analysis also accounts for evidence of compromise, e. g. from SIEM software or forensic investigation. However, in this context, exact Bayesian inference techniques do not scale well. In this paper we show how Loopy Belief Propagation - an approximate inference technique - can be applied to attack graphs, and that it scales linearly in the number of nodes for both static and dynamic analysis, making such analyses viable for larger networks. We experiment with different topologies and network clustering on synthetic Bayesian attack graphs with thousands of nodes to show that the algorithm's accuracy is acceptable and that it converges to a stable solution. We compare sequential and parallel versions of Loopy Belief Propagation with exact inference techniques for both static and dynamic analysis, showing the advantages and gains of approximate inference techniques when scaling to larger attack graphs...|$|E
