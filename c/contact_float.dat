40|$|The {{nonvolatile}} memory {{market has been}} growing very fast during the last decade, especially for mobile communication systems. The Semiconductor Industry Association International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors states that the difficult challenge for nonvolatile semiconductor memories is to achieve reliable, low power, low voltage performance and high-speed write/erase. This {{can be achieved by}} aggressive scaling of the {{nonvolatile memory}} cells. Unfortunately, scaling down of conventional nonvolatile memory will further degrade the retention time due to the charge loss between the floating gate and drain/source contacts and substrate which makes conventional nonvolatile memory unattractive. Using nanocrystals as charge storage sites reduces dramatically the charge leakage through oxide defects and drain/source <b>contacts.</b> <b>Floating</b> gate nanocrystal nonvolatile memory, FG-NCNVM, is a candidate for future memory because it is advantageous in terms of high-speed write/erase, small size, good scalability, low-voltage, low-power applications, and the capability to store multiple bits per cell. ^ Many studies regarding FG-NCNVMs have been published. Most of them have dealt with fabrication improvements of the devices and device characterizations. Due to the promising FG-NCNVM applications in integrated circuits, {{there is a need for}} circuit a simulation model to simulate the electrical characteristics of the floating gate devices. In this thesis, a FG-NCNVM circuit simulation model has been proposed. It is based on the SPICE BSIM simulation model. This model simulates the cell behavior during normal operation. Model validation results have been presented. The SPICE model shows good agreement with experimental results. Current-voltage characteristics, transconductance and unity gain frequency (fT) have been studied showing the effect of the threshold voltage shift (ΔVth) due to nanocrystal charge on the device characteristics. The threshold voltage shift due to nanocrystal charge has a strong effect on the memory characteristics. Also, the programming operation of the memory cell has been investigated. The tunneling rate from quantum well channel to quantum dot (nanocrystal) gate is calculated. The calculations include various memory parameters, wavefunctions, and energies of quantum well channel and quantum dot gate. The use of floating gate nanocrystal memory as a transistor with a programmable threshold voltage has been demonstrated. The incorporation of FG-NCFETs to design programmable integrated circuit building blocks has been discussed. This includes the design of programmable current and voltage reference circuits. Finally, we demonstrated the design of tunable gain op-amp incorporating FG-NCFETs. Programmable integrated circuit building blocks can be used in intelligent analog and digital systems. ...|$|R

Fine methylated quartz particles within {{the size range}} from 0. 2 to 50 μm, and with varying <b>contact</b> angles, were <b>floated</b> in a mechanical flotation cell. Results indicate that particles of a given size need to possess a minimum critical contact angle, which increases in value as particle size decreases, for flotation to be initiated. As a consequence, a non-floating component exists within a given size fraction. This is interpreted as a fraction consisting of particles below the critical contact angle for flotation for that size. The critical contact angle for flotation is {{explained in terms of}} the existence of an energy barrier for bubble–particle attachment. The flotation results are interpreted by means of (Scheludko et al., 1976) and (Drelich and Miller, 1992) models for the floatability of fine particles. The experimental data compared very well with calculations using the Drelich and Miller equation, allowing extension to the prediction of the critical contact angle for flotation down to particle sizes well below the previous limits investigated, bridging the gap existing in the literature. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade we have seen an {{increase}} in marine operations in Arctic waters. Despite research and work on several offshore standards and ship rules, the ice loads on fixed and floating structures are not fully understood. We are {{still a long way}} from being able to formulate standards and rules strictly from theory. If physical ice management is involved, where icebreakers reduce floe sizes and break ridges upstream of the floating structure, we are thus given a possibility to define/design our structure’s working ice environment. Different from level ice and ice ridges, the design codes do not provide standard procedures for calculating actions on offshore structures from broken ice fields. Engineers still have to utilize available full-scale data, to use empirical formulae and to perform physical and numerical modelling in order to give answers to practical problems. Within this context, there is a strong interest to develop ‘predictive’ tools that will allow new structures to be optimized so as to minimize ice loadings and to evaluate operational performance prior to final design verification in an ice test basin. This paper presents several semi-analytical solutions that are useful to model interaction between floe ice and structures. Our ambition is to support the development of multi-body numerical simulators that incorporate rigid-body dynamics, hydrodynamics and ice mechanics in a three-dimensional space. Furthermore, as an extension to a previously developed map of competing failure modes of ice floes, we delineate a new map that includes ice crushing depth distribution for the dominant ice failure modes. This new map is based on observations of ice failure in <b>contact</b> with <b>floating</b> ship-shaped structures in level ice and in low ice concentrations.

40|$|Particle {{hydrophobicity}} {{has been}} derived from Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements {{and its impact}} on the flotation behaviour of chalcopyrite investigated. Batch flotation tests were performed using a dithiophosphate-type of collector in different concentrations. Three flotation regimes were studied using particle size ranges of 20 – 38 μm, 75 – 105 μm and 150 – 210 μm. The individual particle contact angle, and hence, the distribution of contact angles of chalcopyrite within feed, concentrate and tail flotation samples has been determined using ToF-SIMS secondary ions. The effects of particle size and hydrophobicity on the flotation behaviour have been investigated using this new approach. The hydrodynamic effects of the particle size were highlighted by the different distributions of contact angles obtained for each concentrate size fraction, with fine and coarse sizes requiring higher average <b>contact</b> angles to <b>float.</b> This effect was overtaken by hydrophobicity when a high collector concentration was used. The broad distribution of contact angles observed in all samples, i. e. heterogeneity in hydrophobicity, has significant consequences for interpreting flotation behaviour. The methodology of analysis conducted in this study was applied to real ore and can be used as a quantitative, diagnostic tool for examining surface chemical factors affecting hydrophobicity. This new technique has promise and may advance the understanding of mechanisms, which may lead to better control strategies for improving flotation performance. Furthermore, any mineral–collector system can be targeted, provided appropriate calibration is performed. ...|$|R

In this study, a variety of planar thin film electrode configurations were tested to characterize breakdown response. All devices were fabricated using standard surface micromachining methods and materials, therefore our test results provide guidelines directly applicable to thin film structures used in MEMS devices. We observed that planar polysilicon structures exhibit breakdown responses similar to published results for larger metal electrode configurations 3 - 6. Our tests were performed in air at atmospheric pressure, with air gaps ranging from 0. 5 μm to 10 μm. Our results show a sharp rise in breakdown level following increases in gap width up to about 3 μm, a plateau region between 3 μm and 7 μm and breakdown in gaps over 7 μm following the Paschen curve. This profile indicates an avalanche breakdown process in large gaps, with a transition region to small gaps in which electrode vaporization due to field emission current is the dominant breakdown process. This study also provides information on using multiple-gap configurations, with electrically floating regions located near the energized electrodes, and the added benefit this method may provide for switching high voltage with MEMS devices.

40|$|Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) MOSFETs with {{a single}} {{crystalline}} buried body contact has been uniquely fabricated using epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) from selective epitaxial growth (SEG). Unlike other SOI body contacts, this technique incorporates the buried body contact during SOI active area formation using ELO. The resultant cross section is an SOI active area physically connected to a buried body using the same single crystalline silicon. The physical uniqueness of this buried body contact maintains device symmetry and allows topside body contact isolated away from the device source/drain edge. Because the body contact is buried and isolated, additional advantages are reduced contact-area penalty compared to historical SOI body contacts and flexible integration with multilevel interconnects using polysilicon. ^ Electrically, an effective SOI body <b>contact</b> eliminates various <b>floating</b> body effects inherent in partially depleted SOI MOSFETs. In this thesis, electrical characterization of an ELO-SEG buried body contacted SOI MOSFET demonstrates SOI body potential variation by removing the kink effect in its IDSV DS curve with grounded body bias and by shifting its threshold voltage. Here, the ability to change the threshold voltage is particularly important in low power applications where VDD∼ 1. 0 V or less because on/off switching of the MOSFET is faster from dynamically lower threshold voltage for larger saturated current in on-state. This fabricated SOI buried body contact further demonstrates body-current collection in IBuried_Contact -VGS curve at large a VDS, due to impact ionization. General partially depleted SOI MOSFET characteristics have measured subthreshold swing of 117 mV/dec which is comparable to MEDICI simulated value of 113. 8 mV/dec. Averaged over 10 devices, the subthreshold slope measured at 137 mV/dec, and subthreshold leakage measured at less than 2 pA. To further characterize the SOI buried body length, p + n diode (source/drain to body) characteristic is determined to have a diode ideality factor of 1. 7, due possibly to additional R-G processes in the buried contact SOI interfaces, and a resistance of 3. 3 kΩ for thin, narrow, and long single crystalline buried body contact. TSUPREM 4 and MEDICI simulations are further discussed in relation to experimental results of the ELO-SEG buried body contact and then followed by conclusion and recommendation. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} normal axisymmetric contact of dissimilar elastic solids at finite interfacial friction. It {{is shown}} {{that in the}} case of smooth and convex but otherwise arbitrary contact profiles and monotonically increasing loading a single stick-slip contour evolves being independent of loading and profile geometry. This allows developing an incremental procedure based on a reduced problem corresponding to frictional rigid flat punch indentation of an elastic half-space. The reduced problem, being independent of loading and contact region, was solved by a finite element method based on a stationary contact contour and characterized by high accuracy. Subsequently, a tailored cumulative superposition procedure was developed to resolve the original problem to determine global and local field values for two practically important geometries: flat and conical profiles with rounded edges and apices. Results are given for relations between force, depth and contact contours together with surface stress distributions and maximum von Mises effective stress, in particular to predict initiation of fracture and plastic flow. It is also observed that the presence of friction radically reduces the magnitude of the maximum surface tensile stress, thus retarding brittle fracture initiation. Hertzian fracture through indentation of flat float glass specimens by steel balls has been examined experimentally for a full load cycle. It has been observed that if the specimen survived during loading to a maximum level it frequently failed at decreasing load. It has been proposed by Johnson et al. (1973) that the underlying physical cause of Hertzian fracture initiation during load removal is that at unloading frictional tractions reverse their sign over part of the contact region. Guided by these considerations a robust computational procedure has been developed to determine global and local field values in particular at unloading at finite friction. In contrast to the situation at monotonically increasing loading, at unloading invariance properties are lost and stick-slip regions proved to be severely history dependent and in particular with an opposed frictional shear stress at the contact boundary region. This causes an increase of the maximum tensile stress at the contour under progressive unloading. It is shown that the experimental observations concerning Hertzian fracture initiation at unloading are at least in qualitative correlation with the effect friction has on the maximum surface tensile stress. A contact cycle between two dissimilar elastic bodies at finite Coulomb friction has been further investigated analytically and numerically for a wider range of material parameters and contact geometries. With the issue of Hertzian fracture initiation in mind, results concerning the influence of the friction coefficient and compliance parameters on the absolute maximum surface tensile stress during a frictional contact cycle are reported along with the magnitudes of the relative increase of maximum tensile stresses at unloading. Based on a critical stress fracture criterion it is discussed how the predicted increases will influence the critical loads required for crack initiation. Fracture loads are measured with steel and tungsten carbide spherical indenters in <b>contact</b> with <b>float</b> glass specimens at monotonically increasing loading and during a load cycle. Computational predictions concerning the fracture loads are given based on Hertz and frictional contact theories combined with a critical stress fracture criterion. The computational results obtained for frictional contact are shown to be in better agreement with experimental findings as compared to the predictions based on the Hertz theory. The remaining quantitative discrepancy was attributed to the well-known fact that a Hertzian macro-crack initiates from pre-existing defects on the specimen’s surface. In order to account for the influence of the random distribution of these defects on the fracture loads at monotonic loading, Weibull statistics was introduced. The predicted critical loads corresponding to 50 % failure probability were found to be in close agreement with experimentally observed ones. QC 20100729 </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} test of an integrated ion camera chip for monitoring highly localised ion fluxes of electrochemical processes using an ion sensitive sensor array. Ionic concentration fluctuations are shown to travel across the sensor array {{as a result of}} citric acid injection and the BZ-reaction. The imaging capability of non-equilibrium chemical activities is also demonstrated monitoring self-assembling micrometre sized polyoxometalate tubular and membranous architectures. The sufficient spatial resolution for the visualisation of the 10 - 60 µm wide growing trajectories is provided by the dense sensor array containing 64 × 64 pixels. In the case of citric acid injection and the BZ-reaction the ion camera chip is shown to be able to resolve pH differences with resolution as low as the area of one pixel. As a result of the transient and volatile ionic fluxes high time resolution is required, thus the signal capturing can be performed in real. time at the maximum sampling rate of 40 µs per pixel, 10. 2 ms per array. The extracted sensor data are reconstructed into ionic images and thus the ionic activities can be displayed as individual figures as well as continuous video recordings. This chip is the first prototype in the envisioned establishment of a fully automated CMOS based ion camera system which would be able to image the invisible activity of ions using a single microchip. In addition the capability of detecting ultra-low level pH oscillations in the extracellular space is demonstrated using cells of the slime mould organism. The detected pH oscillations with extent of ~ 0. 022 pH furthermore raise the potential for observing fluctuations of ion currents in cell based tissue environments. The intrinsic noise of the sensor devices are measured to observe noise effect on the detected low level signals. It is experimentally shown that the used ion sensitive circuits, similarly to CMOS, also demonstrate 1 /f noise. In addition the reference bias and pH sensitivity of the measured noise is confirmed. Corresponding to the measurement results the noise contribution is approximated with a 28. 2 µV peak-to-peak level and related to the 450 µV �+/- 70 µV peak-to-peak oscillations amplitudes of the slime mould. Thus a maximum intrinsic noise contribution of 6. 2 �+/- 1. 2 % is calculated. A H+ flickering hypothesis is also presented that correlates the pH fluctuations {{on the surface of the}} device with the intrinsic 1 /f noise. The ion camera chip was fabricated in an unmodified 4 -metal 0. 35 µm CMOS process and the ionic imaging technology was based on a 64 �× 64 -pixel ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) array. The high-speed and synchronous operation of the 4096 ISFET sensors occupying 715. 8 × 715. 8 µm space provided a spatial resolution as low as one pixel. Each pixel contained 4 transistors with 10. 2 × 10. 2 µm layout dimensions and the pixels were separated by a 1 µm separation gap.
