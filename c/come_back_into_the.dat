5|$|Lewis Hamilton was fastest in Q2, two-tenths of {{a second}} ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. In his last qualifying session with Lotus, Romain Grosjean experienced technical difficulties that forced him to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pits. Even though he was sent out again, {{he was unable to}} set a time, stopping his car at turn seven. His teammate Pastor Maldonado also did not proceed into Q3, as did Jenson Button who missed out by two-tenths {{of a second}}. The two other drivers eliminated were Felipe Nasr for Sauber and Max Verstappen, who was unable to match the time of his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr.|$|E
5|$|Ian Richardson {{was booked}} {{within a minute}} {{of the second half}} {{starting}} for bringing down Kiwomya. Notts County started to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game; Martindale headed wide, Agana and Richardson both had shots blocked during a goalmouth scramble and Tony Battersby had a shot saved over the crossbar by Jonathan Gould, as County tried to equalise during a 20-minute spell of pressure. Between County's chances, Stallard had the opportunity to double City's lead when he capitalised on a slip from Strodder, but Ward saved his effort. However, City went on to double their advantage on 75 minutes. Ormondroyd, who had replaced the injured Hamilton, flicked on a long pass from Richard Huxford with his first touch. His header went across goal to Stallard who volleyed home. Two minutes after the goal, Martindale fired wide for County after a pass from Agana, and with time running out Finnan's long-range shot was deflected for a corner, but from the resulting set-piece, Richardson shot over the crossbar.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the Great Doxology, {{while the}} Trisagion is sung, the epitaphios is taken in {{procession}} around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning. In some churches, the epitaphios is never left alone, but is accompanied 24 hours a day by a reader chanting from the Psalter.|$|E
25|$|After World War II Essex fell off, {{taking their}} first wooden spoon in 1950. During this period {{it was left}} to Trevor Bailey to do all the pace bowling, and he was often {{unavailable}} due to Test calls, whilst spinner Peter Smith was frequently overbowled until he retired in 1951 – thus a strong batting line-up led by Bailey and Doug Insole could seldom win games. Not until 1957 did Essex <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top half of the table, but Bailey and Barry Knight never had support of sufficient class to permit them to reach the top of the table, even when Robin Hobbs became England's last successful leg-spinner late in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the party}} {{attendees}} expressed displeasure that the strippers had delivered a very short performance despite being paid several hundred dollars apiece to perform. The team captain who had hired the strippers tried to convince the women to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house and complete the performance. Both women {{came back into the}} house, but upon being approached by the player who had earlier held up the broomstick, again refused to perform and locked themselves in the bathroom. By this point, a number {{of the party}} guests had left, and the residents of the house, including David Evans, were asking the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When the strippers left the bathroom and the house for the second time, a resident locked the door so they (and the guests who had left the house) could not get back in.|$|E

25|$|Butler {{had made}} it back to the National Championship {{for the second year in}} a row after losing their best player and {{eventual}} NBA star Gordon Hayward of the Utah Jazz. They were able to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> post season trying to play the cinderella team that they were the previous year. They were seeded as the #8 spot when in fact they had played and won in some very important games that impressed the college basketball sports world. The Butler basketball team was able to pull off upset after upset, game winning shot after game winning shot. Matt Howard made the game winning free throw against The University Pittsburgh after they were losing by one and Matt was fouled 86 feet away from the basket. That wouldn’t be the final of their close calls for this tournament, nor was it their first. Their first game they won by two points, then the close call with Pittsburgh, followed up by an exciting game which led to overtime against Florida in which Butler was able to come out victorious with the win.|$|E
500|$|Unlike other historicists, Weber also {{accepted}} the marginal theory of value (also called [...] "marginalism") and taught {{it to his}} students. In 1908, Weber published an article in which he drew a sharp methodological distinction between psychology and economics and attacked the claims that the marginal theory of value in economics reflected {{the form of the}} psychological response to stimuli as described by the Weber-Fechner law. Max Weber's article has been cited as a definitive refutation of the dependence of the economic theory of value on the laws of psychophysics by Lionel Robbins, George Stigler, and Friedrich Hayek, though the broader issue of the relation between economics and psychology has <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> academic debate with the development of [...] "behavioral economics".|$|E
500|$|Nico Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the third}} {{practice}} session on Saturday morning, setting a time of 1:23.078 on his first timed run, a time that stood {{until the end of}} the session. Hamilton was second, 0.126 seconds off, followed by Sebastian Vettel just two-hundredths of a second behind him. In fourth place, Max Verstappen was faster than teammate Ricciardo for the first time, who finished fifth, ahead of Räikkönen. Upon beginning his preparation laps for qualifying, Rosberg had to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garage, as a sensor on his car was malfunctioning. The team was capable of repairing the damage and he went back out for the final minutes of practice. Sergio Pérez was satisfied with the eighth fastest time, saying that the car had improved [...] "everywhere" [...] following the updates it had received.|$|E

2500|$|Former President Nicolas Sarkozy criticised [...] "negative laicite" [...] {{and talked}} about a [...] "positive laïcité" [...] that recognizes the {{contribution}} of faith to French culture, history and society, allows for faith in the public discourse and for government subsidies for faith-based groups. He visited the Pope in December 2007 and publicly emphasized France's Christian roots, while highlighting the importance of freedom of thought, advocating that faith should <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> public sphere. François Hollande took a very different position during the 2012 presidential election, promising to insert the concept of laïcité into the constitution.

2500|$|In the 31st {{minute of}} the game between France and Korea Republic, the French midfielder Patrick Vieira had a header at goal which {{appeared}} to be saved by Korean goalkeeper Lee Woon-Jae from behind the goal line. Mexican referee Benito Archundia and his linesmen {{did not believe the}} ball had passed the line, and no goal was awarded. The game resulted in a last minute 1–1 draw, shocking the French. French coach Raymond Domenech believed that France [...] "scored a second time, but the referee did not recognize that." [...] Television replays showed that the goal should have been awarded. French player Thierry Henry claimed the team was [...] "really upset" [...] when they saw the ball had passed the goal-line as [...] "if he (the referee) had given us the valid goal, that would not have offered the Koreans the opportunity to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match." [...] However, {{it should also be noted}} that the corner kick leading to the header should have been a goal kick, as the ball had gone out of bounds off a French player. [...] In addition, there appeared to be a whistle on the play for a foul on France, which would have negated the goal anyway.|$|E
