40|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that the particulate resin <b>colestyramine,</b> a bile acid sequestrant formerly used as a cholesterol-lowering agent, enhances secretion of the gut hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). Established physiological actions of CCK include inhibition of gastric emptying and induction of satiation. This study evaluated the hypothesis that <b>colestyramine,</b> which is luminally retained, would slow gastric emptying of liquids and suppress appetite in humans. Nine healthy volunteers consumed 500 mL liquid test meals containing 4 g <b>colestyramine,</b> 12 g <b>colestyramine,</b> or control (water alone), on three occasions, in a randomized order. The effect of <b>colestyramine</b> on gastric emptying was determined non-invasively using the (13) C-acetate breath test, and appetite and other gut-centered sensations were rated using visual analog scale questionnaires. <b>Colestyramine</b> dose dependently slowed liquid gastric emptying compared with control (water) (4  g vs control, ∼ 20 % reduction, P <  0. 05; 12  g vs control, ∼ 35 % reduction, P <  0. 01). <b>Colestyramine</b> also significantly reduced hunger (4  g vs control, ∼ 20 % reduction, P <  0. 01), and the amount of food participants felt able to eat (12 g vs control, ∼ 32 % reduction, P <  0. 001), but increased bloating (both doses, P <  0. 05), with no effect on ratings of nausea. This study provides the first evidence that <b>colestyramine</b> significantly slows liquid gastric emptying and reduces appetite in healthy humans. <b>Colestyramine</b> therefore presents an attractive gut-brain signaling research tool in that it is not absorbed and thus lacks potentially confounding postabsorptive effects.

40|$|Background: Bile acid {{malabsorption}} (BAM) is a common, yet under-recognised, {{cause of}} chronic diarrhoea, with limited guidance {{available on the}} appropriate management of patients with BAM. Aim: To summarise the evidence supporting different treatments available for patients with bile acid malabsorption, noting their impact on clinical outcomes, tolerability and associated side effects. Methods: A literature search was conducted through PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Scopus. Relevant articles studied patients who {{had been diagnosed with}} BAM and were clinically assessed before and after therapy.

40|$|Background: Primary {{bile acid}} {{diarrhoea}} (BAD) {{is associated with}} increased bile acid synthesis and low fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF 19). Bile acid sequestrants are used as therapy, but are poorly tolerated and may exacerbate FGF 19 deficiency. Aim: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the pharmacological effects of conventional sequestrants and a colonic-release formulation preparation of <b>colestyramine</b> (A 3384) on bile acid metabolism and bowel function in patients with BAD. Methods: Patients with seven-day 75 selenium-homocholic acid taurine (SeHCAT) scan retention < 10 % were randomised in a double-blind protocol to two weeks treatment with twice-daily A 3384 250 [*]mg (n[*]=[*] 6), 1 [*]g (n[*]=[*] 7) or placebo (n[*]=[*] 6). Thirteen patients were taking conventional sequestrants at the start of the study. Symptoms were recorded and serum FGF 19 and 7 α-hydroxy- 4 -cholesten- 3 -one (C 4) measured. Results: Median serum FGF 19 on conventional sequestrant treatment was 28 % lower than baseline values in BAD (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). C 4 on conventional sequestrant treatment was 58 % higher in BAD (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). No changes were seen on starting or withdrawing A 3384.

40|$|Bile acids promote bile {{formation}} and facilitate dietary lipid absorption. Animal and human studies showing disturbed bile acid metabolism in diabetes mellitus suggest {{a link between}} bile acids and glucose control. Bile acids are activating ligands of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor with an established role in bile acid and lipid metabolism. Evidence suggests a role for FXR also in maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Animal and human studies employing bile acid sequestrants (bile acid binding agents), which interrupt the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and effectively reduce plasma cholesterol, support a link between bile acid and glucose metabolism. In lipid-lowering trials, bile acid sequestrants, such as colesevelam hydrochloride, <b>colestyramine</b> (cholestyramine) and colestilan (colestimide), have {{also been shown to}} lower plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin levels, suggesting the utility of these agents as a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes.

40|$|Bowel {{symptoms}} including diarrhoea can {{be produced}} when excess bile acids (BA) {{are present in the}} colon. This condition, known as bile acid or bile salt malabsorption, has been under recognized, as the best diagnostic method, the 75 Se-homocholic acid taurine (SeHCAT) test, is not available in many countries and is not fully utilized in others. Reduced SeHCAT retention establishes that this is a complication of many other gastrointestinal diseases. Repeated studies show SeHCAT tests are abnormal in about 30 % of patients otherwise diagnosed as diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhoea, with an estimated population prevalence of around 1 %. Recent work suggests that the condition previously called idiopathic bile acid malabsorption (BAM) is not in fact due to a defect in absorption, but results from an overproduction of BA because of defective feedback inhibition of hepatic bile acid synthesis, a function of the ileal hormone fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF 19). The approach to treatment currently depends on binding excess BA, to reduce their secretory actions, using <b>colestyramine,</b> colestipol and, most recently, colesevelam.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ursodeoxycholic acid is {{increasingly}} {{being used for}} the treatment of chronic cholestatic liver diseases. It appears to be generally well tolerated, but a systematic review on drug safety is lacking. AIM: As experimental data suggest a role of bile acids in the regulation of hepatic drug metabolism at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, the literature was screened for adverse drug reactions and drug interactions related to ursodeoxycholic acid. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed using a refined search strategy to evaluate the adverse effects of ursodeoxycholic acid and its interactions with other drugs. RESULTS: Ursodeoxycholic acid caused diarrhoea in a small proportion of patients. Rare skin reactions were due to drug adjuvants rather than the active substance. Decompensation of liver cirrhosis was reported after the administration of ursodeoxycholic acid in single cases of end-stage primary biliary cirrhosis. Recurrent right upper quadrant abdominal pain was incidentally observed. The absorption of ursodeoxycholic acid was impaired by <b>colestyramine,</b> colestimide, colestipol, aluminium hydroxide and smectite. Metabolic drug interactions were reported for the cytochrome P 4503 A substrates, ciclosporin, nitrendipine and dapsone. CONCLUSIONS: Ursodeoxycholic acid is generally well tolerated. Drug absorption interactions with anion exchange resins deserve consideration. Metabolic interactions with compounds metabolized by cytochrome P 4503 A are to be expecte...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{pruritus}} is a burdensome {{feature of}} numerous hepatobiliary {{disorders such as}} primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, inherited forms of cholestasis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Bile salts, μ-opioids, serotonin, histamine and steroids have been controversially discussed in the pathogenesis of cholestatic pruritus. However, for these substances neither a correlation with itch severity nor a causative link has ever been established. Recent findings indicate that the potent neuronal activator lysophosphatidic acid and autotaxin, the enzyme forming lysophosphatidic acid, may play {{a key element in}} the pathogenesis of cholestatic pruritus. Serum activity of autotaxin correlated with itch intensity and response to antipruritic treatment in patients with cholestatic pruritus, but not other forms of pruritus. Autotaxin activity thereby represents the first biomarker for pruritus and had a positive predictive value of 70 % in differentiating cholestatic pruritus from other forms of pruritus. Treatment options for patients with cholestatic pruritus include the anion exchange resin <b>colestyramine,</b> the PXR agonist rifampicin, the μ-opioid antagonist naltrexone, and the serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline. These drugs are recommended by evidence-based guidelines as a stepwise therapeutic approach. Patients unresponsive to these drugs should be referred to specialized centers to receive experimental approaches such as UVB phototherapy, albumin dialysis, plasmapheresis or nasobiliary drainage.

40|$|Contents of bile {{acids and}} lipids, {{as well as}} rates of {{triglyceride}} synthesis, were determined in isolated hepatocytes from control or cholestyramine-fed rats (denoted below as "control" or "treated" hepatocytes, respectively). During a 3 -hr incubation period, total bile acid production was markedly higher in "treated" cells than in "conrol" cells. With both kinds of cells a marked fall in production rate occurred after the first hour of incubation. Newly produced bile acids appeared in the conjugated form with both kinds of hepatocytes. "Control" cells produced only taurine-conjugated, while "treated" cells made both taurine-conjugated and glycine-conjugated bile acids. However, with exogenous taurine (0. 5 mM), the latter cells also produced taurine-conjugated bile acids only. With both kinds of cells, cholic and β-muricholic acids, but not dihydroxylated bile acids, appeared as newly formed species during the incubation. Addition of dialyzed rat serum to the incubation {{did not result in}} a stimulation of bile acid production, with either kind of hepatocytes. "Treated" cells had a slightly higher content of free cholesterol than control cells; contents of other lipids were not different. Fractional release of bile acids and lipids into the medium did not differ between the two kinds of cells.

40|$|Pruritus is a preeminent symptom in {{patients}} with chronic cholestatic liver disorders such as primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. More than two-thirds of these patients experience itching {{during the course of}} their disease. This symptom is also frequently observed {{in patients}} with other causes of cholestasis such as cholangiocarcinoma, inherited forms of cholestasis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, but may accompany almost any other liver disease. The pathogenesis of pruritus of cholestasis remains largely elusive. Increased concentrations of bile salts, histamine, serotonin, progesterone metabolites and endogenous opioids have been controversially discussed as potential pruritogens. However, for these molecules, neither a correlation with itch intensity nor a causative link could be established. The G protein-coupled receptor for bile salts, TGR 5, {{has been shown to be}} expressed in dorsal root ganglia and give rise to itch in rodents, albeit upon stimuli with suprapathological concentrations of bile salts. The potent neuronal activator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and its forming enzyme, autotaxin (ATX), could be identified in the serum of patients with cholestatic pruritus. ATX activity correlated with itch severity and effectiveness of several anti-pruritic therapeutic interventions in cholestatic patients. Thus, the ATX-LPA-axis may represent a key element in the pathogenesis of this agonizing symptom. Treatment options for pruritus of cholestasis remain limited to a few evidence-based and several experimental medical and interventional therapies. The current guideline-based recommendations include the anion exchange resins <b>colestyramine,</b> the pregnane X receptor-agonist and enzyme inducer rifampicin, the μ-opioid antagonist naltrexone, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline.

40|$|Statins are {{the drugs}} of choicefor {{lowering}} lipid levels {{in patients with}} hypercholestero-laemia when diet alone is unsuc-cessful. Alternatives for patients unable to tolerate a statin, for whom a statin is contraindicated or who need adjunctive therapy because target levels are not achieved with a statin alone include ezetimibe, a fibrate, nicotinic acid or a bile acid sequestering agent such as <b>colestyramine</b> or colestipol (Colestid). 1 The BNF recommends that combination treatment should be supervised by a specialist; in par-ticular, combinations of a statin with a fibrate or nicotinic acid are {{associated with an increased}} risk of adverse effects. 2 The NICE clinical guideline on secondary prevention of myocardial infarction 3 makes no recommendations for the choice of a second-line agent. The technology Colesevelam hydrochloride is a bile acid sequestrant licensed as an adjunct to a statin plus diet to reduce LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia who are not adequately controlled with a statin alone, and as monotherapy as an adjunct to diet to reduce total and LDL-C in patients with isolated pri-mary hypercholesterolaemia in whom a statin is considered inap-propriate or is not well tolerated. Colesevelam is not absorbed systemically. It binds bile in the intestine, interrupting its entero-hepatic recirculation. The result-ing depletion of the bile pool increases hepatic demand for cholesterol and is associated with an increase in hepatic LDL-C receptors; clearance of LDL-C is increased, lowering serum levels. There is also an increase in very low-density lipoproteins, result-ing in an increase in triglyceride levels.
