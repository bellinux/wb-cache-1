40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of clean air in industrial workplaces is well known. Cement dust, {{due to its}} silica content, is very dangerous. The aims {{of this study were}} to assess and control the release of <b>cement</b> dust from <b>silos</b> of concrete batching units during charging and production processes in a dam project. Methods: In this study, dust particule mass released from the <b>cement</b> <b>silos</b> were investigated by performing environmental samplingandpersonal sampling from 15 operators of batching machine. Samples were analyzed by gravimetric method. Control methods were used to control the released dust. Data collected before and after the intervention were analyzed through SPSS 19 and using paired t- test and one sample t- test. Results: Mean concentrations of dust particles masses in personal and environmental samples were respectively 15. 56 and 30. 77 mg/m 3 and both were higher than the standard exposure limit values in Iran. After implementation of dust control methods, mean concentrations of dust in personal and environmental samples decreased respectively to 4. 1 and 5. 2 mg/m 3 that show the efficiency of control methods. Conclusion: The control method applied in the present study is a novel and cost-effective method to control the released particles from batching units of <b>cement</b> <b>silos.</b> It is possible to decrease the dust concentration in industrial workplaces to the standard levels, by performing simiar methods.

50|$|A {{few years}} later Lotz withdrew from the company, but Olaf Kier {{retained}} a semblance of his identity by including Lotz's initials in the organisation's new name, 'J.L. Kier & Co Ltd', which remained the company's principal title for over four decades.By the late 1930s Kier had moved their head office to Belgravia in Westminster, and thereby became neighbours to many of Britain's leading construction engineering consultants and contractors, who had formed a substantial coterie in Westminster for professionals and businessmen engaged in civil engineering. Their immediate neighbours were Marples Ridgeway (builders of Hammersmith Flyover) and Edmund Nuttall (builders of both Mersey road tunnels). During the first thirty-five years of its existence Kier became identified with certain civil engineering specialisms, such as contiguous cylindrical reinforced concrete grain <b>silos</b> and <b>cement</b> <b>silos,</b> using continuously sliding formwork; commencing with those at Barking in 1929, followed by grain silos at Northampton, Peterborough, Melksham, Gloucester and Witham; and <b>cement</b> <b>silos</b> at Norwich, Cambridge, Trinidad, and in India.|$|R
50|$|This period also {{marked the}} {{construction}} of the final house on the Nelson farmstead in 1935, built by Herman Nelson in anticipation of his son’s marriage in 1935. Other improvements to the farmstead followed. A <b>cement</b> <b>silo</b> was added in the 1940s. The original granary was converted into a machine shed. In the 1940s and 1950s, an Aerometer windmill was installed to water the livestock, and a metal shed was built. Few changes were made to the farm from 1959 until 2002, when it was changed over from deep-well to center-pivot irrigation.|$|E
50|$|These {{categories}} typically {{differ in}} the ease of startup and teardown {{and the presence of}} portable features such as axles, brakes, and lights. Mobile batching plants are typically a single unit, made up of a <b>cement</b> <b>silo,</b> an aggregate bin, an aggregate conveyor and the cement and aggregate batchers, but at higher hourly production capacities may require numerous loads for a single plant. Typically, a mobile batching plant can be dismantled and reassembled in a few days time. As a result, they can be used at multiple construction sites to reduce transportation costs.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{unit has}} a {{conveyor}} belt to lift the raw materials, which folds away into the first aggregate bin. Bin-fed batch plants are fitted with load cells and digital display units with printers to enable constant control of raw materials. The unit is supplied cement from a <b>Cement</b> <b>Silo,</b> normally between the capacity of 30-100MT. Since these are much smaller batching plants, great care {{should be taken to}} ensure safety of the Cement Silos.

50|$|Since the {{freshwater}} lakes {{are less}} corrosive to ships than the salt {{water of the}} oceans, many of the Lakers remain in service for long periods and the fleet has a much higher average age than the ocean-going fleet. The average lifespan of a laker is 40-50 years however, ships older than 50 years are not uncommon. Until 2014, , built in 1906 as William P. Snyder (552 ft), was the oldest ship in active duty on the Lakes. She was managed by Port City Steamship and owned by St. Mary's Cement, a subsidiary of Votorantim Cimentos. E. M. Ford {{had one of the}} longest careers, having been built in 1898 (as Presque Isle - 428 ft) and still sailing the lakes 98 years later in 1996.

50|$|There are {{different}} types of cement silos such as the low-level mobile silo and the static upright <b>cement</b> <b>silo,</b> which are used to hold and discharge cement and other powder materials such as PFA (Pulverised Fuel Ash). The low-level silos are fully mobile with capacities from 100 to 750 tons. They are simple to transport and are easy to set up on site. These mobile silos generally come equipped with an electronic weighing system with digital display and printer. This allows any quantity of cement or powder discharged from the silo to be controlled and also provides an accurate indication of what remains inside the silo. The static upright silos have capacities from 200 to 800 tons. These are considered a low-maintenance option for the storage of cement or other powders.

5000|$|Municipalities, {{especially}} in urban or residential areas, {{have been concerned}} at the pollution by concrete batching plants. [...] The absence of suitable dust collection and filter systems in <b>cement</b> <b>silos</b> or at the truck loading point is {{the major source of}} particulate matter emission in the air. The loading point is a large emission point for dust pollution, so many concrete producers utilize central dust collectors to contain this dust. Notably, many transit mix (dry loading) plants create significantly more dust pollution than central mix plants {{due to the nature of}} the batching process. A final source of concern for many municipalities is the presence of extensive water runoff and reuse for water spilled on a producer's sites.|$|R
5000|$|A {{concrete}} plant, {{also known}} as a batch plant or batching plant or a concrete batching plant, is equipment that combines various ingredients to form concrete. Some of these inputs include water, air, admixtures, sand, aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.), fly ash, silica fume, slag, and cement. There are two main types of concrete plants: Dry mix plants and Wet mix plants, and also plants that contain both a transit mix side and a central mix side while utilizing common material storage points. A concrete plant can have a variety of parts and accessories, including: mixers (either tilt drum or horizontal or in some cases both), cement batchers, aggregate batchers, conveyors, radial stackers, aggregate bins, cement bins, heaters, chillers, <b>cement</b> <b>silos,</b> batch plant controls, and dust collectors.|$|R
