5|$|Alexios {{advanced}} from Salonica {{and pitched}} <b>camp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river Charzanes near Dyrrhachium on October 15. He held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers; {{among them was}} George Palaiologos, who had managed to sneak out of the city. A majority of the senior officers, including Palaiologos, urged caution, noting that time was with the Emperor. Alexios, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard's army from the rear, {{while they were still}} besieging the city. Alexios moved his army to the hills opposite the city, planning to attack the Normans the next day.|$|E

The U.S. Army {{did not realize}} how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} start of the Civil War, Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood {{declared}} Davenport to be Iowa's first military headquarters. Five camps were set up in Davenport during the war. Camp McClellan was the largest <b>camp,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern edge of the city. Thousands of Iowa troops trained here. Camp McClellan contained twenty wooden barracks, a stockade building, headquarters buildings, and hospitals. A Davenport neighborhood, McClellan Heights is named after the camp.|$|E

These Americans were herded into air-raid shelters, sealed in, doused with gasoline, and burned alive. One of the survivors, PFC Eugene Nielsen, recounted his tale to U.S. Army Intelligence on January7, 1945. Two days later, MacArthur's forces landed on Luzon and began a rapid advance towards the capital, Manila.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 24 January the Archduke's army took {{positions}} east of {{the small town of}} Byczyna on the royal road leading into Poland.

5|$|The U.S. Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 1865 to {{forestall}} Native American uprisings.

In later years, other nearby settlements would form and merge to become the city of Tempe, but this community was incorporated after Phoenix.|$|E

5|$|The rebels {{abandoned}} their fortified camp on Mount Bábolna, most probably because they needed new provisions. They moved towards Dés, pillaging the noblemen's manors during their march. They threatened all {{who did not}} support them with severe punishments. They established a new <b>camp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Szamos (Someș) River near the town. A new battle was fought between the rebels and their enemies near the camp in late September.|$|E
5|$|To the west, on 12 May, Givati brigade troops {{took the}} British {{detention}} <b>camp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road leading to Latrun, but abandoned {{it the next}} day. Between 14 and 15 May, its 52nd battalion took the villages of Abu Shusha, Al-Na'ani and al-Qubab north of Latrun, thus cutting off the zone from Ramla, the main Arab town in the area. Lapierre and Collins report also that a platoon of the Givati brigade fired on and then penetrated the fort without encountering any resistance {{on the morning of}} 15 May. Again to the east, on 15 May, the troops of the Harel brigade took Dayr Ayyub, which they abandoned the next day.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{stay with}} the Danish consul, the family were shipped to a refugee <b>camp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Büyükada in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul, Turkey, where the Kulikovsky family shared three rooms with eleven other adults. After two weeks, they were {{evacuated}} to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Regent Alexander Karageorgevich, later to become King Alexander I, offered them a permanent home there, but Dowager Empress Marie summoned her daughter to Denmark. The Grand Duchess complied, and the family arrived in Copenhagen on Good Friday 1920. They lived with Kulikovsky's mother-in-law, Dowager Empress Marie, at first at the Amalienborg Palace {{and then at the}} royal estate of Hvidøre. Kulikovsky and Marie did not get along; he was resentful of his wife acting as Marie's secretary and companion, and Marie was distant toward him.|$|E

5|$|In early 1966 Jim Brown, who {{had begun}} an acting career two years before, was {{shooting}} {{for his second}} film in London. The Dirty Dozen cast Brown as Robert Jefferson, a convict sent to France during World War II to assassinate German officers meeting at a castle near Rennes in Brittany. Production delays due to bad weather meant he would miss {{at least the first}} part of training <b>camp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> campus of Hiram College, which annoyed Modell, who threatened to fine Brown $1,500 for every week of camp he missed. Brown, who had previously said that 1966 would be his last season, announced his retirement instead. At the end of his nine-year career, Brown held records for most rushing yards in a game, a season and a career. He also owned the record for all-purpose yards in a career and best average per carry for a running back at 5.22yards, a mark that still stands.|$|E
5|$|Knowing {{that their}} <b>camp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Szamos {{could easily be}} attacked, the rebels marched towards Kolozsvár in October or November. They invaded and pillaged the Báthorys' estates at Fejérd (Feiurdeni). They also {{captured}} and beheaded many noblemen before attacking the abbey and forcing the abbot to flee. A group of rebels took possession of Nagyenyed {{with the assistance of}} its poor burghers and the inhabitants of the nearby villages. Most burghers of Kolozsvár also sympathized with the rebels, who thus entered the town without resistance. A Saxon charter recorded that Antal Nagy de Buda died fighting against the noblemen before 15 December. Demény refutes the credibility of the report, saying that all other sources indicate that the peasants were still resisting in January 1438.|$|E
5|$|The Little Butte Creek {{area was}} {{originally}} settled by the Takelma, {{and possibly the}} Shasta tribe of Native Americans. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the Eagle Point region in 1852. Little Butte Creek was named by the early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Big Butte Creek. Due to conflicts with the Rogue River Indians, Major J. A. Lupton gathered 35men from Jacksonville on October 8, 1855, and attacked the Native Americans {{near the mouth of}} Little Butte Creek, killing about 30 of them. Lupton was also killed, and eleven of his men were injured. On December 24 of the same year, Captain Miles Alcorn discovered and attacked a Native American <b>camp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north fork, killing eight. On Christmas the following day, another band of Native Americans were attacked near Little Butte Creek's mouth; some fled, while the rest were either captured or killed.|$|E
