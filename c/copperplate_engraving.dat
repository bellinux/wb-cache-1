5|$|The Early Netherlandish masters' {{influence}} reached {{artists such}} as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century Cologne, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich {{were the most important}} artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire {{at the start of the}} 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or <b>copperplate</b> <b>engraving)</b> and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive {{artists such as}} Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantages}} {{possessed by}} roller printing over all other processes are mainly three: firstly, its high productivity, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being commonly printed {{in one day}} of ten hours by a single-colour machine; secondly, by its capacity of being applied to the reproduction of every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of <b>copperplate</b> <b>engraving</b> and the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of block printing and to patterns varying in repeat from I to 80 in.; and thirdly, the wonderful exactitude with which each portion of an elaborate multicolour pattern can be fitted into its proper place, and the entire absence of faulty joints at its points of repeat or repetition consideration {{of the utmost importance}} in fine delicate work, where such a blur would utterly destroy the effect.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of its {{publication}} in July 1791, the book had been printed in four variants, differing only in front matter. In the first two variants, 1790 is given as the year of publication, and in the other two variants it is 1791. The 1790 variants have two title pages, one in Slavonic-Serbian (folio 1 verso), and the other in German (folio 2 recto). The earlier of these variants contains a dedication to Metropolitan Mojsije Putnik composed by Kurzbeck, while the other variant has no dedication. The 1791 variants have one title page (folio 2 recto) with both the Slavonic-Serbian and the German version of the title. The preceding page (folio 1 verso) contains a <b>copperplate</b> <b>engraving</b> depicting Count Francis Balassa, and these two variants differ only in some details of the engraving. After the title page comes a dedication to Balassa, composed by Kurzbeck in the tone of humble devotion. All variants have the same foreword written by Kurzbeck, while none of them mentions Jacob Rodde as the source or Teodor Avramović as the editor of the dictionary. Only Kurzbeck is mentioned as its publisher. Its source and editor have been identified respectively by Samuel Linde {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century and Pavel Jozef Šafárik in 1865, since when the book has been referred to as the Avramović Dictionary.|$|E

Tytler also describes the architecture of Noah's Ark in detail (illustrated with a <b>copperplate</b> <b>engraving)</b> and, following Bishop Ussher, includes a remarkably precise chronology for the Earth, beginning with its creation on 23 October 4004 B.C. and noting that the Great Flood of 2348 B.C. lasted for exactly 777 days.

2500|$|During the 18th century {{painters}} {{began to}} portray individual actors in scenes from named plays. There {{was also a}} tradition of private performances, {{with a variety of}} illustrated works to help with stage properties and costumes. Among these was Thomas Jefferys’ A Collection of the Dresses of Different Nations, Antient and Modern (1757–72) which included a <b>copperplate</b> <b>engraving</b> of a crowned Circe in loose dress, holding a goblet aloft in her right hand and a long wand in her left. Evidence of such performances during the following decades is provided by several portraits in character, of which one of the earliest was the pastel by Daniel Gardner (1750–1805) of “Miss Elliot as Circe”. The artist had been a pupil of both George Romney and Joshua Reynolds, who themselves were soon to follow his example. On the 1778 engraving based on Gardner’s portrait appear the lines from Milton’s ‘’Comus’’ ...|$|E

6000|$|Or, again, {{you figure}} Kipps with {{something}} of {{the air of a}} young sacristan, handling his brightly virginal account-books, and looking, and looking again, and then still looking, at an unparalleled specimen of <b>copperplate</b> <b>engraving,</b> ruled money below and above, bearing the words [...] "In Account with, ARTHUR KIPPS" [...] (loud flourishes), [...] "The Booksellers' Trading Union" [...] (temperate decoration). You figure Ann sitting and stitching at one point of the circumference of the light of the lamp, stitching queer little garments for some unknown stranger, and over against her sits Kipps. Before him is one of those engraved memorandum forms, a moist pad, wet with some thick and greasy greenish purple ink that is also spreading quietly but steadily over his fingers, a cross-nibbed pen for first-aid surgical assistance to the patient in his hand, a dating rubber stamp. At intervals he brings down this latter with great care and emphasis upon the paper, and when he lifts it there appears a beautiful oval design of which [...] "Paid, Arthur Kipps, The Associated Booksellers' Trading Union," [...] and a date, are the essential ingredients, stamped in purple ink.|$|E

6000|$|Polite {{literature}} {{was beginning to}} make its appearance. Few native works were advertised, it is true, except sermons and treatises of controversial divinity; nor were the English authors of the day much known {{on this side of}} the Atlantic. But catalogues were frequently offered at auction or private sale, comprising the standard English books, history, essays, and poetry, of Queen Anne's age, and the preceding century. We see nothing in the nature of a novel, unless it be [...] "The Two Mothers, price four coppers." [...] There was an American poet, however, of whom Mr. Kettell has preserved no specimen,--the author of [...] "War, an Heroic Poem"; he publishes by subscription, and threatens to prosecute his patrons for not taking their books. We have discovered a periodical, also, and one that has a peculiar claim to be recorded here, since it bore the title of [...] "THE NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE," [...] a forgotten predecessor, for which we should have a filial respect, and take its excellence on trust. The fine arts, too, were budding into existence. At the [...] "old glass and picture shop," [...] in Cornhill, various maps, plates, and views are advertised, and among them a [...] "Prospect of Boston," [...] a <b>copperplate</b> <b>engraving</b> of Quebec, and the effigies of all the New England ministers ever done in mezzotinto. All these must have been very salable articles. Other ornamental wares were to be found at the same shop; such as violins, flutes, hautboys, musical books, English and Dutch toys, and London babies. About this period, Mr. Dipper gives notice of a concert of vocal and instrumental music. There had already been an attempt at theatrical exhibitions.|$|E

Yet the work that was then so lukewarmly received--if, indeed, it can be said to have been received at all--is at present far more sought after than Stothard's, and the prices now given for the [...] "Songs of Innocence and Experience," [...] the [...] "Inventions to the Book of Job," [...] and even [...] "The Grave," [...] would have brought affluence to the struggling artist, who (as Cromek taunted him) was frequently [...] "reduced so low as to be obliged to live on half a guinea a week." [...] Not that this was entirely the fault of his contemporaries. Blake was a visionary, and an untuneable man; and, like others who work for the select public of all ages, he could not always escape the consequence that the select public of his own, however willing, were scarcely numerous enough to support him. His most individual works are the [...] "Songs of Innocence," [...] 1789, and the [...] "Songs of Experience," [...] 1794. These, afterwards united in one volume, were unique in their method of production; indeed, they do not perhaps strictly come within the category of what is generally understood to be <b>copperplate</b> <b>engraving.</b> The drawings were outlined and the songs written upon the metal with some liquid that resisted the action of acid, and the remainder of the surface of the plate was eaten away with aqua-fortis, leaving the design in bold relief, like a rude stereotype. This was then printed off in the predominant tone-- blue, brown, or yellow, as the case might be--and delicately tinted by the artist in a prismatic and ethereal fashion peculiarly his own. Stitched and bound in boards by Mrs. Blake, a certain number of these leaflets--twenty-seven {{in the case of the}} first issue--made up a tiny octavo of a wholly exceptional kind. Words indeed fail to exactly describe the flower-like beauty--the fascination of these [...] "fairy missals," [...] in which, it has been finely said, [...] "the thrilling music of the verse, and the gentle bedazzlement of the lines and colours so intermingle, that the mind hangs in a pleasant uncertainty as to whether it is a picture that is singing, or a song which has newly budded and blossomed into colour and form." [...] The accompanying woodcut, after one of the illustrations to the [...] "Songs of Innocence," [...] gives some indication of the general composition, but it can convey no hint of the gorgeous purple, and crimson, and orange of the original.|$|E
