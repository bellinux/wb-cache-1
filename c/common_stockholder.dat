40|$|In {{several recent}} cases, the Delaware Chancery Court has {{emphasized}} that where {{a conflict of}} interest exists between holders of a company’s common stock and holders of its preferred stock, the standard of conduct for directors requires that they strive to maximize the value of the corporation for the benefit of its common stockholders rather than for its preferred stockholders. This article interrogates this view of directors’ fiduciary duties from the perspective of incomplete contracting theory. Building on the seminal work of Sanford Grossman and Oliver Hart, incomplete contracting theory examines the critical role of corporate control rights for addressing conflicts that arise between a firm’s investors so as to maximize firm value. It therefore provides a natural starting point for examining how the control rights residing in a company’s board of directors should be used for resolving conflicts between common and preferred stockholders. This analysis highlights the utility of a default fiduciary duty that prioritizes <b>common</b> <b>stockholder</b> welfare for maximizing the value of the corporation. In particular, such a duty helps facilitate Coasian bargaining among investors to resolve unanticipated conflicts that can arise while also minimizing the risk of bargaining failure. Critically, however, a dictate for directors to maximize stockholder welfare can operate in this fashion only to the extent it exists as a default rule that a director can opt out of when elected to represent the interests of a particular investor or group of investors, as is common among preferred stockholders. Moreover, close inspection of Delaware case law highlights how such a dynamic is consistent with Delaware’s corporate jurisprudence which has historically viewed stockholder wealth maximization as ultimately a means to maximize the value of the corporation. To ensure the continuing vitality of the corporate form, Delaware courts should, accordingly, abandon any pretense that corporate directors have an immutable duty to maximize <b>common</b> <b>stockholder</b> value and revert to their traditional focus on policing against the bargaining failures that can occur when investors use directors to address the incomplete contracting challenges that are replete in corporate finance...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is to conduct a {{valuation}} of the <b>common</b> <b>stockholder</b> equity in Marine Harvest on December 31, 2016. The valuation {{will be based on}} a fundamental valuation, supplemented by a method of comparables. In the fundamental valuation we have identified the underlying economic conditions of Marine Harvest, in order to forecast the pro forma financial statement. The discounted cash flows are then used to provide an estimated value. In the method of comparables we have used the method of multiples to provide a supplementary valuation. To provide the reader with the insight required for the thesis, we start with a presentation of the fish farming industry and Marine Harvest. The first part of the fundamental valuation is a strategic analysis of Marine Harvest. Using the PESTEL analysis and Porter's five forces, we reveal opportunities and threats to the fish farming industry. We use the SVIMA framework to conduct an analysis of the resources of Marine Harvest. The results of the strategic analysis are used to identify the sources of the historical strategic advantage of 13. 3 %. In Chapters 9 and 10, we forecast the pro forma financial statement based on the normalized financial statements from the accounting analysis. Our calculations give Marine Harvest a future strategic advantage of 6. 9 %. We then prepared value estimates using the equity method, the capital employed method and the net operating requirement method. After a convergence of the value estimates and an analysis of uncertainty, we concluded with an estimated value of 130, 053 NOK per share. Our final estimate using the method of comparables was NOK 154. 26 per share. By weighting the fundamental value estimate by 70 % and the comparative value estimate by 30 %, we concluded with a final value estimate of 137. 32 NOK per share and thus a sell recommendation...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} whether corporations should owe {{fiduciary duties}} to its preferred stockholders as preferred stockholders across all settings of preferred stock holding. In one context, sophisticated venture capitalists purchase preferred stock after carefully negotiating the stock price, {{control over the}} corporate governance, and other key stipulations by contract. Additionally, because the initial preferred stockholder could protect its interests through staged financing or board control, the preferred stockholder might not discount the stock even if it lacked protection since the other protective devices made the lack of such protections inconsequential so the initial holders won’t pay for these added fiduciary protections. In such settings {{it does not make}} sense for the corporation to owe fiduciary duties to the preferred stockholders as preferred. In fact, doing so rearranges the basis on which the initial stockholders purchased the stock and implying a fiduciary term constitutes a hit to the <b>common</b> <b>stockholders</b> and thus ignores the terms of the claimants and the risk and targeted return for each of them. However, while it makes sense for sophisticated venture capitalists to rely only on bargained-for contractual protections, this Article identifies two specific contexts where a limited fiduciary obligation should be extended to preferred stockholders who lack bargaining power. The first is when non-working children are given preferred stock in a family business. The second is when a corporation takes on a new unfamiliar product line, allowing <b>common</b> <b>stockholders</b> to wipe out the value of publicly traded preferred stock. When the preferred stock is purchased in the public marketplace, the preferred stockholders will not have any bargaining power in the preferred stock’s contractual arrangement. Moreover, the additional terms routine in shareholder agreements between VC’s and founders are almost never found in the Charter documents, so those provisions won’t be transferable. To the subsequent purchaser of preferred stock the lack of such protections might call for a limited fiduciary duty if the markets for preferred stock are not as efficient as for common stock or if there are chinks in the efficient capital market hypothesis. Where the disciplining effects of the market are weaker, subsequent buyers of the preferred stock may not price the stock accurately to reflect the lack of transferable protections, providing a justification for a limited fiduciary duty in that context if implying the term would add value. to be published by the Rutgers University Law Review...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{cross-sectional}} {{analysis of the}} relationship between common stock price reactions to announcements of convertible security calls and variables that represent possible determinants of changes in common stockholders' wealth. The variables are measures of the following effects of convertible security calls: (1) the change in interest expense tax shields, (2) the potential redistribution of wealth from <b>common</b> <b>stockholders</b> to preferred stockholders and debt holders,(3) the decrease in the value of conversion privileges heldby convertible security holders, (4) the relative increase in shares outstanding and (5) the change in earnings per share. A significant relationshipis found only between the measure of the reduction in interest expense tax shields and the stock price response to call announcements. The apparent corporate tax effect is consistent with some combination of effects due to (1) a reduction in interest expense tax shields and (2) unfavorable information about the calling firm's value of earnings prospects that is conveyed by a call of convertible securities. The evidence is consistent with theories of capital structure that imply optimal financial leverage depends on earnings prospects and with theories that imply reductions in leverage convey unfavorable information about firm value. ...|$|R

When interpreting such contracts, courts {{could deal with}} the expectations of parties formally by inquiring only about the plain meaning of the contract or qualitatively by enforcing the presumed expectations of the parties, regardless of whether those expectations are expressed in the contract.

While the duty of good faith appears to respond to the inevitable incompleteness of contracts, the courts largely ignore this duty in preferred stock cases.
