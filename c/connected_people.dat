25|$|German {{researchers}} Oliver Hinz of Universität Darmstadt, Bernd Skiera of University of Frankfurt, and Christian Barrot and Jan U. Becker of Kühne Logistics University, {{argue that}} seeding strategies have strong {{influence on the}} success of viral marketing campaigns. The results propose that seeding to well-connected people is the most successful approach because these attractive seeding points are more likely to participate in viral marketing campaigns. Well-connected people also actively use their greater reach but do not have more influence on their peers than do less <b>connected</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} side of the debate, some argue that influencers have no such effect and {{therefore}} companies shouldn’t target their seeding efforts on a specific group of people. Duncan Watts and Peter Dodds examined the phenomenon through a computer network simulation under the assumption that influential people are more difficult to influence, therefore social hubs have a lower tendency to adopt new products. Their work suggests that highly connected individuals do not play a crucial role in influencing others and that a random individual is just as likely to start a trend as <b>connected</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1839 the Portuguese government, {{acting on}} British pressure, {{abolished}} {{the slave trade}} south of the equator which had so damaged Central Africa. Human trafficking continued {{until well into the}} 1920s, first as an illegal slave trade, then as contract labor. A commodity trade, at first focused on ivory and wax, but gradually growing to include peanuts and rubber, replaced the slave trade. This trade revolutionized the economies and eventually the politics of the whole of Central Africa. In place of the slave trade, largely under the control of state authorities, thousands, and eventually hundreds of thousands, of commoners began carrying goods from inland to coastal ports. These people managed to share in the wealth of the new trade, and as a result, commercially <b>connected</b> <b>people</b> constructed new villages and challenged the authorities.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Duncan Watts, {{a network}} theory {{physicist}} at Columbia University, repeated the Milgram study {{by using a}} web site to recruit 61,000 people to send messages to 18 targets worldwide. He successfully reproduced Milgram's results (the average length of the chain was approximately six links). However, when he examined the pathways taken, he found that [...] "hubs" [...] (highly <b>connected</b> <b>people)</b> were not crucial. Only 5% of the e-mail messages had passed {{through one of the}} hubs. This casts doubt on Gladwell's assertion that specific types of people are responsible for bringing about large levels of change.|$|E
2500|$|The Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS). This scale {{measures}} how emotionally <b>connected</b> <b>people</b> feel to {{the natural}} world, animals, and plants. It also assesses people's perceived equality between nature and themselves. An example of an item is [...] "I recognize and appreciate the intelligence of other living organisms." [...] These items are rated on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) where higher scores demonstrate a higher connection to nature. This scale can be used both at the trait and state level. The state version is 13-items and shows acceptable reliability (α = [...]91,). The trait version is 14-items and also demonstrates good reliability (α = [...]82). This scale's validity is demonstrated by its positive associations with other environmental scales (such as the New Ecological Paradigm Scale) but is not associated with verbal ability or social desirability. See also Connectedness to nature scale.|$|E

As to Mr. Harthouse, whither he tended, he neither considered nor cared. He had no particular design or plan before him: no energetic wickedness ruffled his lassitude. He was as much amused and interested, at present, as it became so fine a gentleman to be; perhaps even more {{than it would have}} been consistent with his reputation to confess. Soon after his arrival he languidly wrote to his brother, the honourable and jocular member, that the Bounderbys were 'great fun;' and further, that the female Bounderby, instead of being the Gorgon he had expected, was young, and remarkably pretty. After that, he wrote no more about them, and devoted his leisure chiefly to their house. He was very often in their house, in his flittings and visitings about the Coketown district; and was much encouraged by Mr. Bounderby. It was quite in Mr. Bounderby's gusty way to boast to all his world that he didn't care about your highly <b>connected</b> <b>people,</b> but that if his wife Tom Gradgrind's daughter did, she was welcome to their company.|$|E

40|$|We define {{social media}} as online or digital {{technologies}} that serve to <b>connect</b> <b>people,</b> information and organisations through networks. The term evolved {{as a way}} to -distinguish the emerging online -information platforms from traditional "broadcast media" [...] TV, radio, film, newspapers [...] by highlighting that these new tools -were "socialised" and allowed the audiences to contribute to their content. Social media have therefore become defined in relation to these existing media channels, but in fact they have their ancestry in existing social technologies, like the telephone and the letter.
