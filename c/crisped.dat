40|$|AbstractMammalian {{fertilization}} is {{a complex}} multi-step process mediated by different molecules present on both gametes. Epididymal protein <b>CRISP</b> 1, {{a member of the}} Cysteine-RIch Secretory Protein (<b>CRISP)</b> family, was identified by our laboratory and postulated to participate in both sperm–zona pellucida (ZP) interaction and gamete fusion by binding to egg-complementary sites. To elucidate the functional role of <b>CRISP</b> 1 in vivo, we disrupted the <b>Crisp</b> 1 gene and evaluated the effect on animal fertility and several sperm parameters. Male and female <b>Crisp</b> 1 −/− animals exhibited no differences in fertility compared to controls. Sperm motility and the ability to undergo a spontaneous or progesterone-induced acrosome reaction were neither affected in <b>Crisp</b> 1 −/− mice. However, the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation was clearly lower in mutant sperm than in controls. In vitro fertilization assays showed that <b>Crisp</b> 1 −/− sperm also exhibited a significantly reduced ability to penetrate both ZP-intact and ZP-free eggs. Moreover, when ZP-free eggs were simultaneously inseminated with <b>Crisp</b> 1 +/+ and <b>Crisp</b> 1 −/− sperm in a competition assay, the mutant sperm exhibited a greater disadvantage in their fusion ability. Finally, the finding that the fusion ability of <b>Crisp</b> 1 −/− sperm was further inhibited by the presence of <b>CRISP</b> 1 or <b>CRISP</b> 2 during gamete co-incubation, supports that another <b>CRISP</b> cooperates with <b>CRISP</b> 1 during fertilization and might compensate for its lack in the mutant mice. Together, these results indicate that <b>CRISP</b> proteins are players in the mammalian fertilization process. To our knowledge this is the first knockout mice generated for a <b>CRISP</b> protein.

40|$|AbstractPreviously we {{reported}} {{the identification of}} the first vertebrate sperm chemoattractant, allurin, in the frog Xenopus laevis (Xl) and demonstrated that it {{was a member of the}} <b>CRISP</b> family of proteins. Here we report identification, purification, and characterization of Xenopus tropicalis (Xt) allurin, a homologous protein in X. tropicalis. “Egg water” as well as purified allurin from both species exhibit efficient cross-species sperm chemoattractant activity. Western blots show that Xt egg water contains a single anti-allurin cross-reactive protein whose molecular weight (20, 497  Da by MALDI MS) agrees well with the molecular weight of the hypothetical gene product for a newly recognized “Crisp A” gene in the X. tropicalis genome. A recombinant form of the protein, expressed in 3 T 3 cells, exhibits chemoattraction for both Xt and Xl sperm and cross reacts with anti-allurin antibodies. Examination of <b>Crisp</b> protein expression in the Xt oviduct using RT-PCR showed that of five documented Xt <b>Crisp</b> genes (<b>Crisps</b> 2, 3, LD 1, LD 2 and A) only <b>Crisp</b> A was expressed. In contrast, <b>Crisp</b> 2, <b>Crisp</b> 3, <b>Crisp</b> LD 1, and <b>Crisp</b> LD 2, but not <b>Crisp</b> A, were all found to be expressed in the Xt testes while subsets of <b>Crisp</b> proteins where expressed in the Xt ovary.

40|$|One {{in eight}} Australian couples of {{reproductive}} age is infertile and {{in more than}} 40 % of these couples, the infertility is due, at least in part, to male factors. In view of this finding, research is committed to addressing male fertility issues. Several regulatory genes {{have been identified as}} having a potential role in male infertility and animal models are widely used to establish functional activity. As a corollary of such research, many proteins are being assessed for their potential value as contraceptive targets. The mammalian cysteine-rich secretory proteins (<b>CRISPs)</b> are a family of four proteins exhibiting a high amino acid sequence similarity and belonging to the CAP (<b>CRISP,</b> Antigen- 5 proteins and the plant Pathogenesis related- 1 proteins) superfamily. <b>CRISPs</b> are predominantly expressed and localised to the male reproductive tract and were therefore investigated for their potential as fertility markers. Functional evidence of mammalian <b>CRISPs</b> is emerging, and data from snake venom <b>CRISPs</b> and from mouse <b>CRISPs</b> in our own lab, is suggesting that all <b>CRISPs</b> function as ion channel regulators. To determine the localization of all 4 members of the mouse <b>CRISP</b> family, I identified 16 tissues likely to express <b>CRISPs,</b> from EST databases and conducted RT-PCR to identify the transcripts and confirmed the localization of the proteins using immunohistochemistry. Consistent with published data, my results showed that <b>Crisps</b> have an expression bias to the male reproductive tract. In addition, however, my data showed that <b>Crisps</b> have a wider expression profile than was previously understood, and as such, raises the possibility of a role of <b>CRISPs</b> in the normal physiology of multiple organs. To investigate the effect of <b>CRISP</b> 4 on sperm function, I expressed recombinant full length <b>CRISP</b> 4 in a bacterial system but upon purification, it was found to be insoluble. After extensive efforts, <b>CRISP</b> 4 was solubilized and refolded and is currently being characterized by other researchers. In a parallel study, I expressed and purified the <b>CRISP</b> domain of <b>CRISP</b> 4 for use in sperm functional assays. At that time, our lab had determined that <b>CRISP</b> 4 <b>CRISP</b> domain could regulate calcium flow through TRPM 8 ion channels on the sperm plasma membrane. As such, I explored the potential for change on sperm function induced by TRPM 8 activation, and the ability of <b>CRISP</b> 4 to reverse such changes. Results from in vitro studies showed that TRPM 8 activation results in a suppression of the ability of spermatozoa to undergo the progesterone-induced acrosome reaction. This effect was reversed by <b>CRISP</b> 4. In order to extend the significance of this finding regarding the in vitro situation, I characterized the reproductive phenotype of <b>Crisp</b> 4 -deficient mice. An investigation of the function of sperm from <b>Crisp</b> 4 null mice showed that the percentage of sperm undergoing the acrosome reaction in response to progesterone was significantly reduced compared to wild type sperm. These in vivo results are consistent with the in vitro experiments and provide the first direct evidence that endogenous <b>CRISP</b> 4 is a regulator of ion channel (including TRPM 8) function, with implications in acrosome maturation within the epididymis and potentially in the fine tuning of the timing of the acrosome reaction within the female reproductive tract. The novel findings in this study provide, for the first time, a conclusive function of endogenous mouse <b>CRISP</b> 4 and add to the growing evidence that mammalian <b>CRISPs</b> are regulators of fertility. These findings have significant implications for identifying the function of human <b>CRISPs</b> and their potential as male contraceptive targets...|$|R
40|$|Cysteine-Rich Secretory Protein 3 (<b>CRISP</b> 3) {{is found}} {{predominantly}} in the salivary gland and granulocytes of healthy subjects, but is significantly up-regulated in the malignant prostate, where {{it represents the}} most over-expressed transcript. While the expression pattern of <b>CRISP</b> 3, its up-regulation in several inflammatory pathologies and the immunosuppressive role of related proteins in other species suggest a role for human <b>CRISP</b> 3 in the regulation of the immune response, no definitive function has been demonstrated. An anti-proliferative role of <b>CRISP</b> 3 in prostate cancer has also been proposed based on in vitro transfection experiments. Progress in understanding <b>CRISP</b> 3 function has been slow due partly {{to the fact that}} <b>CRISP</b> 3 is normally expressed at low levels and has a complex tertiary structure defined by eight conserved disulfide bonds, thus limiting attempts at purification from both native and recombinant sources for use in functional assays. Efforts to purify <b>CRISP</b> 3 from bacterial expression systems have invariably given rise to misfolded protein aggregates. The aims of the work presented in this thesis were threefold; to establish an efficient system of purification of <b>CRISP</b> 3 in its native conformation, to investigate the effects of <b>CRISP</b> 3 on prostatic epithelial cell proliferation, and to define the effect of <b>Crisp</b> 3 knockout in the Hi-Myc model of murine prostate cancer. In Chapter 2, I present a two-step system for recombinant <b>CRISP</b> 3 expression and purification involving cation-exchange and size exclusion chromatography based on a mammalian expression system. This protocol provided milligram quantities of recombinant <b>CRISP</b> 3. The presence of appropriate post-translational modifications and the interaction of the purified protein with a known <b>CRISP</b> 3 binding partner, which was abolished with <b>CRISP</b> 3 denaturation, indicated that the recombinant protein was likely to be in its native conformation. A comparative study of N-glycosylation sites and types within human and mouse <b>CRISP</b> 3 was undertaken, and revealed striking interspecies differences in post-translational modification. This represents the first study of mouse <b>CRISP</b> 3 and characterization of its glycosylation pattern. Our recombinant <b>CRISP</b> 3 preparation was used alongside transfection experiments to show, in Chapter 3, that contrary to a published report, neither extracellular treatment with, nor intracellular overexpression of, <b>CRISP</b> 3 directly affected the proliferation of PC 3 prostate cancer cells. Similarly, shRNA knockdown of <b>Crisp</b> 3 had no effect on prostate cell proliferation. In order to investigate the in vivo function of <b>CRISP</b> 3 in prostate malignancy, we made use of the murine Hi-Myc model of prostate cancer, which relies on the induced prostate-specific overexpression of the human c-Myc oncogene to initiate cancer, which typically becomes invasive between 6 - 12 months of age. A two-generational breeding programme was used to generate <b>Crisp</b> 3 -/- and <b>Crisp</b> 3 +/+ Hi-Myc mice. Cancer progression in the two genotypes was compared with histology and markers of proliferation, tumour burden, invasion, and tumour leukocyte infiltration. <b>CRISP</b> 3 expression was absent in the normal wild type prostate, but underwent significant up-regulation between 5 to 7 months in the Hi-Myc lateral prostate. This up-regulation coincided with accelerated progression to an invasive cancer phenotype by 7 months in the <b>Crisp</b> 3 +/+ animals. In contrast, <b>Crisp</b> 3 knockout totally suppressed progression from duct-contained (carcinoma in situ) to invasive prostate cancer in <b>Crisp</b> 3 -/- mice at 7 months. Hence, the experiments presented in this thesis demonstrate {{for the first time that}} <b>CRISP</b> 3 is pro-tumourigenic in the malignant prostate. Based on immunhistochemistry with the proliferation marker Ki 67 and the work contained in Chapter 3, <b>CRISP</b> 3 is unlikely to directly affect the proliferation of prostatic epithelium. Rather, preliminary data suggest that inflammatory mediators such as TGF-β can induce <b>CRISP</b> 3 up-regulation, which in turn may act on both the prostatic epithelium to promote an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and on tumour-infiltrating immune cells to condition a tolerogenic immune phenotype. This work therefore represents an important advance in the field’s understanding of the role of <b>CRISP</b> 3 in prostate cancer. Open Acces...|$|R
