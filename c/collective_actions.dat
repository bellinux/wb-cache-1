40|$|We propose an {{improved}} theoretical {{approach to the}} rich variety of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> now present in public life. Toward this end, we advance a conception of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> as communicative in nature, and offer a two-dimensional model of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> space, comprising dimensions for (a) the mode of interpersonal interaction and (b) the mode of engagement that shapes interaction. We illustrate the perspective by describing {{the location of a}} variety of contemporary <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> groups within it and by an explication of the space that reveals its utility for making sense of modern <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> efforts. Specifically, we apply the <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> space to illustrate the changing presence of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> groups over time, deviations in <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> groups through changes in size, shape, and location, and variations in the experiences and motivations of people engaged in <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> efforts. Finally, we show how our communicative approach to <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> can integrate the insights of several theoretical traditions, including <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> theory, social capital theory, and aspects of organization theory...|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} {{the role of}} perceived realistic and symbolic threats in predicting <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies, and in mediating effects of intergroup contact and social identity on <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> {{in the context of}} an intractable conflict. Extending earlier research on <b>collective</b> <b>action,</b> integrated threat theory, and intergroup contact theory, we tested whether realistic and symbolic threats would predict <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies and outgroup attitudes; and mediate the effects of intergroup contact and social identity on <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies and outgroup attitudes among the advantaged, Turks, and the disadvantaged, Kurds. Findings from both studies (Study 1, N = 289 Turks; Study 2, N = 209 Kurds) supported the predictive and mediating role of threats on <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies and outgroup attitudes. Overall findings suggest that advantaged and disadvantaged groups might not always have disparate psychologies regarding <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> and incorporating perceived threats as antecedents of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> can help to explain <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies among both groups especially in conflictual contexts...|$|R

25|$|Emergent {{structures}} are patterns that emerge via <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> of many individual entities. To explain such patterns, one might conclude, per Aristotle, that emergent {{structures are}} {{other than the}} sum of their parts {{on the assumption that the}} emergent order will not arise if the various parts simply interact independently of one another. However, there are those who disagree. According to this argument, the interaction of each part with its immediate surroundings causes a complex chain of processes that can lead to order in some form. In fact, some systems in nature are observed to exhibit emergence based upon the interactions of autonomous parts, and some others exhibit emergence that at least at present cannot be reduced in this way. In particular renormalization are methods in theoretical physics which enables scientists to study systems that are not tractable as the combination of their parts.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this is the disease environment. Places with {{different}} mortality rates had different populations and productivity levels around the world. For example, in Africa, the Tsetse fly which is harmful to humans and livestock reduced the ability of the Africans to plow the land. This made Africa less settled. As a consequence, political power was less concentrated. This also affected the colonial institutions that where set in place by the European countries in Africa. If the colonial settlers could live or not in a place made them develop different institutions which led to different economic and social paths. This also affected the distribution of power and the <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> people could take. As a result, some African countries ended up having democracies and others autocracies. Another example of geographical determinants for democracy is having access to coastal areas and rivers. This natural endowment has a positive relation with economic development thanks to the benefits of trade. Trade brought economic development, which in turn, broaden the power. If the ruler wanted to increase his revenues, he had to protect property rights to create incentives for people to invest. As more people had more power, more concessions had to be made by the ruler and in many places this process lead to democracy. These determinants defined the structur of the society moving the balance of political power.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} intergroup contact on different types of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies among advantaged and disadvantaged groups. Studies 1 and 2 tested the simultaneous effects of intergroup contact and established predictors of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> on <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies and ingroup and outgroup oriented policies among Blacks and Whites in South Africa, and compared the effects of intergroup contact and social identity on <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies via relative deprivation and group efficacy. The findings revealed that while social identity was positively associated with <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies, both directly and indirectly, effects of contact were negative and indirect via relative deprivation and group efficacy. Studies 3 and 4 {{investigated the}} effects of contact and social identity on <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies via perceived threats. Using data from Turkish and Kurdish groups in Turkey, I found that social identity predicted <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies positively, both directly and indirectly, while it predicted outgroup attitudes negatively and indirectly via perceived threats. Intergroup contact, on the other hand, predicted outgroup attitudes positively, both directly and indirectly, and <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies negatively via perceived threats. In Study 5, intergroup contact was positively associated, both directly and indirectly, via perspective taking and collective guilt, associated with outgroup oriented <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies. In Study 6, the effect of social identity on ingroup oriented <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> was positive and direct. Intergroup contact with the weaker minority group, on the other hand, was positively associated with outgroup oriented <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies via perspective taking. Additionally, intergroup contact with the majority outgroup moderated this relationship. When participants reported more contact with the majority group, intergroup contact with the weaker minority {{was not associated with}} outgroup oriented <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies. However, when the participants reported less contact with the majority group, intergroup contact positively predicted outgroup oriented <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> tendencies. Finally, Study 7 investigated the effects of two different dimensions of contact, contact with the majority and minority on <b>collective</b> <b>action,</b> via outgroup attitudes, dual-identification, and common ingroup identity in a three wave longitudinal design (N= 610) among Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus.

This work is framed within two social psychological theories, i. e. Identity Process Theory (Break well, 1986) and Social Representations Theory (Moscovici, 1984). The research used the construct of barriers to <b>collective</b> <b>action.</b> The barriers were conceptualised {{at different levels of}} analysis and were considered to embody both identity and representational aspects. The research comprised three studies. Study 1 used a questionnaire among 277 older people in order to establish the extent to which older people participate in different types of <b>collective</b> <b>action.</b> Two types of participation were identified, i. e. 'active' and 'passive'. Disability in specific areas and non-participation in a group were related to lower involvement in <b>collective</b> <b>action.</b> Study 2 was designed to explore the social issues older people are concerned about, to identify the types of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> they are likely to take, and to examine perceived barriers to engaging in <b>collective</b> <b>action.</b> Thirteen focus groups were run (n= 59) and the data was content analysed. Findings showed that older people perceive a need for social change {{for a wide variety of}} social issues and the importance of several aspects of identity and belief systems as either facilitators or barriers to engaging in <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> was revealed. <b>Collective</b> <b>action</b> was defined in terms of type of action (from individual to group action) and type of goal (from collective expression to collective change). Different social psychological factors accounting for willingness to engage in <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> were identified. These were investigated in the following study. Study 3 (n= 345) investigated the relationships between certain social psychological factors and <b>collective</b> <b>action.</b> Differences in perceptions of barriers according to five levels (intraindividual, interpersonal, intragroup, intergroup, societal) were shown. These were related to the way they give meaning to older people's identity structure and social beliefs. A model of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> was tested. Willingness to participate in <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> was directly predicted by political trust, previous experience of <b>collective</b> <b>action,</b> perceived effectiveness of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> and perceived barriers.

Hence, the aim of the study was to explore the role of hope and anger as drivers of participation and involvement in collective mobilizations. A cross-sectional field study (N = 638) conducted right after the emergence of the 15 -M socio-political protest movement in Spain assessed the emotions and beliefs of both demonstrators and those who took no part in the active mobilization. We hypothesized that anger and hope would sequentially mediate the relationship between <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> frames and participation in <b>collective</b> <b>action.</b> Furthermore, to test this premise, we ran two alternative sequential mediation models based on the social identity model of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> (SIMCA) and the encapsulated model of social identity in <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> (EMSICA), but with emotions as mediators between <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> frames and intensity of participation.

Although emotion initially held {{a prominent role in}} theories of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> (LeBon, 1895; Allport, 1924), it is often overlooked in contemporary theories. Past research on <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> can be organized into three general perspectives: The individual difference perspective, the social identity perspective, and the cognitive perspective. Three studies investigate the role emotions play in each of these perspectives using Intergoup Emotions Theory (Smith, 1993) as a framework. The results from Study 1 indicate that group anger and group strength are important mediators of two individual difference variables - locus of control and group identification. Results from Study 2 indicate that legitimacy, an important antecedent of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> according to the social identity approach, also effects collective through feelings of group anger. Furthermore, results from Study 2 demonstrate the role of fear as an inhibitor of <b>collective</b> <b>action.</b> Results from Study 3 indicate that when people are induced to feel angry they perceive less risk in <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> as compared to participants induced to feel afraid. Study 3 helps to resolve a criticism of the cognitive perspective - that the potential costs of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> often outweigh the benefits and participation in action is not logical. However, if anger leads participants to perceive <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> as less risky, then their participation in <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> is more reasonable.
