5|$|A {{study in}} 2000 {{found that the}} genetic {{distance}} between jackdaws {{and the other members}} of Corvus was greater than that within the rest of the genus. This led Pamela Rasmussen to reinstate the genus name Coloeus, created by Johann Kaup in 1829, in her Birds of South Asia (2005), a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in German by Hans Edmund Wolters. A study of corvid phylogeny undertaken in 2007 compared DNA sequences in the mitochondrial <b>control</b> <b>region</b> of several corvids. It found that the western jackdaw, and the closely related Daurian jackdaw (C.dauuricus) of eastern Russia and China, were basal to the core Corvus clade. The names Coloeusmonedula and Coloeusdauuricus have since been adopted by the International Ornithological Congress in their official list. The two species of jackdaw have been reported to hybridise in the Altai Mountains, southern Siberia, and Mongolia. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of specimens of the two species from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct.|$|E

There is also a non-coding long <b>control</b> <b>region</b> (LCR).|$|E
25|$|Currently, eagles only {{occur in}} the Hawaiian Islands as vagrants, but Quaternary bones of Haliaeetus have been found on three of the major islands. An ancient DNA study {{published}} in 2015 characterized the rapidly evolving mitochondrial <b>control</b> <b>region</b> {{of one of these}} specimens. DNA from a ∼3500-year-old sea eagle skeleton found in a lava cave on Maui was sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the Hawaiian eagle represents a distinct (>3% divergent) mtDNA lineage that is most closely related to extant white-tailed eagles. Based on fossil calibration, the Hawaiian mtDNA lineage probably diverged around the Middle Pleistocene. Thus, although not clearly differentiated in morphology from its relatives, the Hawaiian eagle likely represented an isolated, resident population in the Hawaiian archipelago for more than 100,000 years, where it was the largest terrestrial predator. The reasons for its extinction are unknown.|$|E

25|$|Analysis of <b>control</b> <b>region</b> mtDNA {{haplotype}} {{data shows}} two major lineages. The Arctic and the subarctic migratory population includes the lesser sandhill cranes. The other lineages {{can be divided}} into a migratory and some indistinct clusters which can be matched to the resident subspecies. The lesser and greater sandhill cranes are quite distinct, their divergence dating to roughly 2.3–1.2 million years ago , some time during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene. Glaciation seemingly fragmented off a founder population of lesser sandhill cranes, because during each major ice age, its present breeding range was frozen year-round. Still, sandhill cranes are amply documented from fossil and subfossil remains right to the modern era. Conceivably, they might be considered distinct species already, a monotypic G. canadensis and the greater sandhill crane, G. pratensis, which would include the other populations.|$|E
25|$|The E2 protein {{serves as}} a master {{transcriptional}} regulator for viral promoters located primarily in the long <b>control</b> <b>region.</b> The protein has a transactivation domain linked by a relatively unstructured hinge region to a well-characterized DNA binding domain. E2 facilitates the binding of E1 to the viral origin of replication. E2 also utilizes a cellular protein known as Bromodomain-4 (Brd4) to tether the viral genome to cellular chromosomes. This tethering to the cell's nuclear matrix ensures faithful distribution of viral genomes to each daughter cell after cell division. It is thought that E2 {{serves as a}} negative regulator of expression for the oncogenes E6 and E7 in latently HPV-infected basal layer keratinocytes. Genetic changes, such as integration of the viral DNA into a host cell chromosome, that inactivate E2 expression tend to increase {{the expression of the}} E6 and E7 oncogenes, resulting in cellular transformation and possibly further genetic destabilization.|$|E
25|$|According to {{that work}} the {{majority}} of the Ashkenazi mtDNA lineages can be assigned to three major founders within haplogroup K (31% of their total lineages): K1a1b1a, K1a9 and K2a2. The absence of characteristic mutations within the <b>control</b> <b>region</b> in the PPNB K-haplotypes allow discarding them as members of either sub-clades K1a1b1a or K2a2, both representing a 79% of total Ashkenazi K lineages. However, without a high-resolution typing of the mtDNA coding region it cannot be excluded that the PPNB K lineages belong to the third sub-cluster K1a9 (20% of Askhenazi K lineages). Moreover, {{in the light of the}} evidence presented here of a loss of lineages in the Near East since Neolithic times, the absence of Ashkenazi mtDNA founder clades in the Near East should not be taken as a definitive argument for its absence in the past. The genotyping of the complete mtDNA in ancient Near Eastern populations would be required to fully answer this question and it will undoubtedly add resolution to the patterns detected in modern populations in this and other studies.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, {{during an}} attempt to {{understand}} the genetic identity of the rapidly expanding jackal populations in Europe, an international team of researchers examined 15 microsatellite markers and a 406 base-pair fragment of the mtDNA <b>control</b> <b>region</b> from the tissue samples of 97 specimens throughout Europe and Asia Minor. The results showed that European jackals have much lower haplotype diversity than those in Israel (where they have admixed with dogs, grey wolves and African wolves), and that they mostly descend from populations originating from the Caucasus. The highest level of haplotype diversity was found in Peloponnesian jackals, which may represent a relict population of Europe's original golden jackals prior to their extirpation elsewhere. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the genetics of Baltic jackals, as all Baltic states class the animal as an artificially introduced invasive species subject to extermination. It was found that jackals in Estonia originate from the south-eastern European population, whereas those in Lithuania are of Caucasian origin; this was concluded to render the hypothesis of an artificial introduction unlikely, and that their presence in both states was consistent with the natural northward expansion of both southeastern and eastern European populations.|$|E
500|$|Eight {{subspecies}} are identified, {{of which}} two – A. b. caama and A. b. lichtensteinii – {{have been considered}} to be independent species. However, a 1999 genetic study by P. Arctander of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues, which sampled the <b>control</b> <b>region</b> of the mitochondrial DNA, found that these two formed a clade within A. buselaphus, and that recognising these as species would render A. buselaphus paraphyletic (an unnatural grouping). The same study found A. b. major {{to be the most}} divergent, having branched off before the lineage split to give a combined caama/lichtensteinii lineage and another that gave rise to the remaining extant subspecies. Conversely a 2001 phylogenetic study, based on D–loop and cytochrome b analysis by Øystein Flagstad (of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, Trondheim) and colleagues, found that the southern lineage of A. b. caama and A. lichtensteinii diverged earliest. Analysis of skull structure supports partition into three major divisions: A. b. buselaphus division (nominate, also including A. b. major division), A. b. tora division (also including A. b. cokii and A. b. swaynei) and A. b. lelwel division. Another analysis of cytochrome b and D-loop sequence data shows a notable affinity between the A. b. lelwel and A. b. tora [...] divisions.|$|E

40|$|To help {{understand}} {{the mechanisms of}} gene rearrangement in the mitochondrial (mt) genomes of hemipteroid insects, we sequenced the mt genome of the plague thrips, Thrips imaginis (Thysanoptera). This genome is circular, 15, 407 bp long, and has many unusual features, including (1) rRNA genes inverted and distant from one another, (2) an extra gene for tRNA-Ser, (3) a tRNA-Val lacking a D-arm, (4) two pseudo-tRNA genes, (5) duplicate <b>control</b> <b>regions,</b> and (6) translocations and/or inversions of 24 of the 37 genes. The mechanism of rRNA gene transcription in T. imaginis may be {{different from that of}} other arthropods since the two rRNA genes have inverted and are distant from one another. Further, the rRNA genes are not adjacent or even close to either of the two <b>control</b> <b>regions.</b> Tandem duplication and deletion is a plausible model for the evolution of duplicate <b>control</b> <b>regions</b> and for the gene translocations, but intramitochondrial recombination may account for the gene inversions in T. imaginis. All the 18 genes between <b>control</b> <b>regions</b> # 1 and # 2 have translocated and/or inverted, whereas only six of the 20 genes outside this region have translocated and/or inverted. Moreover, the extra tRNA gene and the two pseudo-tRNA genes are either in this region or immediately adjacent to one of the <b>control</b> <b>regions.</b> These observations suggest that tandem duplication and deletion may be facilitated by the duplicate <b>control</b> <b>regions</b> and may have occurred a number of times in the lineage leading to T. imaginis. T. imaginis shares two novel gene boundaries with a lepidopsocid species from another order of hemipteroid insects, the Psocoptera. The evidence available suggests that these shared gene boundaries evolved by convergence and thus are not informative for the interordinal phylogeny of hemipteroid insects. We discuss the potential of hemipteroid insects as a model system for studies of the evolution of animal mt genomes and outline some fundamental questions that may be addressed with this system...|$|R

2500|$|Arctic North-East Siberia: In 2015, a study {{looked at}} the {{mitochondrial}} <b>control</b> <b>region</b> sequences of 13 ancient canid remains and one modern wolf from five sites across Arctic north-east Siberia. The fourteen canids revealed nine mitochondrial haplotypes, three of which were on record and the others not reported before. The phylogentic tree generated from the sequences showed that four of the Siberian canids dated 28,000 YBP and one Canis c.f. variabilis dated 360,000 YBP were highly divergent. The haplotype designated as S805 (28,000 YBP) from the Yana River was one mutation away from another haplotype S902 (8,000 YBP) that represents Clade A of the modern wolf and domestic dog lineages. Closely related to this haplotype was one that {{was found in the}} recently-extinct Japanese wolf. Several ancient haplotypes were oriented around S805, including Canis c.f. variabilis (360,000 YBP), Belgium (36,000 YBP – the [...] "Goyet dog"), Belgium (30,000 YBP), and Konsteki, Russia (22,000 YBP). Given the position of the S805 haplotype on the phylogenetic tree, it may potentially represent a direct link from the progenitor (including Canis c.f. variabilis) to the domestic dog and modern wolf lineages. The gray wolf is thought to be ancestral to the domestic dog, however its relationship to C. variabilis, and the genetic contribution of C. variabilis to the dog, is the subject of debate.|$|E

40|$|The correct spatial {{expression}} of two Drosophila bithorax complex (BX-C) genes, abdominal-A (abdA) and Abdominal-B (AbdB), {{is dependent on}} the 100 -kb intergenic infraabdominal (iab) region.
