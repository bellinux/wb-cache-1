40|$|Susceptibility to 11 {{antibiotics}} {{was determined}} for 63 <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> Staphylococcus aureus and 63 <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> Staphylococcus epidermidis obtained at random from the clinical laboratory. The incidence {{of resistance to}} nine of these antibiotics was greater for S. epidermidis than for S. aureus. Studies of the minimal inhibitory concentration <b>of</b> these <b>cultures</b> to clindamycin showed that 61 <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> S. aureus were susceptible whereas only 46 <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> S. epidermidis were susceptible to this antibiotic. Although <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> S. aureus were more active {{in the production of}} seven virulence factors, some <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> S. epidermidis produced virulence factors. By successive cultivation in increasing concentrations of clindamycin, resistant variants were obtained for 10 <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> S. aureus and 3 <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> S. epidermidis. The presence of subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin inhibited the production of some virulence factors by the resistant variants. In view of the greater resistance of S. epidermidis to antibiotics and its ability to produce virulence factors, its isolation in the clinical laboratory should not be regarded lightly...|$|R

40|$|Monocyte-T-cell {{interactions}} were studied in pokeweed mitogen (PWM) -activated cell cultures. We addressed {{the question of}} monocyte changes in PWM-stimulated <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> T cells and monocytes and found, by flow cytometric analysis, that PWM activation led {{to a loss of}} cells with monocyte or macrophage phenotype (CD 14, HLA-DR, HLA-DQ) within 48 hr <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> in the presence of T cells (CD 4 + T cells), but not in <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> pure monocytes. Chemiluminescence measurements revealed that phagocytic stimulation of monocytic superoxide release was impaired in PWM-stimulated <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> monocytes plus T cells, but not in PWM-stimulated <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> pure monocytes. Furthermore, PWM induced the secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in primary <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> T cells supplemented with 20 % of monocytes, whereas in subsequent secondary <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> these cells PWM induced IFN-gamma only when monocytes were added. We conclude from these flow cytometric and functional analyses that monocytes are efficiently eliminated from PWM-activated T-cell/monocyte cultures by CD 4 + T lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|Pyrite {{oxidation}} {{reaction was}} carried out using acidophilic microorganisms, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and Thiobacillus thiooxidans in pure and mixed <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> these bacteria. Bioleaching experiments {{in this study were}} carried out at 30 °C and different parameters such as pH, Fe (II) and Fe (III) concentration were studied. The results showed that mixed <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> T. ferrooxidans and T. thiooxidans enhanced the dissolution of Fe from pyrite, whereas T. thiooxidans alone did not oxidize pyrite. Amount of sulphuric acid produced in mixed <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> bacteria was higher than pure <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> each bacterium. Enhancement of Fe (III) ions was also observed with mixed <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> T. thiooxidans and T. ferrooxidans, while this did not occur in pure <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> T. ferrooxidans. The presence of iron (III) showed a negative effect on the bacterial iron oxidation rate. In the case <b>of</b> pure <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> T. ferrooxidans, pyrite was nearly completely oxidized to sulphate because of the capacity <b>of</b> this <b>culture</b> to oxidize both iron (II) ions and sulphuric compounds. Ferric ions competitively inhibited ferrous ion oxidation by the bacteria. Also it was observed that volatilization of Fe (II) from pyrite is highly pH-dependent...|$|R
40|$|Anterior {{pituitary}} cell <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> cows {{showed a}} cycle dependent sensitivity to GnRH. The smallest GnRH-inducable LH and FSH secretions were measured {{during the initial}} phase of the corpus luteum. During the blossom phase of the corpus luteum the GnRH-inducable LH and FSH secredons were greater. They increased further during the regression phase of the corpus luteum to reach maximal values in the proestrus stage. During the estrus the GnRH induced LH and FSH concentradons decreased again. The anterior pituitary cell <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> pregnant cows were, with one exception, not sensitive to GnRH. The cell <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> 5 out of 7 cows with ovarian cysts secreted only small quantities of LH and FSH following stimulation with GnRH, similarly to the anterior pituitary cell <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> the cows in the initial phase of corpus luteum. From the remaining two cows with ovarian cysts the cell <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> the one cow showed a marked LH and FSH secretion already at the smallest GnRH concentration, whereas the cell <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> the second cow showed a strong LH-, but a minimal FSH secretion. The ratio LH: FSH also changed during the estrus cycle. It was smallest in cell <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> anterior pituitaries obtained from cows of the corpus luteum regression phase and increased linearly. The greatest ratio LH: FSH was measured during the estrus phase of the cycle. Thereafter it declined again. In anterior pituitary cell <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> cows with ovarian cysts the ratio LH:FSH was twice that found in anterior pituitary cell <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> estrous cows...|$|R

In phosphate- and magnesium-limited <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> B. subtilis var. niger NCIB 8058. lysylphosphatidylglycerol was present in higher proportions at low pH (5. 1) than at neutral pH. With magnesium-limited <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> this strain harvested at pH 8. 0, lysylphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine were not detected. Phosphate-limited <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> B. subtilis NCIB 3610 contained no phosphatidylethanolamine or lysylphosphatidylglycerol at neutral pH, but at low pH (5. 1) both these lipids were present in substantial proportions.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of IgG and IgA {{was measured in}} the supernatants of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and of cells harvested from the intestinal lamina propria, which were cultured in vitro in {{the presence or absence of}} mitogens. The lamina propria mononuclear cells were harvested by collagenase digestion of macroscopically normal mucosa from 10 fresh surgical resections for carcinoma. Secretion <b>of</b> IgA in <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> unstimulated lamina propria mononuclear cells greatly exceeded that of IgG. The addition of pokeweed mitogen increased Ig secretion by <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> peripheral blood mononuclear cells but decreased Ig secretion by lamina propria mononuclear cells. The addition of concanavalin A suppressed Ig synthesis by pokeweed mitogen stimulated cells more in <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> peripheral blood mononuclear cells than in lamina propria mononuclear cells. Cycloheximide inhibited Ig secretion by more than 90 % in <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but there was less inhibition in <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> lamina propria mononuclear cells. In the four unstimulated <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> lamina propria mononuclear cells examined, over 75 % of the Ig was secreted in the first three to four days <b>of</b> <b>culture.</b> The results indicate that lamina propria mononuclear cells are refractory to the inductive and suppressive signals of mitogens, and represent an activated cell population which is committed to Ig secretion before being cultured...|$|R
