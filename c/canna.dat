5|$|In July 2006, a cull of {{invasive}} brown rats on the Scottish island of <b>Canna</b> was deemed a provisional success and {{after two years}} of observation, during which time no rats were observed, the island was declared officially rat free by the Environment Minister, Mike Russell on 7 June 2008. The rats had been outcompeting the rare local wood mouse, known as the <b>Canna</b> mouse and also endangering local seabird populations. The National Trust for Scotland which own the island invested £500,000 employing exterminators from New Zealand to cull the estimated 10,000 brown rats. in co-operation with RZSS, approximately 150 <b>Canna</b> mice were captured and homed at Edinburgh Zoo and the Highland Wildlife Park. 40 mice were returned to the island in late 2006 with the remaining being re-introduced in stages.|$|E

5|$|Óláfr's {{time in the}} Isles is {{confirmed}} by several Icelandic sources which recount how, in 1202, Guðmundr Arason attempted to sail from Iceland to Norway to become consecrated as the Bishop of Hólar. These saga accounts relate how the Icelanders encountered a severe storm and were blown far off course before being forced to make landfall in the Hebrides. The island they landed upon was almost certainly Sanday, a tiny tidal island linked to its larger neighbour <b>Canna,</b> the westernmost of the Small Isles. According to the saga the Icelanders were pressured numerous times to pay a landing-tax to a king named Óláfr. The king encountered by the Icelanders is considered to have been Óláfr, although {{at this point in}} history the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles is not known to have encompassed the Small Isles. One possibility is that Óláfr, like the Icelanders, may have been temporarily stranded on the tidal island, and that he may have taken advantage of the storm-stricken churchmen to offset the poverty that is assigned to him by the chronicle.|$|E
5|$|In Part II, {{after his}} mentor's defeat by Sasuke, Kabuto {{integrates}} some of Orochimaru's remains {{into his body}} to become powerful enough to not serve anyone again. Kabuto then masters snake Sage Justu while modifying his body with DNA samples of the Sound Five, Jugo, Suigetsu, and Karin to increase his abilities further. After perfecting the Reanimation Jutsu, using it to bring back Madara Uchiha as his personal trump card, Kabuto forces Obito Uchiha into a tenuous alliance with him under the promise that he can have Sasuke once they win {{the war against the}} Ninja Alliance. However, during {{the second day of the}} Fourth Great Ninja War, Itachi manages to break free of Kabuto's control and force him to end the Reanimation Jutsu with Sasuke's help. The ordeal of being subjected to Itachi's Izanami genjutsu has Kabuto re-evaluate himself of how to live his life, coming to the conclusion to save Sasuke's life. In the aftermath of the War, Kabuto returned to run the orphanage where he was held when he was a kid together with his adopted brother Urushi. In the Japanese anime, Kabuto is voiced by Nobutoshi <b>Canna,</b> and his English voice actor is Henry Dittman.|$|E

25|$|In 1266, the Treaty of Perth {{transferred}} Suðreyjar to the Scottish king, {{as a set}} of crown dependencies - {{rather than}} merging it into Scotland itself. Geographically, <b>Canna</b> lay within the portion of the former Suðreyjar which had become the MacRory realm of Garmoran (stretching from Uist to the Rough Bounds), but documents relating to Garmoran do treat <b>Canna</b> as part of it, suggesting the island was still under the Abbot's control. The Abbot of Iona thus ruled <b>Canna</b> with considerable power. Nevertheless, {{at the turn of the}} century, William I had created the position of Sheriff of Inverness, to be responsible for the Scottish highlands, which theoretically now extended to <b>Canna.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1641, {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} civil war, king Charles I promised to give <b>Canna</b> to the Baronet of Sleat, since the Earl of Argyll's treason (as one of the king's main opponents) would make <b>Canna</b> forfeit; the king's subsequent defeat made this promise moot. In 1654, the war having ended, the Earl of Argyll leased <b>Canna</b> back to Clan Ranald. In the following year, Donald MacDonald, {{the son of the}} Clan Ranald leader, married the Baronet's daughter, Janet, quelling any potential dispute over the island.|$|E
25|$|A large {{natural harbour}} is formed between <b>Canna</b> and Sanday. The pier on <b>Canna</b> {{and those of}} the other Small Isles, was rebuilt and {{enlarged}} in 2005. This is used by the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, MV Lochnevis, which links <b>Canna,</b> and the neighbouring Small Isles of Rùm, Eigg and Muck, to the mainland port of Mallaig (2½ hours away). Lochnevis is capable of carrying motor vehicles, although NTS permission is required to land them. The harbour is sheltered. It is the only deep harbour in the Small Isles, and is very popular with west coast yachting traffic out of Oban and Arisaig.|$|E
