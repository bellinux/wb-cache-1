The calculation of the structural fiscal balance is useful, since it provides {{a clear picture of}} the fiscal stance of the economy and it is essential {{in the context of a}} medium term fiscal framework. In order to ensure the robustness of the estimation, we employed two methodologies for the computation of the elasticities of various categories of government revenues and expenditures with respect to the output gap. The two approaches issued similar results, the overall average budget sensitivity being equal to 0. 285 and 0. 290, respectively. The amplitude of the <b>cyclical</b> <b>budget</b> balance is around 1 % of GDP.

After remarking that this trend is contradictory with the current economic institutions of Europe relying exclusively on automatic stabilisation for the conduct of fiscal policy, we argue that increasing flexibility, one alternative way to reduce cyclical fluctuations, does not seem a viable path. The paper concludes defending the appropriateness of discretionary fiscal policy. We argue by means of a simple model that the theoretical arguments against its use are not conclusive, and we describe a recent stream of literature, based on structural VAR models, that concludes rather robustly for the effectiveness of discretionary fiscal policy in the short and long run.

The main idea is to separate temporary (cyclical) effects on the budget from those caused by discretionary measures of fiscal authorities. In this paper, after reviewing the concept, its applications and various methodological approaches, the size of cyclically adjusted budget balance is estimated in the case of Croatia for the period 1995 : 1 q- 2008 : 3 q. Thereby, the ECB methodology is implemented and it is assumed that cyclically sensitive budget elements include income tax, profit tax, VAT, excise duties, social security contributions and unemployment benefits. The elasticities of cyclically sensitive budget components, with respect to their macroeconomic bases, are calculated with an error-correction model. The results of the exercise indicate that both periods of pro- and anticyclical fiscal policies have been present in the analyzed period with the restrictive and procyclical policy prevailing in the recent years. fiscal policy, government <b>budget,</b> <b>cyclical</b> adjustment, Croatia...|$|R

This paper estimates tax elasticities for the three major South African taxes, which will contribute to improved estimates of the cyclicality of tax revenues and the Cyclically Adjusted Budget Balance (CABB). After testing for the number of co-integrating relationships, single equation regression methods are employed to estimate the respective long run tax elasticities.

Although the Stability Pact implicitly {{accepts the}} need {{to distinguish between the}} structural and the cyclical component of net deficits, the issue of long-term sustainability is only covered by the need not to exceed a certain threshold value of the net lending. While the OECD and the European Commission (EU) assume constant elasticities when calculating <b>cyclical</b> <b>budget</b> components to derive structural deficits from the net deficits, the present paper choses time series technique to extract the structural balances directly. = Structural balances are calculated on a disaggregated level considering five different government receipts and expenditure components. With the same method, structural primary balances are estimated to analyse long-term sustainability of fiscal policy in the EU. Therefore, we set the structural primary surpluses against those primary balances, necessary to stabilise the debt to GDP ratio. It is shown that in some of the so-called core-countries like Germany and France, structural surpluses are still below those required to stabilize the debt ratio. ...|$|E
40|$|The article assesses to {{what extent}} various {{components}} of government budgets affected by the macroeconomic situation operate (through influencing domestic demand) to smooth the business cycle 1 in Germany. The {{aim of the research}} is to evaluate government budget sensitivity to economic fluctuations and thereby assess the importance of automatic fiscal stabilisers. Fiscal policies and the analysis of fiscal stabilisers {{have been added to the}} agenda due to the fact that the EMU member countries no longer have national monetary policies at their disposal and therefore fiscal policy has to play a more important role in smoothing shocks, especially if they originate on the demand side. However, in order to avoid the typical pitfalls of fiscal finetuning, the main focus has increasingly been put on the work of automatic stabilisers. This view is codified in the Stability and Growth Pact, whose “fiscal philosophy” implies that countries should set a structural target of close to balance or surplus and simply let automatic stabilisers work, where appropriate, over the whole business cycle without breaching the 3 % reference value for the deficit. To determine the size of budgetary cyclical components, i. e. the size of automatic fiscal stabilisers and the structural balance, the standard two-step procedure (also followed by the OECD, the IMF and the European Commission) was used. The first stage of this method is to measure the GDP gap, which is needed for both, estimating budget sensitivity and extracting a <b>budget</b> <b>cyclical</b> component. In line with the method of the European Commission, the estimate of the GDP gap is based upon a statistical smoothing technique (the Hodrick-Prescott filter). The Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP-filter) has been selected on the basis of pragmatic criteria such as simplicity and transparency. The second stage is to identify the cyclical sensitivity of all budget components (on the revenue and expenditure side 2) - their sensitivity to the GDP gap. Finally, <b>budget’s</b> <b>cyclical</b> component and structural balance are both calculated on the basis of sensitivity estimates and the GDP gap. It is well known that the automatic fiscal stabilisers generally reduced cyclical volatility in the 1990 s, although they were growing weak, while discretionary fiscal policy became more active. However, in Germany the need to undertake fiscal consolidation in order to improve public finances forced governments to take discretionary actions that in effect reduced, or even offset, the effect of automatic fiscal stabilisers. Based on data from 1980 until 1998 and using the two-step method, the cyclical sensitivity of the German budget was found to be only 0, 35. This means that when the GDP diverges from its potential value by 1 %, the budget balance will change accordingly by up to 0, 35 % of the GDP...|$|R
40|$|Government {{balances}} {{are often}} adjusted {{for changes in}} economic activity in order to draw {{a clearer picture of}} the underlying fiscal situation and to use this as a guide to fiscal policy analysis. International organisations estimate the cyclical component of economic activity by the current level of the output gap. Using elasticities of tax and public expenditures to GDP, they compute the <b>cyclical</b> part of <b>budget</b> balance. The structural budget balance is defined as the remainder. Our approach is different, as it rests on the estimation of a bivariate VAR. Variables used are the budget balance in percents of GDP, and the annual rate of growth of GDP. The structural part of the budget balance is defined as the one which would have occurred had GDP never deviated from its trend. Hence, past business cycles affect the cyclical part of the budget balance, contrary to what more traditional methods assume. In our method, systematic cyclical policies de facto affect the cyclical balance. Our estimated changes in structural balances are consistent with previous methods, given the fairly large standard errors. However, these methods yield significantly different predictions at the peaks and troughs of business cycles : according to our method, structural balances consolidated by more in 1990 - 1991 and deteriorated by more in 1994 - 1995. fiscal policy, VAR, cycles, structural budget balance...|$|R

The paper also investigates whether the monetary authorities in Bangladesh adopted a strategy of ‘real exchange rate targeting’ to achieve a real objective such as export promotion. Empirical results suggest that the real effective exchange rate of the taka forms a cointegration relationship with fundamental determinants, such as the external terms of trade, trade openness, current account balances, external debt, investment, seigniorage and the government’s current expenditures. Empirical results also suggest that, except for the period 1998 - 2004, there was no significant real exchange rate misalignment in Bangladesh since it started trade reforms in the mid- 1980 s. The results of bivariate Granger causality testing suggest that the real exchange rate misalignment was causally linked to the <b>cyclical</b> component of <b>budget</b> deficits, excess money supply and the cyclical component of real output.

40|$|The {{decision}} on EMU strongly affects {{the course of}} monetary and fiscal policies in 1997 and especially in 1998. We assume that the monetary union will start in January 1, 1999 with a sizable number of participating countries. Once the {{decision on}} the members {{is made in the}} spring of 1998, any differences between short-term interest rates in the participating countries can be eliminated. Currently, money market rates in Italy, in Spain and in Portugal are substantially higher than, for example, in Germany. These high rates will be reduced quickly. Monetary policy will thus become more expansionary not only in these countries but also in Western Europe as a whole. It is not likely that the central banks in countries with relatively low interest rates will tighten their policy because such moves would be resisted {{in the light of the}} severe unemployment in Europe. While fiscal policy is concerned with reducing budget deficits this year in order to qualify for EMU, the course will change in 1998. Governments can afford to loosen this policy stance because the actual deficits in 1998 are not decisive for the entry into the monetary union. Also, the stability pact will become effective only from 1999 onwards, so there will not be any sanctions even if budget deficits are excessive in 1998. Therefore, further substantial cuts in expenditures or increases in revenues are not likely. In a few countries, even tax cuts were announced for 1998, for example, in France and in Germany. In summary, fiscal policy will have an expansionary effect on economic activity in 1998. The upswing in Western Europe will continue in 1997 and in 1998. Export conditions are favorable since the world economy will expand at a healthy pace. The increase in internal demand will accelerate because of the impulses from economic policy. In practically all countries, capacity utilization will reach or even surpass its normal level in the course of next year. As central banks will be expansionary in the fourth consecutive year, the phase of disinflation in Europe is coming to an end. Inflation will go up somewhat in 1998 and more so in the following year. Because of the deteriorating outlook for inflation, European currencies will further devalue against the US dollar and long-term interest rates will increase considerably. All these developments are a burden for the start of EMU. The future European Central Bank will have to follow a restrictive course if it wants to demonstrate its commitment to price level stability.. The Dublin resolution for a "stability pact" is intended to limit budget deficits after EMU will have started. However, the agreement is not sufficient to reach this target for several reasons: First, the governments themselves will decide on sanctions; this raises the possibility that political factors play a major role and that opportunistic behavior will dominate. Second, the sanction mechanism has no bite because too much time goes by until sanctions are implemented. Furthermore, in order to avoid the payment of a fine it is sufficient to reduce the budget deficit to a level of 3 percent of GDP once in five years. A strict sanction mechanism is probably objected by several governments because they fear that it would prevent the automatic stabilizers from working appropriately, so that, e. g., fiscal policy would have to be restrictive in a recession. However, this fear is not warranted because the <b>cyclical</b> <b>budget</b> deficits in all EU countries have not been veiy large during the last fifteen years. In order to avoid excessive deficits in the future, it would be necessary to reduce the structural deficits considerably, in some cases even to zero. This is an ambitious target, but it is precisely what was decided upon in Dublin. So far, however, this is merely a promise because in practically no major country efforts are made to balance the budget by 1999 — a fact which reduces the credibility of the Dublin resolution even more.

The federal government share of wastewater infrastructure spending has shrunk from 78 percent in 1978 to just 3 percent today. In the last four years alone, combined funding for the four largest federal programs that sup-port water and wastewater infrastructure has declined more than 17 percent, not adjusted for infl ation. Steep increases in project costs during the same period have magnifi ed the effect of the funding cuts. For small, rural water and sewer systems, these challenges are exacerbated by diseconomies of scale that result in higher user rates, per capita construction costs, and staff turnover than their urban and suburban counterparts.
