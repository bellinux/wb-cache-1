5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry <b>chemical</b> <b>class</b> D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E

25|$|An {{advantage}} of this method {{is that it is}} fast (5–20 minutes per sample); a disadvantage is that the solute's chemical structure must be known beforehand. Moreover, since the value of log P is determined by linear regression, several compounds with similar structures must have known log P values, and extrapolation from one <b>chemical</b> <b>class</b> to another—applying a regression equation derived from one <b>chemical</b> <b>class</b> to a second one—may not be reliable, since each chemical classes will have its characteristic regression parameters.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{ladies and}} gentlemen, I {{turn to the}} report of this Institution, on whose behalf we are met; and I start with the {{education}} given there, and I find {{that it really is}} an education that is deserving of the name. I find that there are papers read and lectures delivered, on a variety of subjects of interest and importance. I find that there are evening classes formed for the acquisition of sound, useful English information, and for the study of those two important languages, daily becoming more important in the business of life,--the French and German. I find that there is a class for drawing, a <b>chemical</b> <b>class,</b> subdivided into the elementary branch and the manufacturing branch, most important here. I find that there is a day-school at twelve shillings a quarter, which small cost, besides including instruction in all that is useful to the merchant and the man of business, admits to all the advantages of the parent institution. I find that there is a School of Design established in connexion with the Government School; and that there was in January this year, a library of between six and seven thousand books. Ladies and gentlemen, if any man would tell me that anything but good could come of such knowledge as this, all I can say is, that I should consider him a new and most lamentable proof of the necessity of such institutions, and should regard him in his own person as a melancholy instance of what a man may come to by never having belonged to one or sympathized with one.|$|E
