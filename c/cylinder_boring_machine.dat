50|$|Once glazing or carbon {{build up}} has occurred, {{it can only}} be cured by {{stripping}} down the engine and re-boring the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bores,</b> <b>machining</b> new honing marks and stripping, cleaning and de-coking combustion chambers, fuel injector nozzles and valves. If the problem is detected in its early stages, running an engine at maximum load to raise the internal pressures and temperatures allows the piston rings to scrape glaze off the bores and allows carbon build-up to be burnt off. However, if glazing has been allowed to progress to the stage where the piston rings have seized into their grooves, this will not have any effect.|$|R
50|$|Historians {{of machine}} tools often {{focus on a}} handful of major {{industries}} that most spurred machine tool development. In order of historical emergence, they have been firearms (small arms and artillery); clocks; textile machinery; steam engines (stationary, marine, rail, and otherwise) (the story of how Watt's need for an accurate <b>cylinder</b> spurred Boulton's <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> is discussed by Roe); sewing machines; bicycles; automobiles; and aircraft. Others could be included in this list as well, but they tend to be connected with the root causes already listed. For example, rolling-element bearings are an industry of themselves, but this industry's main drivers of development were the vehicles already listed—trains, bicycles, automobiles, and aircraft; and other industries, such as tractors, farm implements, and tanks, borrowed heavily from those same parent industries.|$|R
50|$|In practice, the uniflow engine has {{a number}} of {{operational}} shortcomings. The large expansion ratio requires a large cylinder volume. To gain the maximum potential work from the engine a high reciprocation rate is required, typically 80% faster than a double-acting counterflow type engine. This causes the opening times of the inlet valves to be very short, putting great strain on a delicate mechanical part. In order to withstand the huge mechanical forces encountered, engines have to be heavily built and a large flywheel is required to smooth out the variations in torque as the steam pressure rapidly rises and falls in the cylinder. Because there is a thermal gradient across the cylinder, the metal of the wall expands to different extents. This requires the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> to be <b>machined</b> wider in the cool center than at the hot ends. If the cylinder is not heated correctly, or if water enters, the delicate balance can be upset causing seizure mid-stroke or, potentially, destruction.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates a new {{sealing system}} for sliding {{applications}} in pneumatic cylinders based on non-contact sealing. By “reverse ” assembling the common lip seal, {{the back of}} the seal is exposed to the supply pressure and the lip is turned towards the pressure discharge side. When exposed to sealing pressure the lip yields, resulting in reduced effective surface area with consequent less friction and wear, providing an air leakage path the flow rate of which depends on the radial stiffness of the seal. The aim of this work is to develop a methodology for evaluating the performance of a non-conventional seal system design (air lubricated seal). A spring-energised commercial seal fitted to a piston has been tested to measure the air flow rate through it. More specifically, to evaluate the extent of the influence of <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> diameter and <b>machining</b> tolerance. Preliminary results are presented and discussed. A major factor was to avoid, or at least reduce, frictional problems by using a non-conventional common lip seal assembly solution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Ring and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> wear {{may not be}} {{a problem}} in most current {{automotive}} engines. However, a small change in ring face and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> diameter can significantly affect the lubrication characteristics and ring axial motion. This in turn can cause to change inter-ring pressure, blow-by and oil consumption in an engine. Therefore, by predicting the wear of piston ring face and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> altogether, the changed ring end gap and the changed volume of gas reservoir can be calculated. Then the excessive oil consumption can be predicted. Here, the oil amount through top ring gap into combustion chamber is estimated as engine oil consumption. Furthermore, the wear theories of ring and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> are included. The changed oil consumption caused by the new end gap and the new volume of oil reservoir around second land, can be calculated at some engine running interval. Meanwhile, the wear amount and oil consumption occurred during engine durability cycle are compared with the calculated values. The wear data of rings and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> are obtained from three engines after engine durability test. The calculated wear data of each part are turn out to be around the band of averaged test values or a little below. It is shown that the important factor regarding oi...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} the study is to measure the maximum static {{friction}} and dynamic friction in the actuation process of pneumatic cylinder after TiO 2 nanoparticles are added to grease. The study makes an innovative design of a new measuring equipment of friction force, which can measure the friction force between the piston seal in pneumatic cylinder and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore.</b> The friction force of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> directly affects the output dynamic property of pneumatic cylinder motion. Friction force measuring system can measure the change of friction force of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> under the condition with different operating speeds, and can analyze the relationship between friction force of pneumatic cylinder and output dynamic property of pneumatic cylinder. Such a friction force measuring equipment takes pneumatic cylinder as an output of motive force to drive the measurement of pneumatic cylinder, and uses load cell and draw-line encoder to measure the friction force of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> and the motion speed. In the experiment, the friction forces of pneumatic cylinder given with oil and without oil are measured respectively, achieving the friction force property of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> when being lubricated by nanogrease added with nanoparticles of different weight percentages (wt. %).
