The {{inclusion of a}} data erasure tool allows users to delete files while minimizing the chance of recovery. Web Cleanup removes browser cache files, history, and <b>cookies.</b> <b>To</b> maintain dial-up connections, Connection Keep Alive simulates online activity during periods of user inactivity. Norton Productivity Control enables users to filter Internet content and block newsgroups. When used with the User Access Manager, multiple filtering profiles can be created, assigned to different users.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Robert California (James Spader) reveals he hates Nellie Bertram's (Catherine Tate) business plan and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) swings into action to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from getting fired. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) learns that Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is not going to return to Scranton. Also, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) compete to sell <b>cookies</b> <b>to</b> Kevin (Brian Baumgartner).|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Eugene and Jonathan Coachman. The match started with Eugene hitting an arm drag on Coachman and hitting {{numerous}} headbutts. An unknown {{woman in a}} bikini {{came out to the}} ringside area with some cookies, Coachman offered <b>cookies</b> <b>to</b> Eugene. The woman lured Eugene out of the ring and Eugene went over and grabbed some cookies. As Eugene went to grab more cookies, Coachman slammed Eugene's head into the cookie tray. A spot in the match saw Garrison Cade come out to ringside with a stuffed animal, which prompted Cade to tear up said toy animal. Cade tried to hold Eugene so Coachman could get the advantage, however, Eugene was able dodge the attack, as Coachman ended up hitting Cade instead. Eugene Rock bottomed Coachman and pinned him for the win.|$|E

25|$|Girl Scouts sell <b>cookies</b> <b>to</b> relatives, friends, neighbors, {{and others}} in their town or city. In recent years, because of safety concerns, an {{increased}} emphasis {{has been placed on}} cookie booths, where girls sell from tables in public areas under the supervision of adult troop leaders, rather than door-to-door. Many councils offer the option for customers to sponsor boxes of <b>cookies</b> <b>to</b> be sent to U.S. servicemen and women. Cookies are also available online.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, the National Council {{limited the}} {{bakeries}} providing <b>cookies</b> <b>to</b> just ABC Bakers (a division of Interbake Foods) and Little Brownie Bakers (a {{division of the}} Keebler Company). In 1998, cookie sale awards were instituted.|$|E
25|$|Another cross-site {{vulnerability}} is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser {{into taking}} actions the user didn't intend at a target site (like transferring {{money at a}} bank). It works because, if the target site relies only on <b>cookies</b> <b>to</b> authenticate requests, then requests initiated by code on the attacker's site will carry the same legitimate login credentials as requests initiated by the user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and {{not only in the}} <b>cookies,</b> <b>to</b> authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.|$|E

25|$|Besides content filtering, other {{imperfect}} {{methods for}} cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One {{example is the}} use of additional security controls when handling cookie-based user authentication. Many web applications rely on session cookies for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these <b>cookies.</b> <b>To</b> mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie session <b>cookies</b> <b>to</b> the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that IP to use that cookie. This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after the cookie), but obviously breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same NATed IP address or web proxy as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her mobile IP.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Girl Scouts {{moved to}} {{eliminate}} trans fat from their <b>cookies</b> <b>to</b> be healthier, and started providing nutritional {{information on the}} cookie box.

Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time. In 2003, Willis visited Iraq {{as part of the}} USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq war, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered $1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally.
