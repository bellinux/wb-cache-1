25|$|TeX is {{an example}} of a <b>computer</b> <b>typesetting</b> system that makes use of {{ligatures}} automatically. The Computer Modern Roman typeface provided with TeX includes the five common ligatures ff, fi, fl, ffi, and ffl. When TeX finds these combinations in a text, it substitutes the appropriate ligature, unless overridden by the typesetter. Opinion is divided over whether it is the job of writers or typesetters to decide where to use ligatures.|$|E

In the process he also popularized the asymptotic notation. In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science, Knuth is the creator of the TeX <b>computer</b> <b>typesetting</b> system, the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, and the Computer Modern family of typefaces.|$|E
2500|$|For years, book {{printing}} {{was considered}} a true art form. Typesetting, or {{the placement of the}} characters on the page, including the use of ligatures, was passed down from master to apprentice. In Germany, the art of typesetting was termed the [...] "black art", in allusion to the ink-covered printers. It has largely been replaced by <b>computer</b> <b>typesetting</b> programs, which make it easy to get similar results more quickly and with less physical labor. Some practitioners continue to print books the way Gutenberg did. For example, there is a yearly convention of traditional book printers in Mainz, Germany.|$|E

2500|$|Ligatures {{have grown}} in {{popularity}} over the last 20 years due to an increasing interest in creating typesetting systems that evoke arcane designs and classical scripts. One of the first <b>computer</b> <b>typesetting</b> programs {{to take advantage of}} computer-driven typesetting (and later laser printers) was Donald Knuth's TeX program. Now the standard method of mathematical typesetting, its default fonts are explicitly based on nineteenth-century styles. Many new fonts feature extensive ligature sets; these include FF Scala, Seria and others by Martin Majoor and Hoefler Text by Jonathan Hoefler. Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko contains a particularly large set to allow designers to create dramatic display text with a feel of antiquity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{linotype}} machine ( [...] ) is a [...] "line casting" [...] machine used in printing {{sold by the}} Mergenthaler Linotype Company and related companies. It was a hot metal typesetting system that cast blocks of metal type for individual uses. Linotype {{became one of the}} mainstay methods to set type, especially small-size body text, for newspapers, magazines and posters from the late 19thcentury to the 1970s and 1980s, when it was largely replaced by phototypesetting, offset lithography printing and <b>computer</b> <b>typesetting.</b> The name of the machine {{comes from the fact that}} it produces an entire line of metal type at once, hence a line-o'-type, a significant improvement over the previous industry standard, i.e.,manual, letter-by-letter typesetting using a composing stick and drawers of letters.|$|E
2500|$|Alumni {{have participated}} in {{scientific}} research. Some have concentrated their studies on the very small universe of atoms and molecules. Nobel laureate Carl D. Anderson (BS 1927, PhD 1930) proved the existence of positrons and muons, Nobel laureate Edwin McMillan (BS 1928, MS 1929) synthesized the first transuranium element, Nobel laureate Leo James Rainwater (BS 1939) investigated the non-spherical shapes of atomic nuclei, and Nobel laureate Douglas D. Osheroff (BS 1967) studied the superfluid nature of helium-3. Donald Knuth (PhD 1963), the [...] "father" [...] of the analysis of algorithms, wrote The Art of Computer Programming and created the TeX <b>computer</b> <b>typesetting</b> system, which is commonly used in the scientific community. Narendra Karmarkar (MS 1979) is known for the interior point method, a polynomial algorithm for linear programming known as Karmarkar's algorithm.|$|E

50|$|By late 1992, the {{new draft}} of Li Fanwen's Tangut-Chinese {{dictionary}} was almost complete, {{but he was}} not satisfied with the system of phonetic reconstruction that he was using, so after the Taiwan Tangutologist Gong Hwang cherng came to see him, he decided to use Professor Gong's system of phonetic reconstruction instead. The dictionary was now complete, but technical and financial issues delayed its publication until 1997. Originally, Li Fanwen had hoped to <b>computer</b> <b>typeset</b> the Tangut text, but eventually he had to abandon this plan, and the Tangut text in the 1997 edition was laboriously inserted using photocomposition. The dictionary comprised exactly 6,000 Tangut characters, and these 6,000 characters were later used as the source for the Mojikyo set of Tangut characters, which have since been widely used by Tangutologists for typesetting Tangut text. In 2002, the dictionary won the Wu Yuzhang Prize for Humanities and Social Sciences.|$|R
50|$|<b>Computers</b> and <b>Typesetting</b> is a 5-volume set {{of books}} by Donald Knuth {{published}} in 1986 describing the TeX and Metafont systems for digital typography. Knuth's <b>computers</b> and <b>typesetting</b> project {{was the result}} of his frustration with the lack of decent software for the typesetting of mathematical and technical documents. The results of this project include TeX for typesetting, Metafont for font construction and the Computer Modern typefaces that are the default fonts used by TeX. In the series of five books Knuth not only describes the TeX and Metafont languages (volumes A and C), he also describes and documents the source code (in the WEB programming language) of the TeX and Metafont interpreters (volumes B and D), and the source code for the Computer Modern fonts used by TeX (volume E). The book set stands as a tour de force demonstration of literate programming.|$|R

50|$|The first {{published}} literate programming environment was WEB, introduced by Donald Knuth in 1981 for his TeX typesetting system; it uses Pascal as its underlying programming language and TeX for typesetting of the documentation. The complete commented TeX source code {{was published in}} Knuth's TeX: The program, volume B of his 5-volume <b>Computers</b> and <b>Typesetting.</b> Knuth had privately used a literate programming system called DOC as early as 1979. He {{was inspired by the}} ideas of Pierre-Arnoul de Marneffe. The free CWEB, written by Knuth and Silvio Levy, is WEB adapted for C and C++, runs on most operating systems and can produce TeX and PDF documentation.|$|R
50|$|The {{first edition}} of the dictionary, in 1979, with Patrick Hanks as editor and Lawrence Urdang as {{editorial}} director, was the first British dictionary to use the full power of <b>computer</b> databases and <b>typesetting</b> in its preparation. This meant that, for instance, subject editors could control separate definitions of the same word and the results could be blended into the result, rather than one editor being responsible for a word.|$|R

40|$|Offsetting Queer Literary Labor” {{asks how}} LGBTQ+ people and other feminists navigated late twentieth-century changes in print {{technology}} in the period from roughly 1965 - 1990, a period during which typesetting was first computerized and then all but abandoned {{as part of the}} pre-print process. I do this by way of an encounter with the writings of Marxist-feminist poet Karen Brodine. The labor relations that surround the <b>typesetting</b> <b>computer</b> are {{part and parcel of the}} revolutionary working-class and queer socialist feminism that Brodine elaborates across her writing and that she worked for tirelessly in her life. Through a reading of her poetry, journals, and political activities, I argue that late-twentieth century US gender and sexual categories, as well as novel forms of queer intimacy, were forged through the material relations of print-related wage work. Rather than claiming to queer these texts or this history, this article argues that the concrete forms of feminized labor that attend literary technologies have been and continue to be the basis for the category of “LGBT literature. ...|$|R
