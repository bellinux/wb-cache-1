50|$|The owner-driver's needs seem to {{have been}} {{considered}} very carefully and all but one of them met, that is the difficulty in draining engine oil which requires the removal of an undershield. A minor point was that the rear tappet plate was made difficult to remove by having <b>carburettor</b> <b>control</b> springs anchored on it. A few drops of oil {{two or three times a}} week and tappets will run for a long time without shake otherwise they soon become noisy.|$|E
5000|$|TKM 4-Stroke Junior: Runs on a 4-stroke 200cc engine with a {{restrictor}} on the <b>carburettor</b> to <b>control</b> speeds.|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that the}} float valve of a <b>carburettor</b> (<b>controlling</b> {{the fuel level}} within the carburettor) is not a needle valve, {{although}} it is commonly described as one. It uses a bluntly conical needle, but it seats against a square-edged seat rather than a matching cone. The intention here is to obtain a well-defined seat between two narrow mating surfaces, giving firm shutoff of the flow from only a light float pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Power: The {{engine is}} a {{controlled}} 5.0L V8 (R302ci for the Ford Falcon and 304ci for the Holden Commodore). Most {{parts of the}} engine are controlled and unlike the Australian Touring Cars (Supercars Championship) which uses fuel injection, the series uses a <b>controlled</b> <b>carburettor.</b> The other <b>control</b> parts for the engine are manifolds, exhausts, cam-shafts, rockers, air-filter/cold air box and ignition. The engines are rev-limited to 6400rpm. Top speed is 240 km/h.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} the use of {{negative}} feedback control is the ballcock control of water level (see diagram). In modern engineering, negative feedback loops are found in fuel injection systems and <b>carburettors.</b> Similar <b>control</b> mechanisms are used in heating and cooling systems, such as those involving air conditioners, refrigerators, or freezers.|$|R
50|$|Throttle valves in the updraft <b>carburettor</b> throat were <b>controlled</b> by an {{automatic}} boost control through the throttle linkage {{to maintain the}} selected manifold pressure with changes in altitude. The valves were only partially open during ground and low-level operation to prevent overboosting of the engine. As air density decreases with increased altitude, the throttle valves were progressively opened {{in response to the}} reducing atmospheric pressure. This system provided full power within engine boost limitations up to the critical altitude of 26000 ft.|$|R
5000|$|The first Motorwagen {{used the}} Benz 954 cc single-cylinder {{four-stroke}} engine with trembler coil ignition. This new engine produced [...] at 250 rpm in the Patent-Motorwagen, although later tests by the University of Mannheim {{showed it to}} be capable of [...] at 400 rpm. It was an extremely light engine for the time, weighing about 100 kg. Although its open crankcase and drip oiling system would be alien to a modern mechanic, its use of a pushrod-operated poppet valve for exhaust would be quite familiar. A large horizontal flywheel stabilized the single-cylinder engine's power output. An evaporative <b>carburettor</b> was <b>controlled</b> by a sleeve valve to regulate power and engine speed. The first model of the Motorwagen had not been built with a carburetor, rather a basin of fuel soaked fibers that supplied fuel to the cylinder by evaporation.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 the Pampa {{received}} {{another new}} front, {{identical to the}} Del Rey which had been discontinued in 1991. In 1994, it received an electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>carburettor</b> (2E CE) in the 1.8 L versions, following the alterations to the VW AP-1800 unit. In 1995 the Ghia and 1.6 L GL 4x4 were discontinued, leaving the 1.6 and 1.8 litre L, 1.8 litre GL and 1.8 litre S. For the 1997 model year, the 1.8 L engines were equipped with single point electronic injection. By the end of production in 1997, in excess of 350,000 units had been sold. The replacement, the Ford Courier, never achieved the same sales success.|$|R
50|$|The {{model was}} revised in June 1985, {{identifiable}} by the slightly larger rear lamp clusters. The Japanese market saw {{the debut of}} the first Micra Turbo/MA10ET, where Nissan grafted a turbocharger to the small 1.0 L engine. This version was never sold in Europe, where the only engines ever available were the 1.0 and 1.2 units. The 1.2, with the larger MA12 1.2 L engine with an electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>carburettor</b> with , arrived in late 1987. A non-catalyzed version produced 60 PS. Another facelift came in March 1989, which consisted of some minor upgrades such as deeper bumpers, a new front grille, minor interior details, and headlight changes. This was also when the five-door hatchback version was introduced in Europe.|$|R
25|$|The first version, the Gladiator Mk I, was {{delivered}} from July 1936, becoming operational in January 1937. The Mk II soon followed, the main differences being {{a slightly more}} powerful Mercury VIIIAS engine with Hobson mixture control boxes and a partly automatic boost <b>control</b> <b>carburettor,</b> driving a Fairey fixed-pitch three-blade metal propeller, instead of the two-blade wooden one of the Mark I. All MK II Gladiators also carried Browning 0.303-inch machine guns (licence-manufactured by the BSA company in Birmingham) {{in place of the}} Vickers-Lewis combination of the MK I. A modified Mk II, the Sea Gladiator, was developed for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), with an arrestor hook, catapult attachment points, a strengthened airframe and an underbelly fairing for a dinghy lifeboat, all for operations aboard aircraft carriers. Of the 98 aircraft built as, or converted to, Sea Gladiators, 54 were still in service by the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|The {{beauty of}} the SU lies in its {{simplicity}} and lack of multiple jets and ease of adjustment. Adjustment is accomplished by altering the starting position of the jet relative to the needle on a fine screw (26TPI for most pre-HIF versions). At first sight, the principle appears to bear a similarity {{to that of the}} slide carburettor, which was previously used on many motorcycles. The slide carburettor has the same piston and main needle as an SU carburettor, however the piston/needle position is directly actuated by a physical connection to the throttle cable rather than indirectly by venturi airflow as with an SU carburettor. This piston actuation difference is the significant distinction between a slide and an SU carburettor. The piston in a slide <b>carburettor</b> is <b>controlled</b> by the operator's demands rather than the demands of the engine. This means that the metering of the fuel can be inaccurate unless the vehicle is travelling at a constant speed at a constant throttle setting - conditions rarely encountered except on motorways. This inaccuracy results in fuel waste, particularly as the carburettor must be set slightly rich to avoid a lean condition (which can cause engine damage). For this reason Japanese motorcycle manufacturers ceased to fit slide carbs and substituted constant-depression carbs, which are essentially miniature SUs. It is also possible - indeed, easy - to retrofit an SU carburettor to a bike that was originally manufactured with a slide carburettor, and obtain improved fuel economy and more tractable low-speed behaviour.|$|R
500|$|The use of {{carburettors}} {{was calculated}} {{to give a}} higher specific power output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems. However, the Merlin's float <b>controlled</b> <b>carburettor</b> meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary Bf 109E, which had direct fuel injection, could [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been {{forced out of the}} carburettor's float chamber by the effects of negative g-force (g). RAF fighter pilots soon learned to [...] "half-roll" [...] their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents. [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a restrictor in the fuel supply line to restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in the float chamber to contain fuel under negative G, went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet {{from the bottom of the}} S.U. carburettor to exactly halfway up the side, which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g.|$|R
5000|$|From 1960, Velocette {{produced}} the Venom (and the Viper) in a Clubman racing version, fitted with TT Amal <b>carburettors,</b> a manually <b>controlled</b> BTH racing magneto (in {{place of the}} Lucas unit) and a close-ratio gearbox, with the compression ratio raised to 9.3 to 1. The Venom Clubman dispensed with the glass fibre enclosure and instead made a feature of highly polished crankcase and gearbox castings. Supplied with [...] "rearset" [...] controls, lowered handlebars and a steering damper, the Clubman also had a range of optional accessories including a [...] "megaphone" [...] exhaust silencer, a rev counter and light alloy wheel rims. Although they could be difficult to start - an entire section in the owners handbook was dedicated to starting technique - experienced Clubman riders found them easy to maintain and fast, as the Venom Clubman could achieve over 100 mph. In 1966 the Venom was upgraded to the Mk II, which had the Thruxton front forks fitted with rubber gaiters, a twin leading shoe front brake and narrowed mudguards, combined with a new exhaust design giving it a more modern sports motorcycle look.|$|R
