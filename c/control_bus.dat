It includes volume knobs for each voice, numerous audio outputs, and a DIN sync port (a precursor to MIDI) to synchronize with other devices through the Digital <b>Control</b> <b>Bus</b> interface, which was considered groundbreaking. The machine has three trigger outputs, which can be used to synchronize with synthesizers and other equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{business}} loop {{follows the}} former routing of US12. This routing was first designated as M-14 in 1956 when US12 {{was moved to}} a freeway bypass {{to the south of}} town. I-94 was first designated by the middle of 1960 along the US12 freeway, and a new BL I-94 designation was created {{by the middle of the}} next year. BL I-94 followed M-14 from the Jackson Road interchange to Main Street along Jackson Road and Huron Street. At Main Street, BL I-94 turned along US23 on Huron Street, Washtenaw Avenue and Carpenter Road back to I-94/US12. The US23 freeway was finished on November 2, 1962. BL I-94 was rerouted on the east end to follow the new US23 freeway, returning the Carpenter Road alignment to local <b>control.</b> <b>Bus.</b> US23 replaced US23 along Huron Street and Washtenaw Avenue in the city of Ann Arbor at this time. A new M-14 freeway opened on November 16, 1965, removing the M-14 concurrency from the routing.|$|E

30|$|The {{following}} algorithm’s {{objective is}} to define a set of strongly coupled busses, B, while minimizing voltage estimation errors at the <b>controlled</b> <b>bus,</b> b∈ B, of a local controller. For {{the purpose of this}} study we assume that each controllable device in the smart grid has a local controller at its bus, which we designate as its <b>controlled</b> <b>bus.</b> The size of B is constrained such that both the communication and computation burdens at the local controller are reduced. This is achieved through observation of both the sensitivity matrix and forecast shifts in power and is based on ϵ decomposition (see [31] for an example of ϵ decomposition).|$|R
500|$|In addition, {{the model}} name [...] "VAT" [...] {{was used for}} two rear-engined bus models: the VAT-4800of which two units were {{produced}} in 1956, and the VAT-5200BDof which ten units were produced in 1957. The next change came in 1961, when an engine manufacturer's code {{was included in the}} model name. For example, the VAK lorry powered by an AEC AVU 470 became the A-47. Correspondingly, the same lorry with a Leyland O.600 diesel became the A-60R; the R stood for raskas (heavy), meaning it had a stronger front axle. The bus model names changed again in the same manner. For example, a forward <b>control</b> <b>bus</b> with the Leyland O.600 engine was called the VLB-60.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a newly developed algorithm for power flow solution {{based on a}} complex admittance matrix. The conciseness and close-to-reality iterative procedure make the method extremely attractive for self-made software implementation. The complex algorithm approach enables network connections, loads, generators, <b>controlled</b> <b>bus</b> voltages, including slack bus, {{to be considered in}} a single complex matrix. The power flow solution is achieved with iterations in complex form without the need of real/imaginary decomposition. The method has shown to have advantages over other traditional and available methods in terms of accuracy and convergence also in highly ill-conditioned cases. The cpu-time is comparable and sometimes competitive with those derived from Newton-Raphson methods...|$|R
