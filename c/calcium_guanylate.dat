50|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>guanylate</b> is a {{compound}} with formula Ca(C10H12O4N5PO4). It is the calcium salt of guanylic acid.|$|E
50|$|Guanosine monophosphate in {{the form}} of its salts, such as {{disodium}} guanylate (E627), dipotassium guanylate (E628) and <b>calcium</b> <b>guanylate</b> (E629), are food additives used as flavor enhancers to provide the umami taste. It is often used in synergy with disodium inosinate; the combination is known as disodium 5'-ribonucleotides. Disodium guanylate is often found in instant noodles, potato chips and snacks, savoury rice, tinned vegetables, cured meats, and packet soup.|$|E
5000|$|Guanylate cyclase ( [...] , {{also known}} as guanyl cyclase, guanylyl cyclase, or GC) is a lyase enzyme. Guanylate cyclase is often part of the G protein {{signaling}} cascade that is activated by low intracellular calcium levels and inhibited by high intracellular calcium levels. In response to <b>calcium</b> levels, <b>guanylate</b> cyclase synthesizes cGMP from GTP. cGMP keeps cGMP-gated channels open, allowing for the entry of calcium into the cell. [...] Like cAMP, cGMP is an important second messenger that internalizes the message carried by intercellular messengers such as peptide hormones and NO, and can also function as an autocrine signal. Depending on cell type, it can drive adaptive/developmental changes requiring protein synthesis. In smooth muscle, cGMP is the signal for relaxation, and is coupled to many homeostatic mechanisms including regulation of vascular and airway tone, insulin secretion, and peristalsis. Once formed, cGMP can be degraded by phosphodiesterases, which themselves are under different forms of regulation, depending on the tissue.|$|R
5000|$|Guanylate cyclase {{is found}} in the retina (RETGC) and modulates phototransduction in rods and cones. It is part of the calcium {{negative}} feedback system that is activated in response to the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptors by light. This causes less intracellular <b>calcium,</b> which stimulates <b>guanylate</b> cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs). Studies have shown that cGMP synthesis in cones is about 5-10 times higher than it is in rods, which may {{play an important role in}} modulating cone adaption to light. [...] In addition, studies have shown that zebrafish express a higher number of GCAPs than mammals, and that zebrafish GCAPs can bind at least three calcium ions.|$|R
40|$|The {{neuronal}} calcium sensor proteins GCAPs (guanylate cyclase activating proteins) {{switch between}} Ca 2 +-free and Ca 2 +-bound conformational states and confer <b>calcium</b> sensitivity to <b>guanylate</b> cyclase at retinal photoreceptor cells. They play {{a fundamental role in}} light adaptation by coupling {{the rate of}} cGMP synthesis to the intracellular concentration of calcium. Mutations in GCAPs lead to blindness. The importance of functional EF-hands in GCAP 1 for photoreceptor cell integrity has been well established. Mutations in GCAP 1 that diminish its Ca 2 + binding affinity lead to cell damage by causing unabated cGMP synthesis and accumulation of toxic levels of free cGMP and Ca 2 +. We here investigate the relevance of GCAP 2 functional EF-hands for photoreceptor cell integrity. By characterizing transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of GCAP 2 with all EF-hands inactivated (EF 2 GCAP 2), we show that GCAP 2 locked in its Ca 2 +-free conformation leads to a rapid retinal degeneration that is not due to unabated cGMP synthesis. We unveil that when locked in its Ca 2 +-free conformation in vivo, GCAP 2 is phosphorylated at Ser 201 and results in phospho-dependent binding to the chaperone 14 - 3 - 3 and retention at the inner segment and proximal cell compartments. Accumulation of phosphorylated EF 2 GCAP 2 at the inner segment results in severe toxicity. We show that in wildtype mice under physiological conditions, 50 % of GCAP 2 is phosphorylated correlating with the 50 % of the protein being retained at the inner segment. Raising mice under constant light exposure, however, drastically increases the retention of GCAP 2 in its Ca 2 +-free form at the inner segment. This study identifies a ne...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} {{the regulation of}} cGMP by illumination and by calcium during signal transduction in vertebrate retinal photoreceptor cells. We employed an electropermeabilized rod outer segment (EP-ROS) preparation which permits perfusion of low molecular weight compounds into the cytosol while retaining many {{of the features of}} physiologically competent, intact rod outer segments (ROS). When nuc|eotide-depleted EP-ROS were incubated with MgGTP, time- and dose-dependent increases in intracellular cGMP levels were observed. The steady state cGMP concentration in EP-ROS (0. 007 mol cGMP per tool rhodopsin) approached the cGMP concentration in intact ROS. Flash illumination of EP-ROS in a 250 -nM free calcium medium resulted in a transient decrease in cGMP levels; this occurred in the absence of changes in calcium concentration. The kinetics of the cGMP response to flash illumination of EP-ROS were similar to that of intact ROS. To further examine the effects of calcium on cGMP metabolism, clark-adapted EP-ROS were incubated with MgGTP containing various concentrations of calcium. We observed a twofold increase in cGMP steady state levels as the free calcium was lowered from 1 ~M to 20 nM; this increase was comparable to the behavior of intact ROS. Measurements of guanylate cyclase activity in EP-ROS showed a 3. 5 -fold increase in activity over this range of calcium concentrations, indicating a retention of <b>calcium</b> regulation of <b>guanylate</b> cyclase in EP-ROS preparations. Flash illumination of EP-ROS in either a 50 - or 250 -nM free calcium medium revealed a slowing of the recovery time course at the lower calcium concentration. This observation conflicts with any hypothesis whereby a reduction in free calcium concentration hastens the recovery of cytoplasmic cGMP levels, either by stimulating guanylate cyclase activity or by inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity. We conclude that changes in the intracellular calcium concentration during visual transduction may have more complex effects on the recovery of the photoresponse than can be accounted for solely by guanylate cyclase activation...|$|R
