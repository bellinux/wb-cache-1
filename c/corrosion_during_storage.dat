The impact of biofuel on the corrosion of various industrial metals is a challenge for using biofuel as automotive fuel. Fuel comes in contact {{with a wide variety of}} metallic materials under different temperatures, velocities, and loads thereby causing <b>corrosion</b> <b>during</b> <b>storage</b> and flow of fuel. Hence, the present investigation compares the corrosion rates of copper and brass in Pongamia pinnata oil (O 100), 3 % NaCl, and oil blend with NaCl (O 99) obtained by static immersion test and using rotating cage.

40|$|Proprietary {{mixtures}} of amines and carboxylic acids {{are used as}} volatile corrosion inhibitors (VCIs) {{for the protection of}} steel and iron components against atmospheric <b>corrosion</b> <b>during</b> <b>storage</b> and transportation. Interactions between amines and carboxylic acids have been comprehensively reported in the literature. However, {{little is known about the}} nature of the vapours these mixtures emit. The present study focused on the development of the evolved gas analysis method which will help in the characterisation of the vapours released by VCIs. In the method, the evaporation of various amine-carboxylic acid binary mixtures was monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The nature and the composition of the released vapours was followed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Mixtures consisting of triethylamine (TEA) and acetic acid were studied as a model compound using TGA-FTIR at 50 °C to validate the TGA-FTIR method. As vaporisation progressed, the composition of the remaining liquid and the emitted vapour converged to a fixed amine content of ca. 27 mol %. This is just above the composition expected for the 1 : 3 amine: carboxylic acid complex. Mixtures close to this composition also featured the lowest volatility. TGA-FTIR proved to be a convenient method for studying the evaporation of TEA-acetic acid mixtures, and the nature and composition of the released vapours. Amine addition leads to the dissociation of carboxylic acid dimers in favour salt formation. The formation of an ion pair between the amine and carboxylic acid was confirmed by the FTIR spectra of the liquid phase. The resulting amine-carboxylic acid mixtures showed a slow mass loss rate on TGA when compared with the pure amines and pure carboxylic acids. This indicated that the mixtures have low volatility, hence low vapour pressure compared with the pure components. The low vapour pressure of the mixtures was confirmed by the calculated gas permeability values. These values were much higher for the pure amines and the pure carboxylic acids. However, they dropped significantly on amine addition. The strong amine-carboxylic acid interaction is responsible for the suppressed volatility of the mixtures. No interaction is observed between amine and carboxylic acid molecules in the vapour phase at 230 °C. The method developed was applied to characterise the model compounds simulating the amine-carboxylic acid-based volatile corrosion inhibitors. These model systems contained the primary, secondary and tertiary amines (hexylamine, morpholine and triethylamine), as well as carboxylic acids with different chain lengths (acetic, propanoic, hexanoic and octanoic). These systems are usually employed as equimolar mixtures to protect ferrous metals against atmospheric corrosion. The key finding of the study was that the vapours released by such equimolar mixtures initially contain almost exclusively free amine. After prolonged vaporisation, a steady-state “azeotrope”-like composition is approached. It contains excess acid and features impaired corrosion-inhibition efficiencies according to the Skinner test. In part, this behaviour can be attributed to the mismatch between the volatilities of the amine and carboxylic acid constituents.

40|$|Inhibitors {{are known}} for their {{specificity}} of action. 1 A substance, which effectively protects a given metal under certain conditions, may cease to be effective under other conditions or with other metals. The extracts of some common plants and by-products (peels, seeds, fruit shells, leaves, etc.) contain different organic compounds (e. g., amino acids, tannin, alkaloids, and most of their constituents), which are known to have inhibitive action. 2 - 6 It is therefore expected that the essential oils extracted from plants would exhibit inhibitive action. Vapor corrosion inhibitors (VCIs) are chemicals that are used to protect metallic items from atmospheric <b>corrosion</b> <b>during</b> manufacture, <b>storage,</b> and transportation. Initially, camphor was used to protect military equipment and machinery parts. 6 In later years, the development of organic compounds as VCIs for metals 7 - 10 has been important.

40|$|The {{scientific}} and engineering {{demands of the}} Department of Energy (DOE) Environmental Restoration and Waste Management tasks are enormous. For example, several thousand metric tons of metallic uranium spent nuclear fuel (SNF) remain in water storage awaiting disposition. Of this inventory, 2300 metric tons are N-Reactor fuel that have been stored for up to 24 years in the Hanford, Washington KBasins. No significant precautions were taken to prevent the fuel from corroding since the fuel rods were intended to be reprocessed. Termination of reprocessing has left these fuels stranded in prolonged water storage and an appreciable quantity of the fuel has corroded. In addition, other defense fuels including the aluminum-clad fuels at the Savannah River Site and Idaho National Engineering Laboratory have corroded <b>during</b> interim <b>storage</b> in water. In 1994, the DOE began to implement a strategy for moving water-stored Hanford fuels into dry interim storage and a Record of Decision 1 (ROD) documenting this action was put forth by the Department of Energy on March 4, 1996. Several documents 1 - 4 including this ROD and the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) 1, evaluated and documented concerns regarding the potential for releases of radionuclides to the environment. The DOE plans to remove metallic uranium SNF from water storage and seal it in overpack canisters for ''dry'' interim storage, for up to 75 years. Much of the SNF that will be stored will have been severely corroded <b>during</b> water <b>storage.</b> Chemically bound water not removed during proposed drying operations may lead to long-term corrosion and generation of combustible H 2 and O 2 gas-mixture via radiolysis. No thoroughly tested model is currently available to predict fuel behavior <b>during</b> ''dry'' <b>storage.</b> The PNNL collaborating with the Rutgers University studied the thermo-chemical and radiolytic reactions of actual and prototype SNF materials. The purpose of this project is to deliver pertinent information {{which can be used}} to make decisions concerning the safety and treatment issues associated with dry storage of spent nuclear fuel materials.
