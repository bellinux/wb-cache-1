50|$|In {{addition}} to the spindle and its bearings, the headstock often contains parts to convert the motor speed into various spindle speeds. Various types of speed-changing mechanism achieve this, from a <b>cone</b> <b>pulley</b> or step pulley, to a <b>cone</b> <b>pulley</b> with back gear (which is essentially a low range, similar in net effect to the two-speed rear of a truck), to an entire gear train {{similar to that of}} a manual-shift auto transmission. Some motors have electronic rheostat-type speed controls, which obviates cone pulleys or gears.|$|E

5000|$|Engine lathe is {{the name}} applied to a {{traditional}} late-19th-century or 20th-century lathe with automatic feed to the cutting tool, as opposed to early lathes which were used with hand-held tools, or lathes with manual feed only. The usage of [...] "engine" [...] here is in the mechanical-device sense, not the prime-mover sense, as in the steam engines which were the standard industrial power source for many years. The works would have one large steam engine which would provide power to all the machines via a line shaft system of belts. Therefore, early engine lathes were generally 'cone heads', in that the spindle usually had attached to it a multi-step pulley called a <b>cone</b> <b>pulley</b> designed to accept a flat belt. Different spindle speeds could be obtained by moving the flat belt to different steps on the <b>cone</b> <b>pulley.</b> Cone-head lathes usually had a countershaft (layshaft) {{on the back side}} of the cone which could be engaged to provide a lower set of speeds than was obtainable by direct belt drive. These gears were called back gears. Larger lathes sometimes had two-speed back gears which could be shifted to provide a still lower set of speeds.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dynamics}} of continuously variable (CVT) chain drives. According to the discrete structure of the chain, which causes the polygonal actions, the mechanical model contains each chain link and pulley as a separate body. While a chain link {{is part of a}} strand, only joint forces including friction act on the chain links, whereas in the contact situation additional impulsive and frictional forces in the contact zones between the chain link's rocker pins and the tapered surfaces of the <b>cone</b> <b>pulleys</b> have to be taken into account. For the calculation of the contact forces Coulomb's friction law as well as a time sparing continuous approximation are applied. Simulation results show the influence of the <b>cone</b> <b>pulley's</b> deformation on the power transmission. They also show the repercussion of the polygonal action. Furthermore the chain's pitch influence on the vibrational behavior of the transmission is discussed. A comparison of calculated and measured tensional forces ver [...] ...|$|R

In the current configuration, the cones have been moved apart so the belt [...] "falls" [...] into the space between them. By moving the cones closer, the belt is forced to ride higher {{on the sides of}} the <b>cones,</b> changing the <b>pulley</b> ratio.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{countershaft}} {{is somewhat}} older. In 1828, {{the term was}} {{used to refer to}} an intermediate horizontal shaft in a gristmill driven through gearing by the waterwheel and driving the millstones through bevel gears. [...] An 1841 textbook used the term to refer to a short shaft driven by a belt from the line shaft and driving the spindle of a lathe through additional belts. The countershaft and the lathe spindle each carried <b>cones</b> of different-diameter <b>pulleys</b> for speed control. [...] In 1872, this definition was given: [...] "The term countershaft is applied to all shafts driven from the main line [...] when placed at or near the machines to be driven ..." ...|$|R
50|$|Bridgeport manual milling {{machines}} {{have come in}} many types and sizes over the years, including (but not limited to) the C head (original), R head (heavy duty C head), M head, J head (and high speed, 5440 RPM version), 2J1 1/2 head (1.5 HP Vari-Speed), 2J2 (2HP Vari-speed), and Series II head (4HP Vari-speed). All of the heads offer variable speeds, the earlier ones via a step pulley (<b>cone</b> <b>pulley)</b> and the later ones via electrically or electronically modulated variable-speed drive. Typical table sizes are 9″ × 49″ (Y and X, respectively) and 10″ × 54″. Machine tapers for toolholding include Morse tapers (on early models) and the R8 taper (a widely used standard that Bridgeport created) on most models. Both Morse and R8 allow for both collets and solid holders; and a drill chuck can be held by either of the latter. Machine slides are of the dovetail type, and rotary bearings are mostly of the roller and ball types.|$|E
