Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and <b>cefuroxime,</b> ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
25|$|Levofloxacin is {{also used}} as {{antibiotic}} eye drops to prevent bacterial infection. Usage of levofloxacin eye drops, along with an antibiotic injection of <b>cefuroxime</b> or penicillin during cataract surgery, {{has been found to}} lower the chance of developing endophthalmitis, compared to eye drops or injections alone.|$|E

25|$|After the {{identification}} of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics, amoxicillin, <b>cefuroxime</b> axetil, intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone. The mechanism of tick transmission was also {{the subject of much}} discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands.|$|E
25|$|Outpatients with {{underlying}} {{illness or}} risk factors: Although this group {{does not require}} hospitalization, patients have underlying health problems (such as emphysema or heart failure) or {{are at risk for}} DRSP or enteric gram-negative bacteria. They are treated with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as levofloxacin) or a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefpodoxime, <b>cefuroxime,</b> amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and a macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics are {{the primary}} treatment. The {{specific}} approach to their use {{is dependent on the}} individual affected and the stage of the disease. For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin, <b>cefuroxime</b> axetil, and azithromycin. Individuals with early disseminated or late infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, refractory Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like meningitis or encephalitis. Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives.|$|E

BSW Timber, the UK's largest sawmilling company, has a large site north of Carlisle at Cargo in Kingmoor, next to Carlisle Kingmoor TMD on the WCML.

2500|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{efforts to}} prevent tick bites such as by wearing long pants and using DEET. Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. Ticks can be removed using tweezers. If the removed tick was full of blood, a single dose of doxycycline {{may be used to}} prevent development of infection, but is not generally recommended since development of infection is rare. [...] If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin, and <b>cefuroxime.</b> Treatment is usually for two or three weeks. Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment which may last for one or two days. In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commonly}} quoted {{figure of}} 10% {{of patients with}} allergic hypersensitivity to penicillins and/or carbapenems also having cross-reactivity with cephalosporins originated from a 1975 study looking at the original cephalosporins, and subsequent [...] "safety first" [...] policy meant this was widely quoted and assumed to apply to {{all members of the}} group. Hence, it was commonly stated that they are contraindicated in patients with a history of severe, immediate allergic reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, etc.) to penicillins, carbapenems, or cephalosporins. [...] This, however, should be viewed in the light of recent epidemiological work suggesting, for many second-generation (or later) cephalosporins, the cross-reactivity rate with penicillin is much lower, having no significantly increased risk of reactivity over the first generation based on the studies examined. The British National Formulary previously issued blanket warnings of 10% cross-reactivity, but, since the September 2008 edition, suggests, in the absence of suitable alternatives, oral cefixime or <b>cefuroxime</b> and injectable cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone can be used with caution, but the use of cefaclor, cefadrocil, cefalexin, and cefradine should be avoided.|$|E

5000|$|A Cochrane Review {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. The review showed high-certainty evidence that antibiotic injections in the eye with <b>cefuroxime</b> {{at the end of}} surgery lowers the chance of endophthalmitis. Also, the review showed moderate evidence that antibiotic eye drops (levofloxacin or chloramphenicol) with antibiotic injections (<b>cefuroxime</b> or penicillin) probably lowers the chance of endophthalmitis compared with injections or eye drops alone.
