25|$|Cyclopropane is a <b>cycloalkane</b> {{molecule}} {{with the}} molecular formula C3H6, consisting of three carbon atoms linked {{to each other}} to form a ring, with each carbon atom bearing two hydrogen atoms resulting in D3h molecular symmetry. The small size of the ring creates substantial ring strain in the structure.|$|E
25|$|Both {{saturated}} (alicyclic) {{compounds and}} unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives. The most stable rings contain {{five or six}} carbon atoms, but large rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common. The smallest <b>cycloalkane</b> family is the three-membered cyclopropane ((CH2)3). Saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only, whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or conjugated) double bond. Cycloalkanes do not contain multiple bonds, whereas the cycloalkenes and the cycloalkynes do.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cycloalkanes</b> {{reported}} as LOHC include cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and decalin. The dehydrogenation of <b>cycloalkanes</b> is highly endothermic (63-69 kJ/mol H2), which means this process requires high temperature. Dehydrogenation of decalin {{is the most}} thermodynamically favored among the three <b>cycloalkanes,</b> and methyl-cyclohexane is second {{because of the presence}} of the methyl group. Research on catalyst development for dehydrogenation of <b>cycloalkanes</b> has been carried out for decades. Nickel (Ni), Molybdenum (Mo) and Platinum (Pt) based catalysts are highly investigated for dehydrogenation. However, coking is still a big challenge for catalyst’s long-term stability.|$|R
50|$|The small <b>cycloalkanes</b> - in particular, {{cyclopropane}} - {{have a lower}} stability due to Baeyer {{strain and}} ring strain. They react similarly to alkenes, though they do not react in electrophilic addition, but in nucleophilic aliphatic substitution. These reactions are ring-opening reactions or ring-cleavage reactions of alkyl <b>cycloalkanes.</b> <b>Cycloalkanes</b> can be formed in a Diels-Alder reaction followed by a catalytic hydrogenation.|$|R
25|$|The <b>cycloalkanes,</b> {{also known}} as naphthenes, are {{saturated}} hydrocarbons which have one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached according to the formula CnH2n. <b>Cycloalkanes</b> have similar properties to alkanes but have higher boiling points.|$|R

2500|$|Cyclohexane is a <b>cycloalkane</b> {{with the}} {{molecular}} formula C6H12 (the alkyl is abbreviated Cy).

[...] Cyclohexane is a colourless, flammable liquid with a distinctive detergent-like odor, reminiscent of cleaning products (in which it is sometimes used).|$|E
2500|$|Simple cycloalkanes have a prefix [...] "cyclo-" [...] to {{distinguish}} them from alkanes. Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts {{with respect to}} the number of carbon atoms in their backbones, e.g., cyclopentane (C5H10) is a <b>cycloalkane</b> with 5 carbon atoms just like pentane (C5H12), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring. In a similar manner, propane and cyclopropane, butane and cyclobutane, etc.|$|E

2500|$|Adamantane is a colorless, {{crystalline}} {{chemical compound}} with a camphor-like odor. With a formula C10H16, it is a <b>cycloalkane</b> {{and also the}} simplest diamondoid. Adamantane molecules consists of three connected cyclohexane rings arranged in the [...] "armchair" [...] configuration. It is unique {{in that it is}} both rigid and virtually stress-free. Adamantane is the most stable among all the isomers with formula C10H16, which include the somewhat similar twistane. The spatial arrangement of carbon atoms in the adamantane molecule is the same as in the diamond crystal. This motivates the name adamantane, which is derived from the Greek adamantinos (relating to steel or diamond).|$|E

50|$|<b>Cycloalkanes</b> {{are similar}} to alkanes in their general {{physical}} properties, but they have higher boiling points, melting points, and densities than alkanes. This is due to stronger London forces because the ring shape allows for a larger area of contact. Containing only C-C and C-H bonds, unreactivity of <b>cycloalkanes</b> {{with little or no}} ring strain (see below) are comparable to non-cyclic alkanes.|$|R

50|$|The carbon {{atoms in}} cycloalkanes are sp3 hybridized and are {{therefore}} a deviation from the ideal tetrahedral bond angles of 109° 28′. This causes an increase in potential energy and an overall destabilizing effect. Eclipsing of hydrogen atoms is an important destabilizing effect, as well. The strain energy of a <b>cycloalkane</b> is the theoretical increase in energy caused by the compound's geometry, and is calculated by comparing the experimental standard enthalpy change of combustion of the <b>cycloalkane</b> with the value calculated using average bond energies.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>cycloalkanes,</b> each carbon is bonded nonpolar covalently to two carbons and two hydrogen. The carbons have sp3 hybrization {{and should}} have ideal bond angles of 109.5°. Due to the {{limitations}} of cyclic structure, however, the ideal angle is only achieved in a six carbon ring [...] - [...] cyclohexane in chair conformation. For other <b>cycloalkanes,</b> the bond angles deviate from ideal. In cyclopropanes (3 carbons) and cyclobutanes (4 carbons) the C-C bonds are 60° and ~90° respectively.|$|R

40|$|In {{a search}} for alkane {{candidates}} for 193 nm immersion fluids, several alkanes and <b>cycloalkanes</b> were synthesized, purified and screened to ascertain their absorption at 193 nm, refractive index and temperature dispersion coefficient {{in the context of}} the actual application. In general, <b>cycloalkanes,</b> and more specifically polycycloalkanes, possess a higher refractive index than do linear alkanes. Decalin, cyclodecane, perhydrophenanthreme (PHP), perhydrofluorene (PHF) and perhydropyrene (PHPY) are examined as potential second and third generation immersion fluids. The use of perhydropyrene, which possesses a high refractive index of 1. 7014 at 193 nm, may be limited as an immersion fluid because of high absorption at 193 nm. Mixtures of <b>cycloalkanes</b> can lead to a higher enhancement of the refractive index together with a decrease on the viscosity. Exhaustive purification of the fluids is a critical step in determining the real absorption of the different fluids at 193 nm. Two simple purification processes of these <b>cycloalkanes</b> were developed that led to low absorption fluids in the VUV region. The possibility of forming the oxygen complex in aerated fluids was reduced by purging samples with argon or nitrogen. This easy elimination of the oxygen complex shows the weak bonding nature of this complex...|$|R
