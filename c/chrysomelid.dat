5|$|The tansy plant {{naturally}} {{contains a}} number of volatile components including 1,8-cineole, trans-thujone, camphor and myrtenol, with the quantities and proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to plant. 1,8-cineole is a toxin believed to defend the plant leaves against attacks by herbivores. The tansy beetle is resistant to these chemicals. However, tansy is a repellent to other <b>Chrysomelid</b> beetles. For example, the steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and is strongly repellent to the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of T. lugens is {{completed}} in two years. Adults start their activity soon after snowmelt and are active {{until the beginning of}} autumn (end of September in the Sierra Nevada). Most adults that are active {{at the beginning of the}} season are the individuals that emerged the preceding year and have survived the winter in diapause. Mating and egg laying occur along the whole period of adult activity. At the end of the summer, approximately 15 days to one month before the snow has completely covered the study area, individuals start overwintering under large plants or stones. Overwintering is common in species of Timarcha, as well as other <b>chrysomelids,</b> and it occurs in most high mountain species, which are active only during the warmest period of the year. The short periods of activity (usually restricted to summertime) limits the breeding season to a few months in which these species have to maturate reproductive organs, mate, breed, and develop.|$|R
40|$|Information is {{provided}} {{on the most}} important agronomic aspects of the black bean production process in 3 municipalities in the Valle del Cauca (Ginebra, Cerrito, and Tulua), Colombia. Thirty-one bean production units of varying surface area and technology level were visited. Factors involved in the process are described: land and capital; soil availability and characteristics; agrobiological aspects of pests, diseases and weeds; availability of human, credit, and technical assistance resources; and marketing facilities. The utility of an agroeconomic methodology to help establish research strategies and priorities and government policies oriented toward increasing bean production and productivity is demonstrated. Fifty-six percent of the farmers indicated that the main problem limiting bean production is water management or availability, whereas for large farmers find insect pests such as Empoasca, Trichoplusia, <b>chrysomelids,</b> and Bemisia tabaci, and diseases such as angular leaf spot (Isariopsis griseola), rust (Uromyces phaseoli), bacterial blight (Xanthomonas phaseoli), root rots, and viruses to be major problems.

40|$|Pests and {{diseases}} are important production constraints of snap beans in tropical and subtropical {{regions of the}} world. Among the most important conditions favoring their development are climate, planting susceptible varieties in monoculture over entire regions, staggered planting dates, and planting infected seed. In addition, indiscriminate use of chemicals kills beneficial insects and induces resistance. Among the most important pests are whiteflies, leafminers, leafhoppers, pod borers, <b>chrysomelids,</b> cutworms, crickets, mites and bruchids. In highland regions with cool climates, anthracnose, ascochyta blight, halo blight, and white and gray mold {{are the most important}} diseases during rainy growing cycles. Rust, powdery mildew and southern blight are prevalent during the drier cycles. At lower altitudes with warmer climates, rust, bacterial blight and powdery mildew are the most important diseases. However, in the rainy, tropical lowlands, web blight is the most important disease. Disease and insect control should pursue an integrated approach that includes: a broadening of the genetic base; more rational chemical control; the use of clean seed; and rotations with crops that are not hosts for snap bean pests {{and diseases}}.

40|$|Douglas TallamyBiodiversity {{is said to}} {{increase}} the productivity and stability of the various ecological processes that keep the environment as a whole functioning properly (Naeem et al., 1999). I compared the biodiversity of three target beetle families (Scarabaeidae, Chrysomelidae and Carabidae) in Yasuni National Park of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador in two different forest types, seasonally flooded forest (varzea) and dry forest (terre firme) to 1) to determine whether one forest type would be more diverse than the other; and 2) test the hypothesis that herbivores are more diverse than predators or detritivores. No {{significant differences were found}} between the herbivores, detritivores and predators in dry and seasonally flooded forest. Scarabaeidae: Aphodiinae and Scarabaeinae were more abundant than Chrysomelidae (herbivores) which were more abundant than Carabidae, which roughly followed predictions of energy transference up the feeding trophic levels. However species richness was highest in <b>Chrysomelids,</b> followed by the scarabs with the fewest species recorded within the Carabidae. This result suggests that herbivores are most diverse because of the high diversity of plant life in the tropics. Entomolog...|$|R
40|$|Developmental biology, {{polymorphism}} {{and ecological}} aspects of Stiretrus decemguttatus (Hemiptera, Pentatomidae), an important predator of cassidine beetles. Stiretrus decemguttatus {{is an important}} predator of two species of cassidine beetles, Botanochara sedecimpustulata (Fabricius, 1781) and Zatrephina lineata (Fabricius, 1787) (Coleoptera, Cassidinae), on the Marajó Island, Brazil. It attacks individuals in all development stages, but preys preferentially on late-instar larvae. Its life cycle in the laboratory was 43. 70 ± 1. 09 days, with an egg incubation period of six days and duration from nymph and adult stages of 16. 31 ± 0. 11 and 22. 10 ± 1. 67 days, respectively. The duration of one generation (T) was 12. 65 days and the intrinsic population growth rate (r) 0. 25. These data reveal the adjustment {{of the life cycle}} of S. decemgutattus with those of the two preys, but suggest greater impact on Z. lineata. However, no preference over cassidine species was shown in the laboratory. Up to 17 different color patterns can be found in adults of S. decemguttatus, based on combinations of three basic sets of color markings. Some of them resemble the markings of <b>chrysomelids</b> associated with Ipomoea asarifolia (Convolvulaceae) and are possibly a mimetic ring.

40|$|During {{a survey}} of genetic and species {{diversity}} patterns of leaf beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) assemblages across the Iberian Peninsula we found a broad congruence between morphologically delimited species and variation in the cytochrome oxidase (cox 1) gene. However, one species pair each in the genera Longitarsus Berthold and Pachybrachis Chevrolat was inseparable using molecular methods, whereas diagnostic morphological characters (including male or female genitalia) unequivocally separated the named species. Parsimony haplotype networks and maximum likelihood trees built from cox 1 showed high genetic structure within each species pair, but no correlation with the morphological types and neither with geographic distributions. This contrasted with all analysed congeneric species, which were recovered as monophyletic. A limited number of specimens were sequenced for the nuclear 18 S rRNA gene, which showed no or very limited variation within the species pair and no separation of morphological types. These results suggest that processes of lineage sorting for either group are lagging behind the clear morphological and presumably reproductive separation. In the Iberian <b>chrysomelids,</b> incongruence between DNA-based and morphological delimitations is a rare exception, but the discovery of these species pairs may be useful as an evolutionary model for studying the process of speciation in this ecological and geographical setting. In addition, the study of biodiversity patterns based on DNA requires an evolutionary understanding of these incongruences an...|$|R
