An alumina based mould coating containing varying proportion (5 % to 30 %) of volatile hexachloroethane, C 2 Cl 6 was prepared. The prepared mould coating was applied to form a coat of 2 mm thick on the prepared metallic mould. The hypoeutectic aluminium-silicon alloy melted at 50 °C superheat was poured into the already prepared <b>coated</b> <b>mould</b> and allowed to solidify.

The study revealed that the increase in C 2 Cl 6 concentration in the mould coating up to 15 wt. % decreases the grain size of the alloy thereby causing increase in the mechanical properties (UTS), 0. 2 % proof stress, hardness, percentage elongation and percentage reduction in area) of the alloy. It was established that the optimum value of C 2 Cl 6 concentration at which the mechanical properties were optimum is about 15 wt. %.

40|$|Hot-pressing is {{a powder}} {{metallurgy}} process where loose powder is loaded into a mould, usually of graphite, and sintered by the simultaneous application of high temperature and pressure. In this study elemental titanium and Ti&- 6 Al&- 7 Nb alloy powders are hot-pressed under different conditions {{in order to}} study {{the influence of the}} processing parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties. The samples are characterised in terms of relative density, microstructure, XRD, percentage of interstitials, three-point bending test and hardness. Relative densities as high as 99 % are obtained, the oxygen and carbon content remains almost constant but nitrogen percentage increases. This is due to the interaction with the BN <b>coated</b> <b>mould</b> and leads to the formation of a reacted layer in the surface, composed by different titanium compounds, which greatly affect the mechanical properties.

40|$|Micro {{structured}} {{optical plastics}} components are intensively used i. e. in consumer electronics, for optical sensors in metrology, innovative LED-lighting or laser technology. Injection moulding {{has proven to}} be successful for the large-scale production of those parts. However, the production of those parts still causes difficulties due to challenges in the moulding and demoulding of plastics parts created with laser structured mould inserts. A complete moulding of the structures often leads to increased demoulding forces, which then cause a breaking of the structures and a clogging of the mould. An innovative approach is to combine PVD-coated (physical vapour deposition), laser structured inserts and a variothermal moulding process to create functional mic 8 iuro structures in a one-step process. Therefore, a PVD-coating is applied after the laser structuring process in order to improve the wear resistance and the anti-adhesive properties against the plastics melt. In a series of moulding trials with polycarbonate (PC) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) using different <b>coated</b> <b>moulds,</b> the mould temperature during injection was varied in the range of the glass transition and the melt temperature of the polymers. Subsequently, the surface topography of the moulded parts is evaluated by digital 3 D laser-scanning microscopy.

40|$|The {{fluidity}} of an alloy plays a {{key role}} for the foundry and transport industries as it affects the quality and soundness of the cast products. Particularly, fluidity influences the reject rates, hence casting costs and the production of thinwalled, hence light components. Fluidity is a complex technological property and depends on many parameters. However, many aspects of this subject are still not fully understood. The motivation of the research presented in this doctoral thesis was, therefore, to fill this gap in knowledge. The study has aimed at understanding the influence of various parameters on the fluidity of aluminium foundry alloys and, in particular, Al-Si foundry alloys. A literature review of previously reported results on fluidity was carried out. It was found that a lack of a highly reproducible test method as well as some contradictory results existed in the literature. Therefore, a new fluidity test method was developed. To study the accuracy and reproducibility of this test was {{one of the goals of}} this work. The new test method allowed a constant melt superheat, which is considered as one of the major factors affecting fluidity measurements, and a constant pouring velocity. It was found that the reproducibility of the new method was higher than previous methods. The effect of casting temperature, and hence melt superheat, was assessed through a series of tests. A linear relationship between casting temperature and fluidity length was observed. The effect of grain refiner on the fluidity of an A 356 alloy was systematically investigated. The fluidity lengths without grain refiner and with three additions of Al- 5 wt%Ti- 1 wt%B master alloy were measured. The results showed that grain refinement reduced the grain size throughout the spiral somewhat, particularly at the tip, but there were no statistically significant effects on fluidity. The effect of dissolved hydrogen was also investigated in this study. The hydrogen content was drastically increased by plunging pieces of wood beneath the surface of the molten metal. The fluidity of this melt was measured and compared to a melt with low hydrogen content. It was concluded that the difference in fluidity between the melts with different hydrogen levels was not significant. The effect of minor alloying elements (Sr, Ti, Fe and Mg) on the fluidity of Al- 7 wt%Si alloys was investigated. The Design Of Experiment (DOE) technique and the Taguchi approach were used to design the experiments. The Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to analyse the results. It was concluded that the addition of minor alloying elements to a major alloy system, e. g. Al- 7 wt%Si, does not significantly affect its fluidity and the melt superheat had a far greater impact on fluidity than the minor alloying elements. The effect of mould coating on fluidity was studied on a commercial strip mould which consisted of a H 13 die with five channels of different cross sectional areas. The coating was sprayed to achieve a thickness of 0. 2 mm. Fluidity measurements were performed on the uncoated and <b>coated</b> <b>mould.</b> It was concluded that mould coating significantly increases fluidity. In addition, fluidity measurements on the uncoated and <b>coated</b> <b>mould</b> were undertaken at two different melt superheats and it was found that coating the mould plays a more significant role at low melt superheats. The effect of oxide content on fluidity was also investigated. Three alloys, namely a standard A 356 alloy, the same alloy with 20 % (A 356 + 20 %) and 50 % (A 356 + 50 %) re-melted turning chips, were used and their fluidities compared. Qualitative analysis on the type of oxides present in the three alloys was carried out with a PoDFA test apparatus and the oxide level was quantified with optical microscopy analysis. The results showed that the addition of turning chips significantly increased the oxide content. Among the investigated alloys, A 356 without turning chip additions showed the lowest oxide content and the highest fluidity. No significant differences in either oxide content or fluidity were found between the A 356 + 20 % and A 356 + 50 % melts. Two fluidity test methods, a commercially available one and an experimentally developed test, were used for measuring the fluidity of Al-Mg-Si alloys. Although the two methods were different, they gave consistent results. Numerical simulations of fluidity tests were carried out on an A 356 alloy and the results showed that numerical simulation software can be a useful tool for predicting fluidity in aluminium foundry alloys. These are the major findings achieved by this thesis work which contribute to improve our understanding of the effect of several key variables on fluidity. It is believed that these results will solve some of the problems currently encountered in foundries and improve their processes. </p...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to substitute wet chemical mould coatings in the plastic and rubber processing by PVD and CVD coatings. Suitable mould coatings should show good demoulding characteristics, a positive wear-resistance and advantageous corrosion attributes. To judge the demoulding performance, trials with laboratory moulds were made and a demoulding device was built, enabling you to measure demoulding forces directly. PVD and CVD coatings showed reduced (up to 20 - 25 %) demoulding forces compared with uncoated and galvanic chrome <b>coated</b> <b>moulds.</b> The influence of mould release agents are significantly stronger than the influence of different mould coatings. Due to the 2 to 4 times (TiC) higher micro hardness (Vickershardness) of PVD and CVD coatings compared with hardened steal and galvanic chrome, a higher wear-resistance of the moulds had been achieved. This helps against abrasive parts of the rubber formulation and abrasive mould cleaning. A higher corrosion resistance of some CVD and PVD coatings had been proved by extensive laboratory trials and corrosion tests as well as long term production use. CVD coatings and multilayers with CVD basic coatings are clearly more corrosion resistant than galvanic chrome coatings. It was proved during the project that PVD and CVD coatings can substitute the use of wet chemical galvanic chrome <b>mould</b> <b>coating.</b> (orig.)

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{relation}} between structure evolution, mechanical properties, and stability was investigated for Al 2 O 3 thin films. The existence of different polymorphs of this material offers a range of properties for applications, but also meets the process control challenges when the formation of phase pure material is desired. The aim of this work is to affect the phase structure evolution and the stability of vapor deposited alumina thin films, especially for the case of PECVD. This goal is achieved by experimental investigations of the PECVD process which show that the alpha-Al 2 O 3 phase is obtained only at conditions with a low precursor ratio, a long pulse length and a high power density. These allow for more efficient precursor dissociation as suggested from plasma OES data as well as larger ion bombardment. When these conditions are not fulfilled, only gamma-Al 2 O 3 or alpha-gamma-mixture is formed. Due {{to the use of}} chloridic precursor, it is found that less Cl content is incorporated in alpha-Al 2 O 3 films with < 1. 0 at. % than in gamma-Al 2 O 3 films (~ 2. 0 at. %). This observation is consistent with a high precursor dissociation and significant surface bombardment for the alpha-phase. Smooth and dense alpha-Al 2 O 3 films with negligible Cl incorporation and elastic properties {{similar to those of the}} bulk alpha-Al 2 O 3 are deposited at a growth temperature of 560 ± 10 °C, applying a novel generator that allows for the operation of a PECVD discharge at approx. 4 times larger power density than those utilized conventionally. Up-scaling of a lab-scale PECVD process to an industrial reactor has been successfully conducted allowing the growth of crystalline alumina on large thixocasting tools at substrate temperatures of 590 °C. Steel thixocasting operations on the <b>coated</b> <b>moulds</b> indicate that coatings are intact after thixocasting. No evidence for adhesive or cohesive failure of the coatings was obtained, indicating efficient protecting of the tools during thixocasting. Investigation of thermal stabilities of gamma-Al 2 O 3 films suggest that the gamma-Al 2 O 3 to alpha-Al 2 O 3 transformation in the PECVD films is faster and occurs at lower temperatures in comparison to the FCA films. This could be due to the porous structure of the PECVD grown films which enhance diffusion processes during the phase transformation. The porous structure of PECVD films further enables the oxidation of a TiAlN interlayer and the extrusion of TiO 2 towards the film surface due to large volume expansion from TiO 2, leading to a complete failure of the coating system. The relative stability of gamma-Al 2 O 3 with respect to alpha-Al 2 O 3 with 2. 5 at% of Si, Cr, Ti, Sc, and Y additives is also explored using ab initio calculations, indicating that Si stabilizes gamma-Al 2 O 3, while Cr stabilizes alpha-Al 2 O 3. This is explained by electronic structure changes induced by the alloying element. As Si is added, a bond length increase in alpha-Al 2 O 3 is observed, while strong and short Si-O bonds are formed in gamma-Al 2 O 3, consequently stabilizing this phase. On the other hand, Cr additions induce a smaller bond length increase in alpha-Al 2 O 3 than in gamma-Al 2 O 3, therefore stabilizing the alpha-Al 2 O 3...|$|R
6000|$|The {{amount of}} fine earth {{brought to the}} surface under the form of castings, and {{afterwards}} transported by the winds accompanied by rain, or that which flows and rolls down an inclined surface, no doubt is small {{in the course of}} a few scores of years; for otherwise all the inequalities in our pasture fields would be smoothed within a much shorter period than appears to be the case. [...] But the amount which is thus transported in the course of thousands of years cannot fail to be considerable and deserves attention. E. de Beaumont looks at the vegetable mould which everywhere covers the land as a fixed line, from which the amount of denudation may be measured. {79} He ignores the continued formation of fresh mould by the disintegration of the underlying rocks and fragments of rock; and it is curious to find how much more philosophical were the views maintained long ago, by Playfair, who, in 1802, wrote, [...] "In the permanence of a <b>coat</b> of vegetable <b>mould</b> on the surface of the earth, we have a demonstrative proof of the continued destruction of the rocks."

40|$|In this paper, {{an initial}} {{assessment}} of the quality parameters of the surface finish and dimensional accuracy of tools made by metal casting in rapid prototyping (RP) sand moulds is undertaken. A case study from a local tool room, dealing with the manufacturing of an aluminium die for the lost wax process, is employed. Modern techniques, including surface roughness analysis and three dimensional scanning, are used to determine and understand how each manufacturing step influences the final quality of the cast tool. The best surface finish obtained for the cast die had arithmetic average roughness (Ra) and mean average roughness (Rz) respectively equal to 3. 23 µm and 11. 38 µm. In terms of dimensional accuracy, 82 % of cast-die points coincided with the Computer Aided Design (CAD) data, which is within the typical tolerances of sand cast products. The investigation shows that <b>mould</b> <b>coating</b> contributes slightly to {{the improvement of the}} cast tool surface finish. The study also found that the additive manufacturing of the sand mould was the chief factor responsible for the loss of dimensional accuracy. These findings indicate that machining will always be required t...|$|R
40|$|The Berrazales {{carbonate}} spring deposit {{is a small}} outcrop constituted {{mainly by}} cascade-like geometries. Four main facies have been identified: fibrous dense macrocrystalline formed by rapid degassing under high-flow conditions; framestones of <b>coated</b> plant <b>moulds</b> formed in moderate energy flow favoured {{by the presence of}} biogenic support; micrite/microsparite are primary precipitates in which crystalline aggregates nucleated on organic filaments and/or EPS; banded micrite-coarse crystalline were the result of alternating physically, chemically and biologically induced precipitation in areas of varying flow-velocities. Most facies underwent different degrees of micritization processes. Micrite is distributed as thin lines penetrating the crystals, as irregular patches or as micrite layers. In the first case organic filaments penetrate crystals, suggesting that micritization is mainly biogenically driven. In the latter cases micritization is caused mostly by partial dissolution. Microbe participation in micrite formation increased micrite MgCO 3 content in comparison with coarse crystalline facies. Isotopic analyses show positive δ 13 C values (+ 2. 63 and + 4. 29 ‰ VPDB) and negative δ 18 O (- 5. 65 and - 4. 48 ‰ VPDB) values. Positive δ 13 C values clearly indicate >deep-sourced> fluids. The Berrazales spring deposit studied here very probably is a small part of a larger carbonate building that was largely eroded by fluvial incision. Calculations of spring water temperature give a range from 20 °C to 35 °C, characteristic of a cold to warm spring favouring precipitation of calcite and important biogenic activity (framestones). Although the study deposit has textural characteristics of tufas, proving that the CO 2 sourced from deep fluids, it should be considered as thermogene travertine, being one more example of the difficulty of using those terms for ancient sedimentary deposits. Carbonate spring deposits, very rare in the Canary Islands, are good archives of recent volcanic activity, fluvial processes and vegetation regimes prevailing in the islands in recent times. © 2014 Elsevier B.

60|$|The flying or {{floating}} {{island is}} exactly circular, its diameter 7837 yards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten thousand acres. It is three hundred yards thick. The bottom, or under surface, {{which appears to}} those who view it below, is one even regular plate of adamant, shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards. Above it lie the several minerals in their usual order, and over all is a <b>coat</b> of rich <b>mould,</b> ten or twelve feet deep. The declivity of the upper surface, from the circumference to the centre, is the natural cause why all the dews and rains, which fall upon the island, are conveyed in small rivulets toward the middle, where they are emptied into four large basins, each of {{about half a mile}} in circuit, and two hundred yards distant from the centre. From these basins the water is continually exhaled by the sun in the daytime, which effectually prevents their overflowing. Besides, {{as it is in the}} power of the monarch to raise the island above the region of clouds and vapours, he can prevent the falling of dews and rain whenever he pleases. For the highest clouds cannot rise above two miles, as naturalists agree, at least they were never known to do so in that country.|$|R
40|$|Fluorescent solar {{collectors}} are cheap plates made generally of glass or plastic that is doped with fluorescent molecules. Fluorescence {{can be used}} to trap incident solar radiation in order to concentrate light and also to shift the radiation to wavelengths converted at higher efficiencies. This project investigates both these aspects. Solar concentration using fluorescent {{solar collectors}} is examined for different combinations of solar cells and mirrors coupled to different surfaces of fluorescent solar collectors. The effects of the fabrication method i. e. spin <b>coating</b> or <b>moulding</b> is also studied. Modelling of the fluorescence re-absorption is the key to obtain the efficiency of such systems and these models will be shown to be useful in the optimisation of certain configurations of fluorescent collectors that behave like ideal models. On comparison with experimental results these models {{can also be used to}} quantify and identify losses in configurations that suffer additional losses. Devices tested in the lab are estimated to have the potential to achieve power conversion efficiencies close to 4 % while results of optimisation results indicate possible further improvements. Angular resolved measurements of the fluorescence exiting the fluorescent solar collector edge is also used to study the photon transport of light within these devices. The combination of solar concentration and wavelength shifting (to wavelengths with superior solar cell performance) has been exploited for application to cadmium telluride solar cells for the first time. The theory of operation of these devices is used to model the current output measured experimentally. Novel photonic-based structures that incorporate fluorescent molecules within one-dimensional photonic crystals has also been fabricated and characterised. It will be shown that these devices have the potential to reduce fundamental loss mechanisms found in conventional fluorescent solar collectors by suppressing and reducing emission within loss cones and tuning emission reaching the solar cells to certain wavelengths. The theory of operation of these devices will used to describe the propagation of light within the structure and explain the experimentally measured emission characteristics. The maximum theoretical efficiencies of photonic-based fluorescent solar collectors have also been derived and adapted from previous work to show the potential of such devices...|$|R
40|$|In the {{injection}} moulding of polypropylene reinforced with hard glass fibres, die materials are commonly subjected to severe abrasive wear. In {{order to improve}} its wear resistance, an unbalanced magnetron sputtering PVD compositional monolayered coating has been produced. The film was composed by a nanostructured TiB 2 monolayer. Microstructure characterization and thickness evaluation were conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Film topography and roughness were accessed by SEM and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The phase analyse was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using Cu Kalpha radiation. Scratch tests were conducted in order to study the film adhesion to the substrate. Load-Displacement curves (nanoindentation analysis) allowed measuring the film hardness and Young's modulus. A ball-cratering tribometer {{was used to determine}} the micro-abrasion laboratorial wear resistance, under different tests conditions, using SiC particles in distilled water slurry. At the end of these tests, the worn surfaces were analyzed by SEM and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) in order to compare these results with some other coatings already tested in the same conditions. To test the practical wear resistance, 135000 injection cycles were done in a plastic injection industrial <b>mould.</b> <b>Coated</b> samples were put on the plastic feed canal, after a turbulent zone. In these tests, a 30 % (wt) glass fibres reinforced polypropylene was used. Worn sample surfaces were analyzed by SEM after 45. 000 and 90. 000 cycles. Image analyses were made in order to evaluate the damage increases and to observe the wear mechanisms involved...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Nickel based {{superalloys}} {{are widely}} used for turbine and stator blades of compressor in aero-engines. The objective of this work {{is to determine the}} influence of the inoculant’s content (cobalt aluminate) in the surface layer of the ceramic mould on the microstructure and mechanical properties of high temperature creep resisting superalloy René 77. Design/methodology/approach: Experimentally investigated castings have been made of commercially produced nickel superalloy René 77. Stepped and cylindrical samples have been casted for: microstructure and mechanical examinations. During preparation of ceramic face mould, it has been added the suitably inoculant’s content of: 0, 5, 10 % mass in zirconium flour. The microstructure analysis has been made by the use of light microscopy. Verification of the influence of CoAl 2 O 4 on the mechanical properties of castings has been investigated on the basis of results obtained form tensile and creep tests. Findings: Modification of the face <b>coat</b> of ceramic <b>mould</b> results in the reduction of the grains size of γ matrix and disintegration of carbide precipitates. It results in the improvement of mechanical properties of the alloy. On the grounds of the obtained results, {{it was found that the}} sufficient incoulant concentration in the surface layer of ceramic mould is 5 %mass. Research limitations/implications: As the cost of material and process are very high, the castings were made with only three different contents of cobalt aluminate in the surface layer of ceramic mould. Practical implications: Originality/value: It was revealed, that inoculant content have a significant impact on the microstructure of superalloy René 77 depending on the casting section thickness. It was proved that modification of surface layer of ceramic mould has a positive effect on the mechanical properties of superalloy. The researches allowed to find the optimal concentration of CoAl 2 O 4 in ceramic mould to produce casting elements made from superalloy René 77...|$|R
