5|$|While <b>chromium</b> {{metal and}} Cr(III) ions are not {{considered}} toxic, hexavalent <b>chromium</b> (Cr(VI)) is toxic and carcinogenic. Abandoned <b>chromium</b> production sites often require environmental cleanup.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{mechanism}} in biological roles for <b>chromium</b> is unclear, dietary supplements for <b>chromium</b> include chromium(III) picolinate, chromium(III) polynicotinate, and related materials. The benefit of supplements {{has not been}} proven.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium</b> {{content of}} common foods is {{generally}} low (1-13 micrograms per serving). <b>Chromium</b> content of food varies widely due {{to differences in}} soil mineral content, growing season, plant cultivar, and contamination during processing. In addition, large amounts of <b>chromium</b> (and nickel) leach into food cooked in stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium</b> is {{a member}} of Group 6, of the {{transition}} metals. Chromium(0) has an electronic configuration of 3d54s1, owing to the lower energy of the high spin configuration. <b>Chromium</b> exhibits a wide range of oxidation states, with +3 the most stable; the +3 and +6 states are the most common in <b>chromium</b> compounds, while +1, +4 and +5 are rare.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium</b> is the 22nd most {{abundant}} element in Earth's crust {{with an average}} concentration of 100 ppm. <b>Chromium</b> compounds {{are found in the}} environment from the erosion of chromium-containing rocks, and can be redistributed by volcanic eruptions. Typical background concentrations of <b>chromium</b> in environmental media are: atmosphere <10 ng m−3; soil <500 mg kg−1; vegetation <0.5 mg kg−1; freshwater <10 ug L−1; seawater <1 ug L−1; sediment <80 mg kg−1.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium</b> was {{discovered}} {{as an element}} after {{it came to the}} attention of the Western world in the red crystalline mineral crocoite (lead(II) chromate), discovered in 1761 and initially used as a pigment. Nearly all <b>chromium</b> is commercially extracted from the single commercially viable ore chromite, which is iron <b>chromium</b> oxide (FeCr2O4). Chromite is now the principal source of <b>chromium</b> for pigments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium,</b> use of: The use of <b>chromium</b> {{was invented}} in China no later than 210 BC when the Terracotta Army was interred at a site not far from modern Xi'an; modern archaeologists {{discovered}} that bronze-tipped crossbow bolts at the site {{showed no sign of}} corrosion after more than 2,000 years, because they had been coated in <b>chromium.</b> <b>Chromium</b> was not used anywhere else until the experiments of French pharmacist and chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763–1829) in the late 1790s.|$|E
5|$|Ferrochromium alloy is commercially {{produced}} from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and <b>chromium</b> metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium. <b>Chromium</b> metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development was {{the discovery that}} steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic <b>chromium</b> to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with <b>chromium)</b> together comprise 85% of the commercial use.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, Louis Nicolas Vauquelin {{received}} {{samples of}} crocoite ore. He produced <b>chromium</b> trioxide (CrO3) by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid. In 1798, Vauquelin {{discovered that he}} could isolate metallic <b>chromium</b> by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven, {{for which he is}} credited as the discoverer of the element. Vauquelin was also able to detect traces of <b>chromium</b> in precious gemstones, such as ruby or emerald.|$|E
5|$|After {{nickel and}} <b>chromium,</b> cobalt {{is a major}} cause of contact dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|Although rare, {{deposits}} of native <b>chromium</b> exist. The Udachnaya Pipe in Russia produces {{samples of the}} native metal. This mine is a kimberlite pipe, rich in diamonds, and the reducing environment helped produce both elemental <b>chromium</b> and diamond.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>chromium</b> {{compounds}} {{were used}} in dyes, paints, and leather tanning compounds, these compounds are often found in soil and groundwater at abandoned industrial sites, now needing environmental cleanup and remediation. Primer paint containing hexavalent <b>chromium</b> is still widely used for aerospace and automobile refinishing applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium</b> deficiency, {{involving}} {{a lack of}} Cr(III) in the body, or perhaps some complex of it, such as glucose tolerance factor is controversial. Some {{studies suggest that the}} biologically active form of <b>chromium</b> (III) in an oligopeptide called low-molecular-weight chromium-binding substance (LMWCr), which might {{play a role in the}} insulin signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It {{is the first}} element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle metal which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point. The name of the element {{is derived from the}} Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color, because many <b>chromium</b> compounds are intensely colored.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium</b> is {{also known}} for its luster when polished. It {{is used as a}} {{protective}} and decorative coating on car parts, plumbing fixtures, furniture parts and many other items, usually applied by electroplating. <b>Chromium</b> was used for electroplating as early as 1848, but this use only became widespread with the development of an improved process in 1924.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium</b> metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated <b>chromium</b> is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. <b>Chromium</b> metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium</b> oxides {{are also}} used as a green color in glassmaking and as a glaze in ceramics. Green <b>chromium</b> oxide is {{extremely}} light-fast and as such is used in cladding coatings. It is also the main ingredient in infrared reflecting paints, used by the armed forces, to paint vehicles, {{to give them the}} same IR reflectance as green leaves.|$|E
5|$|During the 1800s, <b>chromium</b> was {{primarily}} {{used as a}} component of paints and in tanning salts. At first, crocoite from Russia was the main source, but in 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near Baltimore, United States. This made the United States the largest producer of <b>chromium</b> products till 1848 when large deposits of chromite were found near Bursa, Turkey.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of pure <b>chromium,</b> the iron must {{be separated from the}} <b>chromium</b> in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The <b>chromium</b> is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the dietary}} {{guidelines}} for daily <b>chromium</b> intake were lowered in 2001 from 50–200 µg {{for an adult}} to 35µg (adult male) and to 25µg (adult female). In 2014, the European Food Safety Authority published a report stating that the intake of chromium(III) has no beneficial effect on healthy people, thus the Panel removed <b>chromium</b> {{from the list of}} nutrients and essential elements.|$|E
5|$|In {{the form}} {{trivalent}} <b>chromium,</b> Cr(III), or Cr3+, <b>chromium</b> {{was identified as}} an essential nutrient in the late 1950s and later accepted as a trace element for its roles in the action of insulin, a hormone critical to the metabolism and storage of carbohydrate, fat and protein. The precise mechanism of its actions in the body, however, have not been fully defined, leaving in question whether <b>chromium</b> is essential for healthy people.|$|E
5|$|Many chromium(0) {{compounds}} are known. Most are derivatives of <b>chromium</b> hexacarbonyl or bis(benzene)chromium.|$|E
5|$|Natural rubies are {{corundum}} (aluminum oxide) crystals {{that are}} colored red (the rarest type) due to <b>chromium</b> (III) ions (other colors of corundum gems are termed sapphires). A red-colored artificial ruby {{may also be}} achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial corundum crystals, thus making <b>chromium</b> a requirement for making synthetic rubies. Such a synthetic ruby crystal {{was the basis for}} the first laser, produced in 1960, which relied on stimulated emission of light from the <b>chromium</b> atoms in such a crystal.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>chromium</b> {{compounds}} {{are used}} as catalysts for processing hydrocarbons. For example, the Phillips catalyst, prepared from <b>chromium</b> oxides, {{is used for the}} production of about half the world's polyethylene. Fe-Cr mixed oxides are employed as high-temperature catalysts for the water gas shift reaction. Copper chromite is a useful hydrogenation catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Such oxidations require metal catalyst, {{such as the}} {{naphthenate}} salts of manganese, cobalt, and <b>chromium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The green {{color in}} gem-quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of <b>chromium</b> (about 2% for emerald).|$|E
5|$|The high {{toxicity}} of Cr(VI) compounds, {{used in the}} established <b>chromium</b> electroplating process, and the strengthening of safety and environmental regulations demand a search for substitutes for <b>chromium</b> {{or at least a}} change to less toxic chromium(III) compounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made <b>chromium</b> an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% <b>chromium.</b> Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when <b>chromium</b> is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% <b>chromium.</b> Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{products}} of <b>chromium</b> ore refining are ferrochromium and metallic <b>chromium.</b> For those products the ore smelter process differs considerably. For {{the production of}} ferrochromium, the chromite ore (FeCr2O4) is reduced in large scale in electric arc furnace or in smaller smelters with either aluminium or silicon in an aluminothermic reaction.|$|E
5|$|Trivalent <b>chromium</b> {{occurs in}} trace amounts in foods, wine and water. In contrast, {{hexavalent}} <b>chromium</b> (Cr(VI) or Cr6+) is highly toxic and mutagenic when inhaled. Ingestion of chromium(VI) in {{water has been}} linked to stomach tumors, and it may also cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium</b> is {{remarkable}} for its magnetic properties: {{it is the}} only elemental solid which shows antiferromagnetic ordering at room temperature (and below). Above 38°C, it changes to paramagnetic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromium,</b> arsenic, cadmium, mercury, {{and lead}} have the {{greatest}} potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use, the toxicity {{of some of their}} combined or elemental forms, and their widespread distribution in the environment. Hexavalent <b>chromium,</b> for example, is highly toxic as are mercury vapour and many mercury compounds. These five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur; in the human body they usually bind, via thiol groups (–SH), to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions. The resulting sulfur-metal bonds inhibit the proper functioning of the enzymes involved; human health deteriorates, sometimes fatally. <b>Chromium</b> (in its hexavalent form) and arsenic are carcinogens; cadmium causes a degenerative bone disease; and mercury and lead damage the central nervous system.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Turkey was a buyer, with 35 Panzer IV {{received}} until 4 May 1944 {{in exchange}} for some <b>chromium.</b> Delivery began with the Ausf G and probably went on with Ausf H versions.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>chromium</b> {{and some}} other {{transition}} metals, molybdenum forms quadruple bonds, such as in Mo2(CH3COO)4. This compound can be transformed into Mo2Cl84−, which also has a quadruple bond.|$|E
5|$|Metal alloys {{account for}} 85% {{of the use}} of <b>chromium.</b> The {{remainder}} is used in the chemical, refractory, and foundry industries.|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium is {{the fourth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 6 in the periodic table, below <b>chromium,</b> molybdenum, and tungsten. All {{the members of the}} group form a diversity of oxoanions. They readily portray their group oxidation state of +6, although this is highly oxidising in the case of <b>chromium,</b> and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended: indeed, tungsten is the last of the 5d transition metals where all four 5d electrons participate in metallic bonding. As such, seaborgium should have +6 as its most stable oxidation state, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, and this is the only oxidation state that is experimentally known for it; the +5 and +4 states should be less stable and the +3 state, the most common for <b>chromium,</b> would be the least stable for seaborgium. Experimental chemical investigation has been hampered due to the need to produce seaborgium one atom at a time, its short half-life, and the resulting necessary harshness of the experimental conditions.|$|E
