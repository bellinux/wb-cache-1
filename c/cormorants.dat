5|$|Rasmussen’s {{early work}} was largely focused on {{studies of the}} systematics, ecology and {{behaviour}} of Patagonian seabirds, notably <b>cormorants.</b> She studied plumage variations in juvenile blue-eyed, king and red-legged <b>cormorants,</b> and used plumage and behavioural patterns to establish relationships between king and blue-eyed shags. She also reviewed the fishing activity of olivaceous <b>cormorants.</b>|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape {{region of}} South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation {{of the eggs}} and chicks of guano-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially crowned <b>cormorants,</b> Cape <b>cormorants</b> and bank <b>cormorants.</b> This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.|$|E
5|$|Cormorant {{fishing is}} a {{traditional}} fishing method in which trained <b>cormorants</b> are used to catch fish in rivers. Historically, cormorant fishing {{has taken place in}} Japan and China since about 960 AD.|$|E
50|$|The red-legged <b>cormorant</b> (Phalacrocorax gaimardi) {{also known}} as the red-legged shag, red-footed <b>cormorant,</b> red-footed shag, Gaimard’s <b>cormorant</b> and grey <b>cormorant,</b> is a {{resident}} of the coastline of South America. It is non-colonial unlike most seabirds. The red-legged <b>cormorant</b> has not been observed wing-spreading, which is unusual among <b>cormorant</b> species.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{birds have}} been recorded at Shag Island: great <b>cormorant,</b> little black <b>cormorant,</b> pied <b>cormorant,</b> little pied <b>cormorant,</b> red-necked stint, sharp-tailed sandpiper, red-capped plover, banded stilt, bar-tailed godwit, grey plover, common greenshank and masked lapwing.|$|R
50|$|The {{target species}} are {{primarily}} the double-crested <b>cormorant</b> in North America {{and the great}} <b>cormorant</b> in Europe, Japan and Australia. The little black <b>cormorant</b> has also been targeted in Australia. In Africa, the reed <b>cormorant</b> is targeted and shot.|$|R

5|$|Killer {{whales in}} many areas may prey on <b>cormorants</b> and gulls. A captive killer whale at MarineLand {{discovered}} it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Phalacrocoracidae is {{a family}} of medium to large coastal, {{fish-eating}} seabirds that includes <b>cormorants</b> and shags. Plumage coloration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colorful.|$|E

5|$|The Phalacrocoracidae are {{a family}} of medium to large coastal, {{fish-eating}} seabirds that includes <b>cormorants</b> and shags. Plumage colouration varies; the majority of species have mainly dark plumage, but some are pied black and white, and a few are more colourful.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the <b>cormorants</b> and some terns, and in common with most other birds, all seabirds have waterproof plumage. However, compared to land birds, they have far more feathers protecting their bodies. This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet, and cold is kept out by a dense layer of down feathers. The <b>cormorants</b> possess a layer of unique feathers that retain a smaller layer of air (compared to other diving birds) but otherwise soak up water. This allows them to swim without fighting the buoyancy that retaining air in the feathers causes, yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water.|$|E
5|$|Animals, and {{products}} made from them, {{are used to}} assist in hunting. People have used hunting dogs to help chase down animals such as deer, wolves, and foxes; birds of prey from eagles to small falcons are used in falconry, hunting birds or mammals; and tethered <b>cormorants</b> {{have been used to}} catch fish.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cormorants</b> are {{medium to}} large aquatic birds with mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} {{coloured}} skin on the face. The bill is long, thin and sharply hooked for catching fish and aquatic invertebrates. They nest in colonies, usually by the sea. There are about 39 species worldwide, with two recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cormorants</b> are medium-to-large aquatic birds, {{usually with}} mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} {{coloured}} skin on the face. The bill is long, thin and sharply hooked. Their feet are four-toed and webbed, a distinguishing feature among the Pelecaniformes order. Four species occur in Tasmania, with a fifth as a vagrant.|$|E
5|$|Among pterodactyloids {{a greater}} {{variation}} in diet is present. Pteranodontia contained many piscivorous taxa, such as ornithocheirans, boreopterids, pteranodontids and nyctosaurids. Some amount of niche partitioning {{seems to have}} been present: ornithocheirans and the later nyctosaurs were aerial dip-feeders like today's frigatebirds, while boreopterids were freshwater diving animals similar to <b>cormorants</b> or Platanista river dolphins, and pteranodonts were pelagic plunge-divers akin to boobies and gannets. The biggest exception among this group are the istiodactylids, which were likely primarily scavengers.|$|E
