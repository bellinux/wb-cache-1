40|$|Abridged) The {{properties}} of stellar <b>clumps</b> in star forming galaxies and their evolution over the redshift range 2 ≲ z ≲ 6 are presented and {{discussed in the}} context of the build-up of massive galaxies at early cosmic times. We use HST/ACS images of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) to identify <b>clumps</b> within a 20 kpc radius. We find that the population of galaxies with more than one <b>clump</b> is dominated by galaxies with two <b>clumps,</b> representing ∼ 21 - 25 % of the population, while the fraction of galaxies with 3, or 4 and more, <b>clumps</b> is 8 - 11 and 7 - 9 %, respectively. The fraction of clumpy galaxies is in the range ∼ 35 - 55 % over 2 <z< 6, increasing at higher redshifts, indicating that the fraction of irregular galaxies remains high up to the highest redshifts. The large and bright <b>clumps</b> (M_∼ 10 ^ 9 up to ∼ 10 ^ 10 M_) are found to reside predominantly in galaxies with two <b>clumps.</b> Smaller and lower luminosity <b>clumps</b> (_ 10 (M_/M_) < 9) are found in galaxies with three <b>clumps</b> or more. We interpret these results as evidence for two different modes of <b>clump</b> formation working in parallel. The small low luminosity <b>clumps</b> are likely the result of disc fragmentation, with violent disc instabilities (VDI) forming several long-lived <b>clumps</b> in-situ, as suggested from simulations. A fraction of these <b>clumps</b> is also likely coming from minor mergers. The <b>clumps</b> in the dominating population of galaxies with two <b>clumps</b> are significantly more massive and have properties akin to those in merging pairs observed at similar redshifts; they appear as more massive than the most massive <b>clumps</b> observed in VDI numerical simulations.

These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease.

Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|In general, in the Solar System, {{planetary}} {{formation is}} thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets. During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the <b>clumping</b> of small particles, which gradually increased in size.

In the DYNAMO- HST sample we measure <b>clump</b> diameters spanning the range d_clump∼ 100 - 800 pc, and individual <b>clump</b> star formation rates as high as ∼ 5 M_ yr^- 1. DYNAMO <b>clumps</b> have very high SFR surface densities, Σ_SFR∼ 15 M_ yr^- 1 kpc^- 2, ∼ 100 × higher than in H ii regions of nearby spirals. Indeed, SFR surface density provides a simple dividing line between massive star forming <b>clumps</b> and local star forming regions, where massive star forming <b>clumps</b> have Σ_SFR> 0. 5 M_ yr^- 1 kpc^- 2. When degraded to match the observations of galaxies in z∼ 1 - 3 surveys, DYNAMO galaxies are similar in morphology and measured <b>clump</b> properties to clumpy galaxies observed in the high-z Universe. Emission peaks in the simulated high-redshift maps typically correspond to multiple <b>clumps</b> in full resolution images. This clustering of <b>clumps</b> systematically increases the apparent size and SFR of <b>clumps</b> in 1 kpc resolution maps, and decreases the measured SFR surface density of <b>clumps</b> by as much as a factor of 20 ×.

5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. <b>Clumping</b> in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit.

The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E
