40|$|Abstract—The evaluative <b>categorizations</b> that {{underlie}} affective and attitudinal judgments have often heen equated with non-evaluative <b>categorizations</b> despite the central importance of evaluative processes for survival. In the present experiment, a late positive potential (LPP) of the event-related hrain potential elicited when participants evahiatively categorized food items as positive or nonpositive was {{compared with the}} LPP elicited when participants semantically (i. e [...] nonevaluativelyl catego-rized food items as vegetable or nonvegetahle. Results revealed that evaluative <b>categorizations</b> evoked an LPP that was rela-tively larger over the right than the left scalp regions compared with the LPP evoked hy nonevaluative <b>categorizations.</b> This finding provides evidence regarding the differences in neural and cognitive processes involved in evaluative and nonevalua-tive <b>categorizations...</b>|$|R
40|$|World Heritage (WH) is an {{organization}} which aims at preserving particularly interesting areas, monuments etc. Each of these “sites ” are described on a website. In order to help users navigate the existing World Heritage website, some <b>categorizations</b> have been created. For instance {{it is possible to}} browse categories based on location or site type. It is difficult to make good <b>categorizations</b> and take advantage of the possibilities that they offer. But good <b>categorizations</b> expresses a lot of information about the sites that they cover. <b>Categorizations</b> {{can be used to make}} some complex queries. For example it is possible to suggest sites that are related to each other based on some category property. The goal of this project is to explore the possibilities that emerging XML technologies offer, and based on the technologies suggest a way of making <b>categorizations</b> of semistructured data. Furthermore we explore the possibilities that <b>categorizations</b> of semistructured data offer, and create a framework that supports easy generatio...|$|R
40|$|Nelson, and Yaacov Trope {{on earlier}} {{versions}} of the manuscript. 2 We find that exposure to broad versus narrow <b>categorizations</b> in a task alters consumers’ information processing styles, which in turn alters their categorizing and purchasing behavior {{in a variety of}} subsequent and unrelated tasks, from basic cognitive behaviors (e. g., grouping), and consumer decisions (e. g., new product adoptions), to more general decision making strategies (e. g., susceptibility to heuristics). Consumers previously exposed to a decision context with broad <b>categorizations</b> adopt a more lenient, and tolerant processing orientation. In contrast, consumers previously exposed to a decision context with narrow <b>categorizations</b> adopt a careful and critical processing orientation. Consequently, prior exposure to broad <b>categorizations</b> leads to greater susceptibility to many context effects and decision heuristics, whereas prior exposure to narrow <b>categorizations</b> leads to more careful and considered decisions, invariable across contexts. 3 The world that consumers encounter comprises a vast collection of objects and events that can be infinitely partitioned, generalized, or categorized. Changing the characteristics of these externally imposed <b>categorizations</b> in the decision environment can significantly influenc...|$|R
5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise <b>categorization</b> or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is that there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E

40|$|Faultlines—hypothetical {{dividing}} lines splitting a group into homogeneous subgroups {{based on}} the distribution of demographic attributes—are frequently assumed to be detrimental to group outcomes because they operationalize social <b>categorizations.</b> However, a literature review indicates that this is not always the case. We argue that diversity faultlines and social <b>categorizations</b> are not necessarily the same and that the effect of diversity faultlines is moderated by perceived social <b>categorizations.</b> To test this proposition, we assigned 172 participants to groups of four. Participant gender, bogus personality feedback, seating position, and colored cards were employed to create two diversity faultline conditions (weak and strong faultline). Groups worked on the Survive in the Desert task, and their interactions were coded with the discussion coding system (DCS). Social <b>categorizations</b> were elicited using a newly developed measure that requires participants to specify subjectively perceived salient categories. Participants stated many socia...|$|R

5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the <b>categorization</b> of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble categorized M87 {{as one of}} {{the brighter}} globular nebulae, as it lacked any spiral structure, but appeared to belong to the same family of non-galactic nebulae as spiral nebulae. In 1926 he produced a new <b>categorization</b> of nebulae, with M87 being classified as a type of elliptical extra-galactic nebula with no apparent elongation (class E0). By 1931, Hubble had identified M87 {{as a member of the}} Virgo Cluster, for which he gave a provisional estimate of 1.8 million parsecs from Earth. At the time it was the only known example of an elliptical nebula for which individual stars could be resolved. M87 continued to be called an extragalactic nebula for many years thereafter, but by 1956 it had been identified as an E0-type galaxy.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries {{of the security}} forces were brought to court in the process of de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a coincidence that the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the <b>categorization</b> {{of the security forces}} as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents of the security forces.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{investigations}} of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object <b>categorization,</b> and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television {{programs such as}} Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.|$|E
5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. <b>Categorization</b> for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The idiopathic (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E

Their primary deity, generally known as Jehovah1, is cast as an extraterrestrial, who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television. Jehovah1 gave him supernatural knowledge {{of the past and}} future, in addition to incredible power. Dobbs then posed deep questions to the alien, receiving mysterious answers. Some of their discussion centered on a powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world.|$|E
