5|$|Caltrans {{engineer}} Jacob Dekema {{announced in}} April1969 that construction on SR76 {{and the nearby}} SR 78 between I-5 and US395 would be delayed until work was underway on I-5 and US395 was underway, or at least until 1976. Nevertheless, a widening project was commissioned in 1970 between Pauma Reservation Road and Cole Grade Road, well east of US395. The next year, construction began on a new interchange between the future routing of SR76 and I-5, near Oceanside Harbor and Camp Del Mar in Camp Pendleton. The expansion of SR76 appeared on the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Planning</b> Organization (CPO) regional government plan in late 1974. At that time, there was an effort by the City of Oceanside to have SR76 included as a scenic highway, but SR76 has not {{been included in the}} system. The Chamber of Commerce decided to continue efforts to have SR76 expanded at the end of 1974.|$|E
5|$|In January of the {{following}} year, state Assemblyman Wadie Deddeh proposed legislation to remove the southern portion of SR 125 from the state highway plans again. Soon afterward, the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Planning</b> Organization (CPO) moved to support retaining SR 125 from Poway to Santee in the county transportation plan, despite opposition from a county supervisor and the mayor of Escondido. Deddeh's bill passed the state Assembly Transportation Committee a month later; in the meeting, Deddeh noted the construction of I-805 to handle the traffic demands of the region, {{as well as a}} lack of funding that would result in the construction being delayed for at least 20 years. Despite a petition from the mayor of Escondido, the CPO again declined to remove SR 125 from the county transportation plan in March.|$|E
5|$|Following this, in 1972, the {{legislature}} {{added a new}} SR117, which extended this part of SR75 southwest to the Mexican border near Border Field State Park, to the state highway system, and a southerly extension of SR125 to the border at Otay Mesa to the state highway and Freeway and Expressway systems. Two years later, planning began {{for the construction of}} the Otay Mesa crossing and the construction of SR75 to connect it to I-5 and I-805. Later, the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Planning</b> Organization (CPO), the local association of municipal governments, recommended using $4million of federal funding for the construction of SR75. The CPO later endorsed expediting construction of the freeway before completion of the border crossing, so that the freeway would primarily serve border traffic, thus preventing land speculation in Otay Mesa. While Mexican authorities wanted the crossing constructed in 1975, the CPO indicated that the funding for SR75 would not be available until at least 1980, or even 1985. Following this, Representative Lionel Van Deerlin attempted to accelerate the construction of the crossing, even though there was no funding for the highway.|$|E

25|$|The {{planning}} for the San Diego Trolley began in 1966 {{under the auspices of}} the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Planning</b> Organization (CPO), an intergovernmental agency of 13 cities and San Diego County. San Diego's streetcar system had been replaced with buses in 1949. In 1966 the local bus company, San Diego Transit, was facing a financial crisis and public takeover. The CPO developed a mass-transit plan to address the long-range transportation issues of the metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|Urban planning, the {{application}} of forethought to city design, involves optimizing land use, transportation, utilities, and other basic systems, {{in order to achieve}} certain objectives. Urban planners and scholars have proposed overlapping theories as ideals for how plans should be formed. Planning tools, beyond the original design of the city itself, include public capital investment in infrastructure and land-use controls such as zoning. The continuous process of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>planning</b> involves identifying general objectives as well as collecting data to evaluate progress and inform future decisions.|$|E

500|$|Progressive Era reformers {{sought to}} improve {{municipal}} government by such changes as the commission system, city planning, and zoning controls. The interests of white business and residential districts were protected, but sometimes {{at the expense}} of blacks who lived in segregated neighborhoods. Fairbanks (1999) explores the changing assumptions about city planning and government among the city's leaders. [...] Dissatisfied with its haphazard development they endorsed centralized planning and wrote and secured the adoption of a new charter and set up a board of commissioners. The commission structure, however, caused government officials to view the city in separate parts rather than as a whole. By the 1920s supporters of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>planning</b> were calling for a program that included adoption of council-manager government, a citywide zoning policy, and public funds for improvements in parks, sewers, schools, and city streets. Voters approved the bond proposals and charter amendments in 1927 and 1930. Dallas thus achieved a more coordinated government which was theoretically more aware of the city's needs and more able to treat those needs equally {{for the benefit of the}} city as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969 the Oregon Legislature passed initial {{legislature}} {{attempting to}} increase the level of state oversight of the land-use planning process. The law, remembered as Senate Bill 10 (SB 10), mandated that every city and county government {{in the state to}} adopt a comprehensive land-use plan and to establish [...] "border-to-border" [...] zoning of its jurisdiction by the end of 1971. SB 10 originated in the powerful Senate Agriculture Committee with farmland preservation in clear view and was firmly supported by Tom McCall, the state's progressive Republican governor, for whom environmental and livability issues were matters of primary importance. The passage of this legislation made Oregon the first state in the union to universally require local zoning ordinances and the second to mandate <b>comprehensive</b> <b>planning.</b>|$|E
