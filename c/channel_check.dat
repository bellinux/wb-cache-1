5000|$|For their 1000 EX and 1000 HX models, Tandy Computer {{designed}} the PLUS expansion interface, {{an adaptation of}} the XT-bus supporting cards of a smaller form factor. Because it is electrically compatible with the XT bus (a.k.a. 8-bit ISA or XT-ISA), a passive adapter {{can be made to}} connect XT cards to a PLUS expansion connector. Another feature of PLUS cards is that they are stackable. Another bus that offered stackable expansion modules was the [...] "sidecar" [...] bus used by the IBM PCjr. This may have been electrically the same as or similar to the XT bus; it most certainly had some similarities since both essentially exposed the 8088 CPU's address and data buses, with some buffering and latching, the addition of interrupts and DMA provided by Intel add-on chips, and a few system fault detection lines (Power Good, Memory Check, I/O <b>Channel</b> <b>Check).</b> Again, PCjr sidecars are not technically expansion cards, but expansion modules, with the only difference being that the sidecar is an expansion card enclosed in a plastic box (with holes exposing the connectors).|$|E
40|$|A rise in base level, as {{behind a}} check dam, causes {{deposition}} of sediment. When deposition is complete, the gradient of the deposited surface {{is only about}} half that of the original channel. This new gradient does not increase with time. No known method of computation explains how incoming sediment is transported over the low gradient zone of deposition. THE PROBLEM When a check dam is built across a channel, sediment accumulates behind it in a wedge, decreasing in thick-ness upstream. When complete, this wedge of deposi-tion has a surface gradient about 50 % of the gradient of the original or undammed <b>channel.</b> <b>Check</b> dams have been built from the earliest period when agriculture was practiced.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} morphologic changes of channels resulted from establishing check dam construction in Chehel cheshme watershed located at Fars Province. In this study, five <b>channels</b> with <b>check</b> dams were selected through the study area. Then some morphologic parameters of channels such as width/depth ratio, the maximum depth and cross section area along the <b>channel</b> on which <b>check</b> dam were constructed had been measured. These measurements were made on 6 cross section areas in 10, 50 and 90 % distances from check dams at upstream and downstream. The above mentioned parameters were calculated using calculating and graphic soft wares. Then, some analytical methods were used to estimate and compare the average digital numbers of calculated parameters through different channels. The results showed that check dams have definitely influenced on width/depth ratios at their upstream and downstream. These influences are associated with higher width/depth ratios at upstream and lower width/depth ratio at downstream. Furthermore, the maximum depth of channels had significant influenced by check dams. As for cross section areas, no significant difference existed between cross sections through total <b>channels</b> and <b>check</b> dams...|$|R

40|$|This note {{addresses}} the potential legality or illegality of channel checking {{in the context}} of a private equity buyout.

In Part IV, this note applies the analysis from Part III to the hypothetical described in Part II. Part IV attempts to reach a conclusion about whether the private equity acquirer, who engages in channel checking, could be found liable for insider trading given the current law. Part IV asks whether channel checkers should face potential insider trading liability, and concludes that the SEC’s newfound focus on channel checking should be directed to regulating more harmful conduct...|$|E
40|$|In early April 2010, ATLAS {{collected}} {{several million}} of minimum bias events at {{a center of}} mass energy of 7 TeV.

The amount of material of the inner detector services running at constant phi in front of the barrel calorimeter, representing ~ 0. 2 X 0, is found in good agreement between data and simulations. Up to 1 X 0 lack of material in the ATLAS description has been observed in the localised regions close to the rails supporting the inner detector, which can be fed into new Monte Carlo geometry...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} how the exchange-rate regime of Argentina and Mexico shaped {{macroeconomic}} performance over the period 1994 - 2001. The purpose of the analysis is to draw lessons for Latin American and other countries on whether and how {{the choice of the}} exchange-rate regime can help sustained growth. As it is impossible to isolate the growth effect of the exchange-rate regime in a comparative country study, the paper emphasises those macro variables that have been identified in the theoretical and empirical literature as important channels through which the choice of the regime affects economic performance: a) investment, b) trade openness, c) capital flows and d) fiscal or institutional rigidities and public debt sustainability.
