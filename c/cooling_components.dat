Central <b>cool</b> gas <b>component</b> that {{is often}} {{observed}} from a well-relaxed cluster system has long been interpreted {{as a consequence of}} “Cooling Flow ” (CF), radiative cooling followed by inflow of Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM).

40|$|Galaxy cluster mass {{distributions}} {{offer an}} important {{test of the}} cold dark matter picture of structure formation, and may even contain clues {{about the nature of}} dark matter. X-ray imaging spectroscopy of relaxed systems can map cluster dark matter distributions, but are usually complicated by the presence of central <b>cool</b> <b>components</b> in the intracluster medium. Here we describe a statistically correct approach to distinguishing amongst simple alternative models of the <b>cool</b> <b>component,</b> and apply it to one cluster. We also present mass profiles and central density slopes for five clusters derived from Chandra data, and illustrate how assumptions about the <b>cool</b> <b>component</b> affect the resulting mass profiles.

50|$|While {{in earlier}} {{personal}} computers {{it was possible}} to cool most components using natural convection (passive cooling), many modern components require more effective active cooling.

Fan control is not always an automatic process. A computer's BIOS (basic input/output system) can control the speed of the built in fan system for the computer.
