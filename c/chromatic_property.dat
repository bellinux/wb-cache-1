40|$|Removal of rain streaks {{in video}} is a {{challenging}} problem {{due to the}} random spatial distribution and fast motion of rain. This paper presents a new rain removal algorithm that incorporates both temporal and chromatic properties of rain in video. The temporal property states that an image pixel is never always covered by rain throughout the entire video. The <b>chromatic</b> <b>property</b> states that the changes of R, G, and B values of rainaffected pixels are approximately the same. By using both properties, the algorithm can detect and remove rain streaks in both stationary and dynamic scenes taken by stationary cameras. To handle videos taken by moving cameras, the video can be stabilized for rain removal, and destabilized to restore camera motion after rain removal. It can handle both light rain and heavy rain conditions. Experimental {{results show that the}} algorithm performs better than existing algorithms. 1...|$|E
40|$|In outdoor {{environment}} vision system, weather {{effects are}} complex noise. They degrade {{the performance of}} vision algorithm such as feature detection, segmentation and object recognition. Removal of rain streaks in video is a challenging problem due to the random spatial distribution and fast motion of rain but removal of rain from image is more challenging. As we know, each drop refracts and reflects the environment, producing sharp intensity changes in an pixel in video. We can get the original value of pixel from one frame of the video or the other but in case of single frame i. e. image, we cannot get the original value of pixel if once corrupted either with rain, fog, mist, snow. In this paper we have used histogram method and MSRCR method to remove rain from image {{on the basis of}} <b>chromatic</b> <b>property</b> of rain. After comparing the results we come to know that histogram method is giving more efficient results in comparison with other algorithm.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{interaction}} between the <b>chromatic</b> and temporal <b>properties</b> of parvocellular (P) neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaque monkeys. We measured the amplitudes and phases of responses to stimulation by spatially uniform fields modulated sinusoidally about a white point in a three-dimensional color space, at a range of temporal frequencies between 1 and 25 Hz. Below about 4 Hz, temporal frequency had relatively little effect on chromatic tuning. At higher frequencies chromatic opponency was weakened in almost all cells. The complex interactions between temporal and <b>chromatic</b> <b>properties</b> are represented by a linear filter model that describes response amplitude and phase as a function of temporal frequency and direction in color space along which stimuli are modulated. The model stipulates the cone inputs to center and surround, their temporal properties, and the linear combination of center and surround signals. It predicts the amplitudes and phases of responses of P-cells, and the change of <b>chromatic</b> <b>properties</b> with temporal frequency. We used the model to investigate whether or not the chromatic signature of the surround in a red–green cell could be estimated from the change in the cell’s <b>chromatic</b> <b>properties</b> with temporal frequency. Our findings could be equally well described by mixed cone surrounds as by pure cone surrounds, and we conclude that, with regard to temporal properties, there is no benefit to be gained by segregating cone classes in center and surround...|$|R

40|$|A large {{variety of}} predatory species {{rely on their}} visual {{abilities}} to locate their prey. However, the search for prey may be hampered by prey camouflage. The most prominent example of concealing coloration is background-matching prey coloration characterized by a strong visual resemblance of prey to the background. Even though this principle of camouflage was recognized to efficiently work in predator avoidance a long time ago, the underlying mechanisms are not very well known. In this study, we assessed whether blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) use chromatic cues {{in the search for}} prey. We used two prey types that were achromatically identical but differed in <b>chromatic</b> <b>properties</b> in the UV/blue range and presented them on two achromatically identical backgrounds. The backgrounds had either the same <b>chromatic</b> <b>properties</b> as the prey items (matching combination) or differed in their <b>chromatic</b> <b>properties</b> (mismatching combination). Our results show that birds use chromatic cues in the search for mismatching prey, whereupon chromatic contrast leads to a ‘pop-out’ of the prey item from the background. When prey was presented on a matching background, search times were significantly higher. Interestingly, search for more chromatic prey on the matching background was easier than search for less chromatic prey on the matching background. Our results indicate that birds use both achromatic and chromatic cues when searching for prey, and that the combination of both cues might be helpful in the search task...|$|R

Both neurons, termed TuTu 1 and LoTu 1, arborize in the anterior optic tubercle andrespond to unpolarized light {{as well as to}} polarized light.

Dorsal unpolarized blue light inhibited the neurons, while stimulation from the ipsilateral side resulted in opponent responses to UV light and green light. While LoTu 1 was inhibited by UV light and was excited by green light, one subtype of TuTu 1 was excited by UV and inhibited by green light. In LoTu 1 the sensitivity to polarized light was at least 2 log units higher than the response to unpolarized light stimuli.

Purpose: This work {{provides}} {{an interpretation of the}} <b>chromatic</b> <b>properties</b> of GafChromic™EBT 3 films based on the chemical nature of the polydiacetylene (PDA) molecules formed upon interaction with ionizing radiation. The EBT 3 films become optically less transparent with increasing radiation dose {{as a result of the}} radiation-induced polymerization of diacetylene monomers. In contrast to empirical quantification of the <b>chromatic</b> <b>properties,</b> less attention has been given to the underlying molecular mechanism that induces the strong decrease in transparency. Methods: Unlaminated GafChromic™EBT 3 films were irradiated with a 6 MV photon beam to dose levels up to 20 Gy. The optical absorption properties of the films were investigated using visible (vis) spectroscopy. The presence of PDA molecules in the active layer of the EBT 3 films was investigated using Raman spectroscopy, which probes the vibrational modes of the molecules in the layer. The vibrational modes assigned to PDA’s were used in a theoretical vis-absorption model to fit our experimental vis-absorption spectra. From the fit parameters, one can assess the relative contribution of different PDA conformations and the length distribution of PDA’s in the film. Results: Vis-spectroscopy shows that the optical density increases with dose in the full region of the visible spectrum. The Raman spectrum is dominated by two vibrational modes, most notably by the ν(C≡≡C) and the ν(C==C) stretching modes of the PDA backbone. By fitting the vis-absorption model to experimental spectra, it is found that the active layer contains two distinct PDA conformations with different absorption properties and reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the mean PDA conjugation length is found to be 2 – 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the crystals PDA’s are embedded in. Conclusions: Vis- and Raman spectroscopy provided more insight into the molecular nature of the radiochromic properties of EBT 3 films through the identification of the excited states of PDA and the presence of two PDA conformations. The improved knowledge on the molecular composition of EBT 3 ’s active layer provides a framework for future fundamental modeling of the dose–response. status: publishe...|$|R
