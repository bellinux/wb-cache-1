Oxide deposits were found on internal surface of tubes. Deposits created significant resistance to heat transfer and resulted in undesirable rise in component temperature. This situation, in turn, aggravated the condition of gas side that was exposed to high temperature. Localized heating <b>coarsened</b> <b>carbides</b> as well as propelled precipitation of new brittle phases along grain boundary resulting in embrittlement of tube material. Continuous exposure to high temperature softened the tube material and tube wall was thinned down with bulging toward outside. Creep void formation along grain boundary was observed and steered intergranular cracking.

The variation in the normalized acoustic nonlinearity parameter (β/β 0) was interpreted as resulting from microstructural changes supported by the electron microscopy. The β/β 0 of CrMo steel increased abruptly in the initial stage of degradation, and then changed little due to the <b>coarsening</b> of <b>carbide</b> and precipitation of stable M 6 C carbide during isothermal aging.

Most important are the <b>coarsening</b> of the <b>carbide</b> and subgrain structure and grain-boundary cavitation. If creep cavities on grain-boundaries grow by the constrained diffusive mechanism, partly cavitated boundary facets act mechanically like microcracks. Cell models are worked out numerically to {{explore the influence of}} a distribution of microcracks on the constitutive response of a creeping solid. The results confirm the predictions of analytical estimates based on the differential self -consistent method of Rodin and Parks. The Rodin and Parks model is combined with a Chaboche-type model in order to provide a comprehensive model covering primary, secondary and tertiary creep under arbitrary loading conditions.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of tool steels and high-speed steels {{has led to}} a significant increase in alloy additions, such as Co, Cr, Mo, N, V, and W. Knowledge about the phase relations in these multicomponent alloys, that is, the relative stability between different carbides or the solubility of different elements in the carbides and in the matrix phase, is essential for understanding the behaviour of these alloys in heat treatments. This information is also the basis for improving the properties or designing new alloys by controlling the amount of alloying elements. Thermodynamic calculations together with a thermodynamic database is a very powerful and important tool for alloy development of new tool steels and high-speed steels. By thermodynamic calculations one can easily predict how different amounts of alloying elements influence on the stability of different phases. Phase fractions of the individual phases and the solubility of different elements in the phases can be predicted quickly. Thermodynamic calculations {{can also be used to}} find optimised processing temperatures, e. g. for different heat treatments. Combining thermodynamic calculations with kinetic modelling one can also predict the microstructure evolution in different processes such as solidification, dissolution heat treatments, <b>carbide</b> <b>coarsening,</b> and the important tempering step producing secondary carbides. The quality of predictions based on thermodynamic calculations directly depends on the accuracy of the thermodynamic database used. In the present work new experimental phase equilibria information, both in model alloys containing few elements and in commercial alloys, has been determined and was used to evaluate and improve the thermodynamic description. This new experimental investigation was necessary because important information concerning the different carbide systems in tool steels and high-speed steels were lacking. A new thermodynamic database for tool steels and high-speed steels, TOOL 05, has been developed within this thesis. With the new database it is possible to calculate thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria with high accuracy and good reliability. Compared with the previous thermodynamic description the improvements are significant. In addition the composition range of different alloying elements, where reliable results are obtained with the new thermodynamic database, have been widened significantly. As the available kinetic data did not always predict results in agreement with new experiments the database was modified in the present work. By coupling the new thermodynamic description with the new kinetic description accurate diffusion simulations can be performed for <b>carbide</b> <b>coarsening,</b> <b>carbide</b> dissolution and micro segregation during solidification.

In general, at 800 °C the carbide microstructure can still change significantly up to 1000 h of annealing. It is found that a higher carbon concentration promotes the carbide precipitation process and increases the thermal stability of carbides.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{continuation}} of a project to characterise ASTM A 437 Grade B 4 B martensitic stainless steel for use In Hitachi Canadian Industries Ltd’s (HCI) steam turbine casing bolts. ASTM A 437 Grade B 4 B steel is commercially available and was chosen for the study due to its chemical similarity to a proprietary steel currently used by HCI. High creep resistance is essential for any candidate so creep-rupture and creep-strain tests were performed at and above the intended service temperature of 538 °C. Hardness measurements and transmission electron microscopy were performed on the steel in the as-received condition as well as on crept samples to determine the effect of elevated temperature {{on the development of the}} steel’s microstructure. During testing, it was found that ASTM A 437 Grade B 4 B steel has a well defined second stage leading to an abrupt transition into the third stage. The second stage begins in the first 10 % of its creep life, while the third stage begins at 90 % of its creep life. This equates to 5 % and 30 % of the final strain, respectively, with an average final strain of 20 %. Time-to-Rupture data show good similarity to the creep life as predicted using the Larson-Miller method. When plotted, the steady-state creep rate shows a definite correlation between the creep stress and temperature. From this an empirical relationship was developed to predict the steady-state creep rate. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results showed a significant change in the icrostructure between crept and as-received steel. <b>Coarsening</b> of <b>carbides</b> along grain boundaries most likely led to a recovery of the microstructure in the crept samples.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to quantify the effect of oversized solutes on radiation-induced segregation in austenitic stainless steels and to determine the mechanism of this effect. Zr or Hf additions to stainless steels demonstrated a reduction in radiation-induced segregation of Cr and Ni at the grain boundary after proton irradiation at 400 °C and 500 °C to low doses, but the solute effect disappeared at higher doses. Rate theory modeling of RIS incorporated a solute-vacancy trapping mechanism to predict solute effects on RIS. The model showed that RIS is most sensitive to solute-vacancy binding energy. First principles calculations determined a binding energy of 1. 08 eV for Zr and 0. 71 eV for Hf. Model and experiment agreed in showing suppression of Cr depletion at 3 dpa at 400 °C and 1 dpa at 500 °C, and experimental results {{were consistent with the}} model in showing greater effectiveness of Zr relative to Hf due to a larger binding energy. The dislocation loop microstructure was measured at 400 °C, 3 and 7 dpa, and showed a significant decrease in loop density and total loop line length in oversized solute alloys relative to reference alloys. Loop microstructure results were consistent with RIS results by confirming enhanced recombination of point defects by solute-vacancy trapping. Increases in RIS with dose indicated a loss of solute effectiveness, which was consistent with an observed increase in loop line length from 3 to 7 dpa. The loss of solute effectiveness at high dose is attributed to a loss of oversized solute from the matrix due to <b>coarsening</b> of <b>carbide</b> precipitates. X-ray diffraction identified a microstructure with ZrC or HfC precipitates prior to irradiation. Precipitate coarsening was identified as the most likely mechanism for the loss of solute effectiveness on RIS by the following: 1) diffusion analysis suggested significant solute diffusion by the vacancy flux to precipitates on time scales of proton irradiations, and 2) atom probe measurements confirmed the loss of oversized solute in solution as a function of irradiation dose. RIS measurements and subsequent analysis were consistent with the solute-vacancy trapping process as the mechanism for enhanced recombination and RIS suppression...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFerritic and {{martensitic}} {{stainless steels}} are an attractive alternative in vehicle production {{due to their}} inherent corrosion resistance. By the opportunity of press hardening, their strength can be increased to up to 2000 MPa, making them competitors for unalloyed ultra-high strength steels. Welding, nevertheless, requires special care, {{especially when it comes}} to joining of high strength heat treated materials. With an adopted in-line heat treatment of the welds in as-rolled as well as press hardened condition, materials with sufficient fatigue strength and acceptable structural behavior can be produced. Because of microstructural transformations in the base material such as grain <b>coarsening</b> and forced <b>carbide</b> precipitation, the corrosion resistance of the weld zone may be locally impaired.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} work the effect of preheat temperature (20 °C, 80 °C, 120 °C, 2 (X) °C) on cooling rate and consequently on the HAZ microstructures of bead - on - plate submerged arc welds have been investigated for quenched and tempered EM 812 plate steel. Due {{to the development of}} a microstructural gradient across the HAZ, it is difficult to carry out Charpy impact toughness testing on a particular structural region of the HAZ. Weld thermal cycle simulation has been conducted in the current work to reproduce in a bulk form similar microstructures to those in selected sub - regions of the actual weld HAZ. Hardness measurements were carried out for both actual and simulated welds and Charpy impact values were determined for the weld simulation samples. Microstructural comparison of the actual and simulated HAZs showed that simulation was successful. The grain coarsened heat affected zone(GCHAZ) for both actual and simulated welds under pre - heat free conditions consisted of lath martensite or bainitic ferrite with martensite austenite (MA) islands, because of the relatively low (2. 58 kJ / mm) heat - input, and the high hardenabihty of the EM 812 steel. Despite the structural similarity, the prior austenite grain size in the simulated GCHAZ region was about double that in the actual welds. It was also found that increasing the preheat temperature from 20 °C to 200 °C caused a reduction in cooling rate, increased the austenitic transformation temperature and resulted in less lath shaped ferrite. Hardness traverses across the root of the HAZ in the actual welds and along the centre line of the simulated HAZs showed that the HAZ was generally harder than the base plate. Maximum hardness was observed in the grain refined heat affected zone (GRHAZ) instead of the GCHAZ due to transformation of both these regions to similar martensitic / bainitic microstructures and existence of much finer microstructure in GRHAZ. Minimum hardness was observed in the base metal due to over - tempering of the quenched and tempered base plate by <b>coarsening</b> of <b>carbide</b> and recovery of ferrite. The simulated GCHAZ showed the lowest toughness, with the loss of impact toughness being due to large prior austenite grain size which is resulted in a coarse microstructure and high hardness. Increase in the preheat temperature caused reduction in cooling rate with decrease in CVN value, mainly because of formation of a large volume fraction of coarse bainitic product in the GCHAZ. On the other hand, the maximum impact toughness was observed either in the grain refined region, or at the boundary of the partially transformed and grain refined region, which also exhibited the maximum hardness. Both of these effects are due to the structural refinement in this region. The investigation showed that for a heat input of 2. 58 kJ / mm the best HAZ toughness is achieved for zero or low preheat, for conditions where hydrogen pick up is not significant...|$|R
40|$|Bearings are {{employed}} {{in a number of}} applications under extremely demanding conditions. During long operation times, the material undergoes rolling contact fatigue where microstructural damage manifests as dark-etching regions and white-etching areas, which display different properties from the surrounding region. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the mechanisms for such damage and to suggest models that can explain the influence of the initial microstructure and test conditions. In order to appraise the stress state in rolling contacts, two testing techniques were employed and it was examined if the testing methods could reproduce the same damage as in bearing operation. During ball-on-rod fatigue testing, microcracks were generated adjacent to inclusions and some were decorated with white-etching areas. Repetitive push tests showed a similar extent of subsurface hardening compared to the ball-on-rod tests, and allowed the strain per stress cycle to be measured. The microstructural alterations in a white-etching area were studied both on a macroscale and on an atomic-scale. The degree of stress concentration near a microcrack was calculated employing a nite element method. The microstructure, as well as the segregation behaviour of alloying elements in the white-etching area, were investigated by employing transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. A nanocrystalline structure with scattered carbide particles was observed in the white-etching area. Carbon and silicon segregation was highly pronounced in some boundaries of dislocation cell structures. Models were suggested to account for the microstructural alterations during rolling contact fatigue. <b>Carbide</b> <b>coarsening</b> in dark-etching regions was modelled by considering how carbon di usion is assisted by dislocation glide. The predicted hardness evolution was consistent with experimental observation. The kinetics of carbide dissolution in white-etching areas was calculated by taking two processes into account: deformation accumulation and carbon diffusion. These models suggest that the microstructural changes during bearing operation can be controlled by tailoring the initial microstructure and managing the test conditions.

40|$|Under the Gen IV {{advanced}} reactor development program, the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) {{is the lead}} concept. Design and development steps are currently underway to construct a high-temperature reactor as the next generation nuclear plant (NGNP) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). A major limitation of this system is the development and qualification of high-temperature materials for structural applications. Such materials must possess good high-temperature resistance. Among candidate materials, Alloy 617 and Alloy 230 are considered the most promising structural materials for the VHTR. In order {{to gain a better}} understanding of material performance during a high-temperature and long-term service life, various material tests and experiments were conducted to investigate the fundamental deformation mechanisms of the alloys and their long-term degradation process during thermal aging. First, mechanical properties of both alloys were studied by performing tensile tests at three different strain rates and at temperatures up to 1000 ºC. This range covers time-dependent (plasticity) to time-independent (creep) deformations. At temperatures from 300 to 700 ºC, the yield strength was found to be temperature independent as a result of additional strain hardening provided by dynamic strain aging. However, higher temperatures (> 800 ºC) activated additional deformation mechanisms, including dislocation creep and dynamic recrystallization, leading to a significant decrease in material strength. Consequently, the fracture mechanisms changed from inclusion particle cracks at temperatures up to 700 ºC to triple junction cracks from 800 to 1000 ºC. Through a strain-rate sensitivity analysis, the results of tensile tests were extended to approximate the alloys’ long-term flow stresses. According to the comparison with these estimated flow stresses, the allowable design stresses for either alloy in American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) B&PV Code did not provide adequate degradation estimation for the long-term service life. However, rupture stresses for Alloy 617, developed in ASME code case N- 47 - 28, can generally satisfy the safety margin estimated in the study following the strain-rate sensitivity analysis. Nevertheless, additional studies on material development are necessary in order for current VHTR conceptual designs to eventually meet design parameters defined by rupture stresses. Additionally, the effect of orientation on Alloy 617 was studied to provide proper guidance for engineering design and alloy development. Mechanical fibering, consisting of an alignment of inclusion particles and matrix crystals, was found to contribute to the mechanical anisotropy of Alloy 617 with varying performances across the studied temperature range. Second, long-term thermal aging experiments (up to 3, 000 hours) were performed to investigate the dynamic process of microstructure evolution and, consequently, mechanical property degradation at 900 and 1000 °C for both Alloy 617 and Alloy 230. This microstructural evolution was found to be characterized by diffusion-controlled precipitation and <b>coarsening</b> of <b>carbide</b> particles (mainly M 23 C 6 and M 6 C). The kinetics of particle coarsening was studied though the measurement of volume increase of intergranular particles. The results of the mechanical tests were in good agreement with microstructure observations. Both hardness measurements and tensile tests showed a typical aging process characterized by short-term strengthening and long-term softening. Generally, both alloys aged at 900 ºC attained higher yield and tensile strengths with a longer hardening time compared to samples aged at 1000 ºC. Alloy 230 exhibited a longer age-hardening duration compared to Alloy 617, due to a lower diffusibility of Tungsten atoms (primary solute element in Alloy 230). Beyond the mechanical tests at room temperature, the long-term aging degradation for high-temperatures tensile properties was found to be comparable to the degradation for low-temperatures properties. Lastly, an advanced measurement technique, high-energy synchrotron radiation, was applied to Alloy 230 to investigate the deformation process during in-situ loading. The small volume fractions of carbides (i. e. ~ 6 % of M 6 C in Alloy 230), which are difficult to detect using lab-based X-ray machines or neutron scattering facilities, were successfully examined using high-energy X-ray diffraction. The loading processes of the austenitic matrix and the carbide were separately studied by analyzing their different lattice strain evolutions, and thus, the response of each phase to the applied tensile load was clarified. Elastic anisotropy for various polycrystal planes (hkl) was also measured through various reflections for the austenitic matrix. The measured lattice strain can be converted to flow stress by a factor of Young’s modulus calculated by Kröner’s self-consistent method. The lattice strain measured from the (311) reflection is extensively studied, since it responds almost linearly to the applied stress in both the elastic and plastic regimes. The lattice strain evolution for carbides is different than that for the matrix. During the transition from the elastic regime to the plastic regime, carbide particles experience a dramatic loading process, and the internal stress reaches a critical value. The internal stress for the particles then begins to slowly decrease while the linear stress increases for the matrix. This indicates a continued particle fracture process during plastic deformations of the matrix. Finally, a high-energy diffraction technique was developed that combines synchrotron X-ray radiation and pressurized creep tubes and allows macroscopic creep strain and lattice strain to be simultaneously measured by a single X-ray exposure. A typical creep curve with an evidently identified secondary and tertiary creep was obtained by analyzing the X-ray diffraction patterns. In-situ observations of the development of dislocation densities and lattice strain make it possible to track the onset of accelerated creep void nucleation, growth and coalescence...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the characterisation of actual welded samples of P 91 - a 9 %Cr heat resisting steel that is widely used for pressure vessels in the power generation industry. Although the creep resistance of the normalised and tempered base steel is excellent, weld fabrication compromises creep performance because of degraded properties in the heat affected zone (HAZ). In order to elucidate the structure and properties of the HAZ, dilatometer heat treatments and simulations of HAZ sub-zones were carried out using both a dilatometer and a Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator. The simulated samples were used to study the microstructure of the HAZ sub-zones and to subject them to creep testing. In actual welding, post weld heat treatment (PWHT) is used to produce a uniform tempered martensite structure across the weldment, making it difficult to distinguish the HAZ sub-zones and the boundary with the unaffected base plate. Nevertheless, hardness profiles across the HAZ and measurements within the sub-zones confirmed that softening occurs below the base plate hardness after PWHT in the intercritical (IC) and grain refined (GR) sub-zones. The creep fracture times of cross-weld creep samples were also lower than parent metal because of type IV fracture in these HAZ sub-zones. Dilatometric investigations shed new light on the sensitivity of the properties of the martensite to the thermal cycle associated with austenitisation and subsequent cooling. The AC 1 and AC 3 temperatures were increased with increasing heating rate and MS was lower for a lower heating rate. MS was found to vary from 420 °C to 370 °C and the hardness of the martensite from 365 to 480 HV, depending on the thermal cycle. This varialibilty is due to the extent of carbide solution. There was a marked increase in hardness with increasing peak temperature of the thermal cycle, but subsequent simulated PWHT substantially decreased the hardness and the hardness range of the simulated sub-zones. An excellent correlation was found between the structures and properties of the HAZ of the actual welds and the simulated sub-zones produced by both dilatometric and Gleeble techniques. It was established that the heat input (1. 6 or 2. 6 kJ/mm) had only a minor effect on the microstructure and hardness of Gleeble simulated sub-zone samples. TEM results confirmed the presence of coarse Cr-rich, M 23 C 6 and fine V-and Nb-rich, MC in all simulated sub-zones, before and after PWHT, except for the as simulated GCHAZ in which carbide solution occurred. Accelerated creep testing showed rapid creep failure of both AR and simulated IC and GR sub-zone samples for testing at higher temperatures in the range of 630 °C to 670 °C and at a higher stress, 100 MPa compared to 80 MPa. Failure was associated with high creep ductility and the phenomenon of rehardening in the region adjacent to the neck due to rapid work hardening prior to fracture. This type of failure has been labelled Mode 1 and is characterised structurally by grains and creep cavities that are strongly elongated parallel to the tensile axis. Another characteristic type of creep failure, Mode 2, exhibits a low creep ductility and transversely aligned creep cavities. This mode was found in notched AR samples and notched simulated GCHAZ samples tested at 630 °C and a stress at 80 MPa. However, for both Mode 1 and 2 failures, non-metallic inclusions were found to {{play a significant role in}} the nucleation of creep cracking and cavition. The research work identified that the GRHAZ is the most creep susceptible HAZ sub-zone because the thermal cycle results in <b>carbide</b> <b>coarsening,</b> reduced precipitation and solid solution strengthening and a high γ prior grain boundary surface area/unit volume. The creep resistance was most marked for the simulated GCHAZ samples and this property relates strongly to the hardness of the P 91 steel prior to creep testing. The important role of non-metallic inclusions in the nucleation of creep cracking and cavitation indicates that control of the type, size distribution and content of inclusions should have a significant effect on the creep life of P 91 steel...|$|R
