5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses.

Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with the company's stock price.

40|$|Previous returns {{studies have}} shown that extreme {{earnings}} and extreme <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> from operations are less informative than moderate (i. e., less extreme) earnings and moderate <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Studies also report that <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> supplement to earnings in firm valuation by showing a higher association of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> with returns when earnings are extreme than when earnings are moderate. We propose that this supplementary role of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> is affected by <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> extremity. Using data from the US capital markets, we find that the supplementary role of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> exists only when <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are not extreme.

5|$|Founder Steve Ells {{attended}} the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, {{he became a}} line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco. There, Ells observed {{the popularity of the}} taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue, near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father. Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day. The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company. Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.|$|E

Amid the general instability in South America, the Colombian government suggested that its London agent might have exceeded his authority when he arranged the £2million loan. When this representative suddenly died, the frantic buying of South American securities was abruptly replaced by equally restless selling.

It aimed to explain the extent earnings, accruals, EBITDA and operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are able to predict listed Malaysian industrial products manufacturing corporations’ operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Ordinary least squares method was used to develop fifteen multiple linear regression models in examining {{up to three years}} of prediction horizon. Current operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> as proxy for future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> are regressed on past one, two and three years of earnings, operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> combined with aggregated/disaggregated accruals and EBITDA as predictors. The sample was collected from annual financial statements of 97 listed corporations from 1999 to 2009 (11 years) and categorised into two subsamples; the within sample (1999 to 2008) to develop the models and the holdout sample (2009) to validate the robustness of the models. Results from the regression analyses revealed that all the accounting measures examined have significant predictive abilities but differing powers. Earnings are superior to operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> but EBITDA are stronger than both earnings and operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> while the operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> have the weakest predictive powers. The model comprising of both operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and disaggregated accrual components have the strongest predictive abilities. This suggests that disaggregating earnings into operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and accruals and further decomposing the aggregated accruals into the individual accrual components enhance the predictive abilities. These findings revealed that accruals have incremental explanatory powers beyond that contained in operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and disaggregated accrual components provided incremental explanatory powers exceeding that provided by aggregated accruals. Aggregated earnings masked the contributions of each accrual component. Disaggregating earnings and further decomposing the aggregated accruals unmask the contributions and effects of each accrual component. As individual predictors, both earnings and accruals have the significant abilities to predict future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> for only one year-ahead (short term), EBITDA can predict up to two years-ahead (medium term) and operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> can predict up to three years-ahead (long term) ...|$|R
