40|$|Abstract Similarity {{search is}} one of the {{critical}} issues in many applications. When using all attributes of objects to determine their similarity, most prior similarity search algorithms are easily influenced by a few attributes with high dissimilarity. The frequent k-n-match query is proposed to overcome the above problem. However, the prior algorithm to process frequent k-n-match queries is designed for static data, whose attributes are fixed, and is not suitable for dynamic data. Thus, we propose in this paper two schemes to process <b>continuous</b> <b>frequent</b> k-n-match queries over dynamic data. First, the concept of safe region is proposed and four formulae are devised to compute safe regions. Then, scheme CFKNMatchAD-C is developed to speed up the process of <b>continuous</b> <b>frequent</b> k-n-match queries by utiliz-ing safe regions to avoid unnecessary query re-evaluations. To reduce the amount of data transmitted by networked data sources, scheme CFKNMatchAD-C also uses safe regions to eliminate transmissions of unnecessary data updates which will not affect the results of que-ries. Moreover, for large-scale environments, we further propose scheme CFKNMatchAD-D by extending scheme CFKMatchAD-C to employ multiple servers to process <b>continuous</b> <b>frequent</b> k-n-match queries. Experimental results show that scheme CFKNMatchAD-C and scheme CFKNMatchAD-D outperform the prior algorithm in terms of average response time and the amount of produced network traffic...|$|E

40|$|Frequent {{subgraph}} mining is a core graph operation {{used in many}} domains, such as graph {{data management}} and knowledge exploration, bioinformatics and security. Most existing techniques target static graphs. However, modern applications, such as social networks, utilize large evolving graphs. Mining these graphs using existing techniques is infeasible, due to the high computational cost. In this paper, we propose IncGM+, a fast incremental approach for <b>continuous</b> <b>frequent</b> subgraph mining problem on a single large evolving graph. We adapt the notion of “fringe” to the graph context, that is the set of subgraphs {{on the border between}} frequent and infrequent subgraphs. IncGM+ maintains fringe subgraphs and exploits them to prune the search space. To boost the efficiency, we propose an efficient index structure to maintain selected embeddings with minimal memory overhead. These embeddings are utilized to avoid redundant expensive subgraph isomorphism operations. Moreover, the proposed system supports batch updates. Using large real-world graphs, we experimentally verify that IncGM+ outperforms existing methods by up to three orders of magnitude, scales to much larger graphs and consumes less memory...|$|E
40|$|The moist {{tropical}} {{forests of the}} Western Ghats of India are pockmarked with savanna-grasslands created and managed by local agricultural communities. A sample of such savanna-grasslands with differing growing conditions was studied in terms of peak above-ground biomass, monthly growth, and cumulative production under different clipping treatments. The herblayer {{was found to be}} dominated by perennial C 4 grasses, with Eulalia trispicata, Arundinella metzii and Themeda triandra being common to all sites. Peak biomass ranged between 3. 3 - 5. 9 t/ha at sites most favourable for grass production. Across these sites, peak biomass was found to be inversely related to the number of rainy days during the growing season, suggesting that growth may be light-limited. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that growth is most rapid immediately after the easing of the monsoon. Single clips early in the growing season had no negative or a slightly positive effect on production, but mid-season single clips or <b>continuous</b> <b>frequent</b> clipping reduced production by as much as 40 %. The results suggest that, while indiscriminate grazing may certainly be deleterious, it is possible to obtain sustained high yields from forest lands managed for grass production without totally excluding grazing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Until recently, {{epilepsy}} {{medical therapy}} is usually limited to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). However, approximately 1 / 3 of epilepsy patients, described as drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients, still suffer from <b>continuous</b> <b>frequent</b> seizures despite receiving adequate AEDs treatment of sufficient duration. More recently, with the remarkable progress of immunology, immunity and inflammation {{are considered to}} be key elements of the pathobiology of epilepsy. Activation of inflammatory processes in brain tissue has been observed in both experimental seizure animal models and epilepsy patients. Anti-inflammatory and immunotherapies also showed significant anticonvulsant properties both in clinical and in experimental settings. The above emerging evidence indicates that modulation of immunity and inflammatory processes could serve as novel specific targets to achieve potential anticonvulsant effects for the patients with epilepsy, especially DRE. Herein we review the recent evidence supporting the role of inflammation in the development and perpetuation of seizures, and also discuss the recent achievements in modulation of inflammation and immunotherapy applied to the treatment of epilepsy. Apart from medical therapy, we also discuss the influences of surgery, ketogenic diet, and electroconvulsive therapy on immunity and inflammation in DRE patients. Taken together, a promising perspective is suggested for future immunomodulatory therapies in the treatment of patients with DRE...|$|E

30|$|Such experiences, and fatal accidents, led to {{regulations}} to improve electrical safety. It also spurred X-ray manufacturers {{to improve their}} systems. By 1935 nearly all new systems were electrically shockproof. Two important developments that facilitated this transition were {{the introduction of the}} Coolidge hot cathode tube in 1913 and the development of flexible shielded high-voltage cable a few years before 1930. The first replaced the erratic gas tube that required more or less <b>continuous</b> surveillance, <b>frequent</b> tube exchanges and thus easy access. The Coolidge tube was more reliable and high-voltage and tube current could be adjusted independently. Ironically, it was also these latter characteristics and the higher loadability which had led to more dangerous systems. Later, the reliability of the Coolidge tube allowed its placement in a well-shielded housing, giving protection against radiation and electrical shock. The flexible high-voltage cable made the complicated and dangerous conducting system between power supply and X-ray tube obsolete.|$|R

40|$|Differences in the RNA-driven {{hybridization}} kinetics of genomic DNA and cDNA probes led us {{to examine}} physical parameters affecting these reactions. Cloned cDNA complementary to serum albumin (SA) mRNA hybridized in accordance with single component kinetics, whereas cloned SA genomic DNA hybridized more slowly and with multiple component kinetics. This difference is largely attributable to the relatively short and variable lengths of the mRNA complementary regions in the cloned genomic DNA. The rate of mRNA driven hybridization is affected to about half the extent observed for DNA renaturation as Na+ is increased or decreased from 0. 18 M.

Some of the common biosignals are ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), MagnetoEncephaloGram (MEG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), ElectroCardioGram (ECG) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).

Nine stands in Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee were analyzed for age structure, species recruitment trends, and radial growth patterns to determine whether they had originated as a result of stand-replacing fires. The oldest pines date from the late 1700 s or early 1800 s. <b>Continuous</b> or <b>frequent</b> episodic pine regeneration from those times to the early to mid 1900 s was evident at all sites. During {{the first half of the}} 20 th century, all sites experienced large surges in pine regeneration. However, no clear evidence of stand-replacing wildfires could be definitively linked to these surges. Rather, the regeneration appeared to have been caused by noncatastrophic surface fires and canopy disturbances occur-ring together or by the cessation of a frequent fire regime. For the past 25 - 50 years, there has been little pine regener-ation at any of the sites. Restoring the dual disturbance regime of periodic fires and canopy disturbances should help sustain 'l'able Mountairi pine- pitch pine communities in southern Appalachian Mountains landscapes.
