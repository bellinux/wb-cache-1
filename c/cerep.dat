50|$|Pottery was {{an early}} art {{practice}} in daily ancient Albanian Illyrian life. Archaeological history findings tell that this production of these goods for practical life service dates back to antiquity and this type of production made of clay lives together with the human being even today, although now only as decorative means.-Productions of pottery amongst ancient Illyrian found their usage in daily life basis. They were made in shapes of dishes for storage of food and drinks. It was a known art in Albanian ethnic area, this type of craftsmanship has been taught in generations, because the baked clay was used for producing a series of objects on preservation and cultivation of foods. The clay was also used of producing at all times dishes of different types, shapes and sizes adequate for the practical needs in service people. These pots were known as pitos, drinks, cereals and other foods were preserved. The small types of dishes served in the daily practice for keeping fluid and except this other types of dishes and objects were produced serving for cult and decoration purposes. From the physiognomy and morphology of production, {{it must have been}} a craftsmanship almost professional with exception of producing tools for baking bread, known as <b>çerep.</b> Dishes and furniture from pottery have found their usage extensively in our people, in the village and city as well. This type of craftsmanship had been practiced a lot until around the 1970s.Pottery products now may be encountered only as illustration of passed era and just for curiosity and decoration. Now we may encounter rare masters of pottery, and be counted three or four.|$|E
40|$|Several {{members of}} a {{repetitive}} DNA family in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans {{have been shown to}} express ARS and centromeric function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The repetitive family, denoted <b>CeRep</b> 3, consists of dispersed repeated elements about 1 kilobase in length, present 50 to 100 times in the nematode genome. Three elements were sequenced and found to contain DNA sequences homologous to yeast ARS and CEN consensus sequences. Nematode DNA segments containing these repeats were tested for ARS and CEN (or SEG) function after ligation to shuttle vectors and introduction into yeast cells. Such nematode segments conferred ARS function to the plasmid, as judged by an increased frequency of transformation compared with control plasmids without ARS function. Some, but not all, also conferred to the plasmid increased mitotic stability, increased frequency of 2 +: 2 - segregation in meiosis, and decreased plasmid copy number. These effects {{are similar to those of}} yeast centromeric DNA. In view of these results, we suggest that the <b>CeRep</b> 3 repetitive family may have replication and centromeric functions in C. elegans...|$|E

40|$|Background: Over recent years, the 5 -hydroxytryptamine 6 (5 -HT 6) {{receptor}} {{has emerged}} as a promising molecular target which interacts with several central nervous system acting drugs. In animal models, both agonists and antagonists of this receptor exhibit equivalent potency and efficacy as potential antidepressants, anxiolytics and anti-obesity or anti-dementia drugs. EMD 386088 (5 chloro- 2 -methyl- 3 -(1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro- 4 -pyridinyl) - 1 H-indole hydrochloride) {{has been described as a}} high affinity 5 -HT 6 receptor ligand with a full agonist activity and with moderate affinity for 5 -HT 3 sites. Methods: We have extended these data by broadening its profile for other, not yet tested, monoaminergic, GABAA, opioid µ receptors and serotonin transporter (SERT) and we have conducted functional in vitro assays; i. e., measurement of cAMP by homogeneous TR-FRET immunoassay and HTRF method made by <b>CEREP</b> as well as aequorin-based calcium flux assay. Results: In two in vitro models based on cAMP formation, maximal efficacy values for EMD 386088 were 65 and 31 %, for in house and <b>CEREP</b> experiments, respectively. In a model based on calcium response, the studied compound showed 46 % of maximal serotonin (5 -HT) signal. EMD 386088 antagonizes 5 -HT response in increasing concentrations from 10 – 9 to 10 – 6 M. Conclusions: The present in vitro findings confirm that EMD 386088 is a selective 5 -HT 6 receptor ligand with moderate affinity for 5 -HT 3 sites only and it behaves as a potent partial agonist of 5 -HT 6 receptor with varying levels of agonist intrinsic activity, depending on a method employed. In view of these results, caution is recommended in the interpretation of pharmacological in vivo studie...|$|E
40|$|Semi-automated {{diffusion}} tensor imaging (DTI) {{analysis of}} white matter (WM) microstructure offers a clinically feasible technique to assess neonatal brain development and provide early prognosis, but {{is limited by}} variable methods and insufficient evidence regarding optimal parameters. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the influence of threshold values on semi-automated, atlas-based brain segmentation in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants at near-term age. DTI scans were analyzed from 45 VLBW preterm neonates at near-term-age with no brain abnormalities evident on MRI. Brain regions were selected with a neonatal brain atlas and threshold values: trace 0. 15, FA> 0. 20, and FA> 0. 25. Relative regional volumes, FA, axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were compared for twelve WM regions. Near-term brain regions demonstrated differential effects from segmentation with the three FA thresholds. Regional DTI values and volumes selected in the PLIC, <b>CereP,</b> and RLC varied the least with the application of different FA thresholds. Overall, application of higher FA thresholds significantly reduced brain region volume selected, increased variability, and resulted in higher FA and lower RD values. The lower threshold FA> 0. 15 selected 78 ± 21 % of original volumes segmented by the atlas, compared to 38 ± 12 % using threshold FA> 0. 25. Results indicate substantial and differential effects of atlas-based DTI threshold parameters on regional volume and diffusion scalars. A lower, more inclusive FA threshold than typically applied for adults is suggested for consistent analysis of WM regions in neonates...|$|E
40|$|With the {{completion}} of the Genome Sequencing Project, it is now possible to rapidly and accurately determine the frequency and position of a particular repeat sequence in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. Several repeat sequences with a variety of characteristics have been examined and with few exceptions they show a near-random distribution throughout the genome. We characterized several genes near the left end of Chromosome III in the C. elegans genome, and found a 24 -bp minisatellite repeat sequence present in the introns of two unrelated genes. This prompted a search of the databank for other occurrences of this sequence. Multiple copy arrays of this repeat are all located on the same autosome and fall in two clusters: one near the left end, and one in the central region separated by ∼ 10 Mb. There are > 200 copies of this repeat on the chromosome. This euchromatic repeat sequence seems unrelated to gene expression, is absent from homologous sites in a related species, is unstable in Escherichia coli, and is polymorphic between different wild isolates of C. elegans. Most <b>CeRep</b> 25 B units in the array match the consensus sequence very well, suggesting that either this repeat originated quite recently or its sequence is functionally constrained. Although chromosome-specific repeat sequences have been reported previously in many organisms, such sequences are usually structural and heterochromatic (e. g., centromeric α-satellite) or on the mammalian sex chromosomes. This report describes the first confirmed instance from a whole genome sequencing project of an autosomal euchromatic chromosome-specific minisatellite repeat...|$|E
40|$|Background: Previously, {{we showed}} cancer cells {{rely on the}} MTH 1 protein to prevent {{incorporation}} of otherwise deadly oxidised nucleotides into DNA and we developed MTH 1 inhibitors which selectively kill cancer cells. Recently, several new and potent inhibitors of MTH 1 were demonstrated to be non-toxic to cancer cells, challenging the utility of MTH 1 inhibition as a target for cancer treatment. Material and methods: Human cancer cell lines were exposed in vitro to MTH 1 inhibitors or depleted of MTH 1 by siRNA or shRNA. 8 -oxodG was measured by immunostaining and modified comet assay. Thermal Proteome profiling, proteomics, cellular thermal shift assays, kinase and <b>CEREP</b> panel were used for target engagement, mode of action and selectivity investigations of MTH 1 inhibitors. Effect of MTH 1 inhibition on tumour growth was explored in BRAF V 600 E-mutated malignant melanoma patient derived xenograft and human colon cancer SW 480 and HCT 116 xenograft models. Results: Here, we demonstrate that recently described MTH 1 inhibitors, which fail to kill cancer cells, also fail to introduce the toxic oxidized nucleotides into DNA. We also describe a new MTH 1 inhibitor TH 1579, (Karonudib), an analogue of TH 588, which is a potent, selective MTH 1 inhibitor with good oral availability and demonstrates excellent pharmacokinetic and anti-cancer properties in vivo. Conclusion: We demonstrate {{that in order to}} kill cancer cells MTH 1 inhibitors must also introduce oxidized nucleotides into DNA. Furthermore, we describe TH 1579 as a best-in-class MTH 1 inhibitor, which we expect to be useful in order to further validate the MTH 1 inhibitor concept...|$|E
40|$|Background: {{alternative}} splicing diversifies {{the pool of}} messenger RNA molecules encoded by individual genes. This diversity is particularly high when multiple splicing decisions cause a combinatorial arrangement of several alternate exons. We know very little on how the multiple decisions occurring during the maturation of single transcripts are coordinated and whether specific sequence elements might be involved. Results: here, the Caenorhabditis elegans genome was surveyed {{in order to identify}} sequence elements that might play a specific role in the regulation of multiple splicing decisions. The introns flanking alternate exons in transcripts whose maturation involves multiple {{alternative splicing}} decisions were compared to those whose maturation involves a single decision. Fifty-eight penta-, hexa-, and hepta-meric elements, clustered in 17 groups, were significantly over-represented in genes subject to multiple alternative splicing decisions. Most of these motifs relate to known splicing regulatory elements and appear to be well conserved in the related species Caenorhabditis briggsae. The usage of specific motifs is not linked to the gene product function, but rather depends on the gene structure, since it is influenced by the distance separating the multiple splicing decision sites. Two of these motifs are part of the <b>CeRep</b> 25 B minisatellite, which is also over-represented at the vicinity of alternative splicing regions. Most of the remaining motifs are not part of repeated sequence elements, but tend to occur in specific heterologous pairs in genes subject to multiple alternative splicing decisions. Conclusions: the existence of specific intronic sequence elements linked to multiple alternative splicing decisions is intriguing and suggests that these elements might have some specialized regulatory role during splicing...|$|E
40|$|Background: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a focal {{dilatation}} of {{the abdominal}} aorta that progresses {{over time and}} eventually ruptures. Surgery is risky but a medical therapy is lacking. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are apoptotic in end-stage AAA. There is evidence that they undergo pathological remodelling in early disease. My novel hypothesis is that reduction of this pathological vascular remodelling will be beneficial. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) drives VSMC remodelling through IP 3 generation, ER Ca 2 + store release and store operated Ca 2 + entry (SOCE) via the plasma membrane Orai 1 channel. In this thesis I will explore the possibilities of small-molecule Orai 1 inhibition to attenuate VSMC remodelling and AAA growth. Methods & Results: A novel Orai 1 blocker, JPIII is used throughout the thesis. Orai 1 was functionally expressed in AAA VSMC and could be inhibited by JPIII which had nanomolar potency against SOCE and reduced downstream proliferation, migration and apoptosis. JPIII was also effective in rodent VSMC against SOCE and the downstream NFAT activation and was selective for Orai 1 in a <b>Cerep</b> selectivity screen. In vivo, three murine models of AAA were used (AngII, CaCl 2 and PPE); VSMC remodelling and Orai 1 upregulation assessed histologically were apparent in all three models. JPIII treatment reduced AAA VSMC remodelling (by histology) and AAA lumen dimensions (by histology and in vivo ultrasound). JPIII was also effective against AAA progression in mice with established AAA. No major toxic flags were demonstrated but JPIII was a pan CYP 450 inhibitor. It was possible to improve the PK of the molecule without loss of the AAA effect. Conclusion: These data suggest {{it is possible to}} modify the VSMC remodelling response in AAA through Orai 1 inhibition with a small molecule blocker with no major off target effects in mice. This is a promising starting point for translational development of a therapy for human patients. ...|$|E
