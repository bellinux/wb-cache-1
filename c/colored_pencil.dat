[...] They also described the work as a tongue-in-cheek view of the world. New York [...] interpreted the New York-centric mind's view {{of the rest of the}} world as a set of outer boroughs as iconic.

Love told Billboard {{at the time that}} she had recorded eight songs in the studio. [...] " [...] are not my usual (style)", Love said. [...] "I don't have any Fleetwood Mac references on it. Usually I always have a Fleetwood Mac reference as well as having, like, Big Black references. These are very unique songs that sort of magically happened." ...|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the same}} {{companies}} that produce artist-grade <b>colored</b> <b>pencils</b> also offer student-grade materials and scholastic-level <b>colored</b> <b>pencils.</b> Lightfastness rating is usually not included in student- and scholastic-grade <b>colored</b> <b>pencils.</b> Core composition and pigment-binder ratio vary among artist- and student-grade <b>colored</b> <b>pencils</b> even when the same company produces them. As they are intended for different users, student- and scholastic-grade <b>colored</b> <b>pencils</b> lack the high quality pigments and lightfastness standards that hold artist-grade products true to their name. Also their color range is smaller, most often limited to 24 or 36 colors.|$|R

2500|$|In the 1918 {{watercolor}} painting Einst dem Grau der Nacht enttaucht, a compositional implemented poem, possible {{written by}} Klee, he incorporated letters in small, {{in terms of}} color separated squares, cutting off the first verse from the second one with silver paper. At {{the top of the}} cardboard, which carries the picture, the verses are inscribed in manuscript form. Here, Klee did not lean on Delaunay's colors, but on Marc's, although the picture content of both painters does not correspond with each other. Herwarth Walden, Klee's art dealer, saw in them a [...] "Wachablösung" [...] (changing of the guard) of his art. Since 1919 he often used oil colors, with which he combined watercolors and <b>colored</b> <b>pencil.</b> The Villa R (Kunstmuseum Basel) from 1919 unites visible realities such as sun, moon, mountains, trees and architectures, as well as surreal pledges and sentiment readings.|$|E

5000|$|Colored pencils {{vary greatly}} {{in terms of}} quality and usability; {{concentration}} of pigments in the core, lightfastness of the pigments, durability of the <b>colored</b> <b>pencil,</b> and softness of the lead are some indicators of a brand’s quality and, consequently, its market price. There is no general quality difference between wax/oil-based and water-soluble colored pencils, although some manufacturers rate their water-soluble pencils as less lightfast than their similar wax/oil-based pencils.Rising popularity of colored pencils as an art medium sparked {{the beginning of the}} <b>Colored</b> <b>Pencil</b> Society of America (CPSA). According to its website, “CPSA was founded in 1990 as a nonprofit organization dedicated to artists over 18 years of age working with colored pencil”. The CPSA not only promotes <b>colored</b> <b>pencil</b> art as fine art, but also strives to set lightfastness standards for <b>colored</b> <b>pencil</b> manufacturers. Other countries such as United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia and Mexico - among many others - have formed their own organizations and societies for <b>colored</b> <b>pencil</b> artists. In Canada, colored pencils are known as pencil crayons, or, regionally in Newfoundland [...] "leads" [...] or [...] "coloured/colouring leads." [...] Colored pencils are commonly stored in pencil cases to prevent damage.|$|E

5000|$|The use of wax-based mediums in crayons can {{be traced}} back to the Greek Golden Age, and was later {{documented}} by Roman scholar, Pliny the Elder. Wax-based materials have appealed to artists for centuries due to their resistance to decay, the vividness and brilliance of their colors, and their unique rendering qualities.Although <b>colored</b> <b>pencils</b> had been used for “checking and marking” for decades prior, it was not until the early 20th century that artist-quality <b>colored</b> <b>pencils</b> were produced. Manufacturers that began producing artist-grade <b>colored</b> <b>pencils</b> included Faber-Castell in 1908 (the Polychromos range was initially 60 colors) and Caran d’Ache in 1924, followed by Berol Prismacolor in 1938.
