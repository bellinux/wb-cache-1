5|$|Airports with {{international}} flights have customs and immigration facilities, which allow right of entry. These {{change over time}} but are generally designated by law. However, as some <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> agreements that allow connecting flights without customs and immigrations, such facilities do not define an international airport.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E

5|$|George Hudson {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} daylight saving in 1895. The German Empire and Austria-Hungary organized the first nationwide implementation, starting on April 30, 1916. Many <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> used it at various times since then, particularly since the energy crisis of the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency. <b>Countries</b> <b>have</b> generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E

5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} {{the notion that}} a large {{population}} implies a large market. Though underdeveloped <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> a large population, their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E

5|$|Some {{parts of}} Western Europe, {{especially}} Scandinavian <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> been creating family friendly {{policies that have}} aided them in equalizing the gender difference in {{participation in the work}} force.

Government aid in providing care to the elderly and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia {{to be a part of}} the working population in nearly a high rate as men.

Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce, as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.|$|E
