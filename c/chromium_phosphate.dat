This framework delimits interesting tunnels in which the Na+ cations are located. The observed bands in the FT-IR spectra for I and III were assigned to corresponding vibrations of the PO 4 tetrahedra. The EPR spectra exhibit two different resonance lines S 1 and S 2, characteristic of octahedral Cr 3 + ions. The thermal evolution of EPR integral intensities of these signals were assigned to antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between nearest neighbors Cr 3 + ions. The AFM ordering within these compounds at low temperature was also revealed from the thermal dependence of the molar magnetic susceptibility.

The diffusion of ferrocene across the chromium phos-phate film is much slower than has been observed with passivating organic films on electrode surfaces. Diffusion through the organic thin films (600 - 30, 000 A) varies with the structure of the polymer (16).

An intimate contact between the polyester film and the aluminium substrate of the laminates and the thicknesses of the pretreated layers have been observed by cross- sectional TEM following sample preparation by chemical sample thinning and microtoming. Based on angle resolved XPS and SIMS investigation, the locus of failure of the can systems produced from the CP and PAAI treated aluminium has been defined as within the polyester film but very near the interface. The thickness of the residual polyester overlayers has been estimated. A peel test has been used to evaluate the adhesion level of the cans. The order of the adhesion level of the cans produced from different surface pretreated aluminium has been found to be; PAAII > CP > PAAI.

The first part is the synthesis of mesoporous chromium phosphates using the room temperature solid state reaction (SSR) approach. One of the major aims of this work is {{to fill the gap}} of lacking a low cost, low or zero pollution, easy method to synthesize phosphates. The room temperature solid state reaction has been demonstrated in this work is such a method. Mesoporous chromium phosphates were prepared using the solid state reaction at low temperature using CrCl 3. 6 H 2 O, and NaH 2 PO 4. 2 H 2 O as precursors and the surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as template. The synthesized chromium phosphates were characterized by XRD, EDS, HR-TEM, N 2 -physisorption, TG-DSC and UV-Vis spectroscopies. The results indicate that <b>chromium</b> <b>phosphate</b> mesophases were formed only at atomic ratios of P/Cr ≥ 1. 8. The mesophase for P/Cr = 2. 0 phosphate possessed the highest ordering of pore array, with a specific surface area as high as 250. 78 m 2 /g and an average pore size of 3. 48 nm. The catalytic performance of the chromium phosphates was examined by employing a model reaction, namely the dehydration of isopropanol to propene. The results indicated that all synthesized chromium phosphates exhibited significantly higher isopropanol conversions and propene yields than that synthesized via the conventional precipitation route. The highest propene selectivity (96. 43 %) at the highest isopropanol conversion (93. 10 %) has been obtained over the mesoporous <b>chromium</b> <b>phosphate</b> catalyst synthesized with a P/Cr atomic ratio of 2. 0. The formation mechanism of the mesoporous <b>chromium</b> <b>phosphate</b> was investigated by FTIR technique.

The synthesized lithium manganese phosphates were characterized by XRD, EDS, SEM, HR-TEM, N 2 -physisorption. The results show that the synthesized meoporous lithium manganese phosphates exhibited a high specific surface area (256. 63 m 2 /g) and a narrow pore size distribution.

The caustic leaching process is designed to remove aluminum, <b>chromium,</b> <b>phosphate,</b> and sulfate. Removing these nonradioactive components will reduce the immobilized high-level waste (IHLW) volume. Aluminum is removed by dissolving aluminum oxides/hydroxides as sodium aluminate.

Effective factors on efficient removal of heavy metals and pollution load such as concentration of biological mass (MLVSS), COD, BOD, pH in the extended aeration activated sludge biological treatment system, in different ratios of the mixing of industrial waste to sanitary wastewater have been experimented and evaluated. The performance of the above system, in the best of conditions, removes about 90 % of pollution load and 65 % of heavy metals existing in the industrial wastes. After analyzing the experiments, it is concluded that the removal of heavy metals through biological methods is possible and moreover it is feasible to biologically treat the mixing of motor vehicle industries effluent and sanitary wastewater up to the ratio of one to one, if guided exactly and scientifically. Key words: Motor vehicle industry effluent, activated sludge, industrial waste to sanitary waste rati...|$|E

Two avenues of approach have in the main been used to define the physiological potentialities of this ubiquitous system. It is possible to measure what has been regarded as the principal functional attribute of the RES, its phagocytic capacity, by the rate at which standard amounts of a suitable colloid, such as carbon or <b>chromium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> are cleared from the blood stream (3, 4). In addition, use has been made {{of the fact that the}} phagocytic function of the RES can be predictably altered either in the direction of decreased activity by administration of a single large dose of colloid, or by suitably spaced, repeated doses of colloid (5) to provide an increased or stimulated phagocytic capacity. These methods are not completely satisfactory, since there are no direct means of establishing whether the changes, which develop concomitantly in other phenomena, are actually the result of an altered status of the RES elements per se. They do, however, possess the merit of providing a direct and comparatively simple means of influencing this otherwise inaccessible system and thereby making it amenable to experimental study. Various colloidal materials, known to be taken up by the reticulo-endothelial phagocyte cells, were therefore injected as a means of investigating the validit...|$|E
5000|$|Soon after that, the Soviet Union {{occupied}} Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in addition, it annexed Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina from Romania. The Soviet Union attacked Finland on November 30, 1939 {{which started}} the Winter War. Finnish defence prevented a complete {{occupation of the}} country, but Finland was forced to cede strategically important border areas near Leningrad. [...] The Soviet Union supported Germany in the war effort against Western Europe through the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement with exports of raw materials (<b>phosphates,</b> <b>chromium</b> and iron ore, mineral oil, grain, cotton, rubber). These and other export goods were being transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories and thereby circumvented the British naval blockade of Germany. The Soviet Union also aided the Nazis by setting up a naval base near Murmansk in support of Hitler’s U-boat war against Britain.Germany ended the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by invading the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa on June 22, 1941. This resulted in the Soviet Union {{becoming one of the}} main members of Allies.|$|R
40|$|Sludge {{pretreatment}} {{will likely}} involve washing, followed by caustic or acidic leaching and washing of sludge residues after leaching. The principal goal of pretreatment is {{to obtain a}} low-volume high-activity waste stream and a high-volume low-activity waste stream. Also, some waste constituents such as <b>chromium</b> and <b>phosphate</b> can be included in glass formulations only at very low concentrations; therefore, it is desirable to remove them from high-level waste streams. Two aspects of sludge treatment and subsequent separations should be well delineated and predictable: (1) the distribution of chemical species between aqueous solutions and solids and (2) potential problems due to chemical interactions {{that could result in}} process difficulties or safety concerns. Before any treatment technology is adopted, it must be demonstrated that the process can be carried out as planned. Three pretreatment methods were considered in the Tri-Party (Washington State Ecology, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U. S. Department of Energy) negotiations: (1) sludge washing with corrosion- inhibiting water, (2) Enhanced Sludge Washing, and (3) acidic dissolution with separations processes. Enhanced Sludge Washing is the baseline process. In Enhanced Sludge Washing, sludge is first washed with corrosion-inhibiting water; it is then leached with caustic (sodium hydroxide solution) and washed again with corrosion- inhibiting water. The initial concern is whether a pretreatment technique is effective in separating sludge components. This can be evaluated by bench-scale tests with sludge specimens from underground storage tanks. The results give data on the distribution of important species such as aluminum, phosphate, and radionuclides between wash and leach solutions and solid sludge residues...|$|R
40|$|Kidney stone {{consists}} of various organic, inorganic and semi organic compounds. Mineral oxalate monohydrate and di-hydrate {{are the main}} inorganic constituents of kidney stones. However, mechanisms leading {{to the formation of}} mineral oxalate kidney stones are not clearly understood. In this field of study, there are several hypotheses including nucleation, crystal growth and/or aggregation of formation of AOMH (Ammonium oxalate monohydrate) and AODH (Ammonium oxalate di-hydrate) crystals. The effect of some urinary species such as ammonium oxalate, calcium citrate, proteins and trace elements were reported by the author. The kidney stone constituents are grown in silica gel medium (SMS) which provides the necessary growth simulation (in-vivo). In the artificial urinary stone growth process, identification of growth parameters within the different chemical environment was carried out and reported for the urinary crystals such as CHP, SHP, BHP and MHP. In the present study, SrCrMHP (Strontium <b>chromium</b> magnesium hydrogen <b>phosphate)</b> crystals are grown in three different growth faces to attain the total nucleation reduction. Extension of this research, many characterization studies have been carried out and the results are reported...|$|R
