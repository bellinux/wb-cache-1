Preliminary findings of the investigation acknowledged that five <b>civilians</b> <b>had</b> been killed. On 2 September 2008, a further report was announced in which the US stated that up to seven <b>civilians</b> <b>had</b> been killed and reasserted that the majority of those killed were members of the Taliban. On 1 October 2008 the Department of Defense published the summary of a report by Brig. Gen. Michael Callan which accepted that 33 civilians were killed.|$|R

25|$|The United Nations Charter {{stipulates}} that {{to assist in}} maintaining peace and security around the world, all member states of the UN should make available to the Security Council necessary armed forces and facilities. Since 1948, about 130 nations have contributed military and civilian police personnel to peace operations. While detailed records of all personnel who have served in peacekeeping missions since 1948 are not available, {{it is estimated that}} up to one million soldiers, police officers and <b>civilians</b> <b>have</b> served under the UN flag in the last 56 years.

25|$|There are {{multiple}} humanitarian, medical, economic, and industrial {{effects of the}} 2008–2009 Gaza War which started with the Israeli air strikes on 27 December 2008 and ended on 18 January with a cease-fire implemented unilaterally by Israel, and later the same day by Hamas and other Palestinian factions. The cease-fire followed twenty-two days of bombardment by land, sea and air which left over 1,300 Palestinians dead and over 5,000 injured, {{and the death of}} 13 Israelis. The United Nations Development Programme warned that there will be long-term consequences of the attacks on Gaza because the livelihoods and assets {{of tens of thousands of}} Gaza <b>civilians</b> <b>have</b> been affected.|$|E
25|$|We cannot {{ignore the}} fact that {{thousands}} of Chechen <b>civilians</b> <b>have</b> died and more than 200,000 have been driven from their homes. Together with other delegations, we have expressed our alarm at the persistent, credible reports of human rights violations by Russian forces in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. There are also reports that Chechen separatists have committed abuses, including the killing of civilians and prisoners.... The war in Chechnya has greatly damaged Russia's international standing and is isolating Russia from the international community. Russia's work to repair that damage, both at home and abroad, or its choice to risk further isolating itself, is the most immediate and momentous challenge that Russia faces.|$|E
50|$|In Acadia, {{the primary}} British {{objective}} was to defeat the French fortifications at Beausejour and Louisbourg.

25|$|Although Umarov {{announced}} in 2006 {{an end to}} violence against civilians, three years later, in 2009, he stated {{he does not believe}} there are any civilians in Russia, but that civilian casualties would be limited as much as possible. Umarov has personally taken responsibility for attacks in which dozens of <b>civilians</b> <b>have</b> been killed, and has been implicated in others. Umarov was sought by the federal government of Russia for alleged crimes including acts of terrorism. During the 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis Umarov had been incorrectly identified by Russian security forces and some hostages as an on-site leader of the hostage takers, a claim which was later officially refuted. Umarov himself condemned the incident.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} attacks have {{involved}} military objectives {{in the north}} and east of the country, although <b>civilians</b> <b>have</b> been targeted on numerous occasions, including during a high-profile attack on Colombo International Airport in 2001 that caused damage to several commercial airliners and military jets, killing 16 people. The LTTE was responsible for a 1998 attack on the Buddhist shrine and UNESCO world heritage site Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy that killed eight worshipers. The attack was symbolic in that the shrine, which houses a tooth of the Buddha, is the holiest Buddhist shrine in Sri Lanka. Other Buddhist shrines have been attacked, notably the Sambuddhaloka Temple in Colombo, in which nine worshippers were killed.|$|E
25|$|Civilian {{casualty}} estimates vary widely.

As in the case of military losses, these claims can not be independently verified. According to a count by the Russian human rights group Memorial in 2007, up to 25,000 <b>civilians</b> <b>have</b> died or disappeared since 1999. According to Amnesty International in 2007, the second war killed up to 25,000 civilians since 1999, with up to another 5,000 people missing. However, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society set their estimate of the total death toll in two wars at about 150,000 to 200,000 civilians.|$|E
