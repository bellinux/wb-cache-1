500|$|... "Kill the Alligator and Run" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jen Kamerman {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). When the animation department finished its work on the episode, it had ended up being about four minutes too long and the staff of the show was forced to make some difficult cuts. One scene that was <b>cut</b> <b>saw</b> Captain Jack lying in state at the capitol in Florida, with Kid Rock being one of the people present to pay their respects to the alligator. The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully has expressed regret for cutting this scene out because it [...] "hurts the logic" [...] later in the episode when Captain Jack crawls out of the capitol and reveals himself to everyone, without any explanation to how he got there.|$|E

5000|$|Power miter saws {{have been}} {{available}} in various forms since the 1970s as specialized cross <b>cut</b> <b>saws</b> but with limited width of cut, especially compared to radial arm saws. Simple miter saws allowed the saw table to pivot allowing miters to be cut in one plane. Compound miter saws also provided saw head tilting allowing compound miters to be <b>cut.</b> Miter <b>saws</b> with abrasive cutting wheels are often used in metal work where they are known as [...] "drop saws" [...] or more commonly [...] "chop saws".|$|R

50|$|Nu-Wood Decorative Millwork is {{millwork}} made of {{a specially}} formulated polyurethane polymer. The standard density is similar to white pine. It can be <b>cut,</b> <b>sawn,</b> shaped, routed, nailed, stapled, and screwed just like wood. Profiles exist {{for a variety of}} uses, indoors and out. Advantages over wood include a surface which will not crack, flake, or blister and a product which is resistant to water, mold, mildew, and insects.|$|R
50|$|From about 1912 a {{seaplane}} {{station was}} positioned at Grain by the Admiralty. From {{the beginning of}} World War I regular patrols were made along the Thames estuary from this station, as part of English Channel defences.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the sliding {{compound}} miter saw was introduced which combined all the best features of the {{compound miter saw}} with sliding tubes allowing the cutter head to traverse for a much wider cut. Since then {{it has become the}} primary cross <b>cut</b> <b>saw</b> for woodworking, largely supplanting the radial arm saw.Manufacturers warn of possible electrocution when used near water or other related saws in a close proximity.|$|E
50|$|A {{fence is}} a {{straight}} edge that is placed parallel to {{the direction of the}} <b>cut</b> <b>saw</b> blade. It is rigidly connected to the saw or table. The distance between the surface of the fence and the closest edge of the saw blade dictates the specified width of the cut. Material that is being cut is held tight against the fence {{in order to ensure that}} it is cut to the specified width.|$|E
5000|$|... "Crosscut Saw", or [...] "Cross <b>Cut</b> <b>Saw</b> Blues" [...] as it {{was first}} called, is a dirty blues song [...] "that must have belonged to the general {{repertoire}} of the Delta blues". [...] The song was first released in 1941 by Mississippi bluesman Tommy McClennan and has since been interpreted by many blues artists. [...] "Crosscut Saw" [...] became an early R&B chart hit for Albert King, [...] "who made {{it one of the}} necessary pieces of modern blues".|$|E
50|$|The name carbide saw {{came from}} the tool, a {{circular}} saw blade, with silver soldered carbide tips. It competed with and just about replaced, solid or segmental HSS blades, because carbide is much harder than HSS. Before HSS saws were developed, abrasive, friction or hot saws were used and are still manufactured for certain applications. These processes create heat and are therefore called hot saws. However, HSS blades use coolant and the cut surfaces don’t get hot, thus called cold saws. With the unique geometry of the teeth of carbide circular saws, the heat, developed by the cutting process is transferred into the chips and carried away with the chips. The cut surfaces stay cool. Therefore, carbide saws were also called cold saws. Other names include cold <b>cut</b> <b>saws,</b> cold circular <b>saws,</b> cold <b>cut</b> off <b>saws</b> or circular cold saws.|$|R

50|$|The {{main outlet}} {{for the men}} looking for work was in the timber {{industry}} and local splitters were fully employed having orders {{to keep them in}} work for many months. Large eucalyptus trees were selected and were then sawn with a cross <b>cut</b> <b>saw</b> into required lengths. Palings were used for weatherboards, garden fences and roof shingling. Although a number of private attempts were made at drainage works in the 1860s and 70s they were met with little success.|$|E
5000|$|In 1966, Albert King {{recorded}} his version calling it [...] "Crosscut Saw". The same lyrics as McClennan's [...] "Cross <b>Cut</b> <b>Saw</b> Blues" [...] were used, {{except for two}} verses which were replaced by guitar solos. However, King uses a different arrangement based on an Afro-Cuban rhythm pattern, {{similar to that of}} his 1962 song [...] "I Get Evil". Backing King is the Stax Records' house band, Booker T. & the MG's. The song was a success, reaching No. 34 in the Billboard R&B chart. [...] It was included on King's Born Under a Bad Sign album, which [...] "became {{one of the most popular}} and influential blues albums of the late '60s". [...] The song remained in his repertoire throughout his career and several live versions were issued.|$|E
5000|$|Tony Hollins, a Mississippi bluesman and {{contemporary}} of Tommy McClennan, recorded {{a version of}} [...] "Cross <b>Cut</b> <b>Saw</b> Blues" [...] with similar lyrics on June 3, 1941, three months before McClennan. The song was not released at the time, but eventually appeared in 1992. In an interview, John Lee Hooker, who knew Tony Hollins, was asked [...] "Well, did Tony Hollins or Tommy McClennan do it first? They both recorded it around the same time". [...] Hooker responded [...] "I think Tommy McClennan did it first". [...] In the earlier days of the blues, {{it was not unusual}} for an unrecorded or unpublished song to be in the repertoire of several blues singers. In the folk music tradition, such songs were passed around and developed {{over an extended period of}} time without regards to ownership.|$|E
50|$|Expenditure <b>cuts</b> <b>saw</b> the UDF {{as a whole}} reduced. The last {{remaining}} regiment of the South Africa Mounted Riflemen was disbanded on 31 March 1926 {{and the number of}} military districts was reduced from 16 to six on 1 April 1926. The Brigade HQ of the SA Field Artillery was also disbanded. In 1933 the six military districts were redesignated Commands. As a result of its conscription policies, the UDF increased its active-duty forces to 56,000 by the late 1930s; 100,000 men also belonged to the National Riflemen's Reserve, which provided weapons training and practice.|$|R
50|$|Diamond {{grinding}} involves {{removing a}} thin layer at the surface of hardened PCC using closely spaced diamond saw blades. The level surface is achieved by running the blade assembly at a predetermined level across the pavement surface, which produces <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> grooves. The uncut concrete between each <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> breaks off more or less at a constant level above the <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> grooves, leaving a level surface (at a macroscopic level) with longitudinal texture. The result is a pavement that is smooth, safe, quiet and pleasing to travel.|$|R
50|$|Materials create {{architectural}} atmospheres. Materials can {{be transformed}} in multiple ways to obtain certain atmospherics in architecture and spaces. For example a stone can be split, <b>cut,</b> <b>sawed,</b> drilled, polished and with each process {{it will have a}} different quality. Materials are also combined with other materials in a building that play with texture, colour, temperature and tone; all of which create an atmosphere and mood. For Zumthor, “Materials react with one another and have their radiance, so that the material composition gives rise to something unique. Material is endless” (Atmospheres, p. 25).|$|R

60|$|It is {{surprising}} how fast and hard men will toil when life {{depends on the}} result. There was a cat-like activity about the carpenter and his mates as they <b>cut,</b> <b>sawed,</b> lashed, and bolted together the various spars and planks which formed the raft. In a marvellously short space of time it was ready and launched over the side, and towed astern by the strongest cable on board, for the danger of parting from it in such weather was very great. Knowing this they had lashed some casks of pork and other provisions to it before launching.|$|R
