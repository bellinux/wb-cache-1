25|$|On Sunday morning, 25 June 2006, {{at about}} 5:30am (GMT+2) an armed squad of Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip {{crossed the border}} into Israel via a 300-meter-long {{underground}} tunnel they dug near the Kerem Shalom border crossing. The militants surfaced in Israeli territory shielded by a row of trees, and <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> IDF border positions facing Gaza. As militants from within the Gaza Strip bombarded Israeli positions with mortar and anti-tank fire, the militant squad split into three cells.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 2016, Mexican {{federal judge}} Vicente Bermúdez Zacarías {{went on a}} morning jog {{near his home in}} Metepec, State of Mexico, an upscale {{community}} outside of Mexico City. As he was crossing a street, an unidentified gunman <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him and shot him at point-blank range in the head. Bermúdez Zacarías fell to the ground bleeding and was transported to a nearby hospital, but died before he was able to receive medical attention. The perpetrator fled the scene with an accomplice and reportedly hid in an abandoned lot nearby before taking off. The incident was captured through a surveillance camera and was leaked to the media the following day. The identity of the suspected gunman was identified the following year, but both of them remain at large.|$|E

25|$|Brannan sent three brigades in {{response}} to Thomas's order: Col. Ferdinand Van Derveer's brigade moved southeast on the Reed's Bridge Road, with Col. John Croxton's brigade on his right. Col. John Connell's brigade <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> in reserve. Croxton's men drove back Davidson's advanced cavalrymen and Forrest formed a defensive line of dismounted troopers to stem the tide. Croxton halted his advance because he was unsure of Forrest's strength. Forrest requested reinforcements from Bragg and Walker near Alexander's Bridge and Walker ordered Col. Claudius Wilson's brigade forward about 9 a.m., hitting Croxton's right flank. Forrest protected his own right flank by deploying the brigade of Col. George Dibrell, which ran into Van Derveer's brigade {{and came to a}} halt under fire. Forrest sent in Brig. Gen. Matthew Ector's brigade, part of Walker's Reserve Corps, but without Walker's knowledge. Ector's men replaced Debrill's in line, but they were also unable to drive Van Derveer from his position.|$|E
25|$|Meeting no resistance, {{the column}} reached the second {{intersection}} at the Al-Arba'een square. A {{member of the}} militia, Mahmoud 'Awad, fired two RPG rounds at the lead tank. One round caused superficial damage, and the other missed. Further ahead, the militia had set up another ambush. Ibrahim Suleiman, positioned in a hideout between Cinema Royal and Cinema Egypt, heard the explosions, and asked his comrade, Mohamed Sarhan, to prepare an RPG round. At a range of 12 meters, Suleiman fired his RPG, hitting the turret ring. The tank blew up, and its cannon tilted to the ground. Moments later, Sarhan fired an RPG round against the APC trailing the lead tank. The APC, carrying paratroopers inside, caught fire. At this point, masses of civilians and soldiers began moving towards the square from the adjacent buildings and from roads leading to the square. The column came to a halt, and began receiving heavy small arms fire, also coming under attack by hand grenades. Within minutes, twenty out of the twenty-four Israeli tank commanders were hit. The Israelis panicked, and began disembarking their vehicles and taking cover in nearby buildings. One group of soldiers tried to enter Cinema Royal, but were repulsed at the entrance. One of the APCs that were hit was carrying the brigade's intelligence group. The group abandoned the APC, and all nine men entered a nearby building, where they were presumably killed. The remainder of the battalion turned around to retreat, which was disorderly. The retreating forces came under attack by small arms, grenades and Molotov cocktails. Four tanks <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> Sidi Al-Arba'een Mosque, but were ambushed by soldiers from the 19th Division, forcing the tanks to retreat.|$|E
500|$|A {{week before}} the {{championship}} game, three Browns players were arrested after a confrontation with Cleveland police. Team captain Jim Daniell, end Mac Speedie, tackle Lou Rymkus and halfback Edgar Jones were drinking and waiting for Speedie's wife to arrive on a flight from Utah. They dropped Jones off and <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> a police car that was blocking their way. Daniell, who was driving the car, honked the horn, and an argument ensued that ended with the arrest of all three men. Daniell was booked on public intoxication, and Speedie and Rymkus were charged with creating a disturbance. Paul Brown fired Daniell after the incident, saying he had [...] "a special obligation to be exemplary in his behavior" [...] {{because he was the}} team captain.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{leaving the}} Plaza Suite, Gravano called Garafola {{and set up}} an ambush outside the club, {{involving}} Garafola, Milito, D'Angelo, Nicholas Mormando, and Michael DeBatt in the plan. Later that night, Gravano confronted Fiala on the street as he exited the Plaza Suite {{among a group of}} people, asking, [...] "Hey, Frank, how you doing?" [...] As Fiala turned around, surprised to see Gravano, Milito <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him and shot him in the head. Milito stood over the body and fired a shot into each of Fiala's eyes as Fiala's entourage and the crowd of people on the street dispersed, screaming. Gravano then walked up to Fiala's corpse and urinated on his mouth.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the unauthorized act by Steiner and the Americans the Italians sent in two Aeritalia F-104S Starfighter warplanes of the 36° Stormo (Wing) from Gioia del Colle. These where soon joined by two more F-104s from Grazzanise airbase. In {{response to}} the Italian action, other warplanes (that have never been publicly identified but are assumed to have been American Tomcat F-14s) <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> the Italian jets. The Italian jets also found their radar jammed above the Tyrrhenian Sea, with the assumption being it was done by a U.S. Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler. National Security Council staffer Michael K. Bohn in the White House Situation Room at the time, later recalled [...] "Pilots on board the US and Italian jets exchanged colorful epithets over the radio about their respective intentions, family heritage, and sexual preferences." [...] Once the 737 approached Rome the formation of, presumably US Naval fighters, turned back – only the T-39 with U.S. Special Forces continued to the Ciampino airport.|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{assured of}} his {{personal}} safety during the treaty negotiations, Hintsa rapidly found himself held hostage and pressured with massive demands for cattle [...] "restitution". Other sources say he offered himself as a hostage until the indemnity was paid and even suggested that he accompany Colonel Smith in collecting Xhosa cattle. He attempted to escape at the Nqabarha River but was pursued, pulled off his horse and immobilized with shots through the back and the leg. Immediately, a soldier named George Southey (brother of colonial administrator Sir Richard Southey) <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> Hintsa and {{shot him in the}} back of the head; furthermore, Hintsa's ears were cut off after his death. Other sources say his horse bolted and Harry Smith tried to shoot the fleeing man but both his pistols misfired. Giving chase, he caught hold of Hintsa and dragged him heavily to the ground. Hintsa was still full of fight. [...] "He was jabbing at me furiously with his assegai," [...] Colonel Smith recalled in his autobiography, and the chief succeeded in breaking away to cover in a nearby stream bed. There, while pleading for mercy, the top of his skull was blown off by one of Smith's officers and his body was afterwards mutilated by British and colonial troops. These actions shocked the government in London, which condemned and repudiated Governor D’Urban. Hintsa's murder angered the Xhosa for decades thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|About {{one week}} after the game was taken away from Daniel, on October 20, 2007, he used his father’s key to unlock the safe and take it back, also taking his father’s handgun. Court reports stated that Daniel <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> his parents as they were {{relaxing}} on their couch {{in the living room and}} said “Would you close your eyes, I have a surprise for you.” Daniel then proceeded to shoot both of his parents. His father said that “his head went numb and he saw blood pouring down from his skull.” [...] Daniel shot his mother in the head, arms, and chest, killing her. In court his father testified that after Daniel shot both of his parents, he tried to make the event look like a murder-suicide by placing the gun in his father's hand whilst saying to him “Hey dad, here’s your gun. Take it,”. A few minutes later, his sister and her husband, Heidi and Andrew Archer, came over for their prior plans of watching a baseball game together. Daniel lied to them that they should not come in because their parents had been fighting. Then, they heard groaning and pushed their way through to find the aftermath of the shooting. Heidi called the police, and before they got there Daniel made an escape attempt by driving off in the family’s van with the Halo 3 game in the passenger seat. The police caught up with him and forced him out of the van via road block. While police were handcuffing him, he yelled [...] "My Dad shot my Mom!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Trains {{continued}} to run {{during the first}} week of June 1968 after closure; one each ran to Lawrence, Beaumont and Roxburgh. [...] The last actual (unofficial service train) goods train from Roxburgh (a cleanup train clearing the stations between Roxburgh and Craig Flat of wagons, as well as the three passenger cars from the official last train) left Roxburgh hauled by an AB steam locomotive on 6 June 1968. [...] This was the last ever steam hauled train on the branch. [...] On the same day an engine and van service hauled by a diesel locomotive of the DJ class ran from Dunedin to Beaumont; the DJ class had been granted running rights on the line that very week. [...] On its return journey that day this diesel-hauled train cleared Beaumont yard and other points south to Lawrence where another train had previously cleared wagons and other equipment out. [...] The DJ locomotive stalled on a steep grade near the Round Hill tunnel as a result of oak leaves falling on the line and the train's relatively large size for the lines steep grades. Sir Arthur Tindall, then judge of the Arbitration Court was travelling in the cab of the following train that day from Roxburgh hauled by the AB. [...] The train he was on <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> the stalled DJ and its train, struck detonators placed on the line as a warning of the stalled train ahead, giving every one a fright and then after a short while effectively pushed the DJ and its train over the hill at Round Hill. [...] Both trains then continued on their respective journeys to Milton.|$|E

[...] " [...] (Grandsons)," [...] Talking God said, [...] "We {{have come to}} run a race with you." [...] "We will see how fit you have become," [...] said Water Sprinkler. [...] They agreed to race around the mountain. [...] The boys ran fast, and the two Holy People ran slower.

[...] In the evening, the boys were sore and tired. , the Wind came to them and said, [...] "Practice each day and grow stronger." [...] In four days, Talking God and Water Sprinkler returned, and the four raced again around the mountain.

[...] Again the Holy People said they would return in four days to race again. [...] And again in the evening [...] came and encouraged them and urged them to train. [...] Each day the boys trained, and in the third race, Talking God and Water Sprinkler no longer whipped the twins, but had to run their strongest to win the race at the end.

2500|$|... 1988, {{the last}} ever Grand Prix of the turbo era, saw Alain Prost win his seventh {{race of the}} season from McLaren {{teammate}} and newly crowned World Champion Ayrton Senna with outgoing champion Nelson Piquet third for Lotus, giving Honda turbo's all three podium positions. The race was also the 15th win and 15th pole in 16 races in a season of total dominance for McLaren-Honda, a domination not seen before or since in Formula One. 1989 {{was hit by a}} deluge of rain and the drivers, notably Prost, {{who did not want to}} start the race because of the very wet conditions, particularly on the Brabham straight. This event came after controversial events 2 weeks before at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, where Prost crashed into his hated teammate Senna, and Senna got going again and finished 1st on the road but after a lot of political ramifications, he was disqualified for cutting the chicane before the pit straight at Suzuka; the repercussions of which dawned on the race. McLaren decided to appeal Senna's disqualification; so Senna still had a chance of winning the championship. The race was delayed for sometime and there were discussions about whether the race should be started. Senna qualified on pole position, and had every intention of starting the race. The circuit was still being hammered by rain and was covered by water, but the drivers, including Prost relented and they started. But an unconvinced Prost came in after one lap and withdrew; and Senna- who was in an awful mental state, immediately began driving as fast as he could. By the end of the first lap, due to Pierluigi Martini's slow Minardi holding up the two faster Williams cars of Belgian Thierry Boutsen and Italian Riccardo Patrese, Senna was an astonishing nine seconds ahead of Martini; the Williams cars soon passed Martini but by the end of the third lap, Senna was 23 seconds ahead of second-placed Boutsen. But even with such a huge lead which extended even further, Senna continued to push very hard- taking very daring chances even for himself; the psychological dominance F1 had exuded over the Brazilian meant that he was known to take chances that most other drivers would not. But going down the Brabham straight on lap 13, Senna <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> Briton Martin Brundle's Brabham-Judd, and Brundle decided to move over to let Senna pass. But Senna was blinded by thick spray; and the Brazilian did not let up and then he hit the back of Brundle's car and it tore off his front left wheel and suspension, so the Brazilian had to retire; effectively handing Prost his third Drivers' Championship; McLaren's appeal had not been decided yet; and it was not only overturned but Senna received a $100,000 fine and a six-month ban, both of which were rescinded. Boutsen won the race in the unimproved conditions, the race was called after it reached the two-hour time limit.|$|E
