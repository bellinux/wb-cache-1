Furthermore, since objects are typically brought into the fovea by eye movements, there is a sudden change of the background just before the objects are foveated.

40|$|The fine-structure {{constant}} alpha {{does not}} vary as Friedmann Universes evolve, a conclusion based on assessments {{of quantum mechanics}} and electrodynamics. alpha = e^ 2 /(4 pi epsilon hbar c), where e is the charge of the electron, epsilon is vacuum permittivity, c is the speed of light, and hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2 pi. This inquiry was motivated by Schrodinger's (1939) prediction that all quantum wave functions coevolve with Friedmann geometry and a similar prediction by Sumner (1994) for vacuum permittivity. The functional form of variations in quantum wave functions found by Schrodinger is enough to show that alpha does not vary. Electrodynamics also predicts that alpha does not vary. Evolutionary changes in <b>c</b> exactly <b>cancel</b> those in vacuum permittivity and other factors in alpha do not change. Since alpha appears in all first-order perturbation formulas for atomic energy levels, comparisons of the atomic spectra of distant atoms with those in laboratories provide an experimental measure of this prediction. Most experiments find changes in alpha that are either statistically zero or very small. These results and estimates of the Hubble constant and deceleration parameter from precision redshift/magnitude data support a major assumption of this paper that the Friedmann solution to Einstein's theory of general relativity without cosmological constant is an adequate approximation to spacetime geometry and its long term evolution at quantum scales.

40|$|In modern VLSI processes, the {{cross-coupling}} capac-itance between adjacent neighboring wires on {{the same}} metal layer {{is a very large}} fraction of the total wire ca-pacitance. This leads to problems of delay variation due to crosstalk and reduced noise immunity, arguably one of the biggest obstacles in the design of ICs in recent times. This problem is particularly severe in long on-chip buses, since bus signals are routed at minimum pitch for long distances. In this work, we propose to solve this prob-lem by the use of crosstalk canceling CODECs. We only utilize memoryless CODECs, to reduce the logical com-plexity and enhance the robustness of our techniques. Bus data patterns can be classified (as 4 C, 3 C, 2 C, 1 C or 0 C patterns) based on the maximum amount of crosstalk that they can exhibit. Crosstalk avoid-ance CODECs which eliminate 4 C and 3 C patterns have been reported. In this paper, we describe crosstalk avoid-ance techniques which eliminate 2 C and 1 C patterns. We describe an analytical methodology to accurately char-acterize the bus area overhead 2 C pattern CODECs. Using these results, we characterize the area overhead ver-sus crosstalk immunity achieved. A similar exercise is performed for 1 C patterns. Our experimental results show that by using 2 <b>C</b> crosstalk <b>canceling</b> techniques, buses can be sped up by up to a factor of 6 with an area overhead of about 200 %, and that 1 C techniques are not very robust. 1...|$|R

The rules were derived from van't Hoff analysis of 23 oligonucleotide triplexes tested at a variety of pH values. To predict the enthalpy of triplex formation (delta H degrees), a simple nearest-neighbor model was found to be sufficient. However, to accurately predict the free energy of the triplex (delta G degrees), a combination model consisting of five parameters was needed. These parameters were (i) the delta G degrees for helix initiation, (ii) the delta G degrees for adding a T-A. T triple, (iii) the delta G degrees for adding a C(+) -G. C triple, (iv) the penalty for adjacent C bases, and (v) the pH dependence of the C(+) -G. C triple's stability. The fitted parameters are highly consistent with thermodynamic data from the basis set, generally predicting both delta H degrees and delta G degrees to within the experimental error. Examination of the parameters points out several interesting features. The combination model predicts that C(+) -G. C. triples are much more stabilizing than T-A. T triples below pH 7. 0 and that the stability of the former increases approximately equal to 1 kcal/mol per pH unit as the pH is decreased. Surprisingly though, the most stable sequence is predicted to be a CT repeat, as adjacent <b>C</b> bases partially <b>cancel</b> the stability of one another.

40|$|The District of Columbia (D. C.) {{marked a}} {{landmark}} civil rights achievement in December 2009 {{when the city}} passed the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act. The law’s enactment allowed D. C. to become the sixth jurisdiction to sanction same-sex marriage in the United States. Supporters hailed the law as a victory for lesbian and gay equality, while detractors vowed that their efforts to traditionally define marriage would continue. Among the most public opponents of the law was the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, which operates Catholic Charities, a leading service provider to low-income residents in the metropolitan area. The Catholic Archdiocese warned the D. C. City Council that it would sever its professional relationship with the city if the same-sex marriage law passed because same-sex unions are inconsistent with the Church’s core theological teachings. A year after the law went into effect, the D. <b>C.</b> City Council <b>cancelled</b> the foster and adoption program co-administered by the city’s Child and Family Services Agency and the Catholic Archdiocese, citing that the religious organization was no longer eligible to provide services. Weeks later, the Catholic Archdiocese announced {{it would no longer}} offer spousal benefits to its new employees. The author offers two observations about the political battle between the D. C. City Council and the Catholic Archdiocese that should inform lawmakers and policy advocates alike. The first observation is that Catholic Charities’ choice to cut its employee benefits demonstrates the lengths to which some religious organizations will go to deny lesbian and gay equality. The Catholic Archdiocese chose to eliminate spousal benefits for all of its employees rather than to offer the same benefits to their new lesbian or gay employees, as required by the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Equal Pay Act requires equal compensation for substantially similar work, and Title VII bans employer {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex. The second observation is that the D. C. City Council elected to carve out a narrow religious activity exemption in its same-sex marriage law to strike a reasonable balance between religious freedom and civil rights. On one hand, the exemption states that a religious organization may refuse to sanction same-sex unions, but, on the other hand, the exemption also implicitly recognizes that civil society may exercise its institutional prerogative to confer benefits to whomever it chooses. Religious freedom and civil rights, in this way, can harmonize to accommodate a plurality of beliefs and interests. The D. C. law is an exception, however, as many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender civil rights laws fail to strike a reasonable balance between religious freedom and robust discrimination protection. Most notably, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), designed to extend federal employment discrimination protection to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, contained a religious organization exemption much broader than the existing Title VII exemption. ENDA’s religious exemption, taking different iterations over fifteen years, begs an important question: why were religious organizations permitted to discriminate against LGBT people but not against other statutorily protected groups? This comment discusses ENDA’s long history of broad religious exemption and its meanings for LGBT civil rights progress ahead. Part I traces ENDA’s religious exemption transformation from 1994 to present, noting a narrowing of the exemption as the LGBT movement witnessed increasing political success. Part II examines the delicate balance between the First Amendment Religion Clauses, as well as LGBT civil rights and religious freedom, and argues that ENDA’s previous exemptions tipped this delicate balance toward religious over-accommodation prohibited by the Establishment Clause. Part III concludes that the LGBT movement experienced a significant victory with the modified religious exemption in the 2009 version of ENDA, which challenged the conservative Christian bloc’s political and cultural monopoly over LGBT rights’ narrative, and represents the defeat of a potentially dangerous precedent for future civil rights struggles...|$|R
