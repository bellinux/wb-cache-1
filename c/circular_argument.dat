25|$|Stephen Oppenheimer {{reviewed}} the Weale and Capelli studies {{and suggested that}} correlations of gene frequency mean nothing without {{a knowledge of the}} genetic prehistory of the regions in question. His criticism of these studies is that they generated models based on the historical evidence of Gildas and Procopius, and then selected methodologies to test against these populations. Weale's transect spotlights that Belgium is further west in the genetic map than North Walsham, Asbourne and Friesland. In Oppenheimer's view, this is evidence that the Belgae and other continental people – and hence continental genetic markers indistinguishable from those ascribed to Anglo-Saxons – arrived earlier and were already strong in the 5th century in particular regions or areas. Oppenheimer, basing his research on the Weale and Capelli studies, maintains that none of the invasions since the Romans have {{had a significant impact on}} the gene pool of the British Isles, and that the inhabitants from prehistoric times belong to an Iberian genetic grouping. He says that most people in the British Isles are genetically similar to the Basque people of northern Spain and southwestern France, from 90% in Wales to 66% in East Anglia. Oppenheimer suggests that the division between the West and the East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion but originates with two main routes of genetic flow – one up the Atlantic coast, the other from neighbouring areas of Continental Europe – which occurred just after the Last Glacial Maximum. Bryan Sykes, a former geneticist at Oxford University, came to fairly similar conclusions as Oppenheimer, which he set forth in his 2006 book called Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of our Tribal History, published in the United States and Canada as Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland. Many feasible scenarios can be constructed to account for evidence. However, Y-chromosome evidence relies on the archaeological and historical evidence for interpretation, and there is a danger of creating a <b>circular</b> <b>argument.</b> Therefore, scenarios that are not justified by other evidence or are created to account for the historical evidence have not been universally accepted.|$|E

2500|$|Hume {{maintained}} that all knowledge, {{even the most}} basic beliefs about the natural world, cannot be conclusively established by reason. [...] Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. [...] Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a <b>circular</b> <b>argument.</b> Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction {{is that there is no}} certainty that the future will resemble the past. [...] Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.|$|E

He accepts that there is reason for the Jewish community to be concerned, but argues that any increase in antisemitic incidents is attributable to classical antisemitism. Proponents of the new antisemitism concept, he writes, see an organizing principle that allows them to formulate a new concept, but it is only in terms of this concept that many of the examples cited in evidence of it count as examples in the first place. That is, the creation of the concept may be based on a <b>circular</b> <b>argument</b> or tautology. He argues that it is an unhelpful concept, because it devalues the term [...] "antisemitism," [...] leading to widespread cynicism about the use of it. People of goodwill who support the Palestinians resent being falsely accused of antisemitism.|$|E
2500|$|Kidderminster, in Worcestershire, is {{sometimes}} {{said to be}} a corruption of the name of 'St Chad's Minster'. [...] However, place-names do not [...] "corrupt" [...] randomly, but evolve according to principles inherent {{in the history of the}} language. Chad or Ceadda would not normally evolve into Kidder. The existence of a minster dedicated to Chad in this town seems to be a legend traceable to Burton's 1890 History of Kidderminster, in which the author acknowledges that the only evidence for such a place is the name of the town. Later writers seem to assume the existence of the monastery and then explain the name of the town from it– a <b>circular</b> <b>argument</b> that collapses if a plausible alternative explanation is available for the name. A grant of land by Æthelbald of Mercia in 736 to one Cyneberht is generally accepted as the origin of the settlement. Cameron suggests that the minster was named after a lay benefactor (normal with -minster formations) and hypothesises Cydela, a suggestion that has found general acceptance. Another possibility might be the later Mercian dux Cydda. Certainly it seems that there was a dynasty of Mercian noblemen, all with similar names beginning Cy and connected to the area. These provide a more plausible explanation for the name of the town than St Chad or his non-existent minster.|$|E

Specifically, he argued that the very reasons that can make SSAs strong arguments mean that we should be poor at abiding by the distinction between good and bad SSAs, making SSAs inherently undesirable.

Scholars have admitted that Fleck’s account of the active and passive elements of knowledge has confused them, and it has been read in at least three different ways: as an extreme form of relativism, as a form of realism, and as a more ‘middle way’ in-between these poles. I argue that he ‘middle way’ view is both more congenial with the bulk of Fleck’s work, and more palatable to medical practitioners. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This is a {{critical}} evaluation of Gone, Miller and Rappaport’s (1999) analysis {{of the significance of}} past personal narrative for the study of conceptual self in cultural identity. Gone et al. address the dilemma, in cultural psychology, of how best to concentrate analytic attention upon the agency of the individual, on the one hand, while simultaneously assessing the pre-existing framework of semiotic resources constructing individual action, on the other. The authors, correctly I believe, critique both extremes of reducing these processes either to an autonomous agent, an individual more or less creatively free from the conventions of cultural expression, or, alternatively, to the reification of culture as monolithic and propelling the passive individual. This commentary, it is hoped, drawing upon cultural anthropological and psychological anthropological paradigms, contributes toward resolution of these <b>circular</b> <b>arguments,</b> which tend to vacillate between individualist and collectivist conceptions of culture, society and the individual.
