25|$|Shortly after release, some users {{complained about}} the {{lighting}} implementation on the Kindle Paperwhite. While not widespread, some users found the lighting to be inconsistent, causing the bottom edge to cast irregular shadows.

50|$|Compact {{fluorescent}} lamps {{are available in}} a variety of styles and shapes. Some have tubes and ballasts permanently connected, while others are separate allowing you to change the tube without changing the ballast. There are also CFLs enclosed in a glass globe, which look similar to conventional incandescent light bulbs. CFLs fit most fixtures designed for incandescent lamps, although only some <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dimmed.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{method of}} {{installing}} cove lighting is by using T5 fluorescent tubes. T5 luminaires are an energy-efficient alternative to larger luminaires (such as T8 lamps) because they save on materials. An even better energy-efficient {{alternative is to}} use LED strips, mounted on an aluminium profiles for optimum heat dissipation, with prismatic covers. With a dimming controller (either analog 1..10V controls or digital, DALI based), the cove lighting <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dimmed.</b> A wide range of LEDs are available, from warm white, daylight and even colour changing RGB modules.|$|E
50|$|LED strips are not {{dimmable}} in {{the conventional}} sense. Attempting to vary {{the brightness of the}} LEDs by changing the external voltage is impractical. However, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dimmed</b> using pulse-width modulation (PWM) dimmers. These rapidly switch the LEDs on and off, typically 20 times per second, by changing the voltage from zero to the expected value as a square wave. The relative width of the on and off portions of the square wave can be varied so that the LEDs are on or off for relatively more or less time, leading to a perceived (and to some extent real, with phosphor-coated LEDs) change in the brightness.|$|E
50|$|The {{contrast}} within individual frames (simultaneous contrast) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{increased when}} the backlight <b>can</b> <b>be</b> locally <b>dimmed.</b> This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> achieved with backlight units that are realized with arrays of LEDs. High-dynamic-range (HDR) LCDs are using that technique {{in order to}} realize (static) contrast values {{in the range of}} CR > 100.000.|$|R
5000|$|Dimming: LEDs <b>can</b> {{very easily}} <b>be</b> <b>dimmed</b> either by {{pulse-width}} modulation or lowering the forward current. This pulse-width modulation is why LED lights, particularly headlights on cars, when viewed on camera or by some people, {{appear to be}} flashing or flickering. This {{is a type of}} stroboscopic effect.|$|R
50|$|Dimming {{fluorescent}} ballasts and dimming LED drivers {{often use}} 0-10 V control signals to control dimming functions. In many cases, the dimming {{range of the}} power supply or ballast is limited. If the light output <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> <b>dimmed</b> from 100% down to 10%, {{there must be a}} switch or relay available to kill power to the system and turn the light completely off. Some 0-10 V controllers offer a built-in line voltage relay, others require an external line voltage relay. Depending on the application, these options should be considered.|$|R
50|$|This {{aspect is}} {{problematic}} {{in the case}} of backlights used for LCD TV displays. New energy efficiency regulations being proposed in many countries will require variable backlighting; variable backlightling also improves the perceived contrast range, which is desirable for LCD TV sets. However, CCFLs are strictly limited in {{the degree to which they}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dimmed,</b> both because a lower plasma current will lower the temperature of the cathode, causing erratic operation, and because running the cathode at too low a temperature drastically shortens the life of the lamps. Much research is being directed to this problem, but high-end manufacturers are now turning to high-efficiency white LEDs as a better solution.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the area}} of the screen that can be {{dynamically}} adjusted {{is a function of the}} backlighting source. CCFLs are thin tubes that light up many rows (or columns) across the entire screen at once, and that light is spread out with diffusers. The CCFL must be driven with enough power to light the brightest area of the portion of the image in front of it, so if the image is light on one side and dark on the other, this technique cannot be used successfully. Displays backlit by full arrays of LEDs have an advantage, because each LED lights only a small patch of the screen. This allows the dynamic backlighting to be used on a much wider variety of images. Edge-lit displays do not enjoy this advantage. These displays have LEDs only along the edges and use a light guide plate covered with thousands of convex bumps that reflect light from the side-firing LEDs out through the LCD matrix and filters. LEDs on edge-lit displays <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dimmed</b> only globally, not individually. For cost reasons, most of LCD TVs have edge-lit backlighting.|$|E
50|$|The new {{temple of}} Thespis is {{situated}} {{on the site of}} the famous old California Theatre. It is perfectly fire-proof, and has 19 exits. The main entrance, on Bush street, is formed by a Roman arch of massive proportions and striking design. The vestibule is rectangular in shape, is finished in antique oak panelling, with pilasters and arabesques, and is lighted by thirty-two 16 candle-power lamps and an electrolier of eight 82's. In the beautiful foyer is another large electrolier.In the auditorium, behind the eight proscenium boxes, with dome-shaped canopies supported by columns, rise arches of Indian fretwork carrying pillars surmounted by 88 candle-power lamps enclosed in opalescent globes shaped like pineapples. The ceiling consists of three concave divisions extending from wall to wall parallel with the front of the stage, gradually rising upward, and separated by narrow panels or chords. It is crossed by four bands of dark color, in which, as well as in the chords and fantastic tracery of the decorations, are set numbers of lamps. From the ceiling, over the parquet and near the boxes, depend three rich electroliers similar in design to those throughout the house, formed by a centre fixture of opalescent glass held in cast metal work, with four pendants of the same shape hanging by chains attached to arms radiating from the stem of the fixture. All the electroliers were specially designed by J. M. Wood, of Chicago, the architect.Throughout the house the decorations are so designed that lamps in the midst of bands of flowers, dados and carvings, not only afford light, but add hitherto unknown features to the general ornamentation. At the back of the metal and plastic tracery of the boxes, balcony and gallery, panels of cathedral glass are inserted, which soften the radiance of 16 candle-power lamps set behind, and give to the railings the effect of carvings thrown into relief by mellow light. For producing winter and moonlight effects, and as a substitute for calcium light, six movable bunch lights, with silvered reflectors, are provided.The rheostats, which control all the lamps in the house, are of novel design. They are divided into six parts, which are in connection with six step-by-step switches, capable of being operated rapidly and positively. The handles of the switches can be locked to a shaft which runs through all; by tightening the handles of the switches to the shaft every part of the house <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dimmed</b> at once, and by loosening any number, any portions can be regulated at the will of the switch-man. Being equally divided, one-half the lamps in the auditorium can gradually be turned down while the other half is being lighted, producing a fine blending effect. This is probably the only theatre in the country where the switches are so arranged.|$|E
40|$|A {{very large}} {{proportion}} of the world's animal species <b>are</b> active in <b>dim</b> light, either under the cover of night or {{in the depths of the}} sea.

The eye designs of nocturnal and deep-sea animals have evolved in response to these two very different types of habitats, being optimised for maximum sensitivity to extended scenes, or to point sources, or to both. After describing the many visual adaptations that have evolved across the animal kingdom for maximising sensitivity to extended and point-source scenes, I then use case studies from the recent literature to show how these adaptations have endowed nocturnal animals with excellent vision. Nocturnal animals can see colour and negotiate dimly illuminated obstacles during flight. They can also navigate using learned terrestrial landmarks, the constellations of stars or the dim pattern of polarised light formed around the moon. The conclusion from these studies is clear: nocturnal habitats are just as rich in visual details as diurnal habitats are, and nocturnal animals have evolved visual systems capable of exploiting them. The same is certainly true of deep-sea animals, as future research will no doubt reveal...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-cost solution of converting the popularly adopted non-dimmable electronic ballast circuit for fluorescent lamps with self-oscillating series resonant inverter into a dimmable one. Dimming function {{is achieved by}} increasing the switching frequency of the inverter from the natural frequency of the resonant tank, so that less energy is coupled to the lamp. Control of the switching frequency is based on deriving an adjustable dc current source from the resonant inductor in the resonant tank to control the operating point of the saturable transformers for driving the switches in the inverter. The overall implementation does not require any integrated circuit. A 17 W prototype has been built and studied. Theoretical predictions have been verified with experimental results.

5000|$|This is a {{technique}} for expanding the contrast of LCD-screens. LCD-screens comprise a backlight unit which is permanently emitting light and an LCD-panel {{in front of it}} which modulates transmission of light with respect to intensity and chromaticity. In order to increase the contrast of such LCD-screens the backlight <b>can</b> <b>be</b> (globally) <b>dimmed</b> when the image to be displayed is dark (i.e. not comprising high intensity image data) while the image data is numerically corrected and adapted to the reduced backlight intensity.

Also the contrast within one frame <b>can</b> <b>be</b> expanded intentionally depending on the histogram of the image (some sporadic highlights in an image may be cut or suppressed).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the concept of}} energy efficient building design and three good practices which has been realized at Petra Christian University, Surabaya, Indonesia. The first priority, {{in the concept of}} energy efficient building, should use the passive environmental control, which maximizing the usage of building envelope (roof, walls, floors) and building elements (landscaping, accessories, doors, windows), to be designed carefully and accurately without electricity to achieve the thermal comfort and visual comfort of the buildings. Then the active environmental control as well as the hybrid environmental control can be implemented to gain greater energy efficiency usage. Ir. Jimmy Priatman, M. Arch, an architect and senior lecturer of Petra Christian University has successfully build two energy efficient buildings, named Gedung Graha Pangeran (2002), belongs to BNI Bank which the energy usage is only 144 KWh/m 2 /year, and Gedung Graha Wonokoyo (2006), a privat company which its energy usage is only 88 KWh/m 2 /year. The energy usage of those two buildings are far below the minimum National Energy Efficient Index in Indonesia, which number is 200 KWh/m 2 /year. Electronic keys for 22 class rooms has been installed at Petra Christian University since early 2009 gradually, yet this accessories donâ€™t show significant reduction in energy consumption of the whole building. Smart LED Lamp control has been accomplished as a model of active environmental control.

In the phase control circuit (19), an ignition signal is generated at the predetermined phase control angle in the half-wave following the first half-wave.

40|$|Global warming {{challenges}} {{designers to}} pay attention to environmental effects of manufacturing when designing new products. This examination project was a personal challenge to uphold ethical responsibility as a designer and consider emotional aspects of design while aiming to create a pleasurable lighting for the home environment. The underpinning idea for the project was to promote the use of recycled materials and an environmentally friendly light source aiming to create a sustainable everyday commonplace product {{that it is possible to}} manufacture. High power LED-technology was chosen because of its energy efficiency, flexibility and a particularly long life-cycle. Recycled plastic and fibre cardboard were chosen to be applied as the shades of the lamps. Both these recycled materials can be broken down and recycled again after use. Emotional design aspect was the leading theory in the design process. The intention was to consider different levels of emotional aspects when defining the main characteristics of the lamp to create pleasurable lighting: Among usability and aesthetics the concentration was on the semiotics of the product and its usage context. It was designed with the aim of evoking pleasurable feelings in users who desire to lead an active and urban life-style but who are simultaneously worried about global warming. Both of the lighting designs are for a dining context. They are supposed to create a pleasurable atmosphere around a dining table while separating the party around the table from the rest of the space. Other lights <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dimmed</b> or switched off when it is time to gather around the table to accentuate the illumination and feeling of togetherness.

40|$|Organic {{light-emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) {{are considered a}} possible light source of the future. Like inorganic {{light-emitting diodes}}, they show much higher efficiencies than incandescent bulbs and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dimmed</b> and turn on instantaneously in contrast to gas discharge lamps. A unique advantage of OLEDs is the possibility to manufacture them with large active areas. Especially the deposition of complex layer structures of organic molecules via VTE (vacuum thermal evaporation) or OVPD (organic vapor phase deposition) enables the production of very efficient OLEDs. Understanding the electrical processes in such structures is crucial for purposeful optimization. It was investigated in this work to what degree a contradiction-free simulation of carrier transport in material blends and over energy barriers at interfaces is possible when thermally activated tunnelling of carriers in Gaussian densities of states is assumed. Based on an extensive literature research, suitable models were chosen, partially modified and combined to derive a compact expression of carrier mobility dependence on mixing ratio of two materials, temperature, electric field and carrier concentration. Therein, the energetically favourable material for the considered carrier type is called guest, {{the other one is}} called host material. The mobility parameterization is valid in two regimes of the mixing ratio: the guest-to-guest regime with sufficiently high and the trap-controlled regime with low guest concentration. The relevant parameters are the widths and relative energetic positions of the densities of states and a material-specific decay constant describing the exponential decrease of carrier transition rates with increasing molecule distance. Additionally, there is a material-specific attempt frequency determining the absolute value of these transition rates for given positional and energetic distances. In the literature, the last two magnitudes were mostly neglected so far in the evaluation of measurements. In this work, the decay constant played a crucial role because it determines carrier heating in the presence of an electric field. Here, IV curves were modelled for the first time under the assumption of carrier heating in a Gaussian density of states. A simulation program was developed based on the resulting mobility parameterization to verify the model through evaluation of test structures and to make it usable for the support of OLED design. Simulations showed the possibility of purposeful modulation of the recombination zone by spatial variation of carrier mobility. In detailed examinations of guest-to-guest transport, a mostly contradiction-free simulation of IV curves at different temperatures and guest concentrations was demonstrated, only the increase of field dependence with decreasing guest concentration was slightly overestimated. Compared to established models, a clear improvement was found in the comparison of measurements and simulations. Also a comparative study of guest-to-guest and trap-controlled transport was performed for the first time. For two different material systems, convincing simulations of both regimes were demonstrated with unified parameter sets. In doing so, also a newly suggested model of field dependence in the trap-controlled regime was used. Only diodes of pristine materials showed discrepancies between measurements and simulations, especially at low voltages. This could be explained at least partially with injection limitation of the current. Interfaces between organic materials were modelled with parameters extracted from the mobility measurements. The assumption of quasi-Fermi level alignment at the interface in combination with carrier heating proved superior to an existing model, the simulation at low electric fields remains difficult, though. The model was finally used for the simulation of OLEDs with different doping profiles. The trends of measured optical properties agreed qualitatively with the characteristics of the simulated recombination zones. Summarized, the present work delivers numerous indications for the possibility of contradiction-free modelling of OLEDs and for the practical use of the simulation...|$|E
