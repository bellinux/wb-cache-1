50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{variation}} in climate, Eastern Australia also provides different ground cover substrates as potential habitats. The species prefers an open substrate environment because the ground cover and loose leaf litter allows for thermoregulation, protection and optimal foraging conditions. Females and males remain sheltered in the leaf litter and their cryptic coloration adds an additional <b>camouflage</b> <b>element</b> but it is inconclusive {{as to whether the}} habitat distribution directly caused the color dimorphism.|$|R
50|$|Legendary Whitetails’ {{primary market}} consist of deer hunters and their families, thus, many items {{incorporate}} <b>camouflage</b> design <b>elements</b> within the product. Legendary Whitetails utilizes five individual camouflage brands with over 20 unique camouflage patterns and styles to design products.|$|R
40|$|When authenticating {{over the}} {{telephone}} or mobile headphone, the user cannot always assure that no eavesdropper hears the authentication secret. We describe an eavesdropperresistant authentication scheme for spoken authentication. This entails the user memorizing {{a small number of}} plaintext-ciphertext pairs. At authentication, these are challenged randomly and interspersed with <b>camouflage</b> <b>elements.</b> It is shown that the response can be made to appear random so that no information on the memorized secret is available to eavesdroppers. We describe the method along with parameter value tradeoffs of security strength, authentication time, and memory effort. We also describe early results of its implementation in a hands-free communication system deployed at a hospital. This method is not restricted to spoken passwords. In general, it is a one-time password scheme that can be used, for instance, for computer login to defend against keystroke logger attacks. An advantage over other one-time schemes {{is that it does not}} require the user to carry a token or password list...|$|R
5000|$|Release Magazine {{gave the}} album a mostly {{positive}} review, stating [...] "...slightly more pop tuned, but still holds all the <b>Camouflage</b> trademark <b>elements.</b> Personal vocal performances, gloom and pop all in one. The single [...] "Motif Sky" [...] {{is one of}} the tracks that have blossomed through repeated listening, as have [...] "We Are Lovers" [...] and my current favourite [...] "Dreaming". Except for the exceptionally dreary [...] "How Do You Feel?", [...] "Relocated" [...] is a solid effort, maybe lacking somewhat in raw hit power".|$|R
50|$|In much of {{the animal}} kingdom, it's kill or be killed on a daily basis, as creatures {{struggle}} to survive and a cycle {{of life and death}} is an everyday event in the wild. This documentary series chronicles the different yet lethal techniques used in this dance of death, from animals that work in well-organized gangs to lone killers that capture prey using <b>camouflage</b> and the <b>element</b> of surprise.|$|R
5|$|Camouflage {{was first}} practiced in simple {{form in the}} mid 18th century by jäger- or rifle units. Their tasks {{required}} them to be inconspicuous, and they were issued green and later other drab colour uniforms. With the advent of longer range and more accurate weapons, especially the repeating rifle, camouflage was adopted for the uniforms of all armies, spreading to most forms of military equipment including ships and aircraft. Many modern camouflage textiles address visibility not only to visible light but also near infrared, for concealment from night vision devices. Camouflage is not only visual; heat, sound, magnetism and even smell {{can be used to}} target weapons, and may be intentionally concealed. Some forms of <b>camouflage</b> have <b>elements</b> of scale invariance, designed to disrupt outlines at different distances, typically digital camouflage patterns made of pixels.|$|R
5000|$|The form of {{the former}} RAAF Operations building, a {{reinforced}} concrete bunker below, and a timber residential building above, to disguise the lower building, is a now rare example of a camouflaged building from the Second World War surviving in its partially <b>camouflaged</b> form. Other <b>elements</b> of <b>camouflage</b> indicated on drawings at the time, such as the artificial tree and the painting of stumps and balustrading on the traverse no longer survive. The traverse is also no longer extant, demolished at an unknown date. The major aspect of the camouflage however, the timber [...] "residential" [...] upper floor still survives and allows the building to be understood.|$|R
40|$|Heat can {{generally}} transfer via thermal conduction, thermal radiation, {{and thermal}} convection. All the existing theories of transformation thermotics and optics can treat thermal conduction and thermal radiation, respectively. Unfortunately, thermal convection {{has never been}} touched in transformation theories {{due to the lack}} of a suitable theory, thus limiting applications associated with heat transfer through fluids (liquid or gas). Here, we develop, for the first time, a general theory of transformation thermal convection by considering the convection-diffusion equation, the Navier-Stokes equation, and the Darcy law. By introducing porous media, we get a set of coupled equations keeping their forms under coordinate transformation. As model applications, the theory helps to show the effects of cloaking, concentrating, and <b>camouflage.</b> Our finite <b>element</b> simulations confirm the theoretical findings. This work offers a general transformation theory for thermal convection, thus revealing some novel behaviors of thermal convection; it not only provides new hints on how to control heat transfer by combining thermal conduction, thermal radiation, and thermal convection, but also benefits the study of mass diffusion and other related fields that contain a set of equations and need to transform velocities at the same time.

30|$|We {{selected}} non-parametric method ViBe [10], texture-based method SILTP [21], and MC-SILTP [23] for comparison. Based on sample consensus, ViBe {{can achieve}} very good results {{with very few}} tunable parameters. It was showed that ViBe performs better than many state-of-the-art parametric and non-parametric algorithms such as [6, 9]. ViBe uses RGB color model and a fixed spherical distance of 30 in matching new pixel with background samples. It keeps 20 background samples, and the new pixel is identified as background with two matches. SILTP employs scale invariant local patterns. It was showed [21] that it performs better than other LBP-based methods [20]. MC-SILTP is one latest texture-based method and can perform even better with pattern obtained by cross-computation on RGB color channels. We implemented SILTP with {{the same set of}} parameters as reported in [21]. The only parameter value which was not mentioned is the number of training frames. Through experimentation, we find that the number of training frames is best fixed as 150. Similarly, we implemented MC-SILTP with the same setting as reported in [23]. The Wallflower dataset contains videos exhibiting gradual illumination change (TimeOfDay), sudden illumination change (LightSwitch), similar background and object color (<b>Camouflage),</b> moving background <b>elements</b> (Waving Trees), etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{detectability}} of {{a target}} in the infrared spectral region is determined by differences between the radiative signatures of the target and the local background. This implies that both, the difference in surface temperature and emissivity ΔT resp. Δε {{and the distribution of}} these differences over the target area and the background, are of major importance. Therefore camouflage measures have to address both issues in order to achieve maximum signature adaptation to the background. To determine the ability of a camouflage material to follow temperature changes in the background, temperatures measurements of camouflage systems and background elements have to be performed under a variety of meteorological conditions. Measurements of representative weather- and background conditions are needed to determine those situations where the camouflage material effectively reduces the target signature. The degree of temperature reduction depends on the required level of protection, that is for detection, recognition, and identification. Statistical analyses are given for various camouflage materials in relation to a number of background <b>elements.</b> <b>Camouflage</b> effectiveness is expressed in the percentage of time for which the apparent temperature contrast between the camouflage material and a background element is 1 °C, 2 °C, or 5 °C. Analyses are performed for five consecutive weeks of measurements in summer and winter, using data which were taken during a measurement campaign at Gilze-Rijen Air Force Base in 1990...|$|R
40|$|Metamaterials are {{engineered}} materials where artificial properties like negative refractive index, zero-index, -artificial magnetism, perfect absorption, {{and others have}} been demonstrated. Various two-dimensional metamaterials were fabricated using conventional lithographic techniques. In order to qualify metamaterials as true -materials that enables curving out real devices, one need to develop three-dimensional metamaterials. However, fabrication of three-dimensional metamaterials based on conventional electron and ion beam lithography is very tedious. Although this method provides the necessary submicron resolution and excellent control over the in-plane geometries, its practical use is restricted to overall lateral dimensions of 3 ̆c 100 s of microns. This size limitation, taken together with the complexity of the lithography tools and their extremely slow patterning speeds, makes this technique poorly suited to requirements for realistic applications in superlenses, photonic components or others, where cost, throughput, area coverage, and long range uniformity are important considerations. Alternative -approaches to 3 D nanofabrication, such as those based on colloidal self-assembly, interference lithography, and two photon polymerization based direct laser writing lack the ability to embed multiple metal/dielectric layers over a 3 D space. Nanoimprint lithography and various forms of soft lithography, in their standard embodiments, offer the necessary resolution, but they do not form 3 D structures easily. We developed a nanotransfer printing method that is directly applicable to fabrication of 3 D metamaterials with excellent optical characteristics, in ways that are scalable to arbitrarily large areas and compatible with manufacturing. We use the resulting methods to fabricate 3 D near-infrared negative index metamaterials with 11 -layers and sub-micron unit cell dimensions, over areas 3 ̆e 75 cm 2, corresponding to 3 ̆e 105 x 105 unit cells, all with excellent uniformity and minimal defects. With further modifications in material choice and deposition process, the optical response is scaled down to the visible domain. Optical devices like infrared detectors, biosensors, <b>camouflage,</b> and display <b>elements</b> are developed based on these large sheets of metamaterials...|$|R
