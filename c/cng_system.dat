40|$|The use {{natural gas}} in {{transportation}} {{is well established}} globally with over 18 million natural gas vehicles (NGVs) distributed through more than 90 countries of the world. This paper discusses several safety issues involved with using natural gas as a transportation fuel. After introducing the NGVs safety aspects and reviewing various standards for compressed natural gas (<b>CNG)</b> <b>system,</b> the paper discusses the 55 CNG-related accidents in Pakistan (which conduced to over 250 casualties) and analyzes the causes for these accidents and extracts “lessons to be learned” for CNG. The analysis reveals that due to low-quality <b>CNG</b> <b>system</b> material, e. g., CNG cylinder, CNG design and installation, maintenance system, etc., lack of strict government CNG vehicle safety regulations and driver negligence every year several CNG vehicles’ accidents took place in Pakistan which showed {{a major threat to}} life in Pakistan...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the project}} is to enhance the {{performance}} of the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) at the Tour de Sol race through various improvements. Although the basic structure of the HEV was unchanged, many systems in the vehicle had undergone certain degrees of modifications. The vehicle components modified included the electrical vehicle (EV) group, alignment parts for the DC motor and transmission, power steering, TV and transmission cables, Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) ignition key, transmission cooler mount, and the CNG Tank and CNG transport system. The transmission cooler mount, new brakes and drums were also installed Modifications to the EV were completed by March 2000. The EV was tested for several weeks before completing the installation of the <b>CNG</b> <b>system.</b> Once the <b>CNG</b> <b>system</b> was operation, tests were done on the HEV. Problems were encountered with virtually every system implemented by the 1998 - 1999 team. These problems were solved as they arose, and by mid-April 2000 the HEV was running and the team was taking energy usage data. This data was critical in helping to determine how the vehicle would perform in the Tour de Sol race, as the winner of the race is determined by measuring vehicle energy usage per mile driven. Barring any unforeseen catastrophes, the 1999 - 2000 team will meet its goals...|$|E

40|$|Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is {{a natural}} gas i. e. methane, in {{compressed}} form. Natural gas at ambient temperature and pressure has very low energy density compared to other fuels. To use natural gas as a transportation fuel, it must be compressed to increase its volumetric energy density. In recent years due to spiraling hike of fuel price, Bangladesh government had no other options but to increase in fuel price. This has led to increase in conversion of petrol/octane automobiles into <b>CNG</b> <b>system,</b> which runs on natural gas abundantly available in this country. How more and more CNG conversion workshops have developed and CNG has gained popularity and acceptability at a rapid pace. The {{purpose of this study}} is to access the popularity of CNG as an alternative automobile fuel. In many respects, the distribution of modal choices in Dhaka is unique among cities of comparable size in the Asia region. Almost 60 % of the 8. 5 million weekday person trips are walk trips and about 19. 2 % use rickshaw. For the remaining 20 % trips on motorized models. The high dependence on walking and rickshaw, both slow and typically best suited for short trips on secondary roads and a low dependence on buses, in a city of 14. 5 million people with an urban area about 2000 sq. km. is a symptom of inefficient and ineffective transport operations as well as uncontrollable land use (DOE 2011). The number of CNG vehicles plying on road till to date is 204243 (RPGCL, May- 2012). Taking an average of 15 liter/day per vehicle, the cost of CNG use per annum amounts to tk. 170. 00 crore.

40|$|Driving on CNG is {{preferable}} to conventional fuels because of diversification of the energy mix, local availability of natural gas, the financial benefit and the transition function towards (sustain-able) biogas and emission reduction. Furthermore, the CNG technology {{is expected to be}} safer than conventional fuels, mainly because of the physical properties of natural gas. Compared to conventional fuels, driving on natural gas emits less CO 2 (compared to gasoline), NOx and PM (compared to diesel). Differences are declining due to technological improvements. The report and research is based on the differentiation of levels of scale. By enquiring the relevant factors on the different levels of scale, more insight inside the level of scale can be achieved. By observing the levels of scale all together, interactions between the different levels of scale will be clarified. For development of a CNG market, the government plays an important role. First, the government should initiate a demand by involving the use of natural gas vehicles in their own fleets. By intro-ducing long term financial incentives and environmental policies, the market should be able to evolve. According to case studies, the best-case potential CNG market penetration in the Nether-lands is estimated on 14 %, resulting in significant emission reductions. Besides this emission re-duction, the introduction of CNG as a transport fuel will pave the road for the introduction of sus-tainable produced biogas. The development of CNG is mainly dependent on the fuel costs; currently 50 % of diesel and 35 % of gasoline. But since there is no long-term tax guarantee given by the government, price of CNG may become as high as the current diesel price, eventually resulting in extinction of the CNG mar-ket. The <b>CNG</b> <b>system</b> discussion shows that the government fulfils an essential role in the CNG market development. This underlines the conclusion of the case studies. The government forms an essen-tial link within the cycle that is decisive for positive or negative characteristics of the cycle. With this fact taken into consideration, the CNG market formation can be positively influenced by gov-ernmental incentives and stimulating initiatives. ...|$|E

40|$|Two stroke spark {{ignition}} engines have high exhaust emissions and low {{brake thermal efficiency}} due to the short circuiting losses and incomplete combustion, which occur during idling and at part load operating conditions.

40|$|This article aims at {{describing}} the opportunity deriving from {{the substitution of}} conventional fuels, as gasoline and diesel, with the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), frequently indicated as methane. The use of <b>CNG</b> <b>systems</b> in vehicles cannot be considered the ultimate {{solution to the problem}} of pollution generated by road transport, but the advantages of this fuel are: a) 	relevant, as it concerns consumer’s expenses and ecological aspect; b) rapidly achievable, waiting for availability of new technologies capable of more relevant advantages; c) 	close to hand for several countries: Europe and U. S. and those where the motorization is at the take-off stage, like the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), and others like: Iran, Pakistan, Indonesia and so on. In fact, such countries in take-off stage on the one hand have extensive reserves of methane, and on the other hand need to cut emission urgently, specifically in areas with a high density of population. From the economic point of view CNG results a viable solution with few contraindication. The most important bottleneck is represented by a possible shortage in the distribution network. If a country is crossed by a gas pipeline this shortage could be overcome rapidly and without relevant costs. In the others the solution could be achieved either through gas carriers ships or through local production of biomethane by the exploitation of biomasses. ...|$|R
