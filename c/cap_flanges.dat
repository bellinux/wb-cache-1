Twenty-five to 38 layers of tape on each <b>cap</b> and <b>flange</b> are vacuum-bagged into shape and then {{interleaved}} with plies of fabric to form light-weight structural members free of wrinkles and voids.

25|$|Bottle caps, or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The crown cork, the first form of a bottle <b>cap,</b> possessed <b>flanges</b> bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.|$|R
5000|$|The DB-80's high, {{cantilever}} wing was unusual both in its construction and high aspect ratio of 9. In plan it was straight tapered on both edges but with semi-elliptical tips curved {{particularly on the}} trailing edges, where its ailerons were full span and broad. The wing was built around three spars, rather than the traditional one or two and the detail of their <b>caps</b> or <b>flanges,</b> rather than {{the shape of the}} longitudinal braces or ribs, determined the airfoil profile. [...] A similar but not identical wing structure was used on the Dyle et Bacalan DB-20.|$|R

Caps also perform as cylinder mounting components <b>flange,</b> <b>cap</b> trunnion, cap clevis. Cap size is determined based on the bending stress. A static seal / o-ring is used in between cap and barrel (except welded construction).|$|R
40|$|Recent field {{observations}} in bridge falsework identified potential {{deficiencies in the}} design of falsework resulting in localized bending in sill and <b>cap</b> beam <b>flanges</b> and lateral buckling in other beams. Possible limits states associated with the bearing of timber and steel posts on cap and sill beams are investigated in this report. The critical limit states are related to flange bending, post crushing or yielding, web yielding, web crippling, lateral web buckling and corbel crushing. Different methods are investigated for predicting the capacity of the flange. The first assumes a uniform stress distribution resulting in bending of the flange. This is adequate for timber posts, but not as accurate at the second more elaborate method which accounts for an interaction between flange bending and post compression strength, found to be effective for timber posts. The third method uses an effective bearing area of the post, which is more effective with steel posts. For beams with relatively thick webs, such as those typically used in bridge falsework, the web was found to have a greater capacity than th...|$|R
40|$|The {{target system}} envisioned for a Muon Collider/Neutrino Factory [1] {{features}} a liquid Hg jet target {{immersed in a}} 20 -T solenoidal field. Field quality limits intercoil gaps to ≈ 40 % of the O. D. of the flanking coils. Longitudinal sag of the tungsten shielding vessels limits their length to ≈ 7 m. Support members adequate to resist intercryostat axial forces require an aggregate cross section of ≈ 0. 1 m 2; the cryogenic heat leakage may be large. The innermost shielding vessel wall can be adequately cooled by helium gas only if its pressure is ≈ 10 atm and its velocity is ≈ 200 m/s. However, the analysis in this paper found none of these engineering challenges to be insurmountable. GEOMETRY OF COILS & SHIELDING Figure 1 sketches (in pink) a longitudinal, vertical section of the first dozen superconducting (SC) coils in the target-magnet design IDS 120 k. Every cryostat has three coils. Cryostat # 1 begins at z ≈− 3 m and ends at z ≈ 4 m (where the downstream end of the beam/jet interaction region is at z = 0); subsequent intercryostat gaps are at spacings of 5 meters. Figure 1 : Longitudinal, vertical section of coils in design IDS 120 k. Figure 2 sketches a longitudinal, vertical section of components inside, and in the bore of, Cryostat # 1.

40|$|A droplet {{detection}} method {{has been developed}} to measure the distribution of droplet sizes on a flat plate under dropwise condensation. Dropwise condensation heat transfer may be modeled by combining an expression for the single droplet heat transfer rate with the droplet size distribution. The ability to measure this distribution is integral to the validation of such models. An example study is undertaken in which heat flux is obtained for a given surface treatment by implementing such a model and measuring the droplet size distribution. These results are compared with the heat flux measured by internal coolant temperature monitoring for external condensation on a tube featuring the same surface treatment. The plate condensing heat exchanger is a modular design for condensate visualization. The core of the design is a four way pipe cross with open flanges on each end. <b>Flange</b> <b>caps</b> are designed to accomplish the goal of condensate visualization, and are easily exchangeable depending on design intent. The sample side flange features a conductive contact between an external cold plate and internally mounted sample. A viewing flange opposite the sample side flange allows for lighting and capture of video data of the condensation process. A third flange features an internal, concentric boiler for steam generation. A vacuum pump valve and ambient temperature and pressure sensors are fitted to the fourth <b>flange</b> <b>cap.</b> Dropwise condensation models are explored in this setup by detection of droplets in the captured video data. Droplet detection is performed by a Circle Hough Transform that has been modified to handle the order of magnitude differences in droplet radii within the same image. The Circle Hough Transform is applied to detect a radius range corresponding to the largest droplets, then the next largest droplets, and so on until the smallest detectable droplets have been marked. Detections in any given stage of the modified Circle Hough Transform are used to mask the detection region for the next stage. This reduces detection noise emanating from larger droplets that would otherwise overwhelm detections of smaller droplets. Another technique used in reducing detection noise involves illumination leveling, morphological erosion, and morphological reconstruction of the video data. The combination of these methods yield measurements of the droplet size distribution suitable for heat transfer analysis. The droplet size distribution is dependent upon a balance between droplet growth and sweeping of condensate, which is observable by analyzing the distribution in each frame of the video data. While the distribution is constant for very large condensing surfaces, the local droplet size distribution varies as droplets nucleate, grow, coalesce, and are swept away by departing droplets. This apparatus and {{detection method}} {{make it possible to}} observe time dependent growth and sweeping mechanisms as well as the droplet size distribution that emerges from these mechanisms. This study demonstrates the utility of the apparatus and detection method for the validation of dropwise condensation heat transfer models...|$|R
40|$|This present {{paper is}} the second in a series which {{together}} detail the static behaviour, fractographic observations, fatigue behaviour and finite element predictions of composite I-beams subjected to mechanical loads. Fractographic observations associated with the mechanical behaviour under static load of both unnotched and web- and flange-notched continuously reinforced carbon-fibre/epoxy and E-glass-fibre/epoxy I-beams are discussed. Ultrasonic scanning, X-radiography and both optical and scanning electron microscopy {{have been used to}} elucidate the presence of different damage mechanisms and the directions of delamination growth in different regions of the beams. The principal damage mechanisms which have been identified as causing failure are delamination, matrix cracking, splitting and fibre fracture. As discussed in detail in the previous paper, a four-point flexural configuration was used. A mode of buckling that was antisymmetric across the width of the compressive flange was observed prior to failure in all cases. Failure of the unnotched I-beams initiated from a buckle on the compressive flange and the subsequent damage was predominantly in the form of delamination. The main delaminations were along the interfaces between the separate sub-components which comprise the I-beams: namely, the <b>flange</b> <b>caps</b> and C-sections and the backs of the two C-sections. These are all interfaces i. e. the relative fibre angle between the adjacent plies is 90 °. Failure of the notched I-beams initiated from a shear-loaded circular cutout within the web. The critical damage mechanism was matrix cracking in local plies which were subject to local tensile stresses. Fibre fracture and component failure resulted from this matrix cracking...|$|R
