5000|$|The densest {{parts of}} the {{filaments}} and clumps are called [...] "molecular cores", while the densest molecular <b>cores</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "dense molecular cores" [...] and have densities in excess of 104 to 106 particles per cubic centimeter. Observationally, typical molecular <b>cores</b> <b>are</b> traced with CO and dense molecular <b>cores</b> <b>are</b> traced with ammonia. The concentration of dust within molecular <b>cores</b> <b>is</b> normally sufficient to block light from background stars so that they appear in silhouette as dark nebulae.|$|R
500|$|In 2016, <b>cores</b> <b>were</b> {{retrieved}} from the Allan Hills in Antarctica {{in an area}} where old ice lay near the surface. [...] The <b>cores</b> <b>were</b> dated by potassium-argon dating; traditional ice <b>core</b> dating <b>is</b> not possible as not all layers were present. [...] The oldest <b>core</b> <b>was</b> found to include ice from 2.7 million years ago—by far the oldest ice yet dated from a core.|$|R
5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most being {{found in the}} largely iron-silicon-nickel core. Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part per billion of the crust whereas its concentration in the <b>core</b> <b>is</b> thought to be nearly 6,000 times higher. Recent speculation suggests that uranium (and thorium) in the core may generate {{a substantial amount of}} the heat that drives plate tectonics and (ultimately) sustains the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

3000|$|Core {{preparation}} The <b>core</b> <b>was</b> {{cleaned and}} dried in a convection oven at 110  °C for 48  h. It was then wrapped in three layers of {{aluminum foil and}} a thin Teflon heat shrink tube to prevent CO 2 diffusion and penetration. The wrapped <b>core</b> <b>was</b> placed in the core holder and evacuated for 10  h before the <b>core</b> <b>was</b> saturated with brine (3 wt% NaCl) for porosity measurement.

30|$|For the RF tests, the <b>core</b> <b>was</b> {{flooded with}} brine at varied {{injection}} rates, followed by polymer injection. For the RRF tests, the <b>core</b> <b>was</b> first flooded with brine, followed by polymer fluid, and chased by brine injection at last.

5|$|The crucial {{property}} {{turns out}} to be treewidth, a measure of how tree-like the graph is. For a graph G of treewidth at most k and a graph H, the homomorphism problem can be solved in time |V(H)|O(k) with a standard dynamic programming approach. In fact, it is enough to assume that the core of G has treewidth at most k. This holds even if the <b>core</b> <b>is</b> not known.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} {{intrinsic}} magnetic field at Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size, and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The <b>core</b> <b>is</b> thought to be electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that the dynamo is missing {{because of a lack}} of convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This caused the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the <b>core</b> <b>is</b> being used to reheat the crust.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of energy at the <b>core</b> <b>is</b> the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse {{together to form a}} single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star's outer layers.|$|E

50|$|The three Hyperspace <b>Cores</b> <b>were</b> {{created by}} the Progenitors in the forge module {{of one of their}} {{greatest}} spaceships, which was also the berth for the dreadnoughts. One of the <b>cores</b> <b>was</b> discovered by the Bentusi 6,000 years ago, which brought forth a great age of galactic prosperity by making possible interstellar travel over long distances. The second <b>core</b> <b>was</b> discovered by the pre-Exodus Hiigarans, who through misuse of the device ended up being exiled to Kharak. The third <b>core</b> <b>was</b> found by the Vaygr. The central conflict of Homeworld 2 revolves around acquiring all three cores and unlocking their secrets.|$|R

5|$|At {{the center}} of the Sun is the core region, a volume of {{sufficient}} temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the <b>core</b> <b>is</b> the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.|$|E

If the mission is successfully completed, the player is rewarded with beneficial items, and often new missions become available. Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not, upon completion, Zack is returned to the save point in the main game.|$|E

5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron <b>core</b> <b>is</b> composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E

30|$|The {{filtration}} method had {{the following}} features: {{measurements of the}} <b>core</b> permeability <b>were</b> carried out under steady-state conditions, i.e., at low and constant flow rates of fluid (oil, kerosene, and water) through the core sample. Initially, the <b>core</b> <b>was</b> extracted with an alcohol-benzene mixture in the Soxhlet apparatus and dried to constant weight. After that, the <b>core</b> weight <b>was</b> measured as equal to 127.024  g. Then, the <b>core</b> <b>was</b> placed in a filtration unit wherein the reservoir thermobaric conditions were maintained. A tank with kerosene was connected with the core holder. The <b>core</b> <b>was</b> then saturated with kerosene at a constant temperature of 48  °C (reservoir temperature), confining pressure of 22  MPa (reservoir pressure), backpressure of 17  MPa, and flow rate of 0.5  ml/min for five pore volumes (until the <b>core</b> <b>was</b> fully saturated). After that, the experiment divided into five stages began. The experiment stages followed continuously one after another.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ultra-low {{permeability}} rocks {{have plenty}} of microfractures. The stress-dependent permeability has {{a significant impact on}} the seepage. Previous studies are mainly on the permeability variation with stress in low permeability reservoir. But few are involved in ultralow permeability cores. In this paper, the experiment of stress sensitive ultralow permeability <b>cores</b> which <b>are</b> fabricated (both matrix cores and microfracture <b>cores)</b> <b>is</b> conducted. The experimental results shows that the permeability of microfracture low permeability <b>cores</b> which <b>are</b> fabricated increases greatly while the porosity of low permeability <b>cores</b> <b>is</b> little affected. This indicates that the fabricated microfracture <b>cores</b> <b>are</b> in line with that of the real situations of fracture media reservoir. By comparison, the permeability stress sensitive hysteresis degree of microfracture <b>cores</b> <b>is</b> not apparent and the permeability recovery degree is high in the unloading cycle. This study is of great benefit to reveals the stress sensitivity features of ultralow permeability reservoir...|$|R
5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is between 0.5 and 8 , its core will become {{sufficiently}} hot to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen via the triple-alpha process, but it will never become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon into neon. Near {{the end of the}} period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell. On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, it will be found on the asymptotic giant branch. It will then expel most of its outer material, creating a planetary nebula, until only the carbon–oxygen <b>core</b> <b>is</b> left. This process is responsible for the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the <b>core</b> <b>is</b> low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the energy}} {{produced}} at Vega's <b>core</b> <b>is</b> generated by the carbonnitrogenoxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This process requires a temperature of about 15millionK, which {{is higher than the}} core temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's proton-proton chain reaction fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the core region. The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.|$|E
