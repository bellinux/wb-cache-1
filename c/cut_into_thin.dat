25|$|Dolphin meat is {{dense and}} such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat {{is located in a}} layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> strips and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either {{horseradish}} or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of whale or horse meat (basashi). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a miso sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to beef liver.|$|E

2500|$|Casu marzu is {{considered}} by Sardinian aficionados to be unsafe to eat when the maggots in the cheese have died. Because of this, only cheese in which the maggots are still alive is usually eaten, although allowances are made for cheese that has been refrigerated, which can kill the maggots. When the cheese has fermented enough, it is often <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> strips and spread on moistened Sardinian flatbread (pane carasau), to be served with a strong red wine. Casu marzu {{is believed to be}} an aphrodisiac by Sardinians. Because the larvae in the cheese can launch themselves for distances up to [...] when disturbed, diners hold their hands above the sandwich to prevent the maggots from leaping. Some who eat the cheese prefer not to ingest the maggots. Those who do not wish to do so place the cheese in a sealed paper bag. The maggots, starved for oxygen, writhe and jump in the bag, creating a [...] "pitter-patter" [...] sound. When the sounds subside, the maggots are dead and the cheese can be eaten.|$|E

60|$|Pemmican, as made in England.--Sir John Richardson describes, in his Narrative, the {{preparation}} of the pemmican that he took with him in his last journey. The following is a résumé of what he says:--The meat used was round of beef; the fat and membranous parts were pared away; it was then <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> slices, which were dried in a malt-kiln, over an oak-wood fire, till they were quite dry and friable. Then they were ground in a malt mill; after this process the powder resembled finely-grated meal. It was next mixed with nearly an equal weight of melted beef, suet, or lard; and the plain pemmican was made. Part of the pemmican was mixed with Zante currants, and another part with sugar. Both of these mixtures were much liked, especially the latter. The pemmican, when complete, cost at the rate of 1x. u 1/2 d. per pound, but then the meat was only 6 3/4 d. per pound; it is dearer now. The meat lost more than three-quarters of its weight in drying. He had 17,424 lbs. of pemmican in all; it was made from--fresh beef, 35,641 lbs; lard9 lbs.; currants3 lbs.; and sugar lbs.|$|E
6000|$|His Royal Highness then {{proceeded}} to luncheon, which is described by a most amiable Canadian correspondent who sent to his newspaper an account of it that I cannot forbear to copy. You may believe what he says, or not, just as you choose: [...] "So interested was his Royal Highness in the proceedings that {{he stayed in the}} ring {{three and a half hours}} witnessing these trotting matches. He was invited to take lunch in a little wooden shanty prepared for the Directors, to which he accordingly repaired, but whether he got anything to eat or not, I cannot tell. After much trouble he forced his way to the table, which he found surrounded by a lot of ravenous animals. And upon some half dozen huge dishes were piled slices of beef, mutton, and buffalo tongue; beside them were great jugs of lager beer, rolls of bread, and plates of a sort of cabbage <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> shreds, raw, and mixed with vinegar. There were neither salt spoons nor mustard spoons, the knives the gentlemen were eating with serving in their stead; and, by the aid of nature's forks, the slices of beef and mutton were transferred to the plates of those who desired to eat. While your correspondent stood looking at the spectacle, the Duke of Newcastle came in, and he sat looking too. He was evidently trying to look democratic, but could not manage it. By his side stood a man urging him to try the lager beer, and cabbage also, I suppose. Henceforth, let the New York Aldermen who gave to the Turkish Ambassador ham sandwiches and bad sherry rest in peace." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{variation}} is Hasselback potatoes, where the potato is <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> very <b>thin</b> slices almost down the bottom, {{so that the}} potato still holds together, and is then baked in the oven, occasionally scalloped with cheese. [...] The proper noun [...] "Hasselback" [...] refers to the luxurious Hasselbacken hotel and restaurant in Stockholm which originated this dish.|$|R

50|$|Beef or veal is {{typically}} used, though some food scholars {{tend to believe}} that the original version was probably venison or pork, and pork is still popular in some areas.

50|$|Tunbridge ware {{is a form}} of decoratively inlaid woodwork, {{typically}} in the form of boxes, that is characteristic of Tonbridge and the spa town of Tunbridge Wells in Kent in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Shaped rods and slivers of wood were first carefully glued together, then <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> many <b>thin</b> slices of identical pictorial veneer with a fine saw. Elaborately striped and feathered bandings for framing were pre-formed in a similar fashion.|$|R
60|$|Charqui is meat dried in the sun. In hot climates meat {{cannot be}} kept for many hours {{in its natural}} state. When a bullock is killed, therefore, all the meat which is not {{required}} for immediate use is <b>cut</b> up <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> strips, and hung up in the sun to dry. After this process it is hard and strong, and by no means palatable; but it will keep for many months, and is the general food of the people. In large establishments it is usual to kill several animals at once, so as to lay in sufficient store of charqui to last for some time.|$|R
