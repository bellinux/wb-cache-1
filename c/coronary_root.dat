40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the quality of <b>coronary</b> restorations and <b>root</b> canal {{fillings}} with the periapical status of root-filled teeth, in a subpopulation of Turkish individuals. Method: The study included 18, 210 randomly selected, 20 - to 70 -year-old patients referred to the Dental Faculty of Ondokuz Mayis University. A total number of 1, 027 root-filled teeth from 780 patients (645 females, 382 males) matched these criteria. Additionally, the radiographs were separated according to the age and gender of patients.

40|$|The {{outflow tract}} (OFT) {{provides}} the structural components forming the ventriculoarterial connection. The prevailing concept that this junction "rotates" to acquire its definitive topography also requires {{a concept of}} "counterrotation" and is difficult to reconcile with cell-marking studies. Rats between 10 embryonic days (EDs) and 2 postnatal days were stained immunohistochemically and by in situ hybridization. DNA replication was determined by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine and apoptosis by the annexin V binding and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-X nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. Starting at ED 12, cardiomyocytes in the distal (truncal) part of the OFT begin to shed their myocardial phenotype without proceeding into apoptosis, suggesting transdifferentiation. Myocardial regression is most pronounced on the dextroposterior side and continues until after birth, as revealed by {{the disappearance of the}} myocardial cuff surrounding the <b>coronary</b> <b>roots</b> and semilunar sinuses and by the establishment of fibrous continuity between mitral and aortic semilunar valves. Fusion of the endocardial ridges of the truncus on late ED 13 is accompanied by the organization of alpha-smooth muscle actin-and nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-positive myofibroblasts into a central whorl and the appearance of the semilunar valve anlagen at their definitive topographical position within the proximal portion of the truncus. After fusion of the proximal (conal) portion of the endocardial ridges, many of the resident myofibroblasts undergo apoptosis and are replaced by cardiomyocytes. The distal myocardial boundary of the OFT is not a stable landmark but moves proximally over the spiraling course of the aortic and pulmonary routes, so that the semilunar valves develop at their definitive topographic position. After septation, the distal boundary of the OFT continues to regress, particularly in its subaortic portion. The myocardializing conus septum, on the other hand, becomes largely incorporated into the right ventricle. These opposite developments account for the pronounced asymmetry of the subaortic and subpulmonary outlets in the formed hear...|$|R

40|$|Vessel {{tracking}} is a {{topic that}} has had extensive coverage when dealing with high axial resolution data, obtained from modalities requiring patients {{to be exposed to}} greater levels of radiation dose, possibly to the detriment of their health[10]. The use of low axial resolution data such as multi-slice CT(MSCT) used in coronary artery disease screening is becoming widely used clinically to provide the same imaging capabilities of previous modalities but with faster acquisition, often within a single breath hold[2]. Such modalities must counteract the loss of image clarity, detail and partial volume effects with benefits to the patient such as faster acquisition and lower dose exposure. Tracking of the arteries can be beneficial for pinpointing objects within such as calcified plaques, stents and other foreign bodies or pathology. In addition to differentiating them from similar, difficult to discern objects in neighbouring regions. To this end, a fully automated artery tracking system is presented to be validated against re-sampled expert extracted vessel centrelines. Implementations include an automated heart isolation algorithm using active contours and region voxel analysis, fully automated <b>coronary</b> artery <b>root</b> detection and segmentation followed by proximal, lumen and distal tracking of the main coronary arteries.

This study was designed to determine whether vitamin E is actually consumed in the coronary circulation in patients with active variant angina having repetitive spasm-induced transient myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Methods: Blood samples were obtained simultaneously from the aortic <b>root,</b> <b>coronary</b> sinus and right atrium in 12 patients with variant angina due to spasm of the left coronary artery, nine patients with stable effort angina and nine control subjects. Plasma vitamin E (a- and g-tocopherol) concentrations were determined by use of high-performance liquid chromatography and plasma lipid peroxides were measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Results: At baseline, both plasma a- (p, 0. 01) and g- (p, 0. 05) tocopherol levels were significantly lower in the coronary sinus (5. 5060. 50 and 0. 5560. 07 mg / l, mean 6 SEM) than in the aortic root (6. 6360. 57 and 0. 6360. 08 mg / l) and also in the right atrium (6. 4460. 61 and 0. 6360. 09 mg / l) in the variant angina group. The TBARS level was significantly (p, 0. 05) higher in the coronary sinus than in the aortic root in this group. In contrast, these levels were not significantly different between the samples from the coronary sinus and the aortic root or the right atrium in the control group and also in the stable effort angina group. The coronary sinus–aortic difference in plasma vitamin E levels in the variant angina group was not significantly altered after left coronary artery spasm induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine.

The word Windsock {{has been applied}} to characterize the anatomical organ which is cone-like structure. We find both physiologic and pathologic cardiovascular windsocks. The physiologic windsock-like structure such as the left atrial appendage indicates the location of the left atrium (Figure 1 B). A very rare pathologic windsock recently found in our hospital was aortic windsock of a 56 years old Thai man who was referred to our hospital because of intractable heart failure.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the relationship between brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), renal function, and the severity {{of congestive heart failure}} (CHF). BackgroundBoth BNP and renal function are prognostic predictors in CHF patients. MethodsWe measured the plasma BNP level in the aortic <b>root</b> and <b>coronary</b> sinus in 366 consecutive patients with CHF. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Cockcroft-Gault equation was used as an indicator of renal function. ResultsBy stepwise multivariate analyses, hemodynamic parameters such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) but not eGFR were independent predictors of a transcardiac increase (<b>coronary</b> sinus-aortic <b>root)</b> in BNP. Regarding the plasma level of BNP in the aortic root, not only LVEF (p < 0. 0001) and LVEDP (p < 0. 0001) but also eGFR (p < 0. 0001) were independent predictors. Patients were divided into two groups, patients with an eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min (group 1, n = 229) and patients with an eGFR < 60 ml/min (group 2, n = 137). There was no difference in LVEF, LVEDP, or the transcardiac gradient of BNP between the two groups, but the plasma level of BNP in the aortic root was approximately two-fold greater in group 2 than in the group 1. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that decreased clearance from the kidney contributes to the elevated BNP in CHF patients with renal dysfunction, especially in patients with an eGFR < 60 ml/min...|$|R

In this study, the efficacy for resuscitation of nonbeating donor hearts of MCI- 186, a free-radical scavenger and antioxidant, was investigated in a pig transplantation model. MethodsCardiac arrest was induced by asphyxiation. After 30 minutes of global ischemia, the hearts were excised and immediately reperfused from the aortic root with normoxemic blood cardioplegia (Po 2 100 mm Hg) for 20 minutes, followed by perfusion with hyperoxemic blood (Po 2 300 mm Hg). MCI- 186 (3 mg/kg) was administered into the aortic root for the first 30 minutes of reperfusion in the treated group (n = 6), and untreated hearts were used as a control group (n = 6). Transplantation was performed with the heart beating. ResultsPosttransplantation recovery of cardiac output, end-systolic pressure–volume ratio, and first derivative of pressure of the left ventricle in the treated group were significantly better {{than those in the}} control group. The <b>coronary</b> sinus–aortic <b>root</b> difference in malondialdehyde levels remained low throughout reperfusion in the treated group but abruptly increased after initiation of oxygenated blood perfusion in the control group.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{the passage of}} echo contrast agents through the microcirculation and the echocardiographic study of myocardial perfusion, ultrasonic energy (sonication) was employed to produce contrast agents consisting of relatively uniform, stable and small (< 10 μ diameter) gaseous microbubbles suspended in liquid solutions. The size and persistence of the microbubbles was verified by light microscopy and an in vitro system were employed for comparative assessment of peak echo amplitude and echo persistence characteristics of various contrast agents. The study indicated that although a variety of hand-agitated and sonicated contrast agents provided satisfactory echo intensities, sonication was clearly superior to the hand-agitation method, because sonication produced smaller, more uniform and more stable microbubbles that may be suitable for myocardial contrast echocardiography. It is concluded that of the contrast agents examined, sonicated solutions of sorbitol (70 %) and dextrose (70 %) appeared to have particular potential {{because of the small}} sizes of the microbubbles (6 ± 2 and 8 ± 3 μ, respectively) and their prolonged in vitro persistence.

METHODS: Eight pediatric patients underwent cardiovascular MRI with controlled mechanical ventilation after ferumoxytol administration. Breath-held contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) was performed during the first-pass and delayed phases of ferumoxytol, followed by a respiratory gated, 4 D MUSIC acquisition during the steady state distribution phase of ferumoxytol. The subjective image quality and image sharpness were evaluated. Assessment of ventricular volumes based on 4 D MUSIC was compared with those based on multislice 2 D cardiac cine MRI. RESULTS: The 4 D MUSIC technique provided cardiac-phase-resolved (65 - 95 ms temporal resolution) and higher spatial resolution (0. 6 - 0. 9 mm isotropic) images than previously achievable using first-pass CE-MRA or 2 D cardiac cine. When compared with Ferumoxytol-based first-pass CE-MRA, the 4 D MUSIC provided sharper images and better definition of the <b>coronary</b> arteries, aortic <b>root,</b> myocardium, and pulmonary trunk (P[*][*] 0. 05 for all).

The aim of our study {{was to develop a}} new method to inject BMCs into coronary arteries of small experimental animals. Transient atrioventricular block (AVB) was induced in 25 rats and 39 hamsters by intracarotid injection of adenosine 50 -triphosphate (ATP). Contrast echocardiography was obtained. BMCs (0. 2 – 0. 5 ml) were collected through femoral puncture, stained with PKH 26 and injected into the carotid artery (CA). Animals were immediately sacrificed or followed for 1 month. To evaluate BMCs transfer from CA to myocardium, AVB and BMCs injections were performed in 10 hamsters subjected to coronary ligation for 30 min. Induction of transient AVB was possible in all animals by injecting 20 – 30 mg of ATP. Animals recovered a basal cardiac activity spontaneously or by dopamine injection.

This study aimed to (1) assess the local cardiac production of inflammatory cytokines in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), stable coronary artery disease and in controls; and (2) determine whether acute administration of colchicine inhibits their production. Methods and Results-—Forty ACS patients, 33 with stable coronary artery disease, and 10 controls, were included. ACS and stable coronary artery disease patients were randomized to oral colchicine treatment (1 mg followed by 0. 5 mg 1 hour later) or no colchicine, 6 to 24 hours prior to cardiac catheterization.

40|$|Background—Prior {{studies suggest}} that most deaths in {{patients}} undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are related to procedural complications. Mortality associated with PCI has steadily declined during the past decade, and the cause and circumstance of death among patients undergoing PCI in the contemporary era remain unknown. Methods and Results—We evaluated all patients undergoing PCI at the University of Michigan from 2001 to 2009. There were 85 deaths among a total of 5520 patients undergoing PCI during this time period. By using a standardized data collection form, 3 cardiologists (2 interventional, H. S. G. and D. S. M.; 1 noninvasive, A. M. B.) determined the cause and circumstance of death, in addition to grading the preventability of death. Left ventricular failure {{was the most common}} cause of death (35. 3 %, n 30), followed by neurological compromise (16. 5 %, n 14) and arrhythmia (12. 1 %, n 12). The circumstance of death was mostly acute cardiac (52. 9 %, n 45), with a procedural complication composing a small fraction (7. 1 %, n 6). Reviewers determined 93 % of deaths to be mostly or entirely unpreventable. Conclusions—Procedural complications are responsible for a small fraction of deaths among patients undergoing contemporary PCI.

40|$|Introduction: Left {{and right}} {{coronary}} arteries supply {{blood to the}} heart arising from ascending aorta. Any coronary artery disorder can have serious implications by reducing the flow of oxygen to heart, which {{may lead to a}} heart attack and possibly death. Certain coronary artery anomalies may indirectly affect the patient's prognosis. Therefore knowledge of coronary is necessary. Methodology: The 100 specimens were collected. These were fixed in 10 % Formalin solution. Then Aorta was dissected to display the origins of the right, left <b>coronary.</b> The aortic <b>root</b> was split postreriorly to enable {{a clear view of the}} aortic sinuses with coronary ostium. Results: Left and right coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle. They arise from ascending aorta.. RCA arises from right anterior aortic sinus in all cases. Ostium of RCA was most commonly arising below sinotubular junction in 98 (98 %) specimens. We had observed location of ostia of Right and Left coronary artery present in Rt. Anterior aortic sinus and Lt. Anterior aortic sinus respectively 100 %(100) in all specimens. Conclusion: Ostium of RCA was below sinotubular junction in 91 (91 %) specimens and above sinotubular junction was 9 (9 %) in case of RCA and was below sinotubular junction in 94 (94 %) specimens and above sinotubular junction was 6 (6 %) in case of LCA. If the Ostium are above the sinotubular junction, they remain open in both systole and diastole of the heart and coronary blood flows continuously. So coronary insufficiency is less and also may have good prognostic value. [Natl J Med Res 2013; 3 (2. 000) : 134 - 136...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{arterial}} switch operation (ASO) {{is currently}} the treatment of choice in neonates with transposition of the great arteries (TGA). The outcome in childhood is encouraging but only limited data for long-term outcome into adulthood exist. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 145 adult patients (age> 16, median 25 years) with ASO followed at our institution. Three patients died in adulthood (mortality 2. 4 / 1000 -patient-years). Most patients were asymptomatic and had normal left ventricular function. Coronary lesions requiring interventions were rare (3 patients) and in most patients related to previous surgery. There were no acute <b>coronary</b> syndromes. Aortic <b>root</b> dilatation was frequent (56 % patients) but rarely significant (> 45 mm in 3 patients, maximal-diameter 49 mm) and appeared not to be progressive. There were no acute aortic events and no patient required elective aortic root surgery. Progressive neo-aortic-valve dysfunction was not observed in our cohort and only 1 patient required neo-aortic-valve replacement. Many patients (42. 1 %), however, had significant residual lesions or required reintervention in adulthood. Right ventricular outflow tract lesions or dysfunction of the neo-pulmonary-valve were frequent and 8 patients (6 %) required neo-pulmonary-valve replacement. Cardiac interventions during childhood (OR 3. 0, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 5. 4, P< 0. 0001) were strong predictors of outcome (cardiac intervention/significant residual lesion/death) in adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients with previous ASO remain free of acute coronary or aortic complications and have low mortality. However, {{a large proportion of}} patients require re-interventions or present with significant right sided lesions. Life-long cardiac follow-up is, therefore, warranted. Periodic noninvasive surveillance for coronary complications appears to be safe in adult ASO patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Liposomes {{may be an}} {{appropriate}} transfection vehicle for transplanted hearts, avoiding the use of viruses in immunosuppressed hosts and allowing transfection of nondividing cells. To study whether liposome-mediated transfection could be accomplished during transplantation, we used a liposome-reporter gene system in a rabbit model of allograft cardiac transplantation. Methods: After aortic crossclamping, Stauffland donor hearts were injected with 10 ml Stanford cardioplegic solution; then a 1. 3 to 2. 0 mg/kg dose of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in 1 : 1 deoxyribonucleic acid–liposome complexes was injected proximal to the aortic crossclamp for coronary artery perfusion. The hearts were transplanted into New Zealand White rabbit recipients in the heterotopic cervical position (n = 11 transplants). Recipients were sacrificed at 24 hours. Myocardial specimens (right and left ventricles) and vascular specimens (epicardial <b>coronary</b> artery, aortic <b>root,</b> and <b>coronary</b> sinus) from both the transplanted and native hearts were analyzed for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase protein {{by means of the}} enzymatic liquid scintillation assay (counts per minute per milligram of total protein). Results: In the recipient, myocardial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity was significantly greater in treated donor hearts (mean 4. 6 × 105 cpm/mg ± 1. 1 × 105 [standard error]) than in native hearts (mean 4. 1 × 102 cpm/mg ± 72 [standard error], p < 0. 01, Mann-Whitney U test). In treated donor hearts, right and left ventricular specimens, as well as apical and basal myocardial specimens, were transfected equally. Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity in vascular specimens also indicated transfection (mean 5. 4 × 105 cpm/mg ± 2. 5 × 105 [standard error]). Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity in the coronary sinus was comparable with that in the coronary arteries, which suggests that liposomes can traverse the coronary capillary beds. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that ex vivo transfection of donor hearts with a liposome-reporter gene system results in significant in vivo expression of the transfected gene product after cardiac transplantation. Genetic alteration of myocardium and cardiac vasculature has potential clinical applications in the prevention of posttransplantation rejection, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and both transplant and nontransplant coronary artery disease.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{replacement of}} a diseased aortic valve, aortic root and ascending aorta with a prosthesis {{is known as}} Bentall procedure (Bentall and De Bono in Thorax 23 : 338, 1968). This is a nowadays standard surgical approach in which the Valsalva sinuses of the aortic root are sacrificed and the coronary arteries are reconnected directly to the graft. The important function of the natural sinuses {{in the presence of}} the natural valve is well established; however, very little information is available about whether or not their presence can affect the functioning of a prosthetic bi-leaflet valve and the coronary flow. In the present work, we study the effect of the aortic root geometry on the blood flow through such devices, focusing the attention on the <b>coronary</b> entry-flow. Three <b>root</b> geometries have been considered, two mimicking the prostheses used in practice by surgeons (a straight tube, and the more recent tube with a circular pseudo-sinus), and a third maintaining the natural shape with three sinuses, obtained by Reul et al. (J Biomech 23 : 181 – 191, 1990) by averaging numerous angiographies of the aortic root in healthy patients. Direct numerical simulations of the flow inside the three prostheses, assumed as undeformable, under physiological pulsatile inflow conditions are presented. The dynamics of the valvular leaflets is obtained by a fully-coupled fluid–structure-interaction approach and the coronary perfusion is reproduced by modulating in time an equivalent porosity, an thus the resistance, of the coronary channels. The results indicate that the sinuses do not significantly influence the coronary entry flow, in agreement with the in vivo observations of De Paulis et al. (Eur J Cardio-thorac Surg 26 : 66 – 72, 2004). Nevertheless, the peak pressure at the joints of the coronary arteries is smaller in the natural-like aortic root geometry. The latter also produces a further beneficial effect of a reduction in the leaflets’ angular velocity at the closure onto the valvular ring. These phenomena, if confirmed in more realistic clinical conditions, suggest that the use of a prothesis with physiologic sinuses would potentially reduce the local pressure peak, with the associated risk of post-operative bleeding and pseudo-aneurysm formation. It would also reduce the haemolysis effects caused by the red blood cells squashing between impacting solid artificial surfaces...|$|R
