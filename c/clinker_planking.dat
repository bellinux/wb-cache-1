5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the <b>clinker</b> <b>planking</b> is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E
25|$|The Scandinavians were {{building}} innovative boats millennia ago, {{as shown by}} the many petroglyph images of Nordic Bronze Age boats. The oldest archaeological find of a wooden Nordic boat is the Hjortspring boat, built about 350 BC. This is the oldest known boat to use <b>clinker</b> <b>planking,</b> where the planks overlap one another. It was designed as a large canoe, 19 m long and crewed by 22–23 men using paddles. Scandinavians continued to develop better boats, incorporating iron and other metal into the design, adding keels, and developing oars for propulsion. Another Nordic shipfind is the Nydam boat, found preserved in the Nydam Mose bog in Sundeved, Denmark. It has been dendro dated to 310-320 AD. Built of oak, it is also clinker-built, is 23 metres long and was rowed by thirty men.|$|E
500|$|The Mary Rose {{was kept}} in reserve from 1522 to 1545. She was once more caulked and {{repaired}} in [...] 1527 in a newly dug dock at Portsmouth and her longboat was repaired and trimmed. Little documentation about the Mary Rose between 1528 and 1539 exists. A document written by Thomas Cromwell in 1536 specifies that the Mary Rose and six other ships were [...] "made new" [...] during his service under the king, though it is unclear which years {{he was referring to}} and what [...] "made new" [...] actually meant. A later document from January 1536 by an anonymous author states that the Mary Rose and other ships were [...] "new made", and dating of timbers from the ship confirms some type of repair being done in 1535 or 1536. This would have coincided with the controversial dissolution of the monasteries that resulted in a major influx of funds into the royal treasury. The nature and extent of this repair is unknown. Many experts, including Margaret Rule, the project leader for the raising of the Mary Rose, have assumed that it meant a complete rebuilding from <b>clinker</b> <b>planking</b> to carvel planking, and that it was only after 1536 that the ship took on the form that it had when it sank and that was eventually recovered in the 20th century. Marsden has speculated that it could even mean that the Mary Rose was originally built in a style that was closer to 15th-century ships, with a rounded, rather than square, stern and without the main deck gunports.|$|E
50|$|While wooden pegs (often called treenails) {{can be used}} {{to fasten}} thicker <b>clinker</b> <b>planks,</b> this {{technique}} only works if the planks are thick enough to hold the pegs. Because of this, large ships were often built using pegs, while smaller boats would use sewn planks.|$|R

The two-tiered auditorium has panelled walls under a domed ceiling. The curved balcony is partly supported on slender cast-iron columns and decorated with military motifs in plaster-work.|$|R
5000|$|The first flying 18 footers {{were either}} carvel or <b>clinker</b> built <b>clinker</b> <b>planked</b> with {{multiple}} steam bent frames. Cotton sails were used and spars were solid wood. The crew number varied {{according to the}} wind strength, often with a boy carried to bail out water. Initial designs were conventional displacement shapes with emphasis on narrow waterlines. In the early 1950s The Sydney boats put emphasis on carrying large extra sails down wind called ringtails. These were set outside the main with light spars top and bottom. They were carried in addition to spinnakers. In very light conditions watersails were carried under the main boom.|$|R
50|$|The Norsemen were skilled seamen {{and boat}} {{builders}} and their boat designs depended on their needs. Trading vessels were wide, to allow large cargo storage, while raiding boats {{were long and}} narrow and very fast. They all used the clinker fashion of planking, i.e. the planks overlapped one another. The boats used for fishing were scaled-down versions of their cargo boats. The Scandinavian influence affected boat building long after the Viking period came to an end. Yoles from the Orkney island of Stroma {{were built in the}} same way as the Norse boats. Early Scottish boat builders copied the Scandinavian designs with their <b>clinker</b> <b>planking</b> and characteristic sharp stems and sterns.|$|E

50|$|The weakest {{part of an}} {{enlarged}} hulk would be its stem and stern. Since it has no proper keel or substantial stem or stern posts {{those parts of the}} boat would have to be reinforced by the introduction of substantial aprons and breasthooks, perhaps augmented by sacrificial stem and stern posts between which the unsupported hull planking could be sandwiched. Early hulks, like all of the other northern boat types, were initially shell-built using lapstrake or <b>clinker</b> <b>planking</b> which was subsequently reinforced by the insertion of grown crooks of timber as frames. Using these techniques, perhaps better understood as a result of technological transfers from architectural woodworking, shipwrights were able to extend the hulk in size until it rivaled and surpassed the cog.|$|E

50|$|Designs from Fabian Bush, David Horne and Stephen Jones {{broadened the}} {{spectrum}} and {{appeal of the}} class, with hull lengths from 19 to 22 ft and construction materials as diverse as possible - sheet ply, <b>clinker</b> <b>planks,</b> cold moulded wood, fibreglass, carbon and Kevlar are all to be found throughout the development fleet, and as with the “hard chine” fleet, rig configurations vary, from aluminium to carbon spars, single or twin trapezes and symmetric or asymmetric spinnakers. These “Progress” designs have traveled the length and breadth of the UK to compete {{in some of the}} bigger one-off handicap regattas such as the Grafham Grand Prix, the Bloody Mary, etc., {{and as long as the}} conditions are appropriate (i.e. no waves!), the boats and the sailors will, and do, acquit themselves favourably against the mainstream competition.|$|R
50|$|As {{guns were}} made more durable to {{withstand}} stronger gunpowder charges, they increased their potential to inflict critical {{damage to the}} vessel rather than just their crews. Since these guns were much heavier than the earlier anti-personnel weapons, {{they had to be}} placed lower in the ships, and fire from gunports, to avoid ships becoming unstable. In Northern Europe the technique of building ships with <b>clinker</b> <b>planking</b> made it difficult to cut ports in the hull; clinker-built (or clench-built) ships had much of their structural strength in the outer hull. The solution was the gradual adoption of carvel-built ships that relied on an internal skeleton structure to bear the weight of the ship. Gunports cut in the hull of ships were not introduced until 1501, at the very start of the early modern period.|$|E

50|$|Since ancient times, war at sea {{had been}} fought much like on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on {{floating}} wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though {{the introduction of}} guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. The first guns on ships were small wrought-iron pieces mounted on the open decks and in the fighting tops, often requiring {{only one or two}} men to handle them. They were designed to injure, kill or simply stun, shock and frighten the enemy prior to boarding. As guns were made more durable to withstand stronger gunpowder charges, they increased their potential to inflict critical damage to the vessel rather than just its crew.

The development of propulsion during the 15th century from single-masted, square-rigged cogs to three-masted carracks with a mix of square and lateen sails made ships nimbler and easier to maneuver.|$|E
50|$|The Tune ship is fragmentary, but {{may have}} been up to 22 m long. It is 4.35 m wide and would have had 11 or 12 pairs of oars. The length of the keel is {{approximately}} 14 m.
