Cable-suspended refers here to cable-driven parallel robots in a crane-like setting, where all the cable drawing points are located on top of the base frame, gravity being used to keep the <b>cables</b> <b>taut.</b> Geometry selection consists of determining the relative positions of the cable drawing points on the base frame and of the cable attachment points on the mobile platform together with the cable arrangement between these two sets of points. An original performance index is introduced. It is defined as the maximum acceptable distance between the mobile platform geometric center and the center of mass of the set consisting of the platform and a payload. This performance index is of particular interest in heavy payload handling applications. Used within a two-phase geometry selection strategy, it yields a new cable-suspended robot geometry having a very large workspace to footprint ratio and able to handle heavy payloads.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the forward kinematics and tension distribution of sinking winches mechanism, {{which is a}} type of four-cable-driven partly constrained parallel robot. Conventional studies on forward kinematics of cable-driven parallel robot assumed that all <b>cables</b> are <b>taut.</b> Actually, given the lengths of four cables, some cables may be slack when the platform is in static equilibrium. Therefore, in this paper, the tension state (tautness or slackness) of cables is considered in the forward kinematics model. We propose Traversal-Solving-Algorithm, which can indicate the tension state of cables, and further determine the pose of the platform, if the lengths of four cables are given. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by four examples. The results of this paper can be used to control sinking winches mechanism to achieve the level and stable motion of the platform, and to make the tension distribution of cables as uniform as possible...|$|R

Each is attached by a flexible cable of finite length to a point on the boundary of this workspace. Each robot has a target point in the workspace it must reach.

The more complex a cable configuration is, the more restrictive {{it is to the}} motion of the robots.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} a lower mobility parallel kinematic crane {{able to generate}} Scara motions (three translations and one rotation about a vertical axis). A crane is an underconstrained cable robot: it requires gravity acting on the traveling plate in order to tense the cables. The proposed crane can resist, to a certain extent, against outside forces and torques in all directions of the 6 -dimensional task space. This feature results {{from the use of}} pairs of cables linking the actuators and the traveling plate. The proposed crane is derived from the I 4 parallel robot. Thus, its traveling plate is articulated which provides a wide range of orientation. It is hyperstatic in the sense that one of the eight cables can be removed while keeping the same kinematic relationships. However, for symmetry reasons all the eight cables are kept (this feature is interesting in case of a cable breakdown). The input/output geometrical and kinematic models required for control are derived. Then, the cables tensions are obtained enabling the determination of the static workspace defined as the domain of reachable space where the <b>cables</b> remain <b>taut</b> under the action of gravity...|$|R

It is shown how this method can be placed {{within the context of the}} general theory of normal forms provided the damping and forcing terms are treated as unfolding parameters. The approach is contrasted to the alternative theory of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) which is argued to be problematic in the presence of damping.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient interval-analysis-based algorithm {{to solve the}} direct geometrico-static problem (DGP) of underconstrained cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs).

Since cables impose unilateral constraints, configurations {{with one or more}} slack cables may occur. When the number of <b>taut</b> <b>cables</b> is smaller than 6, the robot is underconstrained, and DGP solutions must be found considering loop-closure and mechanical equilibrium equations simultaneously.

40|$|A new {{passive device}} for {{mitigating}} cable vibrations is proposed and its efficiency is assessed on 45 -meter long <b>taut</b> <b>cables</b> {{through a series}} of free and forced vibration tests. It consists of a unilateral spring attached perpendicularly to the cable near the anchorage. Because of its ability to change the cable dynamic behaviour through intermittent activation, the device has been called state switched inducer (SSI). The cable behaviour is shown to be deeply modified by the SSI: the forced vibration response is anharmonicc and substantially reduced in amplitude whereas the free vibration decay is largely sped up through a beating phenomenon. The vibration mitigation effect is mainly due to the activation and coupling of various vibration modes, as evidenced in the response spectra of the equipped cable. This first large-scale experimental campaign shows that the SSI outperforms classical passive devices, thus paving the way to a new kind of low-cost vibration mitigation systems which do not rely on dissipation...|$|R
40|$|Passive fluid damper {{is one of}} {{most widely}} used control devices for damping {{vibration}} of stay cables in a cable-stayed bridge in practice. However, each stay cable features unique dynamic characteristics and requires a specific damper to achieve the best control performance, which engenders many troubles in manufacture, implementation and maintenance of dampers. This paper presents a new approach for damping vibration of stay cables in a cable-stayed bridge by using adjustable fluid dampers. The principle and main features of adjustable fluid dampers with shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are first introduced. The solution of a <b>taut</b> <b>cable</b> with the adjustable fluid damper described by the Maxwell model is provided. A most favorable design principle is then proposed for selecting the least types of adjustable fluid dampers for damping vibration of a few hundreds stay cables in a cable-stayed bridge.

40|$|Resonance is an {{important}} phenomenon in vibrating systems and, in systems of nonlinear coupled oscillators, resonant interactions can occur between constituent parts of the system. In this paper, out-of-unison resonance {{is defined as a}} solution in which components of the response are 90 ° out-of-phase, in contrast to the in-unison responses that are normally considered. A well-known physical example of this is whirling, which can occur in a <b>taut</b> <b>cable.</b> Here, we use a normal form technique to obtain time-independent functions known as backbone curves. Considering a model of a cable, this approach is used to identify out-of-unison resonance and it is demonstrated that this corresponds to whirling. We then show how out-of-unison resonance can occur in other two degree-of-freedom nonlinear oscillators. Specifically, an in-line oscillator consisting of two masses connected by nonlinear springs—a type of system where out-of-unison resonance has not previously been identified—is shown to have specific parameter regions where out-of-unison resonance can occur. Finally, we demonstrate how the backbone curve analysis can be used to predict the responses of forced systems...|$|R
