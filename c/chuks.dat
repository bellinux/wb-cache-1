40|$|AbstractActivation of the {{transcription}} factor NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) requires the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). In a yeast two-hybrid screen for NIK-interacting proteins, {{we have identified}} a protein kinase previously known as <b>CHUK.</b> Overexpression of <b>CHUK</b> activates a NF-κB-dependent reporter gene. A catalytically inactive mutant of <b>CHUK</b> is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-, IL- 1 -, TRAF-, and NIK-induced NF-κB activation. <b>CHUK</b> associates with the NF-κB inhibitory protein, IκB-α, in mammalian cells. <b>CHUK</b> specifically phosphorylates IκB-α on both serine 32 and serine 36, modifications that are required for targeted degradation of IκB-α via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This phosphorylation of IκB-α is greatly enhanced by NIK costimulation. Thus, <b>CHUK</b> is a NIK-activated IκB-α kinase that links TNF- and IL- 1 -induced kinase cascades to NF-κB activation...|$|R
