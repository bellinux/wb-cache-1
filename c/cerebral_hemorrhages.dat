The most common symptom affecting the CNS is an intracranial hemangioma in the midbrain.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of early {{rehabilitation}} training combined with edaravone on oxygen free radical generation and nerve injury in patients with <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> Methods: A total of 56 patients with acute <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> who were treated in Zigong Third People’s Hospital between July 2014 and March 2017 were selected and randomly divided into early rehabilitation group and routine rehabilitation group, the early rehabilitation group began the rehabilitation training 2 d after <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> condition was stabilized, and routine rehabilitation group began the rehabilitation training 14 d after <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> Serum contents of oxygen free radicals, nerve injury markers and neurotrophic molecules were detected 28 d and 56 d after <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> Results: 28 d and 56 d after <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> serum MDA, AOPP, 8 -OHdG, GFAP, NSE, Tf, Ft and S 100 B levels of early rehabilitation group were significantly {{lower than those of}} routine rehabilitation group while BDNF, NGF, NTF-α and IGF-I levels were significantly higher than those of routine rehabilitation group. Conclusion: Early rehabilitation training combined with edaravone for <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> can inhibit the oxygen free radical generation, reduce the degree of nerve injury and improve the neurotrophic state...|$|R
40|$|ALTHOUGH {{the total}} {{incidence}} of <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> is high, comparatively few reports concerning the familial occurrence {{of this disease}} have been published. 1, 2 In 1935 Arnason described 10 families with {{a high incidence of}} <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> and concluded that a hereditary form of the disease was present in these families. 3 Further clinicopathological investigations of the disease revealed an autosomal dominant inheritance and a connection between the disease and a special form of amyloidosis confined to the cerebral vasculature. 4 This type of <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> is therefore generally referred to as hereditary <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> with amyloidosis.

There has been no report of HSP complicated with both intestinal perforation and <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> until October 2012. Here we describe a case of HSP with intestinal perforation and <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in a 5 -year-old girl. Plain abdominal radiograph in the erect position showed heavy gas in the right subphrenic space with an elevated diaphragm. Partial resection of the small intestine was performed, and pathological analysis suggested chronic suppurative inflammation in all layers of the ileal wall and mesentery.

50|$|Brain metastases from GCCL are {{particularly}} {{likely to cause}} significant <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> as compared to other lung cancer variants, probably due to greatly increased rates of endothelial proliferation and neovascularization, tumor tissue growth, extensive necrosis, and aggressive local infiltrative character of GCCL cells.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> a {{difficult}} issue in clinical practice, is often detected and studied with computed tomography (CT), {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). However, these expensive devices are not readily available in economically underdeveloped regions, and hence are unable to provide bedside and emergency on-site monitoring. The magnetic inductive phase shift (MIPS) is an emerging technology that may become a new tool to detect <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> and {{to serve as an}} inexpensive partial substitute to medical imaging. In order to study a wider band of <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> MIPS and to provide more useful information for measuring <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> we established a <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> magnetic induction phase shift spectroscopy (MIPSS) detection system. Thirteen rabbits with five <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> states were studied using a single coil-coil within a 1 MHz- 200 MHz frequency range in linear sweep. A feature band (FB) with the highest detection sensitivity and the greatest stability was selected for further analysis and processing. In addition, a maximum conductivity cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) MRI was performed to verify and interpret the MIPSS result. The average phase shift change induced by a 3 ml injection of autologous blood under FB was - 7. 7503 ° ± 1. 4204 °, which was considerably larger than our previous work. Data analysis with a non-parametric statistical Friedman M test showed that in the FB, MIPSS could distinguish the five states of <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in rabbits, with a statistical significance of p< 0. 05. A B-F distribution profile was designed according to the MIPSS under FB that can provide instantaneous diagnostic information about the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> severity from a single set of measurements. The results illustrate that the MIPSS detection method is able to provide a new possibility for real-time monitoring and diagnosis of the severity of <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemorrhage...</b>|$|R
