Historian Joseph Drory argues that it was because Tashtamur and Qutlubugha compelled him to assume the sultanate and remove him from his self-imposed isolation in al-Karak that made an-Nasir Ahmad resentful toward them.|$|E

Burstein, who was nominated in 1996 and won in 1997, have commented that the largest effect of winning or being nominated for a Campbell is not on sales but instead that it gives <b>credibility</b> <b>with</b> established authors and publishers. Criticism has been raised about the Campbell that due to the eligibility requirements it honors writers who become well-known quickly, rather than necessarily the best or most influential authors from a historical perspective.|$|E

Colby participated in the National Security Council meetings that responded to apparent Soviet intentions {{to intervene in the}} war by raising the alert level of U.S. forces to DEFCON 3 and defusing the crisis. In 1975, after many years of involvement, South Vietnam fell to Communist forces in April 1975, a particularly difficult blow for Colby, who had dedicated so much of his life and career to the American effort there. Events in the arms-control field, Angola, Australia, the Middle East, and elsewhere also demanded attention.|$|E

25|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Czech areas of Czecho-Slovakia on the Ides of March, in total contravention of the Munich Agreement that had been signed {{less than six months}} before, infuriated British and French public opinion and lost Germany all sympathy. Such was the state of public fury that it appeared possible for several days afterwards that the Chamberlain government might fall due to a backbench rebellion. Even Ribbentrop's standard line that Germany was only reacting to an unjust Versailles treaty, and really only wanted peace with everyone, which had worked so well in the past, failed to carry weight. Reflecting the changed mood, the Conservative M.P Alfred Duff Cooper {{wrote in a letter to}} The Times:"Some of us are getting rather tired of the sanctimonious attitude which seeks to take upon our shoulders the blame for every crime committed in Europe. If Germany had been left stronger in 1919 she would sooner have been in a position to do what she is doing today". Moreover, the British government had genuinely believed in the German claim that it was only the Sudetenland that concerned them, and that Germany was not seeking to dominate Europe. By occupying the Czech parts of Czecho-Slovakia, Germany lost all <b>credibility</b> <b>with</b> its claim to be only righting the alleged wrongs of Versailles.|$|E

He called the incentive package that sitting governor Martha Layne Collins had offered to lure a Toyota manufacturing plant to the state [...] "a massive mistake and terrible deal" [...] that had made Kentucky [...] "an international laughingstock". He also claimed that both Brown and Beshear would raise taxes and proposed a state lottery, which he claimed would generate $70 million annually for the state's coffers, as an alternative to higher taxes. The proposal proved particularly popular in Northern Kentucky, where residents routinely traveled to neighboring Ohio to play that state's lottery.

500|$|The Sunday Times, meanwhile, {{attempted}} {{to undermine the}} programme's <b>credibility</b> <b>with</b> its own investigative journalism. Citing [...] "official sources", the paper told its readers that This Weeks account of the shootings was [...] "crucially flawed", and [...] "bore no resemblance to what happened". It went on to claim {{that several of the}} programme's witnesses felt that [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had misrepresented their statements. It stated that the documentary's technical advisor, Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, was aggrieved that two of his [...] "key opinions" [...] had been omitted from the version broadcast—specifically that what Proetta interpreted as a gesture of surrender may have been an involuntary reaction to the bullets striking the suspects' bodies, and that the IRA members could still have detonated a bomb in another vehicle parked on the Spanish side of the border. The latter opinion was omitted because the This Week team saw little for the IRA to gain by detonating a bomb on Spanish soil, while the former was included in the broadcast. Josie Celecia, it alleged, had dismissed Proetta's account as [...] "ridiculous", while Stephen Bullock had contradicted Proetta's statement that she had seen plain-clothed soldiers arriving in a police car—testimony The Sunday Times believed [...] "destroyed" [...] Proetta's evidence. Both witnesses complained in letters to other newspapers. Through these, it emerged that Bullock had dismissed only one detail in Proetta's evidence as [...] "ridiculous", while he and Proetta had been referring to two distinct police cars in their statements. The Sunday Times omitted Styles' belief that the shootings were a pre-emptive attack. Styles' view was one of [...] "two active service units waging war [...] taking [...] out quickly, cleanly, and without other people being hurt—that seems to be the only way".

500|$|Quest mode, {{considered}} the game's largest change, has mixed reception. The use of [...] "2112" [...] as a centerpiece in the Quest mode was praised by critics; Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer {{said that the}} concept is [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] for Warriors of Rock and was [...] "a clever and enjoyable break from the typically rigid career structure". Cocke noted that the [...] "2112" [...] section feels like [...] "nice fanservice" [...] and its length and complexity would not be fun for players uninterested in Rush, while Helgeson felt that the [...] "awkward recitation" [...] by the band members were unnecessary. Other aspects of Quest mode {{were found to be}} less enjoyable. Gene Simmons's voice-over narration was found [...] "stilted and awkward". While the story carried similar heavy metal themes as Brutal Legend, very few of the songs within the game are from that genre; to Cocke, this felt [...] "like a desperate attempt to gain <b>credibility</b> <b>with</b> too many crowds, but it ends up spreading itself too thin". The Globe and Mails Chad Sapieha felt that the Quest mode [...] "simply disguised [...] aging career mode", with the characters' powers being [...] "hardly satisfying" [...] and only a means to [...] "artificially inflate one's score". After the player has completed the [...] "2112" [...] setpiece, the rest of the Quest mode was disappointing; Minkley compared the second half of this mode as a [...] "disengaging slog to level up the remaining four characters". Gies felt the [...] "rigid and often frustrating" [...] Quest mode led to playing the songs in an order that was [...] "all over the place in terms of tone, difficulty, and most importantly, fun". Some reviewers felt the improved Quickplay+ mode to be the highlight of the game; Heppe noted that the mode [...] "probably seems too basic to be the star of the game, but it really shines" [...] while Minkley considered that it [...] "offer a far stronger reason to replay than the embryonic Quest Mode manages". Gies' review of the Wii version noted that the Roadie Battles mode exclusive to the Wii version was enjoyable and [...] "helps the Wii version of the game to stand tall" [...] to the high-definition console version.|$|E

40|$|Participatory {{media are}} {{commonly}} used in today's society {{for a variety of}} purposes. The <b>credibility</b> associated <b>with</b> these media is sometimes contested, and their acceptance into school practices has been debated. Focus group interviews with teachers and librarians in upper secondary schools in Sweden are used to investigate conceptions and experiences of activities involving the critical evaluation of participatory media, with a particular focus on Wikipedia. Three themes are addressed. The first concerns how the teaching of the critical evaluation of sources is organized and comanaged between teachers and librarians. The second describes educators' experiences of print versus digital media, and their worry because students have problems negotiating the information architecture of print media. The third theme deals with conceptions of the credibility of Wikipedia. Four conceptions of credibility are identified: <b>credibility</b> is associated <b>with</b> the control and stability of a source; it is considered to be strengthened when several sources support a claim; it is viewed as situational and partial, rather than absolute; and it is associated with a multiplicity of voices and democratic forms of production. These findings may be used to inform educational activities around credibility and authority in schools by raising self-awareness among educators of various ways to talk about the <b>credibility</b> of sources <b>with</b> both colleagues and students.
