5|$|This stratum {{is covered}} with silt {{composed}} of <b>clay,</b> <b>sand</b> and flints and Roman pottery pieces, of the late Neogene age. Its origin {{can be attributed to}} the alteration of the underlying rocks and wind erosion.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of <b>clay,</b> <b>sand,</b> and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift.|$|E
5|$|The Skopje valley {{belongs to}} the Vardar geotectonic region, the subsoil of which is formed of Neogene and Quaternary deposits. The {{substratum}} is made of Pliocene deposits including sandstone, marl and various conglomerates. It is covered by a first layer of Quaternary sands and silt, which is between 70 and 90 m deep. The layer is topped by a much smaller layer of <b>clay,</b> <b>sand,</b> silt and gravel, carried by the Vardar river. It is between 1.5 and 5.2 m deep.|$|E

50|$|The Chipola Formation is {{composed}} of <b>clays,</b> <b>sands</b> and shell beds. These vary from fossil bearing sandy <b>clays</b> to <b>sands,</b> <b>clays,</b> and carbonate beds absent of fossil content with glauconite and phosphate mica which is common. The coloration is from cream to olive gray with mottled reddish brown in the weathered sections. The sands are soft and very fine to coarse with sporadic gravel while carbonate lenses are quite hard. Permeability of the sediments are generally low and {{are part of the}} intermediate confining unit/aquifer system.|$|R
5|$|The rocks {{exposed in}} the park were formed in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods between 370and 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of <b>clay,</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel.|$|E
5|$|Hardy and versatile, B.integrifolia {{will grow}} in <b>clay,</b> <b>sand,</b> acid and even {{alkaline}} soils, {{and it shows}} good resistance to wind and salt, making it suitable for seaside planting. It is therefore highly regarded as a low-maintenance garden tree, although its large size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens. Its hardiness may however forewarn weed potential, as some evidence of weediness has been seen in Western Australia and New Zealand. When growing near bushland within its native habitat, it is recommended to obtain local provenance seed or plants if available.|$|E
5|$|The land {{on which}} Worlds End State Park sits has {{undergone}} tremendous change over the last 350million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion {{of what is now}} North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of <b>clay,</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone.|$|E

5|$|The Allegheny Plateau {{formed in}} the Alleghenian orogeny some 300million years ago, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa {{collided}} with the landmass that became North America, forming Pangaea. In the dissected plateau, years of erosion have cut away the soft rocks, forming the valleys, and leaving the hardest rocks relatively untouched. The land on which Quehanna Wild Area sits {{was part of the}} coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America in the Pennsylvanian subperiod. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of <b>clay,</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} to treat four solid wastes of sodium {{silicate}} used sands, dewatered municipal sludge, <b>clay</b> <b>sands</b> sludge and waste polyethylene, was discussed. About wt/ 50 % sodium silicate used sands and wt/ 50 % dewatered sludge were mixed, and then cured by microwave {{with a certain}} thickness film of <b>clay</b> <b>sands</b> sludge and waste plastic of polyethylene in the surface. The {{results showed that the}} compression strength of granulation sample with the size of Ф 50 × 50 mm was over 0, 45 MPa. The waste plastic was the key factor for the durability, and curing temperature must be over melting temperature, so the thicker film could be coated in the surface of used sands and sludge...|$|R

25|$|Retreating glaciers {{leave behind}} silt, <b>clay,</b> <b>sand,</b> gravel, and {{boulders}} called drift. Glacial drift includes unsorted material called till and layers deposited by meltwater streams called outwash While drift from early (pre-Illinoian) glaciations {{has been found}} {{in some parts of the}} region, much of the incised Paleozoic Plateau of Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois holds no evidence for glaciation.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{much of the}} Middle East {{which is}} rich in lucrative crude oil, Israel has limited natural resources. These include copper, phosphates, bromide, potash, <b>clay,</b> <b>sand,</b> sulfur, asphalt, and manganese. Small amounts of natural gas and crude oil are present, often too little to merit {{commercial}} extraction. In 2009, significant reserves of natural gas were discovered at the Tamar 1 offshore drilling site, 90 kilometers west of Haifa. It is the largest natural gas reserve ever discovered in Israel.|$|E
25|$|Most, but not all, of {{the county}} was covered with the ice sheet during the last Ice age. As the ice retreated, County Wexford {{would have been one}} of the first areas to be covered with glacial drift (a mixture of boulders, <b>clay,</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel) that {{blanketed}} the existing bedrock. This has led to high quality soils, suitable for a wide range of agriculture. A very detailed soil survey {{of the county}} was published in 1964, as part of the 'National Soil Survey of Ireland'. It classifies each area of the county according to its specific soil type.|$|E
50|$|The geology of Suffolk {{in eastern}} England largely {{consists}} of a rolling chalk plain overlain in the east by Neogene <b>clays,</b> <b>sands</b> and gravels and isolated areas of Palaeocene sands.

25|$|Rugby {{union is}} {{played on a}} field, known as a pitch, that should have a grassy surface, though the Laws {{permit the use of}} {{artificial}} grass, <b>clay,</b> <b>sand</b> or snow, but not permanently hard surfaces such as asphalt or concrete. The Laws do not say that the pitch needs to be flat or level, merely that the surface must be safe to play on. If either team feels that the pitch is unsafe, the referee must try to resolve the issues and must not start the match if any part of the ground is considered to be dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{vineyard}} soils {{in the region}} {{date back to the}} Jurassic period of 195-135 million BC when the entire Burgundy region was part of a large inland sea. This left a foundation of predominately limestone made from the skeletal fragments of the marine life that once roamed this sea. The marlstone of the region is made up of the marl, <b>clay,</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel fragments that came from the weathering of old mountain chains in the area such as the Ardennes. The flow of streams and tributaries of the Saône contributes to the diversity of {{the vineyard}} soils by depositing alluvial sediments from their paths.|$|E
25|$|Beneath {{the drift}} {{deposits}} of the Vale of York lie Triassic sandstone and mudstone, and lower Jurassic mudstone {{but these are}} completely masked by the surface deposits. These deposits include glacial till, sand and gravel and both terminal and recessional moraines left by receding ice sheets {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The Escrick moraine extends across the vale from west to east and the York moraine, 8 miles further north, forms a similar curving ridge from York eastwards to Sand Hutton. To the north of these ridges are deposits of <b>clay,</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel left by a glacial lake. There are also areas of river alluvium consisting of clay, silt and sand deposited by the main rivers and streams.|$|E

25|$|The Friuli-Venezia Giulia {{region is}} bordered by the Alps {{to the north}} {{separating}} it from Austria. Slovenia borders the region on {{the east and the}} Italian region of Veneto forms the western border and part of the southern border with the Adriatic Sea. The northern half is very mountainous and gives way to flatter terrain and plains {{on the way to the}} sea. The climate is distinguished with very warm days and chilly nights that help maintain a balance in the grape between acidity and sugar levels and allows the grapes a long, slow growing season. In summertime the mean temperature is around 73°F (22.8°C) with rainfall averaging 60inches (1,530mm). Harvest normally takes place in September. The soils of the region vary from the calcium rich marl and flysch sandstone in the more hilly regions to <b>clay,</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel in the valley. The names of Friuli vineyards and wine estates often include the word ronco (plural ronchi), which is the Friulian word for a terraced hillside.|$|E
