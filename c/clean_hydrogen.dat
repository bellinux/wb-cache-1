In this process, retorting occurs at relatively low temperatures (...) through thermal cracking and hydrogenation of the shale into hydrocarbon vapors and spent solids. The thermal cracking allows hydrocarbon vapors to be extracted and scrubbed of solids. The vapors are then cooled, inducing the condensate {{to drop out of}} the gas. The remaining hydrogen, light hydrocarbons, and acid gases are passed through an amine scrubbing system to remove hydrogen sulfide which is converted to elemental sulfur. The <b>cleaned</b> <b>hydrogen</b> and light hydrocarbon gases are then fed back into the system for compression or into the hydrogen heater to provide heat for the fluidized bed reactor.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{efficiently}} evolve hydrogen via electrocatalysis at low overpotentials holds tremendous promise for <b>clean</b> energy. <b>Hydrogen</b> evolution reaction (HER) {{can be easily}} achieved from water if a voltage above the thermodynamic potential of the HER is applied. Large overpotentials are energetically inefficient but can be lowered with expensive platinum based catalysts. Replacement of Pt with inexpensive, earth abundant electrocatalysts would be significantly beneficial for <b>clean</b> and efficient <b>hydrogen</b> evolution. Towards this end, promising HER characteristics have been reported using 2 H (trigonal prismatic) XS 2 (where X = Mo or W) nanoparticles with {{a high concentration of}} metallic edges as electrocatalysts. The key challenges for HER with XS 2 are increasing the number and catalytic activity of active sites. Here we report atomically thin nanosheets of chemically exfoliated WS 2 as efficient catalysts for hydrogen evolution with very low overpotentials. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy analyses indicate that enhanced electrocatalytic activity of WS 2 is associated with high concentration of strained metallic 1 T (octahedral) phase in the as-exfoliated nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of strain in the 1 T phase leads to an enhancement of the density of states at the Fermi level and increases the catalytic activity of the WS 2 nanosheet. Our results suggest that chemically exfoliated WS 2 nanosheets could be interesting catalysts for hydrogen evolution. Comment: 23 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Raman {{scattering}} is {{a powerful}} technique for quantitatively probing high temperature and high speed flows. However, this technique has typically been limited to <b>clean</b> <b>hydrogen</b> flames because of the broadband fluorescence interference which occurs in hydrocarbon flames. Fluorescence can also interfere with the Raman signal in <b>clean</b> <b>hydrogen</b> flames when broadband UV lasers are used as the scattering source. A {{solution to this problem}} has been demonstrated. The solution to the fluorescence interference {{lies in the fact that}} the vibrational Q-branch Raman signal is highly polarized for 90 deg. signal collection and the fluorescence background is essentially unpolarized. Two basic schemes are available for separating the Raman from the background. One scheme involves using a polarized laser and collecting a signal with both horizontal and vertical laser polarizations separately. The signal with the vertical polarization will contain both the Raman and the fluorescence while the signal with the horizontal polarization will contain only the fluorescence. The second scheme involves polarization discrimination on the collection side of the optical setup. For vertical laser polarization, the scattered Q-branch Raman signal will be vertically polarized; hence the two polarizations can be collected separately and the difference between the two is the Raman signal. This approach has been used for the work found herein and has the advantage of allowing the data to be collected from the same laser shot(s). This makes it possible to collect quantitative Raman data with single shot resolution in conditions where interference cannot otherwise be eliminated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{hydrogen}} {{economy is a}} proposition for the distribution of energy by using hydrogen, in order to potentially eliminate carbon emissions and end our reliance on fossil fuels. Some futuristic forecasters view the {{hydrogen economy}} as the ultimate carbon free economy. Hydrogen operated vehicles are on trial in many countries. The use of hydrogen as an energy source for buildings is in its infancy, but research and development is evolving. Hydrogen is generally fed into devices called fuel cells, to produce energy. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that produces electricity and heat from a fuel (often hydrogen) and oxygen. Fuel cells {{have a number of}} advantages over other technologies for power generation. When fed with <b>clean</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> they have the potential to use less fuel than competing technologies and to emit no pollution (the only bi-product being water). However, hydrogen has to be produced and stored in the first instance. It is possible to generate hydrogen from renewable sources, but the technology is still immature and the transformation is wasteful. The creation of a <b>clean</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production and distribution economy, at a global level is very costly. Proponents of a world-scale hydrogen economy argue that hydrogen can be an environmentally cleaner source of energy to end-users, particularly in transportation applications, without release of pollutants (such as particulate matter) or greenhouse gases at the point of end use. Critics of a hydrogen economy argue that for many planne...|$|E
