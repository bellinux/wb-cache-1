500|$|Much of {{the music}} Tippett {{composed}} following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli's [...] birth. The Fantasia would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though The Timess critic lamented the [...] "excessive complexity of the <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>writing...</b> {{there was so much}} going on that the perplexed ear knew not where to turn or fasten itself". Such comments helped to foster a view that Tippett was a [...] "difficult" [...] composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, who had to be replaced before the première by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the Sonata for Four Horns (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premièred by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: [...] "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen". The BBC's Controller of Music defended the orchestra in The Times, writing that it [...] "is equal to all reasonable demands", a wording that implied the fault was the composer's.|$|E

50|$|Raff {{was very}} prolific, {{and by the}} end of his life was one of the best known German composers, though his work is largely {{forgotten}} today. (Only one piece, a cavatina for violin and piano, is performed with any regularity today, sometimes as an encore.) He drew influence from a variety of sources - his eleven symphonies, for example, combine the Classical symphonic form, with the Romantic penchant for program music and <b>contrapuntal</b> orchestral <b>writing</b> which harks back to the Baroque. Most of these symphonies carry descriptive titles including In the Forest (No. 3), Lenore (No. 5) and To the Fatherland (No. 1), a very large-scale work lasting around seventy minutes. His last four symphonies make up a quartet of works based on the four seasons. Arturo Toscanini conducted some performances of the Symphony No. 3 In the Forest in 1931.|$|R
50|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, the didactic strict counterpoint {{was used for}} musical training purposes from the Renaissance to the present day, but was never employed in practice. Broadly speaking, due {{to the development of}} harmony, from the Baroque period on, most <b>contrapuntal</b> compositions were <b>written</b> in the style of free counterpoint. This means that the general focus of the composer had shifted away from how the intervals of added melodies related to a cantus firmus, and more toward how they related to each other.|$|R
2500|$|Another stylistic {{aspect of}} his madrigals is the {{prominent}} use of textural contrast, with chordal, syllabic passages alternating with passages in running thirds or sixths, or brief imitative sections.

50|$|In 1992 Rateau began “Les Chants du Temps” for the piano, his Journal Musical (Musical Diary), “a work in {{progress}} of unachievement”. “Chants du Temps” returned to a very simple, quite purified, strongly melodic, and <b>contrapuntal</b> form of <b>writing,</b> which contrasts radically with the pioneering pieces he wrote in 1960-1970. It consists of a modulable composition in fifteen volumes, each volume enclosing twelve books and,each book containing twelve pages of music. Like a collection of poems, according to his mood and his preferences, the reader-interpreter will choose pieces to be read or played without restraint.|$|R
50|$|In his {{religious}} works, Galuppi mixed modern and antique styles. It {{was then the}} custom to incorporate into new church music the stile antico with smooth vocal lines {{in the tradition of}} Palestrina and a good deal of counterpoint. However, Galuppi applied the stile antico sparingly, and when he felt constrained to <b>write</b> <b>contrapuntal</b> music for the choir he would balance it with a bright modern style for the orchestral accompaniment. His masses and psalm settings for St Mark's exploit all the resources available to a modern composer in the mid-18th century, with choir supported by an orchestra of strings and some or all of flutes, oboes, bassoons, horns, trumpets, and organ. In his tutti choral writing, Galuppi generally leaned toward syllabic settings, reserving the technically demanding melismatic passages for soloists.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983 Duchesne, Lussier, Derome and Robert M. Lepage formed Ambiances Magnétiques, {{a musical}} {{collective}} and artist-run record label specialising in avant-garde music.

Then he began <b>writing</b> <b>contrapuntal</b> compositions for a guitar quartet, and formed Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar (The 4 Guitarists of the Apocalypso-Bar) with Lussier, Bouchard and Roger Boudreault to perform the pieces.

They premiered at the 4th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville (FIMAV) at Victoriaville, Quebec in October 1986, and continued until 1989, touring Canada, the United States and Europe.

5000|$|Formally, {{the symphony}} {{is one of}} Mahlers most {{outwardly}} conventional. The first three movements are relatively traditional in structure and character, with a standard sonata form first movement (even including an exact repeat of the exposition, unusual in Mahler) leading to the middle movements - one a scherzo-with-trios, the other slow. However, attempts to analyze the vast finale {{in terms of the}} sonata archetype have encountered serious difficulties. As Dika Newlin has pointed out:"it has elements of what is conventionally known as sonata form, but the music does not follow a set pattern ... Thus, expositional treatment merges directly into the type of <b>contrapuntal</b> and modulatory <b>writing</b> appropriate to elaboration sections ...; the beginning of the principal theme-group is recapitulated in C minor rather than in A minor, and the C minor chorale theme ... of the exposition is never recapitulated at all" ...|$|R
2500|$|While in Leipzig, {{performances}} of Bach's church music {{were limited to}} some of his motets and, under cantor Doles, some of his Passions, a new generation of Bach aficionados emerged: they studiously collected and copied his music, including some of his large-scale works, such as the Mass in B minor, and performed it privately. One such connoisseur was Gottfried van Swieten, a high-ranking Austrian official who was instrumental in passing Bach's legacy on to the composers of the Viennese school. Haydn owned manuscript copies of the Well-Tempered Clavier and the Mass in B minor, and was influenced by Bach's music. Mozart owned a copy of one of Bach's motets, transcribed some of his instrumental works (K. 404a, 405), and <b>wrote</b> <b>contrapuntal</b> music influenced by his style. Beethoven played the entire Well-Tempered Clavier {{by the time he was}} eleven, and described Bach as [...] "" [...] (progenitor of harmony).|$|R

5000|$|The {{view that}} modern tonal harmony in Western music began in about 1600 is commonplace in music theory.

5000|$|In the mid-1980s, {{experimental}} rock guitarist {{and composer}} André Duchesne from Montreal, Canada began <b>writing</b> <b>contrapuntal</b> compositions for a guitar quartet. To perform them he recruited René Lussier and Jean-Pierre Bouchard from Conventum, Duchesne's late-1970s avant-garde folk-rock group, and Roger Boudreault, a jazz guitarist. The quartet premiered at the 4th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville at Victoriaville, Quebec in October 1986 with ex-Henry Cow drummer Chris Cutler. Duchesne wanted drums {{to complete the}} group's sound and asked Cutler, who was already playing at the festival with Cassiber, to perform with the quartet. Also present at the festival was ex-Henry Cow guitarist and composer Fred Frith, who was playing in a duo with Lussier. Frith was impressed with Duchesne's guitar quartet and later wrote an extended composition, [...] "The As Usual Dance Towards the Other Flight to What Is Not" [...] for them to play. In 1989 Frith formed his own guitar quartet, the Fred Frith Guitar Quartet.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that while Francis I ruled France (1515 - 47) royal musicians produced a large, idiosyncractic repertory of sacred and secular polyphony, {{much of which}} was published in Paris by the first French printer of polyphonic music, Pierre Attaingnant. Because {{of the extent to which}} chansons predominate in Attaingnant 2 ̆ 7 s prints, stylistic similarities between the secular works and the motets written by Claudin de Sermisy and Pierre Certon, two of the crown 2 ̆ 7 s chief musicians, traditionally have been attributed to the overwhelming popularity of the so-called 2 ̆ 2 Parisian chanson 2 ̆ 2 during the third and fourth decades of the century. Textual and musical analysis of the ninety-three motets attributed to Claudin, however, reveals considerable technical and aesthetic differences between the two genres, a number of which arise from the composer 2 ̆ 7 s overriding concern to reflect musically the syntax and the rhetoric of the unrhymed motet texts he favored. Moreover, although similar analysis of the polyphonic repertory created by the musicians of Louis XII (r. 1498 - 1514) indicates that no one type of motet predominated at the royal court before 1515, clear antecedents for Sermisy 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 syntactic 2 ̆ 2 motets can be found among the compositions of Antoine de Fevin, Mathieu Gascongne, and Jean Mouton, all of whom served in the royal chapel during his formative years at the court. It may be suggested, on the basis of this analysis and a review of the history and the musical patronage of the court, that the 2 ̆ 2 syntactic 2 ̆ 2 style of motet writing became dominant in the royal chapel during the third decade of the century not as a direct result of the emergence of the Parisian chanson, but rather in response to the musical tastes of the king and the increasing cultural isolation of the court at that time, an isolation brought on in large part by the disaster of Pavia in 1525 and the growing effectiveness of the crown 2 ̆ 7 s musical patronage. During the final decade of Francis 2 ̆ 7 s reign, the 2 ̆ 2 syntactic 2 ̆ 2 style gradually was supplanted by Pierre Certon 2 ̆ 7 s attempted rapprochement of the courtly tradition with the more <b>contrapuntal</b> manner of <b>writing</b> favored in the imperial chapel, an attempt that met with limited success. ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{movement}} exemplifies Borodins lyrical (as {{opposed to}} dramatic) {{treatment of the}} sonata form. All thematic material is lyrical; contrasts are achieved via <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>writing</b> (as in the middle section of the subordinate theme, beginning in measure 57, and especially in beginning in measure 65), or color contrasts (such as changes of keys-beginning of the development, and particularly the non-traditional key of the subordinate theme in the recapitulation).|$|E
50|$|The profoundly tragic mood {{continues}} in the following andante, one of Handel's most personal statements. The movement is a fugue on a striking atonal four-note theme, B-G-D sharp-C, which is reminiscent of Domenico Scarlatti's Cat fugue. The suspensions and inner parts recall the <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>writing</b> of Bach. There is an unexpected addition of a G sharp in the last entry of the four-note theme in the bass as the movement draws to a close.|$|E
5000|$|The {{work was}} {{at least in part}} {{inspired}} by Bartók's unrequited love for the violinist Stefi Geyer - in a letter to her, he called the first movement a [...] "funeral dirge" [...] and its opening notes trace a motif which first appeared in his Violin Concerto No. 1, a work dedicated to Geyer and suppressed by Bartók for many years. The intense <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>writing</b> of this movement is often compared to Ludwig van Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14, op. 131, the opening movement of which is a slow fugue.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the prelude in 17th century Germany led to a sectional form similar to keyboard toccatas by Johann Jakob Froberger or Girolamo Frescobaldi. Preludes by northern German composers such as Dieterich Buxtehude (c.1637-1707) and Nikolaus Bruhns (c.1665-1697) combined sections of free improvised passages with parts in strict <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>writing</b> (usually brief fugues). Outside Germany, Abraham van den Kerckhoven (c.1618-c.1701), {{one of the most}} important Dutch composers of the period, used this model for some of his preludes. Southern and central German composers did not follow the sectional model and their preludes remained improvisational in character with little or no strict counterpoint.|$|E
5000|$|The manualiter chorale prelude BWV 685, {{despite being}} only 27 bars long and {{technically}} speaking a three-part fughetta, {{is a complex}} composition with dense fugal writing.

The compact style, imitative <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>writing</b> and sometimes capricious touches, such as repetition and the ambiguity in the number of parts, are features that BWV 685 shares with the shorter chorale preludes in Kauffmann's Harmonische Seelenlust.

5000|$|Whatever Bach's {{personal}} reaction, the <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>writing</b> of Clavier-Übung III {{provided a}} musical response to Scheibe's criticisms and Mattheson's call to organists. Mizler's statement, cited above, that {{the qualities of}} Clavier-Übung III provided a [...] "powerful refutation {{of those who have}} ventured to criticize the music of the Court Composer" [...] was a verbal response to their criticisms. Nevertheless, most commentators agree that the main inspiration for Bach's monumental opus was musical, namely musical works like the Fiori musicali of Girolamo Frescobaldi, for which Bach had a special fondness, having acquired his own personal copy in Weimar in 1714.|$|E
5000|$|This smaller manualiter {{setting of}} Aus tiefer Noth schrei' ich zu dir is a four-part chorale motet {{in the key}} of F minor, with the {{augmented}} cantus firmus in the phrygian mode of E in the uppermost soprano part.

50|$|In 18th-century <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>writing,</b> voices may cross freely, {{especially}} among {{voices in the}} same pitch location. It is, however, quite restricted in invertible counterpoint, since it makes the crossing in the inversion impossible. Canons at small harmonic intervals usually necessitate considerable voice crossing, and in a crab canon it is inevitable at the midpoint. For this reason, many authors find that canons sound better when performed by voices of different timbre. In four-part chorale writing, voice crossing is infrequent, and again the most frequently crossed voices are the alto and tenor. Voice crossing is usually forbidden in pedagogical exercises in common practice chorale-style voice-leading, especially when involving an outer voice.|$|E
50|$|In jazz, a shout chorus (occasionally: out chorus) {{is usually}} the last chorus of a Big Band arrangement, and is {{characterized}} by being the most energetic, lively, and exciting and by containing the musical climax of the piece. A shout chorus characteristically employs extreme ranges, loud dynamics, and a re-arrangement of melodic motives into short, accented riffs. Shout choruses often feature tutti or concerted writing, but may also use <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>writing</b> or call and response between the brass and saxophones, or between the ensemble and the drummer. Additionally, brass players frequently use extended techniques such as falls, doits, turns, and shakes to add excitement.|$|E

5000|$|This {{section is}} a {{complete}} change of character from the formal fugue that preceded it {{and the one that}} follows it.

Analysts who see the fugue as a multi-movement work rolled into one view this as the traditional Andante movement.

Among the choral works are two cantatas, St. John of Damascus, Op. 1 (also known as A Russian Requiem), and At the Reading of a Psalm (Op. 36, sometimes regarded as his swan song).
