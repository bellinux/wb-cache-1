40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{the elaboration of}} epigenetic models for differentiation. I discuss how results and conclusions arising from studies of prokaryotes were extrapolated to explain differentiation during metazoan development. In this respect, I focus on the presentation of a multi-stable biochemical model by Delbr√ºck in 1949, and {{on a series of}} works dealing with enzyme adaptation in Escherichia coli that culminated in Jacob and Monod's operon model. These influential contributions are discussed in the context of debates on nuclear versus <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>heredity,</b> on the regulation of gene expression, {{as well as on the}} mechanisms at the basis of cell differentiation.

40|$|International audienceOur {{knowledge}} of heredity has recently undergone major upheaval. Heredity transmits {{considerably more than}} just genetic elements: 1) the oocyte is full of maternal cytoplasmic components subsequently present in each new cell 2) maternal cells are able to pass to the progeny, and they remain active into adult life (microchimerism). Here we examine {{the notion that the}} transmission of characters involves at least two processes besides that of Mendelian heredity, long considered to be the only hereditary mechanism. These processes, which all involve epigenetic processes, involve the transmission of macromolecules, subcellular organelles and living cells solely from the mother to her offspring, be they female or male, during pregnancy and lactation. We postulate that <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>heredity</b> and maternal transmission of cells leading to a long-term state of microchimerism in progeny are two good examples of matrilineal non-Mendelian heredity. A mother's important contribution to the development and health of her progeny seems to possess many uncharted depths...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear {{pleiotropic}} respiratory-deficient mutant pet 1 (previously M 126) exhibits cytochromes aa 3 and b deficiencies {{accompanied by}} {{loss of the}} oligomycin-sensitivity of the mitochondrial ATPase. The mutant pet 1, unable to grow on glycerol, growth on glucose. The latter phenotypic trait symbolized by ANAS-D, exhibits a high frequency (2 to 4 X 10 (5)) Of spontaneous suppression into Antimycin A-resistant strains. Mutagenesis with MnCl 2 increases {{by a factor of}} 10 (2) the frequency of ANAR-D derivatives. This suppression is partial since none of the suppressed strains is able to grow on glycerol even when respiratory functions and cytochromes activities are restored as in the pet 1 [SUP 2] strain. In the latter strain it is concluded that the extralocus suppressor gene [SUP 2] is responsible for the ANAR-D trait. Tetrad analysis in a cross homozygous for pet 1 demonstrates a non-Mendelian segregation pattern for the SUP 2 suppressor gene. In stable diploids, homozygous for pet 1, the [SUP 2] suppressor exhibits a mitotic segregation pattern. Furthermore the transmission of the [SUP 2] gene is decreased by ethidium bromide treatment. Therefore, the [SUP 2] suppressor gene responsible for partial suppression of the nuclear pleiotropic phenotype in mutant pet 1 is of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>heredity...</b>|$|E
