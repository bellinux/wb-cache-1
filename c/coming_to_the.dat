5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This has {{replaced}} the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right of access to the car park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E

From that early start, Balukas completely dominated women's professional pool during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

However, the West Indies side that had enjoyed this considerable recent success was beginning {{to show signs of}} ageing. The experienced batsmen Viv Richards (the captain), Gordon Greenidge, Jeff Dujon, and Desmond Haynes were all <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of their careers, and bowlers Michael Holding and Joel Garner and batsman Larry Gomes had recently retired. As a result, the squad arrived with an unusually inexperienced group of pace bowlers. Supporting Malcolm Marshall, a veteran of 53 Tests, were relative newcomers Courtney Walsh (20 Tests), Patrick Patterson (11), Winston Benjamin (4), Curtly Ambrose (3) and Ian Bishop (0).|$|E
