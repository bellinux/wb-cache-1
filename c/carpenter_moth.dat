50|$|The Hercules moth (Coscinocera hercules), in {{the family}} Saturniidae, is endemic to New Guinea and {{northern}} Australia, and its wings have the largest documented surface area (300 square centimeters) of any living insect, and a maximum wingspan which is confirmed to 28 cm while unconfirmed specimens have spanned up to 35.5 cm. The largest species overall is often claimed to be either the Queen Alexandra's birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae), a butterfly from Papua New Guinea, or the Atlas moth (Attacus atlas), a moth from Southeast Asia. Both of these species can reach a length of 8 cm, a wingspan of 28 cm and a weight of 12 g. One Atlas moth allegedly had a wingspan of 30 cm but this measurement was not verified. The larvae in the previous species can weigh up to 58 and 54 g, respectively. However, there are no reported measurements of surface area that would exceed the Hercules moth, and the white witch (Thysania agrippina) of Central and South America, has the largest recorded wingspan of the order, and indeed of any living insect, though the white witch is exceeded in surface area by the Hercules moth. The verified record-sized Thysania spanned 30.8 cm across the wings, although specimens {{have been reported to}} 36 cm. The heaviest mature moths have been cited in the giant <b>carpenter</b> <b>moth</b> (Xyleutes boisduvali) of Australia, which has weighed up to 20 g although the species does not surpass 25.5 cm in wingspan.|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} pairs of {{suspensory}} muscles in the larva of Tipula abdominalis which originate dorso-laterally between body segments one through four and insert laterally along the mid-gut and on the mid-portion of the Malpighian tubules. Cytologically these muscles resemble body wall muscles more than gut muscles. In the living animal, the muscles probably take up slack and keep the gut and Malpighian tubules from being displaced unduly. Although the existence of suspensory muscles in some insect larvae has been recognized for some time, few descriptions of these muscles have actually been published. Lyonet (1762) {{was the first to}} describe such muscles, in the <b>carpenter</b> <b>moth,</b> Cossus cossus. He observed seven pairs of these muscles which extended from intersegmental portions of the body wall to various places on the mid-gut, hind-gut, Malpighian tubules, and silk glands. He called these "trunk " muscles. Much later, a second observation of such muscles was made in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Tanaka (1911) described nine pairs of muscles which he called "dermo-visceral " muscles. They originated on the body wall between segment...|$|E
40|$|Understanding factors {{responsible}} for structuring genetic diversity is of fundamental importance in evolutionary biology. The seabuckthorn <b>carpenter</b> <b>moth</b> (Holcocerus hippophaecolus Hua) {{is a native}} species throughout the north of China and is considered the main threat to seabuckthorn, Hippophae rhamnoides L. We assessed the influence of outbreaks, environmental factors and host species in shaping the genetic variation and structure of H. hippophaecolus by using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers. We rejected the hypothesis that outbreak-associated genetic divergence exist, as evidenced by genetic clusters containing a combination of populations from historical outbreak areas, as well as non-outbreak areas. Although {{a small number of}} markers (4 of 933 loci) were identified as candidates under selection in response to population densities. H. hippophaecolus also did not follow an isolation-by-distance pattern. We rejected the hypothesis that outbreak and drought events were driving the genetic structure of H. hippophaecolus. Rather, the genetic structure appears to be influenced by various confounding bio-geographical factors. There were detectable genetic differences between H. hippophaecolus occupying different host trees from within the same geographic location. Host-associated genetic divergence should be confirmed by further investigation...|$|E
50|$|Holcoceroides is a {{monotypic}} genus of <b>carpenter</b> <b>moths</b> (family Cossidae). It includes {{only the}} species Holcoceroides ferrugineotincta and is doubtfully distinct from Holcocerus. Like the latter, its relationships to other Cossidae are not determined with certainty. The species {{is found in}} Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Sudan.|$|R
50|$|Cossoidea is the {{superfamily}} of <b>moths</b> {{that includes}} <b>carpenter</b> <b>moths</b> and relatives. Like their likely sister group Sesioidea they are internal feeders and have spiny pupae with moveable segments {{to allow them}} to extrude out of their exit holes in stems and trunks during emergence of the adult (Edwards et al., 1999).|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though they}} are [...] "micromoths", the Aluctoidea are not {{especially}} primitive Lepidoptera; the sizable <b>carpenter</b> <b>moths</b> (Cossidae) {{as well as the}} butterflies are not particularly distant relatives. The closest living relatives of the Aluctoidea, however, seem to be the plume moths (Pterophoroidea), which like the many-plumed moths have wings consisting each of several narrow straps (though less strikingly so than in the Aluctoidea). However, the taxonomic treatment of the many-plumed moths among the Ditrysia is disputed, mostly because of their unclear relationship to the fruitworm moths (Copromorphoidea).|$|R
40|$|Seabuckthorn <b>carpenter</b> <b>moth,</b> Eogystia hippophaecolus (Lepidoptera: Cossidae), is an {{important}} pest of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), which is a shrub that has significant ecological and economic value in China. E. hippophaecolus is highly cold tolerant, but limited {{studies have been conducted}} to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its cold resistance. Here we sequenced the E. hippophaecolus transcriptome using RNA-Seq technology and performed de novo assembly from the short paired-end reads. We investigated the larval response to cold stress by comparing gene expression profiles between treatments. We obtained 118, 034 unigenes, of which 22, 161 were annotated with gene descriptions, conserved domains, gene ontology terms, and metabolic pathways. These resulted in 57 GO terms and 193 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. By comparing transcriptome profiles for differential gene expression, we identified many differentially expressed proteins and genes, including heat shock proteins and cuticular proteins which have previously been reported to be involved in cold resistance of insects. This study provides a global transcriptome analysis and an assessment of differential gene expression in E. hippophaecolus under cold stress. We found seven differential expressed genes in common between developmental stages, which were verified with qPCR. Our findings facilitate future genomic studies aimed at improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of insects to low temperatures...|$|E
