5|$|Beecher {{enjoyed the}} company of women, and rumors of extramarital affairs {{circulated}} as early as his Indiana days, when he was believed to have {{had an affair with}} a young member of his congregation. In 1858, the Brooklyn Eagle wrote a story accusing him of an affair with another young <b>church</b> <b>member</b> who had later become a prostitute. The wife of Beecher's patron and editor, Henry Bowen, confessed on her deathbed to her husband of an affair with Beecher; Bowen concealed the incident during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The Church holds three {{scheduled}} prayer meetings each day. The first daily prayer {{meeting is}} at 5:00a.m. and usually lasts one hour. The service includes a talk that {{is meant to}} recordar (remember) the material covered in the Sunday School. The 9:00a.m. prayer was originally started by González's wife, Elisa Flores. A female <b>church</b> <b>member</b> presides over the prayer meeting, which includes a talk. The evening prayer has the same structure as the 5:00a.m. meeting. In each prayer meeting members {{are expected to be}} prepared with their Bibles, hymn books and notebooks and to be consecrated.|$|E
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} {{has become}} popular among poor Americans, {{particularly those who}} seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants. Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views. Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the Global South—to {{the fact that it}} promises security and helps explain capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners. In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another <b>church</b> <b>member).</b> Hillsong Church, the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity theology that emphasizes personal success. Marion Maddox has argued that this message has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>church</b> <b>members</b> {{belong to}} a church council, either {{because they have been}} elected by the local <b>church</b> <b>members,</b> or because they hold {{one of a number of}} offices within the local church.

25|$|The {{status of}} McCune's {{religious}} beliefs {{is open to}} dispute. Mormon missionary Stuart Martin wrote in 1920 that McCune was not a Mormon, but had many Mormon friends and had given much money to the church. Judge Orlando Powers, Associate Justice of the Utah Supreme Court, said in 1906 that he understood that McCune was not a Mormon. Frank J. Cannon, too, claimed McCune was not a Mormon,and B. H. Roberts, LDS Church historian {{and member of the}} First Council of the Seventy, said in 1930 that McCune was not a <b>church</b> <b>member.</b> Historian Orvin Malmquist, however, says that church records show he was baptized into the LDS Church at the age of eight in 1857, and that his marriage to Elizabeth Claridge in a Mormon temple in 1872 could not have occurred without his being a <b>church</b> <b>member.</b> It is not in dispute that he was baptized by proxy in 1969.|$|E

25|$|The {{death knell}} or the tolling {{of the church}} bell is a popular {{practice}} among rural congregations.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the relationship between religious and charitable giving. We test how income, the tax-price of giving and the German church tax, differently affect charitable donations of <b>church</b> <b>members,</b> individuals leaving <b>church</b> and nonchurch <b>members.</b> We find crowding in between the church tax and charitable giving for <b>church</b> <b>members,</b> {{but not for the}} church-leavers. In contrast to <b>church</b> <b>members,</b> donations of church-leavers and non-members are also highly responsive to the tax deductibility. Additionally, non-donors exhibit a significantly increased probability of leaving church compared to donors. Finally, we demonstrate that leaving church increases donations on the extensive margin but decrease giving along the intensive margin...|$|R

25|$|Wesley Church was {{designed}} by Richard Roach Jewell, an architect, circuit steward, clerk of colonial works and <b>church</b> <b>member.</b> Jewell {{was responsible for the}} design of a number of other prominent Perth buildings, including the Cloisters (1858), the Pensioner Barracks (1863), and extensions and alterations to Government House (1864) and Perth Town Hall (1870). Jewell designed Wesley Church in the fashionable Gothic revival style, a style which he successfully adapted in his other buildings. Jewell's plan for Wesley Church, comprising the nave, chancel and bell tower with a tall and elegant spire, was accepted with one alteration - the relocation of the bell tower from the north-east side to the south-east side.|$|E
