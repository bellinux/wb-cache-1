40|$|Absolute {{stress in}} {{structural}} steel members {{is an important}} parameter for the design, construction, and <b>servicing</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> structures. However, {{it is difficult to}} measure via traditional approaches to structural health monitoring. The ultrasonic time-of-flight (TOF) method has been widely studied for monitoring absolute stress by measuring the change of ultrasonic propagation time induced by stress. The TOF of the two separated shear-wave modes induced by birefringence, which is particular to shear waves, is also affected by stress to different degrees. Their synthesis signal amplitude spectrum exhibits a minimum that varies with stress, which makes it a potential approach to evaluating uniaxial stress using the shear-wave amplitude spectrum. In this study, the effect of steel-member stress on the shear-wave amplitude spectrum from the interference of two shear waves produced by birefringence is investigated, and a method of uniaxial absolute stress measurement using shear-wave spectral analysis is proposed. Specifically, a theoretical expression is derived for the shear-wave pulse-echo amplitude spectrum, leading to a formula for evaluating uniaxial absolute stress. Three steel-member specimens are employed to investigate the influence of uniaxial stress on the shear-wave pulse-echo amplitude spectrum. The testing results indicate that the amplitude spectrum changes with stress, and that the inverse of the first characteristic frequency in the amplitude spectrum and its corresponding stress exhibit a near-perfect linear relationship. On this basis, the uniaxial absolute stress <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> members loaded by a test machine is measured by the proposed method. Parametric studies are further performed on three groups <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> members made <b>of</b> 65 # <b>steel</b> and Q 235 steel to investigate the factors that influence the testing results.

40|$|International {{standards}} and codes dedicated to design of pressure vessels are {{still unable to}} competitively ensure safe design and fitness for <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> vessels for high pressure gaseous hydrogen. Emptying and shallow pressure cycles subject the material to hydrogen enhanced fatigue. A pre-normative project, MATHRYCE under the EU joint research program focused in this subject through material and component testing, analytical work, review of design methodologies and international collaboration. An easy to implement, safe and economically competitive vessel design methodology is targeted. Steps towards this goal were taken by deepening our understanding on hydrogen enhanced fatigue in different kinds of laboratory specimens and real vessels designed for hydrogen service at maximum 45 MPa pressure. This included cyclic pressure testing of artificially notched vessels both in hydrogen and inert environment. The effect of hydrogen pressure, frequency and mechanical loading parameters (ΔK, Sa) on fatigue crack initiation and propagation was analyzed. Attention was paid on the definition of “initiation” and influence of hydrogen on the relative parts of initiation and propagation on the fatigue life of a component. A good correlation between results with various test types was found. Particularly promising was the match between the measured – and estimated – crack growth rates in laboratory specimens and vessels. This supports our proposal for a safe design procedure based on crack growth and defect tolerant approach. Recommendations for implementation in a new international standard, on how to properly address hydrogen enhanced fatigue based on laboratory tests, were given and will be summarized in this presentation. Our results indicate that crack initiation from inclusions or other small microstructural features is not necessarily affected by hydrogen to a similar extent as crack growth, but when initiated, the remaining life may be short due to fast growth. This is challenging for design and inspection rules to allow economically competitive construction of hydrogen equipment without compromising safety. JRC. C. 1 -Energy Storag...|$|R

Furthermore, the wooden beams of wooden guardrails that had been in place for 10  years in Miyazaki Prefecture were recovered and subjected to strength tests. The result showed that they still retained plenty of function [21]. All of the wood used in these examples was treated with preservatives by pressure injection. Furthermore, the efficacy of pressure injection is influenced by the amount of preservatives inside the wood, and it is known that pressure injection treatment results in a larger amount of chemical agent absorption compared with surface coating treatment [22].|$|R

Corrosion inducing substances, such as chlorides, can enter the matrix through these cracks and cause steel reinforcement corrosion and concrete degradation. Self-repair of concrete cracks is an innovative technique which has been studied extensively {{during the past decade}} and which may help to increase the sustainability of concrete. However, the experiments conducted until now did not allow for an assessment <b>of</b> the <b>service</b> life extension possible with self-healing concrete in comparison with traditional (cracked) concrete.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to study the effect of heat {{treatments}} and resulting changes in microstructure on mechanical properties, mainly impact toughness, of commercial 2205 duplex stainless steel and higher alloy superduplex 2507 grade. Design/methodology/approach: Both steels were submitted to ageing treatments in the temperature range of 500 - 900 °C with exposure time periods 6 minutes, 1 hour and 10 hours. Light microscope examinations, hardness measurements and impact toughness tests were performed in order to reveal microstructure and changes in mechanical properties. Findings: Obtained results confirm that high temperature <b>service</b> <b>of</b> duplex stainless <b>steels</b> should be avoided. Precipitations of secondary phases (mainly σ phase) strongly deteriorate mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> but some amounts of these phases could be acceptable in the microstructure depending upon the application <b>of</b> the <b>steel.</b> Research limitations/implications: Presence of secondary phases in duplex stainless steel microstructure can be very harmful for its corrosion resistance. This phenomenon is not considered in this study. Practical implications: The accidents during exploitation and errors in processing <b>of</b> duplex stainless <b>steels</b> can result in undesired temperature growth over 500 °C. Such events brings question whether the steel can be still exploited or not. The aim of present study is to reveal the effect of thermal cycles on structural changes and mechanical properties <b>of</b> duplex stainless <b>steel</b> and establish the highest acceptable time-temperature conditions for safe operation <b>of</b> the <b>steel.</b> Originality/value: Information available in literature does not clearly indicate what amount of secondary phases existing in duplex stainless steel microstructure can be acceptable.

The switch box {{which has been}} subjected to blast loading is chosen for a detailed study. For impulsively loaded structures, the structural damage and response depends on the impulse rather than the pressure pulse. In this regard, the blast wave is modelled as a uniform rectangular pressure pulse distributed over the sides of the switch box. The blast behaviour <b>of</b> a simple <b>steel</b> box is modelled using LS-DYNA software. The steel material is modelled using isotropic hardening model, pertaining to Von Mises yield condition with isotropic strain hardening, and strain rate-dependent dynamic yield stress based on the Cowper and Symonds model. Three different cracked structures are chosen to investigate their capability in dissipating the blast loading. To improve the blast resistance, the cracked steel structures are stiffened using carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite patches. The repaired patches reduce the stress field around the crack as the stress is transferred from the cracked zone to them. This situation prevents the crack from growing and extends the <b>service</b> life <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> structure. It will be shown that CFRP repairing can significantly increase the blast resistance <b>of</b> cracked <b>steel</b> structures...|$|R

40|$|A common way {{to extend}} <b>service</b> life <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> tools under heavy duty service {{conditions}} {{is the use}} of hardfacing coatings. Coating an economically feasible basematerial like carbon steelwith a hardfacing alloy by any processes based on welding, casting or cladding improves significantly its wear resistance. All these processes involve high heat inputs in order to partially melt the substrate material to create a sound bonding between the substrate and the wear resistant alloy. The intermixing and the elemental diffusion from the hardfacing material into the substrate and vice versa cause a change in microstructure, hardness and wear properties of the diluted alloy. It is not trivial to categorize the amount of dilution and its effects on material properties since composition and microstructure change discontinuously, especially in casting processes, due to different diffusion rates of elements and due to phase transitions. This paper presents a simplified model to correlate the amount of dilution in hardfacing alloys after a casting process considering several reference parameters. Three coefficients are derived to describe the degree of dilution based on crucible casting experiments and are numerically correlated by linear regressions. They specify distinct issues about macroscopic and microscopic dilution, aswell as changes in chemical composition. Themodel is then applied to a spin casting case studywhich can be taken as a reference example for industrial hardfacing processes where dilution effects are clearly observable...|$|R
