40|$|We {{consider}} a portfolio optimization {{problem for a}} short-term investor who faces an illiquid stock market. The illiquidity of this market results from a transitory price impact that is captured by the transaction costs that are convex {{in the number of}} shares traded by an investor. The linear component in these costs defines a no-trading zone, while the nonlinear component does not allow trading the stock at an arbitrary rate. The portfolio choice problem is solved when the stock path is continuous and when the stock may crash. We find that an economy could be in states where the <b>conditional</b> <b>liquidity</b> premium is of the same order of magnitude as the historical risk premium of the stock market. If the illiquid stock undergoes crashes, then in many states, an investor demands a premium for crashes that is much higher than that in the liquid market. Finally, we study the shape of the no-trading zone when the nonlinearity in the transitory price impact is strong or moderate. We find that this shape is significantly different from that when the transitory price impact is linear. Portfolio choice Liquidity Price impact Transaction costs...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} pricing of {{liquidity}} risk {{and its effect}} on stock returns in the Finnish stock market. In addition to that, it investigates whether there is a trend in liquidity risk. Finally, it analyzes whether the two chosen liquidity measures provide different results. The data consists of all the common shares listed in the Finnish stock market during the period of 1 / 1997 – 7 / 2015. To examine whether liquidity risk affects stock returns in the Finnish stock market, this study utilizes a conditional version of liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model (LCAPM) by Acharya and Pedersen (2005). Two recently proposed illiquidity measures – PQS and AdjILLIQ – are used in the empirical estimation to see whether there are differences in the results between the measures. The time-varying <b>conditional</b> <b>liquidity</b> risks are estimated by using a multivariate DCC-GARCH model, while the pricing of the liquidity risk is conducted by applying fixed effect panel regression. The results imply that investors in the Finnish stock market are willing to pay a premium to hedge from wealth shocks and having liquid assets during the declined market liquidity. However, investors are not willing to pay a premium for stocks with higher returns during illiquid markets. The total annualized illiquidity premiums found in the Finnish stock market are 1. 77 % and 1. 04 %, based on the PQS and AdjILLIQ measures, respectively. The study also shows that liquidity risk does not exhibit decreasing trend, and investors should consider liquidity risk in their portfolio diversification in the Finnish stock market...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that stock index returns form a martingale difference sequence (MDS) is tested for 10 European emerging stock markets: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Turkey and the Ukraine, using joint variance ratio tests based on signs {{and the wild}} bootstrap, for the period beginning in January 1998 and ending in September 2007. For comparative purposes, the same tests are carried out with data for the United Kingdom and the United States. In two of the emerging markets, Poland and Turkey, and the two developed markets, none of the tests rejects the martingale hypothesis. For the stock markets in Malta, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, {{all of the evidence}} finds that stock index returns do not form a martingale difference sequence. The results are discussed in light of stock market characteristics: size, liquidity {{and the quality of the}} market are important for MDS returns.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model analyzing {{the potential for}} an International Court with powers to declare standstills to mitigate the coordination problem inherent to roll-overs in sovereign debt markets. It is shown that, regardless {{of the quality of}} the information handled by such an Institution, the scale of the coordination problem is reduced since its mere existence forces investors to focus on the Court's course of action rather than on other investors' beliefs. Furthermore, the model shows that, in order to avoid moral hazard, the right of recourse to the Court should be made <b>conditional.</b> sovereign debt, <b>liquidity</b> runs, standstills, effort...|$|R

Table A 1 presents the monthly contemporaneous returns (month t) and the alphas for the decile portfolios constructed based on the shock to effective spread (SPRDU) in Panel A and the conditional measure of shock to Amihud’s illiquidity measure (LIQCU) in Panel B. Table A 2 reports 5 × 5 portfolio results from the conditional bivariate sorts of liquidity shocks (measured by the changes in Amihud’s illiquidity) and the control variables. Table A 3 provides bivariate portfolio results from the <b>conditional</b> sorts of <b>liquidity</b> shocks (measured by SPRDU in Panel A and LIQCU in Panel B) and the control variables. Table A 4 presents bivariate portfolio results from the <b>conditional</b> sorts by <b>liquidity</b> shocks (LIQU, SPRDU and LIQCU) after controlling for VOLDU and IVOLU. Table A 5 investigates the orthogonal components of SPRDU for predicting future stock returns. Table A 6 shows stock-level cross-sectional regression results after controlling for IVOLU and all other return predictors. Table A 7 presents results from the Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions of one-month ahead returns on the liquidity shock measures and the control variables. Panels A and B of Table A 8, respectively, present {{the results of the}} univariate portfolio sorts and stock-level Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions based on the shock to equal-weighted quoted spread (QSPRDU).

40|$|In {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} economy with uninsurable aggregate liquidity shocks, {{we show that}} public information may trigger allocative inefficiency and liquidity crises. Entrepreneurs do not internalize {{the negative impact of}} their investment decisions on the equilibrium risk of liquidity shortage. A more informative public signal decreases the risk of a liquidity shock, but increases the risk of capital rationing <b>conditional</b> on a <b>liquidity</b> shock. In equilibrium, information quality has a non-monotonic effect on expected returns on investment and social welfare. An increase in the quality of public information has redistributive effects on welfare as entrepreneurs gain and financiers lose.

40|$|There is {{existing}} {{evidence of}} equity returns having a mixture distribution with multiple component structures. Following the increasing interest in intraday trading, {{this article examines}} determinants of intraday equity return distributions and finds that greater information flow and stock liquidity {{reduce the number of}} components while greater heterogeneity amongst traders increases the number of components. These results show that when empirically modelling intraday return distributions allowance needs to be made for their time varying nature {{and the fact that they}} are <b>conditional</b> on the <b>liquidity</b> and information flow of a stock. In addition, the results reinforce the recent emphasis by market regulators on information flow and liquidity being key to increasing transparency and reducing uncertainty (multiple components in the return distribution). ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} alternative option pricing models based either on jump-diffusion nor stochastic volatility data generating processes. We assume either a smooth volatility function of some previously defined explanatory variables or a model in which discrete-based observations can be employed to estimate both path-dependence volatility and the negative correlation between volatility and underlying returns. Moreover, we also allow for liquidity frictions to recognize that underlying markets may not be fully integrated. The simplest models tend to present a superior out-of sample performance and a better hedging ability, although the model with liquidity costs seems to display better in-sample behavior. However, none of the models seems {{to be able to}} capture the rapidly changing distribution of the underlying index return or the net buying pressure characterizing option markets. pricing, <b>conditional</b> volatility, hedging, <b>liquidity,</b> net buying pressure. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of the recent {{financial}} crisis, the discussion on the nature of runs and on the stabilizing role of liquidity holdings has intensified. This paper explores the cash management conducted by German open-end equity funds for the period between 2005 and 2010. Since ownership structures may have important consequences according to recent work, we distinguish funds whose shares are predominantly held by retail investors from funds with a stronger institutional orientation. Conditional on poor portfolio liquidity, we find that managers of permanently retail-oriented funds tend to move towards higher cash-to-asset positions. Cashbuilding intensities are found to be lower when illiquid funds are institutional-oriented or when the portfolio liquidity of retail-based funds is higher. The striking effort undertaken by poorly liquid funds with a lasting retail-orientation is likely to be linked to their exposure to the risk of strategic investor behavior at times of distress. We conclude that <b>conditional</b> on their <b>liquidity</b> status, these funds use cash as a device to provide for the ownership-related fragility of their funding base, thereby contributing to the self-stabilization of the financial system...|$|R
40|$|We study two {{designs for}} a liquidity-saving {{mechanism}} (LSM), a queuing arrangement used with an interbank settlement system. We consider {{an environment where}} banks are subjected to liquidity shocks. Banks must {{make the decision to}} send, queue, or delay their payments after observing a noisy signal of the shock. With a balance-reactive LSM, banks can set a balance threshold below which payments are not released from the queue. Banks can choose their threshold such that the release of a payment from the queue is <b>conditional</b> on the <b>liquidity</b> shock. With a receipt-reactive LSM, a payment is released from the queue if an offsetting payment is received, regardless of the liquidity shock. We find that these two designs have opposite effects on different types of payments. Payments that are costly to delay will be settled at least as early, or earlier, with a receipt-reactive LSM. Payments that are not costly to delay will always be delayed with a receipt-reactive LSM, while some of them will be queued and settled early with a balance-reactive LSM. We also show that parameter values will determine which system provides higher welfare. Bank liquidity; Interbank market; Payment systems; Bank liquidity...|$|R
