5|$|A study {{conducted}} by the University of Chicago showed that bottlenose dolphins <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> whistles of other dolphins they'd lived with after 20 years of separation. Each dolphin has a unique whistle that functions like a name, allowing the marine mammals to keep close social bonds.|$|E
5|$|After awakening, Jon Snow {{is greeted}} by Davos Seaworth and Melisandre. When asked by Davos what he <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> Jon says he remembers only his {{assassination}} but nothing from being dead. Melisandre tells Jon that her religion prophesies {{the return of}} a heroic prince and suggests that this prince may not be Stannis, as she first thought, but Jon. Jon enters the courtyard {{to meet with the}} wildlings. He meets with and embraces Tormund Giantsbane and Dolorous Edd, Tormund saying the Wildlings think he is a god.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 2013, BBC {{released}} a short prequel video to the episode, written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes {{he might be able}} to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E

50|$|Meriadar teaches {{patience}} and respect to all creatures. He expects open-mindedness and compassion, and expects {{his followers to}} attempt to meet and befriend other races.

50|$|In addition, context <b>can</b> affect <b>remember</b> {{and know}} {{responses}} while not affecting recollection and familiarity processes. Remember and know responses are subjective decisions {{that can be}} affected by underlying memory processes. While changing recollection and familiarity processes <b>can</b> influence <b>remember</b> and know judgments, context can affect how items are weighted for remember-know decisions.|$|R
5|$|Mushishi {{opens with}} Yoki {{and his mother}} walking along a {{mountain}} when a cliff suddenly collapses. This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)â€”an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes and the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{celebrate}} their six-month anniversary, Long Island socialites Tony and Carlotta Milburn arrange a wild drinking party with friends, {{culminating in a}} stop at the restaurant owned by Faronea. They are unaware that Faronea is conspiring with Baptiste Bouclier, the chauffeur of party host Vic Huling, to kidnap Vic. The next morning the Milburns awake hung over to find Vic dead from a gunshot through the heart and his wife Bette missing. Tony calls his friend, district attorney Danny Harrison to investigate. Bette arrives with Billy Arliss at whose home she had slept. Because of their excessive drinking, no one <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> anything about what had happened the night before. As circumstantial evidence mounts against Tony, he calls in hypnotist Professor Karl Jones to help everyone try to recover their memories. Just as the professor is about to reveal the murderer, he is murdered.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of Bride, Laemmle was eager to put Whale to work on Dracula's Daughter (1936), the sequel to Universal's first big horror hit of the sound era. Whale, wary of doing two horror films {{in a row and}} {{concerned}} that directing Dracula's Daughter could interfere with his plans for the first all-sound version of Show Boat (previously filmed as a part-talkie by Harry A. Pollard), instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a novel called The Hangover Murders. The novel is a comedy-mystery in the style of The Thin Man, about a group of friends who were so drunk the night one of them was murdered that none <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> anything. Retitled Remember Last Night?, the film was one of Whale's personal favorites, but met with sharply divided reviews and commercial disinterest.|$|E
50|$|Several of {{the above}} {{problems}} are reduced by caching of verification results. In particular, systems that give no useful information (not rejecting at the RCPT TO time, have catch-all e-email, etc.) <b>can</b> be <b>remembered</b> and no future call backs to those systems need to be made. Also, results (positive or negative) for specific e-mail addresses <b>can</b> be <b>remembered.</b> MTAs like Exim have caching built in.|$|R

5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules is that everyone has to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the time machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E

5000|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} with Goldmine magazine, bassist John Taylor {{admitted that he}} was struggling with his drug addictions during recording of the album.

25|$|In 1967 Scott held a Fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford, {{where he}} contributed {{regularly}} to Alan Montefiore's politics seminar for postgraduates. Once, {{when he and}} Montefiore started talking at the same time, Scott carried on speaking with the amiable excuse : 'You <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> {{what you want to}} say longer than I can'.|$|E
25|$|When one is {{reminded}} of true beauty {{by the sight}} of a beautiful boy, he is called a lover. While all have seen reality, as they must have to be human, not all are so easily reminded of it. Those that <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> are startled when they see a reminder, and are overcome with the memory of beauty.|$|E
25|$|Resistance is often, at the least, understandably protective: As {{anyone who}} <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> {{her or his}} own first uneasy {{encounters}} with particularly challenging new theories or theorists can attest, resistance serves to shield us from uncomfortable shifts or all-out upheavals in perception and understanding-shifts in perception which, if honored, force us to inhabit the world in fundamentally new and different ways.|$|E

25|$|Elephants <b>Can</b> <b>Remember</b> {{was cited}} {{in a study}} done in 2009 using {{computer}} science to compare Christie's earlier works to her later ones. The sharp drops in vocabulary size and increases in repeated phrases and indefinite nouns suggested Christie may have been suffering from some form of onset dementia, perhaps what later became known as Alzheimer's disease. The subject of the book being memory may be another clue.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} {{conducted}} by the University of Chicago shows that bottlenose dolphins <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> whistles of other dolphins they'd lived with after 20 years of separation. Each dolphin has a unique whistle that functions like a name, allowing the marine mammals to keep close social bonds. This also shows that Dolphins see themselves and other Dolphins as distinct individuals. The new research shows that dolphins have the longest memory yet known in any species other than people.|$|E
25|$|Christie {{wrote the}} novel {{in the early}} 1940s, during World War II. Partly fearing for her own survival, and wanting to have a fitting end to Poirot's series of novels, Christie had the novel locked away in a bank vault for over thirty years. The final Poirot novel that Christie wrote, Elephants <b>Can</b> <b>Remember,</b> was {{published}} in 1972, followed by Christie's last novel, Postern of Fate. Christie authorised Curtains removal from the vault and subsequent publication. It {{was the last of}} her books to be published during her lifetime.|$|E
