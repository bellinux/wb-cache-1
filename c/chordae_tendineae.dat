25|$|Heart valve {{dysplasia}} (including mitral and {{tricuspid valve}} dysplasia) is a congenital heart abnormality in dogs. Dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves - {{also known as}} the atrioventricular (AV) valves - can appear as thickened, shortened, or notched valves. <b>Chordae</b> <b>tendineae</b> are also usually abnormal.|$|E
25|$|It {{may also}} be a result of tensing of the <b>chordae</b> <b>tendineae</b> during rapid filling and {{expansion}} of the ventricle. In other words, an S3 heart sound indicates increased volume of blood within the ventricle. An S3 heart sound is best heard with the bell-side of the stethoscope (used for lower frequency sounds). A left-sided S3 is best heard in the left lateral decubitus position and at the apex of the heart, which is normally located in the 5th left intercostal space at the midclavicular line. A right-sided S3 is best heard at the lower-left sternal border. The way to distinguish between a left and right-sided S3 is to observe whether it increases in intensity with inhalation or exhalation. A right-sided S3 will increase on inhalation, while a left-sided S3 will increase on exhalation.|$|E

2500|$|The first heart sound, or S1, {{forms the}} [...] "lub" [...] of [...] "lub-dub" [...] and is {{composed}} of components M1 (mitral valve closure) and T1 (tricuspid valve closure). Normally M1 precedes T1 slightly. It {{is caused by the}} [...] closure of the atrioventricular valves, i.e. tricuspid and mitral (bicuspid), at the beginning of ventricular contraction, or systole. When the ventricles begin to contract, so do the papillary muscles in each ventricle. The papillary muscles are attached to the cusps or leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves via <b>chordae</b> <b>tendineae</b> (heart strings). When the papillary muscles contract, the <b>chordae</b> <b>tendineae</b> become tense and thereby prevent the backflow of blood into the lower pressure environment of the atria. The <b>chordae</b> <b>tendineae</b> act a bit like the strings on a parachute, and allow the leaflets of the valve to balloon up into the atria slightly, but not so much as to evert the cusp edges and allow back flow of blood. It is the pressure created from ventricular contraction that closes the valve, not the papillary muscles themselves. The contraction of the ventricle begins just prior to AV valves closing and prior to the semilunar valves opening. The sudden tensing of the <b>chordae</b> <b>tendineae</b> and the squeezing of the ventricles against closed semilunar valves, sends blood rushing back toward the atria, and the parachute-like valves catch the rush of blood in their leaflets causing the valve to snap shut. The S1 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves. The delay of T1 even more than normally causes the split S1 which is heard in a right bundle branch blockage.|$|E
2500|$|In acute MI {{secondary}} to a mechanical {{defect in the}} heart (i.e., rupture of a papillary muscle or <b>chordae</b> <b>tendineae),</b> the treatment of choice is mitral valve surgery.

2500|$|The {{mitral valve}} {{apparatus}} comprises two valve leaflets, the mitral valve annulus, which forms a {{ring around the}} valve leaflets, and the papillary muscles, which tether the valve leaflets to the left ventricle and prevent them from prolapsing into the left atrium.

40|$|AbstractAcute mitral {{regurgitation}} (MR) is {{a frequent}} complication of acute myocardial infarction, with a variable presentation depending on the severity of MR {{and the integrity of}} the subvalvular apparatus. While most cases are asymptomatic or have mild dyspnea, rupture of <b>chordae</b> <b>tendinea</b> or papillary muscles are catastrophic complications that may rapidly lead to cardiogenic shock and death. Despite the presence of pulmonary edema and/or cardiogrenic shock, the murmur of acute MR is usually subtle due to rapid equalization of left atrial and left ventricular pressure gradient, and therefore misleading. Echocardiography is the definite diagnostic modality, allowing quantification of the severity of MR and the structural abnormalities within the subvalvular apparatus. Severe MR accompanied by rupture of chordae or papillary muscles should be managed with temporary stabilization with medical treatment or with mechanical circulatory support, with subsequent surgical intervention to repair or replace the valve...|$|R
40|$|Mitral {{regurgitation}} (MR) is {{a common}} valvular heart disease characterized by abnormal reversal of blood flow from the left ventricle (LV) into the left atrium (LA). Chronic severe MR has both pathophysiologic and clinical consequences. The pathophysiologic results of MR are volume overload and resultant LV and LA remodeling and subsequent impairment in LV function. If the severe MR is uncorrected {{it would lead to}} excess mortality and morbidity. Even in asymptomatic patients with severe MR eventually need surgery during their follow up to evade indisposed consequences like LV dysfunction, arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation and excess mortality rate. The timing of surgical intervention depends on the consequences of existing severe MR as that compared with surgical outcomes. The mitral valve apparatus is a complex anatomic and functional unit composed of the mitral annulus, valve leaflets, <b>chorda</b> <b>tendineae,</b> papillary muscles, and the underlying LV wall. Normal function depends on both normal anatomy of each of these components and on the overall three dimensional relationships of these structures to each other, including the effects of overall LV size, shape and systolic function. Diverse mechanisms of MR are associated with different clinical outcomes. In addition, medical or surgical treatment is directed at the specific mechanism of regurgitation in eac...|$|R

From January 2004 to June 2008, 11 patients underwent surgery for a suspected valvular tumor. Valvular tumor and tumor-like lesions accounted for 0. 32 % of adult cardiac operations. Five (45. 5 %) valvular lesions were papillary fibroelastomas, one (9. 1 %) was myxoma, 2 (18. 2 %) were organized thrombi, and 3 (27. 3 %) were calcification lesions. There was a total of 5 (45. 5 %) atrioventricular valve lesions, 4 arising from the atrial side of the leaflets, and one from the ventricular side. All 5 (45. 5 %) semilunar valvular lesions were from the aortic valve. One (9. 1 %) lesion originated from the <b>chorda</b> <b>tendinea</b> of the mitral valve. All leaflet lesions were resected by a simple shave technique, and all the patients recovered favorably. Valvular tumor and tumor-like lesions are rare.

40|$|The {{failure of}} mitral valve repair {{procedures}} {{revealed in the}} outcomes of the recent randomized studies is suggesting the necessity for {{a better understanding of}} the biomechanical mechanisms underlying the failure of the surgical approaches. Use of biomechanical modelling and finite element analysis (FEA) in cardiovascular research is an important aid in this context. In our group we developed a biomechanical model taking into account all the component of the mitral valve functional unit including the valve leaflets, the annulus, the papillary muscles, the <b>chordae</b> <b>tendinea</b> and the ventricular geometry. The two-dimensional mathematical model was capable to predict some of the actual geometrical and mechanical features of the valvular and subvalvular apparatuses in physiological and pathological conditions providing the engineering quantitative relations between closing and tethering forces and the mechanisms governing the mitral valve unit function. This model might further become patient-specific by means of 3 D reconstruction of clinical imaging. Images are first converted in a standard vector format (DICOM, etc.), then automatically translated in a "structural" finite element model and finally implemented in a finite element code. This allows for in silico simulations to virtually explore the effects of different surgical approaches at an early stage after the procedure, to help the operative decision processes, or to optimize the design of surgical implants...|$|R

40|$|Anomalies of the mitral subvalvular {{apparatus}} {{can include}} differing types of papillary muscles and chordae tendinae. Direct insertion of the anomalous papillary muscle or <b>chordae</b> <b>tendinea</b> into the anterior mitral leaflet and fusion to the ventricular septum are common findings {{related to these}} anomalies. Anomalous papillary muscles or chordae, especially those that insert directly into the mitral leaflets, {{play a role in}} obstructing left ventricular outflow by restricting the mobility of the leaflets and/or tethering them toward the septum, thus narrowing the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). The incidence of mitral valve anomalies associated with LVOT is probably underestimated. This topic is frequently studied, however, especially in the pediatric cardiac surgery milieu, because LVOT obstruction could have a surgical solution. We report a case of an 18 -year-old woman affected by epilepsy since 5 months of age who was found dead in her bedroom. An uncommon anomalous papillarymuscle/ chordaewas themain autopsy finding. This malformation causes direct continuity between an accessory papillary muscle and a mitral leaflet, resulting in a long rigid area that can cause dynamic latesystolic intraleft-ventricular obstruction.

To assess left ventricular (LV) regional myocardial dysfunction using STE in Duchenne muscular dystrophy model dogs (CXMD J) without overt clinical signs of heart failure. Methods Six affected dogs, 8 carrier dogs with CXMD J, and 8 control dogs were used. Conventional echocardiography, systolic and diastolic function by Doppler echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), and strain indices using STE, were assessed and compared among the 3 groups. Results Significant differences were seen in body weight, transmitral E wave and E' wave derived from TDI among the 3 groups. Although no significant difference was observed in any global strain indices, in segmental analysis, the peak radial strain rate during early diastole in posterior segment at <b>chordae</b> the <b>tendineae</b> level showed significant differences among the 3 groups. Conclusions The myocardial strain rate by STE served to detect the impaired cardiac diastolic function in CXMD J without any obvious LV dilation or clinical signs.

50|$|Each leaflet is {{composed}} of three layers of tissue: the atrialis, fibrosa, and spongiosa. Patients with classic mitral valve prolapse have excess connective tissue that thickens the spongiosa and separates collagen bundles in the fibrosa. This is due to an excess of dermatan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan. This weakens the leaflets and adjacent tissue, resulting in increased leaflet area and elongation of the <b>chordae</b> <b>tendineae.</b> Elongation of the <b>chordae</b> <b>tendineae</b> often causes rupture, commonly to the chordae attached to the posterior leaflet.

50|$|The <b>chordae</b> <b>tendineae</b> are {{attached}} to papillary muscles that cause tension to better hold the valve. Together, the papillary muscles and the <b>chordae</b> <b>tendineae</b> are known as the subvalvular apparatus. The function of the subvalvular apparatus {{is to keep the}} valves from prolapsing into the atria when they close. The subvalvular apparatus has no effect on the opening and closure of the valves, however, which is caused entirely by the pressure gradient across the valve. The peculiar insertion of chords on the leaflet free margin, however, provides systolic stress sharing between chords according to their different thickness.|$|E

50|$|These are the mitral and tricuspid valves, {{which are}} {{situated}} between the atria and the ventricles and prevent backflow from the ventricles into the atria during systole.

Thus, when the left ventricle contracts, the intraventricular pressure forces the valve to close, while the tendons keep the leaflets coapting together and prevent the valve from opening in the wrong direction (thus preventing blood to flow back to the left atrium).Each chord has a different thickness.
