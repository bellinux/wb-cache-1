5|$|Aside from Rock Steady Crew, several {{breaking}} <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> {{active in}} the 1970s such as Mighty Zulu Kings, Dynamic Rockers, New York City Breakers, SalSoul, Air Force Crew, Crazy Commanders Crew, Starchild La Rock, and Rockwell Association. In the same way b-boy <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> active {{on the east coast}} of the United States spreading breaking throughout New York, funk <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> also active on the west coast spreading the funk styles throughout California. Aside from The Lockers and The Electric Boogaloos, other funk styles crews such as Medea Sirkas/Demons of the Mind, Black Messengers, The Robot Brothers, The Go-Go Brothers, Granny and Robotroid, and Chain Reaction were active during the 1970s performing on stage.|$|E

5|$|The airline was {{established}} on October 5, 1990, as Japan Air Charter Co., Ltd. (JAZ), an 80 percent-owned low-cost charter subsidiary of Japan Airlines (JAL), to operate leisure flights to Asia-Pacific resort destinations from regional airports in Japan; {{in response to}} a Ministry of Transport policy. JAZ obtained its aircraft from JAL; its cockpit <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> American contract pilots based in Hawaii and its cabin <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> hired and based in Bangkok, where it operates a cabin crew training centre. JAZ obtained license to operate non-scheduled services on February 22, 1991 and operated its first charter flight from Fukuoka to Honolulu with a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 on July 1. The airline celebrated its 100,000th passenger on July 9, 1993, in a ceremony held in Sendai.|$|E

5|$|The {{race was}} {{sponsored}} {{for the first}} time by Aberdeen Asset Management, and both <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> competing for the Aberdeen Asset Trophy. It was the fiftieth anniversary of the BBC's coverage of the event and over the preceding five years had secured an average audience in excess of six million.|$|E
5|$|There were 43 rowers in Team GB, {{the most}} since {{qualifying}} quotas were introduced after the 1992 Summer Olympics. <b>Crews</b> <b>were</b> fielded in 12 {{out of a}} possible 14 events making Team GB the fourth biggest team. Medals were won in 6 events, which meant that GB topped the rowing medal table.|$|E
5|$|While {{defending}} the Oosterbeek perimeter three {{days into the}} battle, Baskeyfield commanded a pair of anti-tank guns that destroyed several enemy tanks before the <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> killed. Baskeyfield subsequently fired the guns alone before he too was killed. His body was not identified {{after the war and}} he has no known grave.|$|E

5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} {{the morale of the}} {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> assigned to the same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
5|$|Around 1,400 {{men of the}} Belgian {{fishing fleet}} had left for Britain after the Belgian surrender. Three Belgian {{trawlers}} even {{took part in the}} evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk, rescuing 4,300 British soldiers between them. Their ships and <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> put at the disposal of the Royal Navy, for coastal patrols and launching barrage balloons. From October 1940, many joined the RNSB.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} peace was {{completely}} restored in the city, {{the cost to}} the state for suppression of the mob was between $80,000 and $85,000. Later that year, the B agreed to a number of reforms: crewmen would not be called to work more than an hour before a train's departure, <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> to be paid a quarter of a day's pay if the train they were working was canceled, and passes were to be given for men working who had long layovers. In 1880, the B Employees Relief Association was established.|$|E

25|$|The 1989 tanker <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> {{half the}} size of the 1977 crew, worked 12- to 14-hour shifts, plus overtime. The <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> rushing to leave Valdez with a load of oil.|$|R
25|$|U-570s inexperienced <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> {{not unique}} for the time. British {{interrogation}} of rescued crew-members of —sunk {{on her first}} patrol in September 1941—revealed that 41 out of 48 <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> on their first war patrol.|$|R
5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions {{provoked}} a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to sequester the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, the <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> reduced to one-third of normal size.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{the only}} fully trained <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> pilots, other crew members being volunteers from skilled ground trades who {{underwent}} short courses in gunnery and bomb aiming. Pilots {{were responsible for}} navigation, and when accurate navigation was essential, a second pilot was carried. Early in 1936 the Air Navigation School had been formed at RAF Manston to take over this training for all pilots destined for Coastal and Bomber Commands. Conversion training for Flying Boats was also given there.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale sprang up which inflicted further damage to the battered ships and caused water to gush through the many shot holes in the ships' hulls. Aboard the Dutch ships, the situation was especially dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed aboard as prize <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed to the deck and huge quantities of water leaked into the hulls.|$|E
50|$|After scuttling the Ayesha, the <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> {{taken to}} Arabia to begin an {{overland}} trek {{that ended in}} Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire in May 1915. From there, the <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> {{able to return to}} Germany.|$|R
50|$|SS-Hauptsturmführer Michael Wittmann: Tiger tank ace, who {{along with}} his tank <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> informally buried in an unmarked site {{following}} their deaths on 8 August 1944. Rediscovered in 1983, the <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> re-interred at La Cambe.|$|R

5|$|Five crew residencies {{took place}} over the station's lifespan, in late 1977-early 1978, late 1978, mid-1979, mid-1980, and early 1981, {{including}} cosmonauts from Warsaw Pact countries {{as part of the}} Intercosmos programme. These <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> responsible for carrying out the primary missions of Salyut 6, including astronomy, Earth-resources observations and the study of the effect of spaceflight on the human body. Following the completion of these missions and the launch of its successor, Salyut 7, Salyut 6 was deorbited on 29 July 1982, almost five years after its launch.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was finally}} {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} try every possible method to stop Bomber Command's night offensive over Germany. The operation was sanctioned by the OKL in November. Secrecy of the operation was paramount. The problem of preparing a large number of crews produced security fears which was recognised clearly. When crews of NJG 3 and NJG 2 were called to a briefing on Gisela, they were locked behind guarded doors. The <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> told that all available night fighters would participate in an all-out attack against Bomber Command over their airfields in England. The tactical deployment for the operation, they were told, was for two waves of night fighters to cross the coast in the region of Hull. To avoid enemy radar raiders were told to fly at minimum altitude and then climb to 4,500 metres as they reached the coast, generally believed to be the average operating height of British bombers. The Luftwaffe Western Front Intelligence Summary Service prepared dossiers for crews to study. It advised on the layout of British airfields and the lighting systems, such as the Drem system, along with funnel lights and angle of glide indicators. <b>Crews</b> <b>were</b> warned about RAF lighting codes on the control towers which warned RAF bomber crews of a possible intruder in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Coastal Command's {{problems}} did not abate. Experienced <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> siphoned off to Malta, {{to undertake}} ASO against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. Hudson, Blenheim and Beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69, 28 and 20 aircrews by January 1942. The leftover crews, some 75 percent, were {{far off the}} 200 operational hours considered for a pilot to be experienced. Efficiency fell among squadrons. The mixing of experienced crews and the inexperienced damaged morale and accident rates increased.|$|E
5000|$|Kansas <b>Crew</b> <b>is</b> a rowing club in Lawrence, Kansas, United States. The club {{is located}} on a 5,000 m stretch of the Kaw River. Kansas <b>Crew</b> <b>was</b> first {{recognized}} by the University of Kansas in 1977.|$|R
50|$|After {{spending}} {{a number of}} days alone on the tiny islet, the <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> greeted by men from a village on a nearby island who arrived in canoes, having seen washed-up flotsam from the raft. The <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> taken back to the native village, where they were feted with traditional dances and other festivities. Finally the <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> taken off Raroia to Tahiti by the French schooner Tamara, with the salvaged Kon-Tiki in tow.|$|R
50|$|On 23 January 1968 the United States Navy ship USS Pueblo (AGER-2) was boarded and {{captured}} by the North Koreans. The ship and its <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> taken to the port at Wonsan and the <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> taken hostage.|$|R
5|$|In El Salvador, {{heavy rains}} from the {{depression}} helped alleviate drought conditions; however, flooding also inundated 200homes in San Salvador along the Acelhuate River. Fifteen farms were inundated by flooding, five {{of which were}} destroyed. Seventy people evacuated to shelters set up after the storm by the local Red Cross and armed forces. Military <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> quickly deployed to help clean up the damages on September22. Although it passed over Central America, there are no reports of damage or deaths in the region due to the tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|In Lee County, <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> {{deployed}} to collect plant debris. Due to storm damage, officials in Hernando County provided curbside debris removal, and two parks were closed. The post office in Cedar Key was damaged severely enough to remain closed for repairs until February, while the city hall {{has yet to}} reopen. In the meantime, city business has been conducted in a double-wide trailer near the city hall. In Franklin County, the St. George Island Bridge was reopened just 15hours after its closure to allow access to cleanup crews.|$|E
5|$|In their spare time, <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> able {{to catch}} up with work, observe the Earth below, respond to letters, {{drawings}} and other items brought from Earth (and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard Mir), or make use of the station's ham radio. Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} pieces of information provided by Johnson was how The Vario <b>Crew</b> <b>was</b> avoiding FBI wiretaps and bugs. The <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> using a parked trailer in a junkyard owned by Paul Vario in Brooklyn.|$|R
