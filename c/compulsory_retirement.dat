For much of that period, he was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. This was a time of rapid naval reform, and he insisted that the ships of the United States Navy should be as capable as those of Great Britain and France, the foremost navies in the world at that time. He also wrote a bill, and guided it through Congress, that provided for <b>compulsory</b> <b>retirement</b> of officers who did not meet the standards of the profession.|$|E

The ADF {{is one of the}} few areas of the Australian Government to continue to have <b>compulsory</b> <b>retirement</b> ages: permanent personnel must retire at 60 years of age and reservists at 65.

5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first <b>compulsory</b> <b>retirement</b> {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E

The second source of retirement is the age pension, which is a government paid pension that is funded by general taxation. The national pension can only be received after ten years of constant residence in Australia (Holzmann et al., 2005 : 10) and is thus unavailable for seasonal workers.|$|R

The empirical analysis is based on a 2005 nationally representative sample of 3437 government sector workers, ranging in age between 50 and 57 years. The study’s main findings are: the age of 55 is shown to be the age of choice for early retirement for both men and women; women are more likely to retire earlier than men; good health status is associated with longer stay in the job; women are more educated than men; the level of education is not a determining factor for women, but it is for men; men without a university degree are more likely to retire earlier than others with a university degree; men plan to work after their early retirement; the presence of the working wife has a positive effect on her husband’s decision to retire early, yet a working husband discourages his wife to retire early.
