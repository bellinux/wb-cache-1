5|$|The Defense <b>Communications</b> <b>Planning</b> Group's {{research}} and development program created an advanced technological system. Muscle Shoals would consist of three interdependent parts. First, there were air-dropped, battery-powered acoustic and seismic sensors. The camouflaged sensors were to be dropped in strings at predetermined geographical points along the PAVN logistical network. Once emplaced, they would serve as tripwires to any movement or activity along the system.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Chiefs and CINCPAC {{turned down}} the concept, believing that it would consume the efforts of too many troops and create a {{logistical}} nightmare. McNamara, however, was intrigued. Ignoring the military chiefs, he approached the Institute for Defense Analyses and requested that it fund {{a study of the}} concept. The project was then handed over to the Jason Division (also referred to as the Jason Group or Jason Committee), a group of 67 scientists who were to study and develop the technology necessary to make the physical/electronic barrier feasible. The group concentrated its efforts in three key areas: communications; data processing and display; and sensor development. On 15 September 1966, McNamara made Army General Alfred D. Starbird the head of the newly formed Defense <b>Communications</b> <b>Planning</b> Group (DCPG), which was to oversee the implementation of the program. The barrier concept was then given the designation Practice Nine. The DCPG's original mission profile, as of September 1966, was simply to implement the anti-infiltration system devised by the Jason Division. The original plan foresaw the deployment of both a physical barrier in addition to an air-supported barrier using various electronic sensors.|$|E

The Defense <b>Communications</b> <b>Planning</b> Group (DCPG) ran the secret development of seismic and acoustic sensors to detect truck traffic on the roads that made up the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos. It was also known as the Igloo White Project. The idea was the brainchild of the Scientific Advisory Board and embraced by Secretary of Defense Robert S.

Its purpose {{is to create a}} lively and stable downtown environment for visitors, Muncie citizens, and business owners. The MDDP partnered with Ball State's Cardinal Communications in 2010 for public relations, advertising, and graphic design needs. Cardinal Communications was able to conduct research and devise an integrated marketing <b>communications</b> <b>plan</b> for the MDDP. As of 2012, the MDDP was in need of a more simpler <b>communications</b> <b>plan</b> that was manageable and realistic for the small non-profit to successfully complete. This <b>communications</b> <b>plan</b> focused on simpler goals and strategies that the employees at MDDP could implement on their own. These goals focused on the non-profits identity as well as its communication strategies to target publics. The goals are a measurable way for the business to succeed. Each goal is aimed at a specific target audience accompanied by a specific key message for the audience. The strategies are suggestions on how to best complete the goal, while the tactics are ideas to complete the strategy. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

40|$|A merger/acquisition is a {{potentially}} disruptive {{time for an}} organization. This creative project presented an in-depth literature review related to the internal communications needs of a corporation engaged in a merger/acquisition. Following this review, an online survey of employees currently working for a Midwest company undergoing a merger/acquisition was distributed to gauge employee reactions to the types of communication used during this process and collect information on what types of communication employees prefer. Results suggest that a corporation must pay attention to not only the legal and financial aspects of the merger/acquisition, {{but also to the}} employee-related concerns that may emerge. Evidence presented within the scholarly research explains the ways in which a comprehensive internal <b>communications</b> <b>plan</b> can be used to address the informational needs of employees while maintaining relationship integrity. Together, survey results and a review of current research were used to formulate an internal <b>communications</b> <b>plan</b> and define the goals, objectives, strategies, and tactics necessary for its successful implementation. Developing a <b>communications</b> <b>plan</b> that empowers leaders to focus on two-way communication and preserve relationships is necessary for an organization to emerge successfully from a merger or acquisition.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to create an {{enhanced}} marketing <b>communications</b> <b>plan</b> for a local electricity seller Pori Energia Oy. With {{the help of the}} new plan, it was de-sired that Pori Energia would improve its company image and increase its clientele. In addition, possible new ways to store and follow-up the plan were considered. Pori Energia felt that their marketing <b>communications</b> <b>plan,</b> as it was at present, was not serving the company in the right way. Their current plan had some deficiencies that they wanted to overcome, such as poor usability. The company was interested to hear new ways it could do marketing and receive more visibility in the Satakunta region. The theoretical framework for the thesis was based on Raatikainen's (2004) starting point analyses, which included analyses about the market, company and competitors. Furthermore, a SWOT-matrix was constructed from the facts that were discovered through theory. Also, other theories that supported the starting point analyses were used during the process.
