40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} integrating an acoustic modem onto a Wave Glider {{with the goal of}} providing a bidirectional <b>communications</b> <b>gateway</b> for submerged sensors, platforms, and networks. The Wave Glider unmanned surface vehicle continuously harvests energy from the environment and is able to hold station without needing to refuel. A unique two-body architecture and wing system directly converts wave motion into thrust, and solar panels provide electricity for sensor payloads. Data messages are transmitted to shore via satellite, and the continuous surface presence means that data can be delivered in real time as it is collected. The objective of this thesis is to identify the best location for an acoustic modem on the Wave Glider, considering the factors of hydrodynamic drag on the vehicle and acoustic performance of the modem.

40|$|The {{recently}} developed wave glider {{has the potential}} to be an effective unmanned platform for acoustic ap-plications. We present the results of a variety of experiments that quantify this potential. The radiated self-noise of the autonomous platform is evaluated using an integrated passive acoustic recorder during a set of field trials off the coast of Hawaii. We present the radiated noise spectra from these trials to illustrate the dependence on hydrophone location and sea state. Using the same instrumentation, we demonstrate the ability of a modified wave glider to detect marine mammals using passive acoustic monitoring techniques. We also evaluate the performance of the wave glider operating as an active acoustic gateway, highlighting the potential of this platform to serve as a navigation reference and communications relay for scientific, in-dustrial, and military subsea assets. To demonstrate the potential of the wave glider platform to support acoustic navigation, we assess the performance of time-of-flight range estimation and seafloor transponder localization. These tests were performed using commercial off-the-shelf acoustic positioning hardware in-tegrated with the wave glider to illustrate that the low self-noise of the wave glider makes it possible to achieve acoustic positioning performance similar to previously reported results. Finally, we show that the glider can operate as a station-keeping surface <b>communications</b> <b>gateway</b> and provide recommendations for its use. C © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 1...|$|E
40|$|Gateways in sensor {{networks}} {{are used to}} relay, aggregate and communicate information from capillary networks to more capable (e. g. IP-based) networks. However Gateway-to-Gateway (G 2 G) communication to exchange and update information among the gateways in large-scale sensor networks for query processing, data fusion and other similar tasks has been less discussed in recent works. The requirements for large-scale sensor networks such as dynamic topology and update strategies to reduce the overall network load makes G 2 G communications an important aspect in the network design. In this paper, we introduce a mediated gossip-based G 2 G communication mechanism. The proposed solution leverages the publish/subscribe approach and uses high-level context assigned to publish/subscribe channels to enable the information discovery and G 2 G <b>communications.</b> <b>Gateways</b> store/aggregate sensor observation and measurement data according to specific context which is defined based on features such as spatial and temporal attributes, observed phenomena (i. e. feature of interest) and sensor device features. The gateways {{communicate with each other}} to exchange data and also to forward related queries for data aggregation in cases that the data should be aggregated from two different sources. The proposed solution also facilitates reliable sensor service provisioning by enabling gateways to communicate and/or forward requests to other gateways when a resource fails or a sensor node becomes unavailable. We compare our results to probabilistic gossiping algorithms and run benchmarks on different dynamic network topologies based on indicators such as number of sent messages and dissemination delay...|$|R
