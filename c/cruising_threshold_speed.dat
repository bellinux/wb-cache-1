40|$|LectureTilting pads {{journal bearing}} (TPJB) force {{coefficients}} are usually {{evaluated by the}} Lund approach where pad degrees of freedom are reduced {{to those of the}} shaft (8 Synchronous Reduced Coefficients), therefore for each shaft perturbation pads are assumed to simultaneously response. This assumption might not remain valid {{in the presence of a}} particular combination of rotor-bearings system and operating condition. In such systems pad inertia leads to a phase delay between the same pad and shaft movement. Depending on the rotor-bearing system the synchronous reduced assumption may not be accurate to identify the instability <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> and an explicit modeling of pad dynamic (degree of freedom) has to be incorporated into the rotordynamic analysis. The synchronous reduced method is still accurate in the determination of <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> for current turbomachine technology. For future advanced challenging applications the understanding and definition of the applicability of the reduced method is necessary. The predicted sub-synchronous instability (negative logarithmic decrement) presented in this paper are calculated by introducing in the finite element model (beam elements) additional nodes (respect to shaft generalized coordinates) at bearing locations to represent the pads degrees of freedom. The calculations were repeated to predict the instability <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> using the classical Lund approach and it has been verified that using this method the instability <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> is over predicted with respect to those obtained in the above mentioned analysis. The comparison of the calculations highlights the important difference in the <b>speed</b> <b>threshold</b> values given by the two methods for the system considered. A development activity has been performed to test a configuration of rotor-bearings system of high peripheral speed (> 75 m/s) and large bearing diameter (> 180 mm) verifying the tools prediction capability. The scope of this work is to compare experimental observed sub-synchronous vibration (instability <b>threshold</b> <b>speed)</b> with the predictions in order to consolidate the reliability of the method. To enforce the validation the same test are repeated with different TPJB designs in order to test different bearing configurations in terms of micro-geometry, pad arc length, pivot stiffness etc...|$|R

Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has been applied for reducing the energy consumption by dynamically changing the supply voltage. One can apply an adaptive scheme by computing a <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> of the supplied voltage, and adopting greedy online DVS scheduling algorithm when the voltage exceeds the threshold while choosing a conservative speed on the contrary.

Introduction. In real-time systems, power-aware design is applied to save energy or extend the battery lifetime. Two methods are applied to manage the power supply of real-time systems, which are dynamic power management (DPM) and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). The dynamic energy consumption of a system can be reduced by means of DVS, a technique that changes the supply voltage according to the processor’s workloads assumption.

40|$|In the authors’ {{previous}} report two models {{were presented to}} bump foil journal bearings and the assembly preload was shown to influence the maximum load capacity of the bearing. One model corresponds to the bearing with an excessive static friction between the top and bump foils {{and the other to}} the bearing without friction. This study aims at predicting the stability <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> and whirl frequency ratio of a horizontal rigid rotor supported in the bearings, by applying the frequency response method. The following results are obtained. Relatively small deformation of the top foil with the excessive friction contributes to little change in the stability <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> of the rotor-bearing system when comparing with that of the circular bearing. On the contrary the compliance of the top foil with no friction can change the speed, because it forms a relatively steep wedge in the steady-state equilibrium while it smoothens the wedge when the air film pressure is fluctuated by the small oscillation of the journal. Stability charts standardized by the mean radial clearance in the assembled bearing clearly show that the large assembly preload results in a decrease in stability <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> of the bearing with no friction...|$|R

These properties are controlled by meteorological factors. A method is proposed that relates the <b>threshold</b> wind <b>speed</b> for the initiation of snow transport to standard surface meteo-rological observations. A complete dataset on the hourly threshold condition for snow transport as determined from visual observation was developed for 16 stations on the prairies of western Canada over six winters.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The thesis presents the results of the experiments that were conducted on short and long fluid film bearings with a simple single disk rotor. The behavior of the journal was analyzed as function of the rotor system parameters such as the load, speed and imbalance mass. It was verified that the journal bearing can lose stability through either a subcritical or a supercritical bifurcation. In the supercritical bifurcation, the expected gradual increase in the amplitude of the limit cycle was observed, while in the subcritical bifurcation there was a sudden jump to a large limit cycle. In the case of a subcritical bifurcation, it was also observed that the journal bearing became unstable below the rotor <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> of instability, following a small perturbation applied to the rotor. Demarcations were made for the stable regions of operation (region where the rotor is stable below the <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> of instability) for the journal bearing based on the obtained experimental results.

We try to show as simply as possible under what conditions thermal effects contribute to the destabilization of strongly field-aligned (zero aspect angle) Farley-Buneman modes. We show that destabilization can arise from a combination of (1) a reduction in pressure gradients associated with temperature fluctuations that are out of phase with density fluctuations, and (2) thermal diffusion, which takes the electrons from regions of enhanced temperatures to regions of negative temperature fluctuations, and therefore enhanced densities.

40|$|Fluid-induced {{instability}} of a rotor-bearing system occurs frequently in rotating machinery. This involves {{two types of}} instability, i. e., fluid whirl and whip. Whirl is a predominately rigid-body mode and tracks at around one-half shaft running <b>speed.</b> Its <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> can be arbitrarily raised by using externally-pressurized fluid bearings, which allow for adjustable pressure for high stiffness. Whip is mainly a rotor-bending mode and locks into the rotor natural frequency. It appears when increases in bearing stiffness no longer influence the instability threshold. As demonstrated both analytically and experimentally in this paper, however, use of an externally-pressurized gas seal in the mid-span of the rotor can successfully eliminate whip. Its <b>threshold</b> <b>speed</b> can be greatly raised beyond running speed by adding the mid-span seal, to nearby the antinode of the rotor-bending mode. An experimental rig was operated at speed up to 10, 000 rpm, far above the rotor natural frequency of less than 2000 rpm without the seal. Gas supply pressure could be adjusted to yield stiffness required for eliminating whip, which would otherwise appear even with an externally pressurized fluid bearing at the shaft end.
