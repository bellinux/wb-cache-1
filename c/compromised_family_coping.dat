40|$|Purpose:This {{study was}} to test a {{theoretical}} model examining the relationships among social support, illness demands, marital adjustment, <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> and <b>family</b> functioning in couples {{more than three years}} after breast cancer diagnosis. Methods: A causal modeling methodology was used to test the specified relationships in the recursive theoretical model. A total of 60 couples with breast cancer were recruited from January to April 2005. Five standardized question-naires were used to measure the theoretical concepts: social support (ISSB), illness demands (DOII), marital adjust-ment (DAS), <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> (F-COPES), and <b>family</b> functioning (FACESII). Results: Path analysis results from the wives and the husbands revealed different patterns. Three hypotheses were supported in the wife model as predicted: social support and <b>family</b> <b>coping,</b> <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> and <b>family</b> functioning, and social support and marital adjustment (trend). Five hypotheses were supported in the husband model as predicted: social support and illness demands, also social support and marital adjustment, illness demands and marital adjustment, marital adjustment and <b>family</b> <b>coping,</b> and <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> and <b>family</b> functioning. Conclusion: This study provides valuable information for developing various interven-tions with social support for improving family functioning of breast cancer couples in the middle adaption stage (mor...|$|R
40|$|Background Psoriasis is {{an incurable}} and chronic disease that {{includes}} unpredictable periods of remission and relapse requiring long-term therapy. Purpose This paper {{focuses on the}} relationship among <b>family</b> <b>coping,</b> psychological morbidity, body image, dyadic adjustment {{and quality of life}} in psoriatic patients and their partners. Method One hundred and one patients with psoriasis and 78 partners comprised the sample. They were regular users of the Dermatology Service of a Central Northern hospital in Portugal and a private dermatology clinic. Patients with psoriasis were assessed on anxiety, depression, body image, quality of life, dyadic adjustment and <b>family</b> <b>coping.</b> Partners were assessed on the same measures except body image and quality of life. Results A positive relationship among dyadic adjustment, psychological morbidity and <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> in patients and their partners was found. Also, patients with lower levels of quality of life had partners with higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms. Better dyadic adjustment predicted <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> in the psoriatic patient. High levels of dyadic adjustment in patients and low partners’ trait anxiety predicted better dyadic adjustment in partners. Conclusion The results highlight the importance of incorporating family variables in psychological interventions in psoriasis’ care, particularly <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> and dyadic adjustment as well as the need for psychological intervention to focus both on patients and partners...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Despite {{substantial}} evidence that problem gambling {{is associated with}} a wide range of family difficulties, limited effort has been devoted to studying the negative impacts on family members as a result of problem gambling and how they cope and function under the impacts of problem gambling in Chinese communities. Among the very few Chinese-specific gambling-related family impact studies, none have examined how gambling-related <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> responses are related to gambling-related family impacts. Based on a sample of treatment-seeking Chinese family members of problem gamblers, this study aimed to explore: (1) the demographic characteristics and health and psychological well-being of the family members; (2) the gambling-related family member impacts (active disturbance, worrying behavior); (3) the <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> strategies (engaged, tolerant-inactive and withdrawal coping); (4) the relationship between gambling-related family member impacts, psychological distress and <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> strategies. It was hypothesized that positive significant relationships would be found between family member impacts, psychological distress and <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> strategies. From March 2011 to February 2012, a total of 103 family members of problem gamblers who sought help from Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Even Centre in Hong Kong were interviewed. Results showed that a majority of family members were partners or ex-partners of the gambler with low or no income. A large proportion of participants reported moderate to high psychological distress (72. 6  %), poor to fair general health (60. 2  %), and poor to neither good nor bad quality of life (61. 1  %). Family member impacts were positively significantly correlated to all <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> strategies and psychological distress. Tolerant-inactive coping had the strongest relationships with family member impacts and psychological distress. Strong relationships between family member impacts and psychological distress were also found. The results provide preliminary support for aspects of the stress–strain–coping–support model in the Chinese culture. It is suggested that family member-specific treatment groups targeting <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> are required to alleviate the level of negative impacts of gambling disorder on family members...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{relationship}} between conjugal support, <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> behaviours and the well-being of the elderly couple. A multistage sample of 135 couples, 65 years and over, was drawn from users of the health and social system, as well as from non-service users, in a large metropolitan area. Data were collected through home visits. A series of questionnaires to measure conjugal support, <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> behaviours, three indicators of well-being (self-assessed health, life satisfaction and marital satisfaction), and selected control variables were presented in interview format separately to each marital partner by two interviewers. Data analysis was performed on individual and couple data. Results revealed significant positive correlations between availability and reciprocity of conjugal support and well-being of both marital partners and a negative association between conflict within the conjugal relationship and well-being of husbands and wives. Only two cognitive <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> strategies, reframing and avoidance of passive appraisal, were positively related to the well-being of both partners. External <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> strategies related to seeking help outside the elderly dyad were not associated with well-being. Paired t-tests revealed that husbands tended to perceive more support from their spouse and to be more satisfied with their marital life than wives. Wives more than husbands perceived the couple to use more external social support and spiritual support. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that congruency of perception between husbands and wives had an effect on the well-being of the wives only. A path model in which conjugal support has direct and indirect effects on well-being through cognitive <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> strategies is proposed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} caregiving stress, <b>family</b> <b>coping,</b> spirituality/religiosity, and hope on the marital satisfaction of family caregivers who provide care for their aging parent(s). The goal {{of this study was}} to gain a more complete understanding of the marital satisfaction of family caregivers based on a strength-based framework of family resiliency. Previous research has identified a relationship between the caregiving experience and coping, spirituality/religiosity, and hope, but no study to date has investigated the effect of those variables on the marital satisfaction of family caregivers. It was hypothesized that family caregivers who are spiritual/religious, hopeful, and use effective <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> strategies would experience greater marital satisfaction. A hierarchical linear regression analyzing data from 191 family caregivers revealed that caregiving stress, spirituality/religiosity, and use of effective <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> strategies significantly predicted marital satisfaction. The importance of these findings to family caregivers and the implications for clinicians working with this population are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{potential}} relationship between <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> and <b>family</b> dynamics and their association with relationship outcomes for adults who were bullied as children. Previous research has focused on bullied children mainly in terms of the school environment and long term impacts in regards to individuals. However little research has been done on how family response to bullying may help or further harm bullied children. Ninety-three participants were recruited and completed a demographic questionnaire, Family Crisis Oriented Evaluation Scale, Family Functioning Scale, Miller Social Intimacy Scale, and Adolescent Peer Relations Scale. A regression analysis was run to assess the predictor value of <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> skills and <b>family</b> dynamics on adult peer relationships. While the model was found to be significant, the significant predictor was gender, not <b>family</b> <b>coping</b> or functioning. Correlations were run to assess the relationship between victimization rates and adult peer relationship. A positive correlation was found between level of verbal bullying experienced and adult peer relationships. These findings are discussed in terms of resilience literature, clinical implications, and future directions for research. ...|$|R
