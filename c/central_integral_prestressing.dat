40|$|The authors study {{solutions}} to the backward Boltzmann transport equation (BBTE) specialized to equations governing moments {{of the distribution of}} ions implanted into amorphous targets. A <b>central</b> moment <b>integral</b> equation set has been derived starting from the classical plane source BBTE for non-central moments. A full generator equation is provided to allow construction of equation sets of an arbitrary size, thus allowing computation of moments of arbitrary order. A BBTE solver program has been written that uses the residual correction technique proposed by Winterbon (1970). A simple means is presented to allow direct incorporation of Biersack's two-parameter 'magic formula' into a BBTE solver program. Results for non-central and <b>central</b> moment <b>integral</b> equation sets are compared with Monte Carlo simulations, using three different formulae for the mean free flight path between collisions. Comparisons are performed for the ions B and As, implanted into the target a-Si, over the energy range 1 keV- 1 MeV. The <b>central</b> moment <b>integral</b> equation set is found to have superior convergence properties to the non-central moment equation set. For As ions implanted into a-Si, at energies below approximately 30 keV, significant differences are observed, for third- and fourth-order moments, when using alternative versions for the mean free flight path. Third- and fourth-order moments derived using one- and two-parameter scattering mechanisms also show significant differences over the same energy range...|$|R
40|$|At-speed {{testing has}} emerged as {{dominant}} test requirement {{in the era of}} high speed microprocessors. Since the conventional testing techniques prove to be incompetent, Instruction-Based Self-Testing (IBST) has been proposed as an effective alternate to those conventional techniques for at-speed testing of high performance microprocessors. The Superscalar architectures, with vast functionality and exceptionally high speed have become the <b>central</b> <b>integral</b> part of modern high speed digital systems. However, testing superscalar microprocessors using this approach faces serious challenges, due to the out-of-order execution with multiple functional units and in-order commit behaviour. This paper discusses the test program generation procedure (template based) for multiple identical functional units in a superscalar architecture. Procedures for delay fault testing, which make sure that generated test vectors are applied in the correct order to test each testable path, are developed.

40|$|AbstractWe {{develop an}} {{arithmetic}} of complete permutations of symmetric, integral bases; this arithmetic {{is comparable to}} that of perfect systems of difference sets with which there are several interrelations. Super-position of permutations provides the addition of this arithmetic. Addition if facilitated by complete permutations with a certain “splitting” property, allowing them to be pulled apart and reassembled. The split permutations also provide a singular direct product for complete permutations in conjunction with the multiplication (direct product) of the arithmetic which itself derives from that for perfect systems of difference sets. We pay special attention to complete permutations satisfying constraints both fixed and variable; this is equivalent to embedding partial complete permutations in complete permutations. In the sequel, using this arithmetic, we investigate the spectra of certain constraints with respect to <b>central</b> <b>integral</b> bases which are of interest for the purpose of giving further constructions either of complete permutations with constraints or of irregular, extremel perfect systems of difference sets...|$|R

We use this to complete the computation of Goldie ranks for primitive ideals with <b>integral</b> <b>central</b> character for all special nilpotent orbits but one (in E_ 8).

40|$|AbstractThe {{cytochrome}} bc 1 complex (ubiquinone:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) is the <b>central</b> <b>integral</b> {{membrane protein}} in the mitochondrial respiratory chain {{as well as}} the electron-transfer chains of many respiratory and photosynthetic prokaryotes. Based on X-ray crystallographic studies of cytochrome bc 1, a mechanism has been proposed in which the extrinsic domain of the iron–sulfur protein first binds to cytochrome b where it accepts an electron from ubiquinol in the Qo site, and then rotates by 57 ° to a position close to cytochrome c 1 where it transfers an electron to cytochrome c 1. This review describes the development of a ruthenium photooxidation technique to measure key electron transfer steps in cytochrome bc 1, including rapid electron transfer from the iron–sulfur protein to cytochrome c 1. It was discovered that this reaction is rate-limited by the rotational dynamics of the iron–sulfur protein rather than true electron transfer. A conformational linkage between the occupant of the Qo ubiquinol binding site and the rotational dynamics of the iron–sulfur protein was discovered which could {{play a role in the}} bifurcated oxidation of ubiquinol. A ruthenium photoexcitation method is also described for the measurement of electron transfer from cytochrome c 1 to cytochrome c.

40|$|Spores of Bacillus subtilis {{require the}} GerAA, GerAB, and GerAC {{receptor}} proteins for L-alanine-induced germination. Mutations in gerAA, both random and site directed, result in phenotypes that identify amino acid residues important for receptor function in broad terms. They highlight the functional importance of two {{regions in the}} <b>central,</b> <b>integral</b> membrane domain of GerAA. A P 324 S substitution in the first residue of a conserved PFPP motif results in a 10 -fold increase in a spore’s sensitivity to alanine; a P 326 S change results in the release of phase-dark spores, in which the receptor may be in an “activated ” or “quasigerminated” state. Substitutions in residues 398 to 400, in a short loop between the last two likely membrane-spanning helices of this central domain, all affect the germination response, with the G 398 S substitution causing a temperature-sensitive defect. In others, there are wider effects on the receptor: if alanine is substituted for conserved residue N 146, H 304, or E 330, a severe defect in L-alanine germination results. This correlates with the absence of GerAC, suggesting that the assembly or stability of the entire receptor complex has been compromised by the defect in GerAA. In contrast, severely germination-defective mutants such as E 129 K, L 373 F, S 400 F, and M 409 N mutants retain GerAC at normal levels, suggesting more local and specific effects on the function of GerAA itself. Further interpretation will depend on progress in struc-tural analysis of the receptor proteins...|$|R

40|$|Finite W-algebras {{are certain}} {{associative}} algebras arising in Lie theory. Each W-algebra is constructed {{from a pair}} of a semisimple Lie algebra g (our base field is algebraically closed and of characteristic 0) and its nilpotent element e. In this paper we classify finite dimensional irreducible modules with <b>integral</b> <b>central</b> character over W-algebras. In more detail, in a previous paper the first author proved that the component group A(e) of the centralizer of the nilpotent element under consideration acts on the set of finite dimensional irreducible modules over the W-algebra and the quotient set is naturally identified with the set of primitive ideals in U(g) whose associated variety is the closure of the adjoint orbit of e. In this paper for a given primitive ideal with <b>integral</b> <b>central</b> character we compute the corresponding A(e) -orbit. The answer is that the stabilizer of that orbit is basically a subgroup of A(e) introduced by G. Lusztig.
