50|$|Typical {{oxidizing}} agents undergo permanent chemical alteration through covalent or ionic reaction chemistry, {{resulting in the}} complete and irreversible transfer {{of one or more}} electrons. In many chemical circumstances, however, the transfer of electronic charge from an electron donor may be only fractional, meaning an electron is not completely transferred, but results in an electron resonance between the donor and acceptor. This leads to the formation of charge transfer complexes in which the components largely retain their <b>chemical</b> <b>identities.</b>|$|R

For priority setting, water pollution risks by biocides were evaluated based on potential environmental emissions {{as well as on}} environmental behaviour and ecotoxic effects.|$|R
25|$|Equilibria {{are defined}} for {{specific}} crystal phases. Therefore, the solubility product {{is expected to}} be different depending on the phase of the solid. For example, aragonite and calcite will have different solubility products even though they have both the same <b>chemical</b> <b>identity</b> (calcium carbonate). Under any given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable precipitate (e.g. aragonite), which is then said to be in a metastable state.|$|E
25|$|Isomerism caused much consternation {{to early}} researchers, since isomers have {{exactly the same}} composition, but differ in {{configuration}} (arrangement) of the atoms. For example, there was much speculation for the <b>chemical</b> <b>identity</b> of benzene, until the correct structure was described by Friedrich August Kekulé. Likewise, the idea of stereoisomerism - that atoms have rigid three-dimensional structure and can thus form isomers that differ only in their three-dimensional arrangement - was another crucial step in understanding the concept of distinct chemical substances. For example, tartaric acid has three distinct isomers, a pair of diastereomers with one diastereomer forming two enantiomers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry devices, an LC-MS system contains an interface that efficiently transfers the separated components from the LC column into the MS ion source. The interface is necessary because the LC and MS devices are fundamentally incompatible. While the mobile phase in a LC system is a pressurized liquid, the MS analyzers commonly operate under vacuum (around 10−6 torr). Thus, {{it is not possible}} to directly pump the eluate from the LC column into the MS source. Overall, the interface is a mechanically simple part of the LC-MS system that [...] transfers the maximum amount of analyte, removes a significant portion of the mobile phase used in LC and preserves the <b>chemical</b> <b>identity</b> of the chromatography products (chemically inert). As a requirement, the interface should not interfere with the ionizing efficiency and vacuum conditions of the MS system. Nowadays, most extensively applied LC-MS interfaces are based on atmospheric pressure ionization (API) strategies like electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI).These interfaces became available in the 1990s after a two decade long research and development process.|$|E

In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of T.mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by the species Cryptococcus laurentii. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them. Subsequently, researchers chemically synthesized the polysaccharide, and determined the <b>chemical</b> <b>identities</b> of the component sugar units. The polysaccharide, known as glucuronoxylomannan—produced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions—has been shown to consist of a mannan backbone that is glycosylated with xylan chains in a regular repeating structure.

40|$|Molecular tips in {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy can directly detect intermolecular electron tunneling between {{sample and}} tip molecules and reveal the tunneling facilitation through chemical interactions that provide overlap of respective electronic wave functions, that is, hydrogen-bond, metal-coordination-bond, and charge-transfer interactions. Nucleobase molecular tips were prepared by chemical modification of underlying metal tips with thiol derivatives of adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil and the outmost single nucleobase adsorbate probes intermolecular electron tunneling to or from a sample nucleobase molecule. We found that the electron tunneling between a sample nucleobase and its complementary nucleobase molecular tip was much facilitated compared with its noncomplementary counterpart. The complementary nucleobase tip was thereby capable of electrically pinpointing each nucleobase.

The approach records a prototypical pattern of peaks with retention times and associated metadata, such as <b>chemical</b> <b>identities</b> and classes, in a template.

For the small solute, the fluctuations around the mean values of observables are not negligible and the probability distribution P(r) of the state space depends on the intricate details of {{the interaction of the}} solute with the solvent. Here, we employ a superstatistical approach: P(r) is expressed as a marginal distribution summed over the variation in β, the inverse temperature of the solute. The joint distribution P(β,r) is estimated by maximizing its entropy. We also calculate the first order system-size corrections to the canonical ensemble description of the state space. We test the development on a simple harmonic oscillator interacting with two baths with very different <b>chemical</b> <b>identities</b> viz. a) Lennard-Jones particles and b) water molecules.

This large amount of data allows for the identification of microstructural features in a sample, such as grain or heterophase boundaries, if the feature density is large enough. Correlation of the measured atomic positions with these identified features results in an atom-by-atom description of the chemical environment of crystal-lographic defects. This article outlines a data compilation technique for the generation of composition profiles in the vicinity of interfaces in a geometrically independent way.

The non-polar fraction was inductive to larval attachment and was thus further fractionated using HPLC. Bioassay-guided fractionation was used to locate the active compounds that were then structurally characterized by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Two inductive compounds were identified, a hydrocarbon (6, 9 -heptadecadiene) and a fatty acid (12 -octadecenoic acid), which are the first chemical cues inductive to larval attachment of marine invertebrates isolated from natural biofilms. © Inter-Research 2009. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The dauer larva is a {{specialized}} dispersal {{stage in the}} nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the animal to survive starvation {{for an extended period}} of time. The dauer does not feed, but uses chemosensation to identify new food sources and to determine whether to resume reproductive growth.

We find that bacterial fatty acids in the environment augment recovery from the dauer stage under permissive conditions. The effect of increased fatty acids on different dauer constitutive mutants indicates a role for insulin peptide secretion in coordinating recovery from the dauer stage in response to fatty acids. These data suggest that worms can sense the presence of fatty acids in the environment and that elevated levels can promote recovery from dauer arrest.

Measurements of products having mole fractions ranging from 10 − 14 to − 11 were carried out with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (the Cluster CIMS). Most products that were correlated with number concentrations of the smallest particles measured (10 – 20 nm) had molecular weights in the 430 – 560 amu range.
