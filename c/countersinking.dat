60|$|About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two {{lanterns}} {{of sperm}} oil, Stubb stoutly {{stood up to}} his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness. The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within {{a few inches of}} the sleepers' hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in <b>countersinking</b> for a screw.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the study and {{comparison}} of stress intensity factor solutions for cracks emanating from <b>countersunk</b> holes in a plate subjected to remote tension and bending moments. To explore {{the difference in the}} crack behavior at a straight-shank and <b>countersunk</b> rivet hole, models of holes with different shapes at various ratios of <b>countersunk</b> depth to plate thickness were generated, in which there were two extreme cases of <b>countersunk</b> holes: knife edge hole and straight-shank hole. The stress intensity factor solutions for cracks at the <b>countersunk</b> holes were predicted using the FEM-BEM alternating technique. The FEM-BEM alternating method, which is described in this paper, was verified by carrying out a study of the stress intensity factor for a crack at a straight-shank hole. A range of crack shapes and sizes under remote tension and bending moments were analyzed. The results from the crack analyses revealed that the crack behavior is considerably different at the <b>countersunk</b> holes with different <b>countersunk</b> depths.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} conducted into the damage progression {{and strength of}} bolted joints with fibre-reinforced composite laminates and <b>countersunk</b> fasteners. The main goal of the experimental investigation is to characterise {{the effect of the}} <b>countersink</b> geometry on the load-carrying capacity of single lap joints in comparison to the straight-shank case. The effects of bolt torque, clearance and <b>countersink</b> height ratio on the damage progression and joint strength are also studied. Experimental tests and detailed microscopy studies are conducted on a bearing test specimen with a straight-edged hole, and several single-lap joint configurations with <b>countersunk</b> fasteners. It is found that introduction of the <b>countersunk</b> hole roughly halves the bearing stress, and causes delamination for some configurations. This delamination is primarily located {{at the start of the}} <b>countersink</b> region, though is found to be triggered by other damage mechanisms and has only minor influence on the results. Bolt torque increases the density of through-thickness damage though limits its extension from the hole edge, whilst bolt clearance causes localisation of the damage region. Increasing the ratio of the <b>countersink</b> depth to the laminate thickness reduces the extent of bearing and promotes bending, with a change to net section failure at large ratios...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{investigation}} into the effect of <b>countersunk</b> depth, plate thickness, <b>countersunk</b> angle and plate width on the stress concentration around <b>countersunk</b> hole is carried out {{with the help of}} finite element analysis. The variation of stress concentration with respect to these parameters is studied for three types of loading viz. uniformly distributed load, uniformly varying load and functionally distributed load. The results of the finite element analysis are interpreted and some conclusions are drawn. The distribution of stress concentration around <b>countersunk</b> hole in isotropic plates simply supported at all the edges is found similar and is independent of loading. The maximum stress concentration also occurs at a particular point irrespective of the loading conditions...|$|R

40|$|Single-lap, carbon-epoxy joints with <b>countersunk</b> {{fasteners}} were modelled {{using the}} nonlinear finite element code Abaqus. A highly-detailed {{analysis of the}} stress distribution at the <b>countersunk</b> hole boundary is provided. Bolt-hole clearance, which arises due to limitations in manufacturing capabilities, is modelled extensively. Clearance levels {{both inside and outside}} typical aerospace fitting tolerances are studied and the finite element model is validated with experimental data. Plots of radial stress in each ply of the <b>countersunk</b> laminate show the load transfer to be severely localised, with only a few plies bearing the majority of the load. The inclusion of clearance in the model was shown to result in far higher radial stresses compared to those in the neat-fit joint model. An associated loss in joint stiffness of more than 10 % was recorded for the highest clearance considered (240 mu m). Finally compressive through-thickness stresses are shown to be present at the damageable region of the <b>countersunk</b> hole, and increase with bolt-hole clearance. These compressive stresses, which are an indicator of lateral constraint, are seen to suppress "brooming" failure in the <b>countersunk</b> laminate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

50|$|Form <b>{{countersink}}ing,</b> {{also known}} as dimpling, is a countersink that is formed into sheet metal to increase {{the strength of a}} structure as the countersinks of multiple pieces nest together. There are two processes for producing formed countersinks: coin dimpling and modified radius dimpling. Such dimples in fairly thick sheet can even be tapped to yield a threaded hardpoint on the sheet without the bother and expense of welding a nut to the sheet. This style of construction is often seen in modern household appliance design, because it allows the product to be lower-priced, and the quality can still be good as long as the sheet is thick enough.|$|E
50|$|A drill {{is a tool}} {{fitted with}} a cutting tool {{attachment}} or driving tool attachment, usually a drill bit or driver bit, used for boring holes in various materials or fastening various materials together. The attachment is gripped by a chuck {{at one end of}} the drill and rotated while pressed against the target material. The tip, and sometimes edges, of the cutting tool does the work of cutting into the target material. This may be slicing off thin shavings (twist drills or auger bits), grinding off small particles (oil drilling), crushing and removing pieces of the workpiece (SDS masonry drill), <b>countersinking,</b> counterboring, or other operations.|$|E
5000|$|Chinese elm {{heartwood}} ranges in tone from reddish brown {{to light}} tan or flesh coloured, while the sapwood approaches off-white. The grain is often handsome and dramatic. Unlike other elms, freshly cut Chinese elm has a peppery or spicy odour. While it turns easily {{and will take}} a nice polish off the lathe without any finish, and it holds detail well, the fibrous wood is usually considered too tough for carving or hand tools. Chinese elm contains silica which is hard on planer knives and chainsaws, but it sands fairly easily. Like other woods with interlocking grain, planes should be kept extra sharp to prevent tearing at the grain margins. It steam-bends easily, holds screws well but pilot holes and <b>countersinking</b> are needed. It {{tends to be a}} [...] "lively" [...] wood, tending to warp and distort while drying.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the bolt clampup force relaxation behavior in <b>countersunk,</b> single-lap bolted joints between glass/vinylester resin laminates and steel panels. Additionally, the effect of bolt clampup force relaxation on the bearing strength of such joints was studied. Specially-instrumented bolts were used to measure clampup force relaxation in ten <b>countersunk</b> joint specimens. A 100, 000 pound capacity MTS testing machine {{was used to evaluate}} the bearing strength in tension of sixteen <b>countersunk</b> bolted joint specimens torqued to four different levels of initial torque, as well as four similar protruding-head bolted joint specimens (at the same levels of torque). The results of the relaxation experiments indicate that clampup force varies widely in nominally identical joints at identical torque levels, by as much as a factor of two. In <b>countersunk</b> bolt joints with sufficiently high initial clampup force, the clampup force relaxed in accordance with the inverse power equation proposed by Shivakumar and Crews for protruding-head bolt joints in graphite/epoxy laminates. Relaxation in the present experiments proceeded faster than in the protruding-head joints studied by Shivakumar and Crews; this {{is believed to have been}} due to the relative lack of constraint provided at the GRP surface by the <b>countersunk</b> bolt. The results from the bearing strength experiments suggest that clampup force has only a small beneficial effect on bearing strength in both <b>countersunk</b> and protruding head single-lap joints, when compared to double-lap joints. The reduced effectiveness of clampup force in increasing the bearing strength is believed to be a result of the increased joint rotation and bolt bending inherent in single-lap joints. These phenomena lead to delamination and brooming failure in the GRP, which can be avoided in double lap joints with sufficient bolt clampup force. The <b>countersunk</b> joints failed at a load approximately 20 % lower than the protruding head joints. [URL]...|$|R
