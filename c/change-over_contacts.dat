50|$|Less commonly, some jacks are {{provided}} with normally open (NO) or <b>change-over</b> <b>contacts,</b> and/or the switch contacts may be isolated from the connector.|$|E
50|$|This {{operated}} {{on the same}} principle as the vibrator type but the <b>change-over</b> <b>contacts</b> were operated by a synchronous motor. It was suitable for high-power applications, e.g. electrolysis cells and electrostatic precipitators.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the reverse}} of a {{vibrator}} inverter. An electromagnet, powered by DC through contacts it operated (like a buzzer) (or fed with AC), caused a spring to vibrate and the spring operated <b>change-over</b> <b>contacts</b> which converted the AC to DC. This arrangement was only suitable for low-power applications, e.g. auto radios and was also found in some motorcycle electrical systems, where it was combined with a voltage regulator.|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{methods to}} reduce the recovery voltages on the open <b>change-over</b> selector <b>contacts.</b> The generation of arcing or sparking gases can be minimized increasing the contact opening speed of the change-over selector. Using an additional snap contact, it can be assumed that the transformer DGA will not {{be influenced by the}} change-over operation...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of these}} contacts was for switching in telephone exchanges, for which there were many patterns. Two sets of <b>change-over</b> <b>contacts,</b> isolated from the connector contacts, were common. The more recent pattern of one NC contact for each signal path, internally attached to the connector contact, stems from their use as headphone jacks. In many amplifiers and equipment containing them, such as electronic organs, a headphone jack is provided that disconnects the loudspeakers when in use. This is done by means of these switch contacts. In other equipment, a dummy load is provided when the headphones are not connected. This is also easily provided by means of these NC contacts.|$|E
50|$|A picture above {{shows an}} STC SLU (Subscribers' Line Unit - {{in those days}} {{customers}} were always called subscribers, invariably shortened in conversation to 'subs'). It handled the traffic to and from five customers, and had five trunks going on to the B switches. There is therefore a 5Ã—5 switching matrix of reed relays, which constituted the A-switch. Note that the four reeds {{in each of these}} reed relay were in-line, whereas in Plessey reed-relays the reeds were in a square formation. The SLU also contained 10 electro-mechanical relays, two for each line. They were the Line Relay (LR), which was operated when the customer picked up the handset and which generated the calling signal, and a K relay which gave the correct tones and prevented spurious calling conditions. These two relays both provided <b>change-over</b> <b>contacts</b> and therefore had to be electro-mechanical, because the reed-relays only gave make-break contacts. The face-plate of the unit is to the right: at the other end one can see the edge connector. It was feared that this type of connector would cause problems after a relatively low number of removal/re-insertion operations, but in practice they proved to be more than adequately robust.|$|E
