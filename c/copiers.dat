5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper <b>copiers</b> once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large end-use) as more and more <b>copiers</b> switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) <b>copiers</b> of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
25|$|FedEx founder Fred Smith {{has stated}} in {{numerous}} articles that Xerox's {{development of the}} copier, and its need to quickly get parts to customers, {{was one of the}} economic issues that led him to pioneer the overnight delivery business in 1971. Because Xerox manufactured its <b>copiers</b> in Rochester, the city was one of the original 25 cities that FedEx served on its first night of operations on April 17, 1973.|$|E

25|$|Several {{open source}} modchips were {{designed}} using readily available electronic parts, {{by the end}} of the system's life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using free, unofficial tools, as well as the reproduction of original discs. With the introduction of such devices the console became very attractive to programmers and illegal <b>copiers</b> alike, as well as those who merely wished to protect the lifespan of their lawful, original discs.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007 {{the defense}} {{asked for more}} time to prepare its case and {{presented}} the judge with four motions. In addition to the charges of premeditated murder, at the time Martinez was charged with one count each of wrongful possession of a privately owned firearm, unexploded ordnance, and alcohol. The other charge against him was for wrongfully giving government property, in this case printers and <b>copiers,</b> to an Iraqi national. One of the defense motions was to sever the murder charges from the others. The case was scheduled {{to go to trial}} in August 2007.|$|E
25|$|Nintendo {{was very}} public about its scepticism toward using CDs and DVDs to store games, citing longer load times and {{durability}} issues. It was widely {{speculated that the}} company was even more concerned with the proprietary cartridge format's ability to help enforce copy protection, given its substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive titles for its revenue. Piracy was rampant on the PlayStation due to the relative ease of the installation of a modchip, allowing the PlayStation to play games region free and/or recorded on a regular CD-R, making the console very attractive to programmers and illegal <b>copiers.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{different}} names blue-line <b>copier,</b> whiteprint <b>copier</b> or [...] diazo <b>copier,</b> were given, {{due to the}} nature of the process, which consists in exposing to an ultraviolet light a previously sensitized paper with a component called diazo, and finally developing it in a bath (a solution of ammonia in water) which converts the parts not exposed to light, to a dark blue colour (blue-line) over an almost white background.|$|R

Resource and Information Centers managed by Freedom House in Tashkent, Namangan, and Samarkand offered access to materials and books on human rights, as well as technical equipment, such as computers, <b>copiers</b> and Internet access. The government warned that criminal proceedings could be brought against Uzbek staff members and visitors following recent amendments to the criminal code and Code on Administrative Liability of Uzbekistan. Other human rights groups have been similarly threatened and obliged to suspend operations.|$|E

The institutions arranged for multiple residences for educators as well as state sponsored education and arrangements for students and scholars. Similar arrangements {{were made by the}} Chola dynasty in 1024 CE, which provided state support to selected students in educational establishments. Temple schools from 12–13th centuries included the school at the Nataraja temple situated at Chidambaram which employed 20 librarians, out of whom 8 were <b>copiers</b> of manuscripts and 2 were employed for verification of the copied manuscripts. The remaining staff conducted other duties, including preservation and maintained of reference material.|$|E
25|$|Professional digital {{printing}} (using toner) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto {{which it is}} printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white <b>copiers</b> to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP Indigo Digital Press series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.|$|E
50|$|In 1963 Xerox {{introduced}} the Xerox 813, the first desktop plain-paper <b>copier,</b> realizing Carlson's {{vision of a}} <b>copier</b> that could fit on anyone's office desk. Ten years later in 1973, a basic, analogue, color <b>copier,</b> based on the 914, followed. The 914 itself was gradually sped up to become the 420 and 720. The 813 was similarly developed into the 330 and 660 products and, eventually, also the 740 desktop microfiche printer.|$|R
5000|$|A great {{advantage}} of digital <b>copier</b> technology is [...] "automatic digital collation." [...] For example, when copying {{a set of}} 20 pages 20 times, a digital <b>copier</b> scans each page only once, then uses the stored information to produce 20 sets. In an analog <b>copier,</b> either each page is scanned 20 times (a total of 400 scans), making one set at a time, or 20 separate output trays are used for the 20 sets.|$|R

With the <b>copier</b> installed in her home in Stonington, Connecticut, Hill experimented with techniques such as moving an object over the platen of the <b>copier</b> as a copy was being made, occasionally using brightly colored <b>copier</b> paper, and spooning extra quantities of toner into the machine. The IBM Copier II created many of the features which distinguished Hill's work by allowing for richer blacks and producing [...] "flaws" [...] in the print where the toner did not adhere to the paper.

2500|$|Chester Carlson, the {{inventor}} of photocopying, was originally a patent attorney and part-time researcher and inventor. His job at the patent office in New York City required {{him to make a}} large number of copies of important papers. Carlson, who was arthritic, found this a painful and tedious process. This prompted him to conduct experiments with photoconductivity. Carlson experimented with [...] "electrophotography" [...] in his kitchen and in 1938, applied for a patent for the process. He made the first [...] "photocopy" [...] using a zinc plate covered with sulfur. The words [...] "10-22-38 Astoria" [...] were written on a microscope slide, which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but because the process was still underdeveloped he failed. At the time multiple copies were made using carbon paper or duplicating machines and people did not feel the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including IBM and GE, neither of which believed there was a significant market for <b>copiers.</b>|$|E
