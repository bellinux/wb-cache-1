5|$|<b>Corky</b> (Gina Gershon), an ex-con who {{has just}} {{finished}} a five-year jail sentence, arrives at an apartment building to start work as a painter and plumber. On her {{way up to the}} apartment, she encounters the couple who live next-door, Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). After Caesar has gone out, Violet flirts with <b>Corky</b> and asks her to help retrieve an earring that has fallen down her sink. After <b>Corky</b> extracts the earring, Violet admits she lost it on purpose in order to get closer to <b>Corky,</b> and starts to seduce her. They are interrupted by the arrival of Caesar and <b>Corky</b> goes back to work. When she leaves for the day, Violet follows her to her truck. They go to Corky's apartment and have sex. The next morning, Violet tells <b>Corky</b> that Caesar is a money launderer for the Mafia and they have been together for five years.|$|E
5|$|Later, Violet overhears Caesar and his Mafia {{associates}} {{beating and}} torturing Shelly (Barry Kivel), {{a man who}} has been skimming money from the business. Upset by the violence and cruelty, Violet seeks solace from <b>Corky.</b> She tells <b>Corky</b> that she wants to make a new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will find the nearly $2 million Shelly took and count it in their apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money. <b>Corky,</b> already wary of Violet's intentions, is unsure whether to trust her.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{explains}} to <b>Corky</b> that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. <b>Corky</b> will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let <b>Corky</b> in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. <b>Corky</b> and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corky's</b> is a {{restaurant}} in Los Angeles, California's Sherman Oaks neighborhood. It was designed by Armet & Davis and built in 1958. It has a sweeping roofline, characteristic of Googie Architecture. It was remodeled in the 1970s and has been restored in recent years. It originally opened as Stanley Burke's Coffee Shop on Van Nuys Boulevard and became <b>Corky's</b> in the early 1960s as it transitioned to being open 24 hours a day / 7 days a week. Billy Joel played piano at the eatery in the 1970s. After 25 years as <b>Corky's</b> it became the Lamplighter, and was used in 2010 as a filming location for Nightmare on Elm Street. The restaurant is now restored and renovated as a renewed <b>Corky's.</b>|$|R

At Red Hot & Blue's founding, the chain had an agreement to use <b>Corky's</b> recipes. But before that, according to Walldorf, <b>Corky's</b> was owned by Sticky Fingers co-founder Jeff Goldstein's father, who also operated another Memphis barbecue, The Public Eye. [...] "Herb Goldstein had sold his interest and came to Charleston to help us get Sticky Fingers going," [...] Walldorf said.|$|R

5|$|Hydnellum was {{circumscribed}} by Finnish mycologist Petter Adolf Karsten in 1879 {{with what}} was then known as Hydnum suaveolens as the type species. Before then, fungi with spines (hydnoid fungi) had been grouped in Hydnum by Elias Fries in his 1821 work Systema mycologicum. Karsten defined Hydnellum as having fruitbodies with a <b>corky</b> or leathery, tough cap, and a centrally attached stipe. Synonyms of Hydnellum include Calodon (Karsten, 1881), and Phaeodon (Joseph Schröter, 1888).|$|E
5|$|In 2003, she {{returned}} to WWE and was put into a feud with Torrie Wilson, and another storyline as Vince McMahon's mistress. In 2004, she left the company {{to spend more time}} with her family. Outside wrestling, she is considered to be a sex symbol and has been featured on the cover of Playboy three times. The April 1999 issue of the magazine with her on the cover was one of the highest selling issues in Playboy history. She has guest starred on several television series, including Pacific Blue, and appeared in the film <b>Corky</b> Romano.|$|E

5|$|Very little {{improvisation}} {{took place}} during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film. Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between <b>Corky</b> and Caesar {{near the end of the}} film, Gina Gershon hit her hand so hard when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required stitches.|$|E
5|$|<b>Corky</b> waits next-door {{with the}} money while Gino and Johnnie arrive. After {{watching}} Johnnie flirt with Violet and taunt him, Caesar pulls out a gun and tells Gino that his son stole the money. In an angry panic, he kills both Gino and Johnnie, and Gino's bodyguard Roy. He tells Violet {{that they have to}} find the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived, lest their Mafia pals find the money or men missing. Unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment, Caesar telephones Mickey (John P. Ryan), a Mafia friend, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh is}} reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and <b>corky</b> as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit body tissue {{is made of}} {{generative}} hyphae that do not expand. This slows {{the growth of the}} fruit body, often enabling it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E
5000|$|After World War II, {{barbecue}} {{became a}} viable commercial venture in Memphis. Small restaurants, known as [...] "joints", began to {{open with a}} purpose-built pit for slow-cooking the meat. Many small neighborhood joints in low-income areas, such as Payne's, Leonard's and Interstate, have gained notoriety as they reflect the roots of Memphis barbecue. Many regional chains have also developed from Memphis, including Tops, Neely's, and <b>Corky's.</b> As Memphis-style barbecue became more popular across the country, restaurants such as <b>Corky's</b> and Rendezvous began shipping orders overnight to customers.|$|R

5|$|The grasslands, heathland, {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as barn owls (Tyto alba) and nightjar, with butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), <b>corky</b> fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) which support populations of dormouse (Gliridae), common lizards, siskin, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple hairstreak butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E
5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and <b>corky</b> materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E
5|$|The pale brown-skinned ovoid {{tunicate}} bulbs have a membranous {{tunic and}} a <b>corky</b> stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs {{in a ring}} around the edge, which grow up to 40mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.|$|E
