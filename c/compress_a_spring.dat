2500|$|Hooke's {{law is a}} {{principle}} of physics that states that the force (...) needed to extend or <b>compress</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> by some distance [...] scales linearly with respect to that distance. That is: , where [...] is a constant factor characteristic of the spring: its stiffness, and [...] is small compared to the total possible deformation of the spring. The law is named after 17th-century British physicist Robert Hooke. He first stated the law in 1676 as a Latin anagram. He published the solution of his anagram in 1678 as: ut tensio, sic vis ("as the extension, so the force" [...] or [...] "the extension {{is proportional to the}} force").

50|$|As a child, Maxim {{had been}} knocked {{over by a}} rifle's recoil, and this {{inspired}} him to use that recoil force to automatically operate a gun. Between 1883 and 1885 Maxim patented gas, recoil and blowback methods of operation. After moving to England, he settled in a large house formerly owned by Lord Thurlow in West Norwood where he developed his design for an automatic weapon, using an action that would close the breech and <b>compress</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring,</b> by storing the recoil energy released by a shot to prepare the gun for its next shot. He thoughtfully ran announcements in the local press warning {{that he would be}} experimenting with the gun in his garden and that neighbours should keep their windows open to avoid the danger of broken glass.|$|E

Once the striker is released it flips downwards into a percussion cap which fires the adjacent detonator followed by the booster charge and then the main explosive filling of TNT.

5000|$|Low {{capacity}} {{magazines are}} {{the type of}} magazine provided by Tokyo Marui and some other manufacturers with their guns. They are known as [...] "Low capacity" [...] or [...] "low-cap" [...] as they hold drastically fewer BBs than most medium capacity or high capacity magazines.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} design {{optimization}} approach for core of solenoid actuators by combining optimization techniques with the {{finite element method}} (FEM). A solenoid is an important element part which hydrau-lically controls a transmission system, etc. The demanded feature of the solenoid is that it performs an electromagnetic force output being constant regardless of the stroke and being proportional to coil current. The plunger <b>compresses</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> with <b>a</b> minimum force of 12 N over an 1. 7 mm travel.

5000|$|A {{moving coil}} {{galvanometer}} {{can be used as}} a voltmeter by inserting a resistor in series with the instrument. The galvanometer has a coil of fine wire suspended in a strong magnetic field. When an electric current is applied, the interaction of the magnetic field of the coil and of the stationary magnet creates a torque, tending to make the coil rotate. The torque is proportional to the current through the coil. The coil rotates, <b>compressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> that opposes the rotation. The deflection of the coil is thus proportional to the current, which in turn is proportional to the applied voltage, which is indicated by a pointer on a scale.|$|R

50|$|The mine is {{circular}} {{and has a}} very rounded appearance, with {{a central}} metal cap that covers the mine's safety device, a large screw. The mine is unusual in that it uses five igniter/fuzes linked to a central detonator {{by a series of}} flame tubes. Sufficient pressure on the top surface of the mine causes it to press down on {{one or more of the}} igniters, <b>compressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> and allowing two steel striker retaining balls to escape, releasing the striker, which is forced upwards by <b>a</b> second <b>spring.</b> The striker hits a percussion cap at the top of the igniter, the flash from which travels along a flame tube to a metal chamber in the centre of the mine. If the safety screw is removed then the flash is free to ignite the detonator, which in turn detonates the main charge.|$|R
40|$|This {{demonstration}} {{illustrates that}} the energy stored in <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> {{is proportional to the}} square of the distance the spring is compressed. An air track glider is attached to <b>an</b> arm that <b>compresses</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring.</b> When released it moves up the inclined air track, as illustrated in Figure 1. In this case the distance the glider travels up the incline is proportional to its final gravitational potential energy, which is linearly proportional to vertical height and therefore to distance along the incline. The energy stored in the compressed spring increases as the square of the compression, so compression ratios of 1 - 2 - 3 units respectively produce energies in the ratio of 1 - 4 - 9, and the glider moves up the incline by distances in the ratio of 1 - 4 - 9, as seen from the scale provided along the air track...|$|R
50|$|A {{tensioner}} is {{a device}} that applies a force to create or maintain tension. The force may be applied parallel to, {{as in the case}} of a hydraulic bolt tensioner, or perpendicular to, {{as in the case of}} a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner, the tension it creates. The force may be generated by a fixed displacement, as in the case of an eccentric bicycle bottom bracket, which must be adjusted as parts wear, or by stretching or <b>compressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring,</b> as in the case of a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner; by changing the volume of a gas, as in the case of a marine riser tensioner; by hydraulic pressure, as in the case of a hydraulic bolt tensioner; or by gravity acting on a suspended mass, as in the case of a chair lift cable tensioner.|$|R
5000|$|After the Second World War, Czechoslovakia's Ministry of the Interior {{requested}} a new pistol design from Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod. The resulting gun was chambered in [...]32 ACP and designed by two brothers Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl. It combined elements {{from both the}} Walther PP and PPK. The pistol is fed from an 8-round single-stack magazine, located within the bakelite paneled grip. Small fixed sights are located {{on top of the}} slide. The pistol functions via the blowback principle - recoil causes the slide to move backwards, thereby <b>compressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> around the fixed barrel. After it reaches the end of its rearward travel, the recoil spring returns the slide to its forward position, stripping and chambering a new round from the magazine as it does so, rendering the gun ready to fire again. Hammer and trigger operation is single and double action [...]|$|R
5000|$|RFV {{is often}} {{explained}} by modelling the tire {{as being a}} ring composed of short compression <b>springs.</b> <b>As</b> the tire turns <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> element makes contact with the road and is <b>compressed.</b> [...] <b>As</b> the <b>spring</b> rotates out of the contact area it recovers to its original length. In practice, these springs have slight differences in their lengths and spring constants. These variations result in RFV.|$|R
5000|$|In chemistry, a {{molecule}} experiences strain when its chemical structure undergoes some stress which raises its internal energy {{in comparison to}} a strain-free reference compound. The internal energy of {{a molecule}} consists of all the energy stored within it. A strained molecule has an additional amount of internal energy which an unstrained molecule does not. This extra internal energy, or strain energy, can be likened to <b>a</b> <b>compressed</b> <b>spring.</b> [...] Much like <b>a</b> <b>compressed</b> <b>spring</b> must be held in place to prevent release of its potential energy, a molecule can be held in an energetically unfavorable conformation by the bonds within that molecule. Without the bonds holding the conformation in place, the strain energy would be released.|$|R
40|$|A {{negative}} stiffness {{device and}} method for seismic protection of a structure is described.

The <b>compressed</b> <b>spring</b> has <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> force. In <b>a</b> rest state, the compressed spring does not apply a lateral force to the movement frame. In an engaged state, the compressed spring is configured to apply a lateral force to displace the movement frame in a lateral direction of a seismic load. The spring force is amplified by the linkage when the movement frame is laterally displaced to an amplification point...|$|R
50|$|The clutch is the {{component}} that defines a torque screwdriver. This is achieved with steel balls rolling between indented plates, <b>compressed</b> by <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> at one end, {{and the other}} side driving a screw or fastener. The torque limiting clutch is the part of the tool that limits the amount of torque being applied to the fastener at the receiving end of the tool. On simpler tools the clutch settings may be marked with arbitrary numbers (e.g., from 1 for the lowest available torque to 20 for the highest, without necessarily having a linear relationship with actual torque) rather than torque values.|$|R
50|$|Whereas most markers have a {{feed tube}} {{attached}} to a hopper/loader that either drops paintballs one-by-one or force-feeds (in the case of some loaders) into the chamber, the Cyclone-Feed System is a housing {{on the right side}} of the marker. Contained within the housing are two star-shaped sprockets. Paintballs fall from a wide mouth hopper into the gaps between the spokes. As the operator fires, excess gas from the firing cycle is routed to a cylinder, which holds a piston. Gas pressure pushes the piston forward, also <b>compressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> which will return the piston when the gas pressure in the cylinder drops; at far end of its travel, the piston is connected to a ratchet which interacts with a toothed gear, the advancement of which on the piston's return stroke because it regulates the force with which the paintballs are struck by the spokes rotates the position of the spokes counterclockwise and feeds a paintball into the chamber. This effectively means that the rate at which paintballs are being fed into the marker is dependent on the rate at which the operator pulls the trigger. Users have reported speeds in excess of 25 bit/s, but this requires mechanical modification to the stock cyclone parts. It is advertised at 15+ bps.|$|R
50|$|The Type 9 wooden {{anti-tank}} mine was an Italian bar type {{anti-tank mine}} used during World War II in North Africa. The box {{consisted of a}} lower section, containing the large warhead and fuzes and an upper, overlapping lid with two pivoting wooden covers that sat over the two fuzes. The fuzes were designed as a pivoting lever, and downward motion of the lid caused the lever to pull back <b>a</b> striker, <b>compressing</b> <b>a</b> striker <b>spring</b> until the pivoting action moved the lever enough to release the striker. The striker then impacted a blank cartridge, firing it, triggering a detonator charge, followed by the main charge.|$|R

50|$|Most {{downhole}} {{safety valves}} are controlled hydraulically from the surface, meaning they are opened using a hydraulic connection linked {{directly to a}} well control panel. When hydraulic pressure is applied down a control line, the hydraulic pressure forces a sleeve within the valve to slide downwards. This movement <b>compresses</b> <b>a</b> large <b>spring</b> and pushes the flapper downwards to open the valve. When hydraulic pressure is removed, the spring pushes the sleeve back up and causes the flapper to shut. In this way, it is failsafe and will isolate the wellbore {{in the event of}} a loss of the wellhead. The full designation for a typical valve is 'tubing retrievable, surface controlled, subsurface safety valve', abbreviated to TR-SCSSV.|$|R

50|$|Deep {{research}} into the anatomy of large mammals such as, kangaroos and other large ungulates such as deer and gazelle, suggests strongly {{that some sort of}} elastic mechanism is important for this energetic savings. Previous combination of careful experiments, with anatomical (e.g. tendon dimensions), mechanical (e.g. force plate recordings) and mathematical calculations revealed that a significant fraction of the work done with each step could be provided by the spring-like action of tendons, rather than by muscle work.When the animal’s foot contacts the surface of the ground during high speed locomotion, the tendon or ligament is pressed tightly together, storing elastic energy much like <b>a</b> <b>compressed</b> <b>spring.</b> <b>As</b> the foot gets of the ground, the pressure on the compressed tendons and ligaments is released, and elastic recoil from these spring like structures provides additional force to propel the animal thus resulting in energetic savings. Simple calculations based kangaroo hopping and forces involved in hopping show how storage of elastic strain energy can save twenty to thirty percent of metabolic energy required for hopping. Measurements of oxygen consumption with fluctuations of kinetic and gravitational potential energy, indicate elastic savings of at least fifty four percent at high speeds.|$|R
40|$|In the {{aerospace}} field spacecraft components are {{held together by}} separation systems until a specific time when they must be separated or deployed. Customarily a threaded joining bolt engages one of the components to be joined, and a threaded nut is placed on that bolt against the other component {{so they can be}} drawn together by a releasable locking assembly. The releasable locking assembly herein includes a plunger having one end coupled to one end of a plunger bolt. The other end is flanged to abut and <b>compress</b> <b>a</b> coil <b>spring</b> when the plunger is advanced toward the interface plane between the two components. When the plunger is so advanced toward the interface plane, the end of the plunger bolt can be connected to the joining bolt.
