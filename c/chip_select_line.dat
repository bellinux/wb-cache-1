25|$|In the {{independent}} slave configuration, {{there is an}} independent <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> <b>line</b> for each slave. A pull-up resistor between power source and <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> <b>line</b> is highly recommended for each independent device to reduce cross-talk between devices. This is the way SPI is normally used. Since the MISO pins of the slaves are connected together, {{they are required to}} be tri-state pins (high, low or high-impedance).|$|E
25|$|Every slave on the {{bus that}} has not been {{activated}} using its <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> <b>line</b> must disregard the input clock and MOSI signals, and must not drive MISO.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} hardware-level differences. Some chips combine MOSI and MISO {{into a single}} data line (SI/SO); this is {{sometimes}} called 'three-wire' signaling (in contrast to normal 'four-wire' SPI). Another variation of SPI removes the <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> <b>line,</b> managing protocol state machine entry/exit using other methods. Anyone needing an external connector for SPI defines their own: UEXT, JTAG connector, Secure Digital card socket, etc. Signal levels depend entirely on the chips involved.|$|E
25|$|The SD {{protocol}} {{envisioned the}} ability to gang 30 cards together without separate <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> <b>lines.</b> The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card {{to respond to the}} command using its unique serial number.|$|R
50|$|The 80186 {{series was}} {{generally}} intended for embedded systems, as microcontrollers with external memory.

25|$|Some devices {{even have}} minor variances from the CPOL/CPHA modes {{described}} above. Sending data from slave to master {{may use the}} opposite clock edge as master to slave. Devices often require extra clock idle time before the first clock or after the last one, or between a command and its response. Some devices have two clocks, one to read data, and another to transmit it into the device. Many of the read clocks run from the <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|The one-bit SD {{protocol}} {{was derived from}} the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use open collector interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a pull-up resistor) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> <b>line</b> to sense that the host device had selected it.|$|E
25|$|Below is {{an example}} of bit-banging the SPI {{protocol}} as an SPI master with CPOL=0, CPHA=0, and eight bits per transfer. The example is written in the C programming language. Because this is CPOL=0 the clock must be pulled low before the chip select is activated. The <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> <b>line</b> must be activated, which normally means being toggled low, for the peripheral {{before the start of the}} transfer, and then deactivated afterward. Most peripherals allow or require several transfers while the select line is low; this routine might be called several times before deselecting the chip.|$|E
40|$|A compact {{isolated}} low-power 32 -channel 16 -bit data-logging system {{around an}} NXP ARM processor (LPC 1768) {{and four of}} the linear technology octal analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs) LTC 1857 / 58 / 59 is designed. The system requires only 250 mA when powered at 5 V to run at full power (including a capacitive 2. 8 inch touch-screen display and 32 Gb SHDC SD memory card). The sample rate is configurable up to 1 k SPS per channel as well as voltage dynamic input up to �� 10 V; additionally, 32 <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> <b>lines</b> (SPI protocol) individually addressable and controllable while sampling to configure userdesigned programmable gain amplifiers (PGAs) are available. Collaboration is being sought to improve the software capabilities, particularly to enrich the very basic user interface and to add wireless connectivity. The code is available (under the GPL licence) at our repository, the gerber file to reproduce the PCB is available (on the As-Is basis) on request. The galvanic isolation between the power supply data connection and ADC channels makes the data-logger also compatible with the main powered PCs, hence it is suitable {{for the implementation of}} medical devices at least for the prototyping and initial testing stages. �� The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014...|$|R

5000|$|When the <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> pin {{is held in}} the {{inactive}} state, {{the chip}} or device is [...] "deaf", and pays no heed {{to changes in the}} state of its other input pins; it holds its outputs in the high impedance state, so other chips can drive those signals.

The module uses four 2 K x 1 -bit N-channel FET, random access memory chips, called array chips, and two sense amplifier chips, mounted and interconnected on a ceramic substrate. Four 5 % tolerance power supplies are required. At the Module, the address, <b>chip</b> <b>select,</b> and array <b>select</b> <b>lines</b> require a 0 - 8. 5 V MOS signal level. The data output, read-strobe, and write-enable lines operate at TTl levels.

50|$|When an {{engineer}} needs to connect several devices {{to the same}} set of input wires (e.g., a computer bus), but retain the ability to send and receive data or commands to each device independently of the others on the bus, they can use a <b>chip</b> <b>select.</b> The <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> is a command pin on many integrated circuits which connects the I/O pins on the device to the internal circuitry of that device.|$|R

Although {{it is the most}} frequently used PC port for controlling external applications, the parallel port has severe limitations in generating <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> and control signals. Their number can be increased by using the parallel port data lines, extra hardware and specific routines. Higher speed can be obtained if the EPP and ECP modes are used. Techniques for increasing the number of <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> and control signals generated by the PC parallel port are presented and analyzed...|$|R
