Mutations have also been found that produce “core” myopathies). Although their phenotypes are similar, in addition to typical nemaline myopathy some specialists distinguish another type of myopathy called actinic nemaline myopathy. In the former, clumps of actin form instead of the typical rods. It is important to state that a patient can show {{more than one of}} these phenotypes in a biopsy. The most common symptoms consist of a typical facial morphology (myopathic faces), muscular weakness, a delay in motor development and respiratory difficulties. The course of the illness, its gravity and the age at which it appears are all variable and overlapping forms of myopathy are also found. [...] A symptom of nemalinic myopathy is that “Nemaline rods” appear in differing places in Type 1 muscle fibres. These rods are non-pathognomonic structures that have a similar composition to the Z disks found in the sarcomere.|$|E

The committee includes 59 members from 10 medical disciplines. They are organized into 5 working groups: genetics/diagnosis, neurology, pulmonology, gastroenterology/nutrition/speech/oral care, and orthopedics/rehabilitation. In each care area the authors summarize the committee's recommendations for symptom assessments and therapeutic interventions.

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>myopathies</b> are a {{rare and}} {{heterogeneous}} group of diseases. They are primarily characterised by skeletal muscle weakness and disease-specific pathological features. They harshly limit ordinary life and in severe cases, these myopathies are associated with early death of the affected individuals. The <b>congenital</b> <b>myopathies</b> investigated in this thesis are nemaline myopathy and myofibrillar myopathy. These diseases are usually caused by missense mutations in genes encoding myofibrillar proteins, but the exact mechanisms by which the point mutations in these proteins cause the overall weakness remain mysterious. Hence, in this thesis two different nemaline myopathy-causing actin mutations and one myofibrillar myopathy-causing myosin-mutation found in both human patients and mouse models were used to investigate the cascades of molecular and cellular events leading to weakness. I performed {{a broad range of}} functional and structural experiments including skinned muscle fibre mechanics, small-angle X-ray scattering as well as immunoblotting and histochemical techniques. Interestingly, according to my results, point mutations in myosin and actin differently modify myosin binding to actin, cross-bridge formation and muscle fibre force production revealing divergent mechanisms, that is, gain versus loss of function (papers I, II and IV). In addition, one point mutation in actin appears to have muscle-specific effects.  The presence of that mutant protein in respiratory muscles, i. e. diaphragm, has indeed more damaging consequences on myofibrillar structure than in limb muscles complexifying the pathophysiological mechanisms (paper II). As numerous atrophic muscle fibres can be seen in <b>congenital</b> <b>myopathies,</b> I also considered this phenomenon as a contributing factor to weakness and characterised the underlying causes in presence of one actin mutation. My results highlighted a direct muscle-specific up-regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (paper III). All together, my research work demonstrates that mutation- and muscle-specific mechanisms trigger the muscle weakness in <b>congenital</b> <b>myopathies.</b> This gives important insights into the pathophysiology of <b>congenital</b> <b>myopathies</b> and will undoubtedly help in designing future therapies...|$|R

50|$|Currently, {{there are}} no {{treatments}} {{for any of the}} congenital myopathies.

For example, many <b>congenital</b> <b>myopathy</b> patients are involved in physical or occupational therapy in an attempt to strengthen their skeletal muscles. Orthopedic surgery is usually necessary to correct skeletal deformities secondary to muscle weakness, such as scoliosis.

50|$|MWS is a heterogeneous, {{initially}} {{described as}} a syndrome.

50|$|Myopathies {{with varying}} fiber size, such as {{congenital}} fiber type disproportion, occurs when type 1 fibers, the slow twitch fibers involved in sustaining activity, {{are smaller than}} type 2 fibers, the fast twitch fibers involved in quick activity.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews adult {{presentations of}} the major <b>congenital</b> <b>myopathies</b> - central core disease, multiminicore disease, centronuclear {{myopathy}} and nemaline myopathy - {{with an emphasis on}} common genetic backgrounds, typical clinicopathological features and differential diagnosis. RECENT FINDINGS: The <b>congenital</b> <b>myopathies</b> are a genetically heterogeneous group of conditions with characteristic histopathological features. Although essentially considered paediatric conditions, some forms - in particular those due to dominant mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR 1), the dynamin 2 (DNM 2), the amphiphysin 2 (BIN 1) and the Kelch repeat-and BTB/POZ domain-containing protein 13 (KBTBD 13) gene - may present late into adulthood. Moreover, dominant RYR 1 mutations associated with the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility trait have been recently identified as a common cause of (exertional) rhabdomyolysis presenting throughout life. In addition, improved standards of care and development of new therapies will result in an increasing number of patients with early-onset presentations transitioning to the adult neuromuscular clinic. Lastly, if nemaline rods are the predominant histopathological feature, acquired treatable conditions have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. SUMMARY: Recently identified genotypes and phenotypes indicate a spectrum of the <b>congenital</b> <b>myopathies</b> extending into late adulthood, with important implications for clinical practice...|$|R
