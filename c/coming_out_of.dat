5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets for birds and mammals that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation.

DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E

5|$|For {{the coming}} 1963season, manager Fred Hutchinson envisioned the same the role for Sisler, <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the bullpen {{with the idea}} that he would {{occasionally}} start. The Reds announced on February9 that Sisler had signed for the 1963season, although he did not make the Reds' NL club and was optioned to their class-AAA team, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). In 35games pitched for the Padres, he started six, had a 6–9record and a 3.40ERA in 90innings. On March18, 1964, it was announced that Sisler retired from baseball to join an Investment company.|$|E

However, after seeing very limited minutes from head coach Seth Greenberg during his first two seasons there, he transferred to La Salle and started competing for the Explorers in late 2012. As a junior with his new team, he famously made a game-winning floater in the 2013 NCAA Tournament.|$|E
5|$|In October 1965, Leeds skipper Collins {{was injured}} in an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup game against Torino and Revie gave the {{captaincy}} to Bremner after initially handing the armband to Charlton {{for the remainder of}} the season; Charlton was keen to give up the captaincy as it prevented his superstitious ritual of <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel last on match days. Revie and Bremner had a strong bond of trust, which was why the manager gave him the captaincy at such a young age. Leeds finished second in the league in the 1965–66 campaign to Liverpool, who had finished six points clear at the top.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Kennedy's staff.|$|E
