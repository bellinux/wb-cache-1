5000|$|Cold {{saw blades}} are <b>circular</b> metal <b>cutting</b> saw blades {{categorized}} into two types: solid HSS or tungsten carbide-tipped (TCT). Both types of blades are resharpenable {{and may be}} used many times before being discarded. Cold saw blades are used to cut metal using a relatively slow rotational speed, usually less than 5000 surface feet per minute (SFM) (25m/s), and a high chip load per tooth, usually between [...]001" [...] - [...]003" [...] (0.025 - 0.08mm) per tooth. These blades are driven by a high power motor and high-torque gear reduction unit or an AC vector drive. During the cutting process, the metal is released in a shearing action by the teeth as the blade turns and the feed mechanism moves the blade forward. They are called [...] "cold saw blades" [...] because they transfer all the energy and heat created during the cutting process to the chip. This enables the blade and the work material to remain cold.|$|R

40|$|Rock {{drilling}} is {{the process}} employed to retrieve both the conventional and the unconventional resources, such as gas and oil buried deep under the ground. This study attempts to improve {{the understanding of the}} interaction between the drilling bit and rock by investigating the mechanics involved. In terms of achieving such a goal, a numerical modeling, if successful, can provide insights that are not possible through either field tests or laboratory experiments. When the cutting depth progresses from shallow to deep, there is a failure mode transition from ductile to brittle, and a critical depth that governs this transition. This study introduced Bažant’s simple size effect law into interpreting the transition process of rock cutting. By treating the cutting depth as a measure of size, the law was found applied well to rock cutting based upon the data available in the literature, and the Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling results. By introducing the concept of characteristic length, this study also reinterpreted the previous understanding of the critical depth in rock cutting, by introducing the concept of characteristic length, and obtained the influence of characteristic length on critical depth through numerical modeling. The Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) and the Rate of Penetration (ROP) are two key factors for evaluating the efficiency of a drilling process and together they form a good base for strategizing a desirable drilling operation. In the absence of cutter wear rate, a relationship between MSE and ROP for a rectangular cutter has previously been suggested. This study presented a simple model for a circular cutter that includes the wear progression, which could explain the laboratory result of cutting high strength rock under high pressure. The operation of a drilling bit in the field is mainly achieved through <b>circular</b> <b>cutting</b> action. This study extended the previous efforts and modeled first the <b>circular</b> <b>cutting</b> of a single disc cutter.

With regard to the results of this test, the new device can be considered as a sphincter preserving mechanism for treatment of high anal fistulas. Consequently, a major reduction in the risk of fecal incontinence, recurrence rate, convalescence period and patient morbidity may be achieved using the new device for treatment of fistula-in-ano...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates cutting {{forces and}} surface error due to cutting force-induced tool {{deflections}} in peripheral milling of curved geometries. In machining workpiece geometries, where curvature varies continuously along the tool path, both cutting force and surface error vary from point to point. This {{is different from}} the case of machining straight and <b>circular</b> geometries where <b>cutting</b> forces and surface error are both invariant along the tool path. To study the effect of curvature, first force models for feed and normal cutting forces are derived from dynamometer measured forces.

A programme of lightening was begun: some of this involved <b>cutting</b> <b>circular</b> lightening holes into the bogie frames, and replacing steel buffer beams or roof panels with aluminium. Much of the over-weight was due to ancillary components, particularly the train-heating steam generators, being supplied over weight. To avoid waste, these components were replaced by lighter versions from other makers, but the heavier originals were then used in the Class 20 and Class 40 locomotives. The lightened locomotives eventually met British Rail's approval, but only after a painstaking weighing that involved specifying the amount of sand in the sandboxes and other precise details.|$|R

40|$|Pie-cutting is {{different}} from cake-cutting. For one thing, a cake is usually rectangular, a pie <b>circular.</b> <b>Cutting</b> a cake into n ≥ 2 pieces typically involves making n– 1 parallel, vertical cuts across the cake, whereas cutting a pie usually means cutting wedgeshaped pieces from the center, which requires n cuts. We {{can think of a}} cake as being obtained from a pie by making some initial cut, which determines the two ends of the cake, so its remaining division requires only n– 1 additional cuts. It is the initial cut that essentially differentiates pie-cutting from cake-cutting. We focus on pie-cutting here, although we return to cake-cutting to compare it with pie-cutting. We restrict our analysis to two players, because the properties we impose on the allocation of pie pieces are demanding and cannot all be satisfied if there are three or more players.

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of the studies that allow determining the mechanism of forming macro and micro relief of surfaces taking place at termo frictional treatment of parts and ensuring the acquisition of a given accuracy and quality of treatment. It is established that thermo frictional treatment is characterized by complex temperature-deformation processes in the contact zone of the tool and part that are associated with the formation of treatment zones with heating and melting the material. We present complex methods of surface treatment that implement features of thermo frictional and mechanical treatment processes using machine tools by combining preliminary treatment of parts by a disk tool, which has a <b>circular</b> <b>cutting</b> edge and subsequent milling, or grinding and finishing bilateral operations. Thus, after processing we obtain a wavy surface with a random profile, which has a system of parallel grooves and ridges oriented perpendicular to the feeding direction. Parameters of waviness depend on the dynamic characteristics of the machine tool, on the cutting process, and on the use of additional devices.

The forecasting of thermal processes during metal cutting is characterized by the multifactor of the model and the nonlinearity of the connection between the temperature field of the cutting zone and the processing parameters. Therefore realistic modeling of these processes with regard to the maximum number of influencing factors which will minimize the time and cost of experimental studies is very important. The research investigates the use of computer-aided design SolidWorks Simulation system to analyze the thermal processes occurring in the cutting zone during finishing turning of hardened <b>circular</b> steel <b>cutting</b> blade of superhard material. While modeling, the distribution of heat generated in cut (in the zone of plastic deformation of the workpiece and on the surfaces of friction of the cutting blade with chips and the treated surface) is observed by four flows: to the tool, chips, workpiece and the environment. The limiting conditions for the existence of the developed model-geometric, physical and temporal limits are defined. Simulation is performed in steady and transient modes. Control of adequacy of simulation results is made. The conclusions of the analysis of opportunities of CAD SolidWorks Simulation System for research of thermal processes the cutting zone are drawn. ...|$|R
