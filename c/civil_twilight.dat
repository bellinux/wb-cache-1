5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than <b>civil</b> <b>twilight.</b> Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
25|$|The {{sun sets}} on November 18 or 19, {{and it remains}} below the horizon for about 65 days. This creates a polar night that lasts until the Sun returns to lightly touch the horizon (due to the {{refraction}} and scattering of the atmosphere) by January 22 or January 23. The sun then rises again completely over the horizon by January 27 or 28. During {{the first half of}} the polar night, there is a decreasing amount of twilight each day, and on the winter solstice (around December 21 or December 22), <b>civil</b> <b>twilight</b> in Barrow lasts for a mere 3 hours.|$|E

40|$|Zenith {{skylight}} {{is often}} distinctly blue during clear <b>civil</b> <b>twilights,</b> {{and much of}} this color is due to pre-ferential absorption at longer wavelengths by ozone’s Chappuis bands. Because stratospheric ozone is greatly depleted in the austral spring, such decreases could plausibly make Antarctic twilight colors less blue then, including at the zenith. So for several months in 2005, we took digital images of twilight zenith and antisolar skies at Antarctica’s Georg von Neumayer Station. Our colorimetric analysis of these images shows only weak correlations between ozone concentration and twilight colors. We also used a spectroradiometer at amidlatitude site to measure zenith twilight spectra and colors. At both locations, spectral extinction by aerosols seems as important as ozone absorption in explaining colors seen through-out the twilight sky. © 2011 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 010. 1030, 010. 1290, 010. 1690, 010. 3920, 010. 4950, 330. 1730. 1...|$|R
50|$|When the sun {{has just}} set, the {{brightness}} of the sky decreases rapidly, thereby enabling us to see the airglow that is caused from such high altitudes that they are still fully sunlit until the sun drops more than about 12° below the horizon. During this time, yellow emissions from the sodium layer and red emissions from the 630 nm oxygen lines are dominant, and contribute to the purplish color sometimes seen during <b>civil</b> and nautical <b>twilight.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In a {{news posting}} to the Evanescence website during June 2009, Amy Lee {{wrote that the}} band {{was in the process}} of writing new {{material}} for a new album proposed for release in 2010. She stated that the music would be an evolution of previous works and be [...] "better, stronger, and more interesting". The band played a [...] "secret show" [...] at the Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom in New York City on November 4, 2009, with label mates <b>Civil</b> <b>Twilight.</b> Tickets for the show sold out in five minutes. This performance acted as a warm-up for their headline appearance at the Maquinária Festival in São Paulo, Brazil, which took place on November 8.|$|E

2500|$|Huygens {{found the}} {{brightness}} of the surface of Titan (at time of landing) to be about one thousand times dimmer than full solar illumination on Earth (or 500 times brighter than illumination by full moonlight)—that is, the illumination level experienced about ten minutes after sunset on Earth, approximately late <b>civil</b> <b>twilight.</b> The color of the sky and the scene on Titan is mainly orange due to the much greater attenuation of blue light by Titan's haze relative to red light. [...] The Sun (which was comparatively high in the sky when Huygens landed) would be visible as a small, bright spot, one tenth the size of the solar disk seen from Earth, and comparable in size and brightness to a car headlight seen from about 150 meters. It casts sharp shadows, but of low contrast as 90% of the illumination comes from the sky.|$|E
2500|$|While {{calculations}} of days, {{months and years}} are based on fixed hours equal to 1/24 of a day, {{the beginning of each}} halachic day is based on the local time of sunset. The end of the Shabbat and other Jewish holidays is based on nightfall (Tzeth haKochabim) which occurs some amount of time, typically 42 to 72 minutes, after sunset. According to Maimonides, nightfall occurs when three medium-sized stars become visible after sunset. By the 17th century, this had become three-second-magnitude stars. The modern definition is when the center of the sun is 7° below the geometric (airless) horizon, somewhat later than <b>civil</b> <b>twilight</b> at 6°. The beginning of the daytime portion of each day is determined both by dawn and sunrise. Most halachic times are based on some combination of these four times and vary from day to day throughout the year and also vary significantly depending on location. The daytime hours are often divided into Sha'oth Zemaniyoth or [...] "Halachic hours" [...] by taking the time between sunrise and sunset or between dawn and nightfall and dividing it into 12 equal hours. The nighttime hours are similarly divided into 12 equal portions, albeit a different amount of time than the [...] "hours" [...] of the daytime. The earliest and latest times for Jewish services, the latest time to eat chametz on the day before Passover and many other rules are based on Sha'oth Zemaniyoth. For convenience, the modern day using Sha'oth Zemaniyoth is often discussed as if sunset were at 6:00pm, sunrise at 6:00am and each hour were equal to a fixed hour. For example, halachic noon may be after 1:00pm in some areas during daylight saving time. Within the Mishnah, however, the numbering of the hours starts with the [...] "first" [...] hour after the start of the day.|$|E
5000|$|Morning <b>civil</b> <b>twilight</b> {{begins when}} the {{geometric}} {{center of the}} sun is 6° below the horizon and ends at sunrise. [...] Evening <b>civil</b> <b>twilight</b> begins at sunset and ends when the geometric center of the sun reaches 6° below the horizon. In the United States' military, the initialisms BMCT (begin morning <b>civil</b> <b>twilight,</b> i.e. civil dawn) and EECT (end evening <b>civil</b> <b>twilight,</b> i.e. civil dusk) are {{used to refer to}} the start of morning <b>civil</b> <b>twilight</b> and the end of evening <b>civil</b> <b>twilight,</b> respectively. Civil dawn is preceded by morning nautical twilight and civil dusk is followed by evening nautical twilight.|$|E
50|$|These uses {{of night}} {{are listed in}} order of {{increasing}} restrictiveness. The end of evening <b>civil</b> <b>twilight</b> generally occurs less than one hour after sunset.
