Baumol defined a <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> in his 1982 paper as a market where [...] "entry is absolutely free and exit absolutely costless", freedom of entry in Stigler sense: the incumbent has no cost discrimination against entrants. He states that a <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> will never have an economic profit greater than zero when in equilibrium and the equilibrium will also be efficient.

This is in contrast to the older theory of industry structure since not only industry structure is not exogenously given, but equilibrium is reached without add hoc hypothesis on the behavior of firms, say using reaction functions in a duopoly.

The debate surrounding contestability theory prompted economists to critically reassess the neoclassical theory of the firm, particularly with respect to: impediments to potential competition; the complementary role of potential and actual competition in affecting the conduct of incumbent firms; and the role of direction of appropriate industry regulation. The major problems identified by the debate are the difficulty in determining the extent to which markets may be imperfectly contestable and the framing of policy approaches appropriate to specific industry contexts. ...|$|R

Contestable markets are characterized by [...] "hit and run" [...] competition; if a firm in a <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> raises its prices much beyond the average price level of the market, and thus begins to earn excess profits, potential rivals will enter the market, hoping to exploit the price level for easy profit. When the original incumbent firm(s) respond by returning prices to levels consistent with normal profits, the new firms will exit. Because of that, even a single-firm market can show highly competitive behavior.|$|E

40|$|We address two {{questions}} {{about the impact of}} the UBS-SBC merger: (i) How will the concentration in the Swiss retail banking market change, and (ii) what are the expected consequences for the consumers. The answer to the first question is based on a comparison of Herfindahl and C 3 -indices in 1997 as they actually have been to as they could have been if the banks already had been merged. For both types of indices, and for the two product groups considered (loans and mortgages, savings deposits) the impact of the merger is huge. To answer the second question, we have examined how concentration interfered with savings deposits and mortgages interest rates in the previous decade, between the cantons and over time. The results obtained for savings deposits indicate that the structure performance hypothesis dominates for large cantons, while the efficiency hypothesis and the <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> hypotheses cannot be rejected for small cantons. For mortgages, the <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> hypotheses clearly dominates for large cantons, while for small cantons evidence is split between the efficiency hypothesis and the <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> hypothesis. ...|$|E

40|$|Approximately {{three years}} have passed since {{deregulation}} in the Dublin taxi market. In this paper, Jennifer Daly demonstrates how the taxi market has changed since deregulation to benefit the consumers. Although increased benefits to consumers are confirmed by the research, the author warns about the possibility of regulatory recapture and calls for further liberal reforms in the market. According to the theory of W. J. Baumol, a <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> is one in which there is complete freedom of entry and exit for firms: It is a requirement of contestability that there be no cost discrimination against entrants. Absolute freedom of exit 8 ̆ 5 is one way to guarantee freedom of entry 8 ̆ 5 any firm can leave without impediment, and in the process of departure can recoup any costs incurred in the entry process (Baumol, 1983) This characterisation of a <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> represents the very antithesis of the regulated Dublin taxi market up until November 2000. The idea of a <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> approximates the ideal perfectly competitive market outcomes by ensuring that the possibility of new entrants to the market disciplines the incumbents in the market to behave optimally. Just over three {{years have passed}} since the High Court decision by Mr. Justice Murphy led to the removal of entry restrictions in the taxi market. Sufficient time has passed to determine whether the deregulated market represents a closer approximation to Baumols <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> and also the positive and negative aspects of the change. Ultimately, I would like to establish definitively, whether deregulation has led to a significant improvement in services, and also, the implications of taxi deregulation for other transport sectors in terms of privatisation policy, e. g. the proposed privatisation of some of the Dublin bus routes and the proposed shake up of the Aer Rianta company. Up until 1978 there had been no restrictions in the number of taxis allowed to operate in Dublin. In the period prior to regulation, increased demand for taxis le...|$|E

40|$|Banks have {{market power}} {{due to the}} {{existence}} of product differentiation, high switching costs, locational characteristics, banks specialised knowledge and segmented customers. Therefore, creating a <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> is more realistic than establishing perfect competition. This study aims to examine the role of opening the market to create contestability. In the last 30 years, the industry experienced structural changes from a closed-regulated into open-less regulated industry. The Panzar-Rosse method is employed to estimate the degree of competition, find the market structure and assess the impact of opening the market to competition. This study found that in a free entry market, banks are more competitive. The potential entrants act as market discipline so it facilitates the creation of a <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> as observed in 1989. On the other hand, the absence of potential entrants explains the lack of market discipline for the incumbents to operate efficiently in the 2000 s. contestable markets; Panzar-Rosse method; potential entrants; emerging economies; Indonesia; banking industry; regulation changes; regulatory structure; contestability; competition; bank competitiveness...|$|E

Implementation of proposals suggested by the sugar industry review working party and in some of the submissions to it are also examined.

The results indicate that although deregulation has the potential to lead to improved welfare for both growers and the mills, this will only be the case if mills price competitively, i. e. in the <b>contestable</b> <b>market</b> case where the threat of competition from neighbouring and competing mills is sufficient to force the incumbent mill to pay for cane at a competitive price to prevent the entry of potential competitors.

The real issue however, particularly with regard to continuing reforms elsewhere in Europe, is the ability of regulatory authorities to maintain competitive and contestable (free) markets and the research suggests that in the face of market forces this is simply not possible. The only conclusion therefore is that contestability in the free market is not sustainable, and thus can only be introduced directly through franchising...|$|E
