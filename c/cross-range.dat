25|$|The {{version of}} Kliper {{presented}} during the bid in January 2006 differs {{again from the}} original design. It showed a lifting body with larger wings, that, according to Energia officials, could be folded around the core crew module and unfold after atmospheric re-entry {{in order to provide}} <b>cross-range</b> and better landing accuracy for the spacecraft. The light Kliper version proposed was stripped down to 7 tons and uses the 'split-up'-option with Parom as a spacetug.|$|E
50|$|The new Air Force <b>cross-range</b> {{requirements}} doomed the DC-3 design.|$|E
50|$|Resolution {{may benefit}} from spatial diversity, due to the {{availability}} of multiple spatially diverse down-range profiles. Conventional radar typically has a much poorer <b>cross-range</b> resolution compared to down-range resolution, thus there is potential for gains through the intersection of constant bistatic range ellipses.|$|E
50|$|Image {{resolution}} of SAR in its range coordinate (expressed in image pixels per distance unit) is mainly {{proportional to the}} radio bandwidth of whatever type of pulse is used. In the <b>cross-range</b> coordinate, the similar resolution is mainly proportional to the bandwidth of the Doppler shift of the signal returns within the beamwidth. Since Doppler frequency depends on {{the angle of the}} scattering point's direction from the broadside direction, the Doppler bandwidth available within the beamwidth is the same at all ranges. Hence the theoretical spatial resolution limits in both image dimensions remain constant with variation of range. However, in practice, both the errors that accumulate with data-collection time and the particular techniques used in post-processing further limit <b>cross-range</b> resolution at long ranges.|$|E
50|$|The SV-5, the {{centerpiece}} of the START (Spacecraft Technology and Advanced Reentry Tests) project, was promoted by Multhopp as superior to NASA's M2 and HL-10 lifting body shapes, having a better lift-to-drag ratio and greater re-entry <b>cross-range</b> capability, along with better aerodynamics and improved design efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The first PRIME {{vehicle was}} {{launched}} from Vandenberg AFB on 21 December 1966 atop an Atlas launch vehicle. This mission simulated a low Earth orbit reentry with a zero <b>cross-range.</b> The ballute deployed at 99,850 feet (30.43 km), though the recovery parachute failed to completely deploy. The vehicle {{crashed into the}} Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5000|$|The Air Force also {{demanded a}} <b>cross-range</b> {{capability}} of 1,500 miles, {{meaning that the}} spacecraft {{would have to be}} able to land at a point 1500 mile km to either side of its orbital path when it started re-entry. This was due to the desire to be able to land again after one orbit, the so-called [...] "orbit-once-around".|$|E
50|$|The Martin X-23A PRIME (Precision Reentry Including Maneuvering reEntry) {{was a small}} lifting-body {{re-entry}} vehicle tested by the United States Air Force in the mid-1960s. Unlike ASSET, primarily used for structural and heating research, the X-23 PRIME was developed to {{study the effects of}} maneuvering during re-entry of Earth's atmosphere, including <b>cross-range</b> maneuvers up to 710 statute miles (1143 km) from the ballistic track.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{technical}} {{details are}} closely guarded military secrets, to hinder any development of enemy counter-measures. The bus's on-board propellant limits the distances between targets of individual warheads to {{perhaps a few}} hundred kilometers. Some warheads may use small hypersonic airfoils during the descent to gain additional <b>cross-range</b> distance. Additionally, some buses (e.g. the British Chevaline system) can release decoys to confuse interception devices and radars, such as aluminized balloons or electronic noisemakers.|$|E

5000|$|The final PRIME {{mission was}} flown on 19 April 1967, and {{simulated}} reentry from low Earth orbit with a 710-mile (1143-kilometre) <b>cross-range.</b> This time, all systems performed perfectly, and the X-23 was successfully recovered. An inspection by a USAF-Martin team reported the craft [...] "ready to fly again", although no later missions were carried out. The third X-23 {{is now on}} display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.|$|E
50|$|The Harley-Davidson Confederate Edition was a <b>cross-range</b> {{limited edition}} {{motorcycle}} made by Harley-Davidson in 1977. It was released following the successful manufacture of the Liberty Edition {{to commemorate the}} United States Bicentennial in 1976. The Confederate Edition consisted of a special commemorative paint scheme of metallic gray paint and 'rebel' flag decals on the fuel tank and an army general's sleeve braid decal on the front fender and which {{was applied to the}} Harley-Davidson Super Glide, FLH Electra Glide, Harley-Davidson Sportster XLH, XLCH and XLT models.|$|E
50|$|Program 437 Thors could {{intercept}} low earth orbiting satellites up to {{an altitude}} of 700 nmi km and a <b>cross-range</b> distance of 1500 nmi km. Two missiles were readied for launch, one as primary launcher and the other as a hot back-up in case of primary failure. Launch windows were as small as one second, also necessitating the dual missiles. Once the missile's trajectory hit the target's orbital path, the one megaton Mark 49 warhead would explode, setting off a blast radius of five miles (8 km).|$|E
5000|$|Supported by Paine's ambitious plans, in August 1969 the ILRV {{program was}} re-defined to be a [...] "maximum effort" [...] design, and only fully {{reusable}} designs would be accepted. This {{led to a}} second series of Phase A studies. The designs that were returned varied widely, meeting the huge payload range specified in the original RFP. Two basic fuselage designs {{seemed to be the}} most common; lifting body designs that offered high <b>cross-range</b> but limited maneuverability after re-entry, and delta-winged designs that reversed these criteria.|$|E
50|$|At KSC's ~30 degree north {{latitude}} {{the picture is}} similar. Over the same 90 minute orbit KSC will rotate about 1350 mile km. Unlike the equatorial orbit case, however, letting the spacecraft stay in the inclined orbit a little longer will start taking it south of the launch site, its closest point of approach being about 300 mile km to the southwest. A spacecraft wishing to return to its launch site will need about 300 miles of <b>cross-range</b> maneuverability during re-entry, and the NASA shuttle designs demanded about 450 miles {{in order to have}} some working room.|$|E
50|$|In {{honor of}} the science fiction series Star Trek, the first ship is named after the fictional {{starship}} Enterprise. To reenter the atmosphere, SpaceShipTwo folds its wings up and then returns them to their original position for an unpowered descent flight back onto the runway. The craft has a very limited <b>cross-range</b> capability, and until other planned spaceports are built worldwide, it has to land {{in the area where}} it started. Further spaceports are planned in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere, with the intention that the spaceline will have a worldwide availability and commodity in the future.|$|E
50|$|The two {{dimensions}} of a radar image are range and <b>cross-range.</b> Radar images of limited patches of terrain can resemble oblique photographs, but not ones {{taken from the}} location of the radar. This is because the range coordinate in a radar image is perpendicular to the vertical-angle coordinate of an oblique photo. The apparent entrance-pupil position (or camera center) for viewing such an image is therefore not as if at the radar, but as if at a point from which the viewer's line of sight is perpendicular to the slant-range direction connecting radar and target, with slant-range increasing from top to bottom of the image.|$|E
50|$|The upside of {{this design}} {{approach}} was {{that changes in}} the weight and balance could be addressed simply by moving the wing or re-shaping it, a common solution {{that had been used}} for decades in aircraft designâ€”including the original Douglas DC-3 whose wings were swept rearward for just this reason. The downside was that the spacecraft would have little hypersonic lift, so its ability to maneuver while re-entering would be limited and its <b>cross-range</b> would be about 300 miles. It could make up for some of this with its improved low-speed flying ability, but would still not be able to match the mandated 450 miles.|$|E
5000|$|Sharp edges {{dramatically}} reduce drag, but {{the current}} generation of thermal protection system materials are unable to withstand the considerably higher forces and temperatures experienced by sharp leading edges in reentry conditions. The relation between radius of curvature and temperature in a leading edge is inversely proportional, e.g. as radius decreases temperature increases during hypersonic flight. Vehicles with [...] "sharp" [...] leading edges have significantly higher lift to drag ratios, enhancing the fuel efficiency of sustained flight vehicles such as DARPA's HTV-3 and the landing <b>cross-range</b> and operational flexibility of reusable orbital spaceplane concepts being developed such as the Reaction Engines Skylon and Boeing X-33.|$|E
50|$|Polar orbits {{from the}} Air Force's Vandenberg Air Force Base are another matter entirely. Located {{slightly}} north of KSC, the distance it would move over a single orbit would be similar, but critically, the shuttle would be traveling south, not east. This {{meant that it}} was not flying toward the launch point as it traveled in its orbit, and when it completed one orbit it would have to make up the entire 1,350 miles during re-entry. These missions required a dramatically improved <b>cross-range</b> capability, set at 1,500 miles to give it a slight excess capability. The ballistic re-entry profile of the DC-3 series simply could not come close to matching this requirement.|$|E
5000|$|Before World War I was over, a {{specialised}} dumaresq {{proposed by}} Captain FC Dreyer {{was incorporated into}} the Dreyer Fire Control Table alongside the main one to track and nullify the influence of <b>cross-range</b> winds on the shells as they flew toward the target. In the wind dumaresq, the vector bars subtracted own ship's motion from the real wind vector to produce the relative wind vector, which was called [...] "wind you feel". A rolling spindle graph across the dial plate was spun to the present gun range and its markings indicated an additional correction to deflection {{to be applied to}} the gun sights in order to negate the crosswind's influence. This figure was read off by projecting the vector sum pipper to the roller graph.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, CNES {{commenced}} studies into a manned Ariane concept. Two different concepts for {{the vehicle}} {{were examined in}} detail, these being a capsule and a glider. In 1983, CNES opted to focus its attention on a space plane as the agency had concluded that such a vehicle would deliver greater convenience, comfort, and cost-effectiveness. Opting for a space plane approach was found to simplify recovery due to it possessing the necessary <b>cross-range</b> manoeuvrability to reach a given point on the Earth within {{the space of a}} single day, while also providing for a less challenging re-entry environment for the crew and payload, while being reusable would also serve to reduce the cost of successive missions. Critical technologies identified included thermal protection, environmental controls, life support systems, aerodynamics, and power.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to realize that only those sub-wavelength differences of successive ranges from the transmitting antenna to each target point and back, which govern signal phase, are used to refine the resolution in any geometric dimension. The central direction and the angular width of the illuminating beam do not contribute directly to creating that fine resolution. Instead, they serve only to select the solid-angle region from which usable range data are received. While some distinguishing of the ranges of different scene items can be made from the forms of their sub-wavelength range variations at short ranges, the very large depth of focus that occurs at long ranges usually requires that over-all range differences (larger than a wavelength) be used to define range resolutions comparable to the achievable <b>cross-range</b> resolution.|$|E
5000|$|Faget filed {{a patent}} for {{a space shuttle}} vehicle design in 1972. His design, which he named [...] "DC-3" [...] in homage to the famed Douglas DC-3 airliner, was a small {{two-stage}} fully reusable shuttle with a payload capacity around 15000 lb. DC-3 was officially studied by North American Aviation and shown in the press as a baseline contender for the Space Transportation System (STS). North American also studied {{a version of the}} same basic system with a much larger 50000 lb payload. However, the DC-3's nose-high re-entry profile was controversial, and eventually doomed it when the U.S. Air Force joined the Shuttle program and demanded <b>cross-range</b> performance that the DC-3 simply couldn't meet. In the end, its most lasting contribution was to clearly identify the trade-offs inherent in any reusable design.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{vehicle was}} {{launched}} on 5 March 1967. This flight simulated a 654-mile (1053-kilometre) <b>cross-range</b> reentry, and banking at hypersonic speeds. The recovery parachute deployed properly and was located {{by two of}} the deployed recovery aircraft. During an inspection fly-by of the descending parachute system it was seen that reefing cutters had failed to actuate. These cutters are on the harness suspending the vehicle from the parachute to ensure stability of the vehicle behind the JC-130B recovery aircraft during reel-in, and permit safely boarding the vehicle. As a result, the parachute and vehicle were allowed to descend to the sea. Subsequently, the vehicle separated from its flotation [...] "balloon" [...] in the rough seas and, with the parachute, sank before a nearby ship could arrive to retrieve it from the ocean.|$|E
50|$|Terrestrial or {{ground-based}} SAR Interferometry (GBInSAR or TInSAR) is {{a remote}} sensing technique for the displacement monitoring of slopes, rock scarps, volcanoes, landslides, buildings, infrastructures etc. This technique {{is based on the}} same operational principles of the Satellite SAR Interferometry, but the Synthetic Aperture of the Radar (SAR) is obtained by an antenna moving on a rail instead of a satellite moving around an orbit. SAR technique allows 2D radar image of the investigated scenario to be achieved, with a high range resolution (along the instrumental line of sight) and <b>cross-range</b> resolution (along the scan direction). Two antennas respectively emit and receive microwave signals and, by calculating the phase difference between two measurements taken in two different times, it is possible to compute the displacement of all the pixels of the SAR image. The accuracy in the displacement measurement is of the same order of magnitude as the EM wavelength and depends also on the specific local and atmospheric conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} axisymmetric {{shape is}} the sphere or spherical section. This {{can either be}} a complete sphere or a spherical section forebody with a converging conical afterbody. The aerodynamics of a sphere or spherical section are easy to model analytically using Newtonian impact theory. Likewise, the spherical section's heat flux can be accurately modeled with the Fay-Riddell equation. [...] The static stability of a spherical section is assured if the vehicle's center of mass is upstream {{from the center of}} curvature (dynamic stability is more problematic). Pure spheres have no lift. However, by flying at an angle of attack, a spherical section has modest aerodynamic lift thus providing some <b>cross-range</b> capability and widening its entry corridor. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, high-speed computers were not yet available and computational fluid dynamics was still embryonic. Because the spherical section was amenable to closed-form analysis, that geometry became the default for conservative design. Consequently, manned capsules of that era were based upon the spherical section.|$|E
50|$|The Lord Roberts Centre was a {{controversial}} building from its inception. Oriented North-East rather than due North, early morning shooters on the outdoor ranges were {{blinded by the}} sun rising over the targets. This was compounded by {{the decision not to}} include <b>cross-range</b> baffles, as are common in similar range complexes in Hannover or Munich. The first floor - where the airgun range was located - was criticised for using a sprung construction which produced noticeable bounce on the firing point. Despite this, NiccolÃ² Campriani successfully scoring a 599 and a perfect 600 score at the British Airgun Championships in 2013. Most notable however was the financial strain that this large facility placed on the NSRA, which had no experience operating a dedicated range complex. With the prohibition on both centrefire and smallbore pistols in 1997, visitor numbers from air gun and rifle shooters to the centre were insufficient to cover the operating costs, resulting in the Associationâ€™s commercial arm seeking other sources of income, including wedding receptions and a long-term deal that saw the upstairs hall configured as a roller-hockey rink.|$|E
50|$|The total {{signal is}} that from a beamwidth-sized patch of the ground. To produce a beam that is narrow in the <b>cross-range</b> direction, {{diffraction}} effects require that the antenna be wide in that dimension. Therefore, the distinguishing, from each other, of co-range points simply by strengths of returns that persist {{for as long as}} they are within the beam width is difficult with aircraft-carryable antennas, because their beams can have linear widths only about two orders of magnitude (hundreds of times) smaller than the range. (Spacecraft-carryable ones can do 10 or more times better.) However, if both the amplitude and the phase of returns are recorded, then the portion of that multi-target return that was scattered radially from any smaller scene element can be extracted by phase-vector correlation of the total return with the form of the return expected from each such element. Careful design and operation can accomplish resolution of items smaller than a millionth of the range, for example, 30 cm at 300 km, or about one foot at nearly 200 mi.|$|E
5000|$|The {{military}} role {{made this}} infeasible, however. One desired safety requirement for any spacecraft {{is the ability}} to [...] "abort once around", that is, to return for a landing after a single orbit. Since a typical low Earth orbit takes about 90 to 120 minutes, the Earth will rotate to the east about 20 to 30 degrees in that time; or for a launch from the southern United States, about 1500 mi. If the spacecraft is launched to the east this does not present a problem, but for the polar orbits required of military spacecraft, when the orbit is complete the spacecraft overflies a point far {{to the west of the}} launch site. In order to land back at the launch site, the craft needs to have considerable <b>cross-range</b> maneuverability, something that is difficult to arrange with a large smooth surface. The Delta Clipper design thus used a nose-first re-entry with flat sides on the fuselage and large control flaps to provide the needed cross range capability. Experiments with the control of such a re-entry profile had never been tried, and were a major focus of the project.|$|E
5000|$|The study {{identified}} {{a number of}} issues with development of this option: [...] "On the one hand, the Apollo system is well understood, and proved to be a highly successful, rugged system with a very capable launch abort system. Documentation would be very helpful in leading the designers. On the other hand, nearly every system would have to be redesigned, even if it were to be replicated. None of the existing hardware (such as CMs in Museums) was thought to be usable, because of age, obsolescence, lack of traceability, and water immersion. There would be no need for fuel cells or cryogenics, and modern guidance and communications would be lighter and less expensive. Although the flight hardware would be less expensive, {{and its impact on the}} Expendable Launch Vehicles would be minimal (it's just another axisymmetrical payload), the landing sites for the CRV may drive the Life Cycle costs high. By adding a Service Module (smaller than the one required to go to the moon), orbital <b>cross-range</b> of 3000 to 5000 ft/s, might be gained, and the number of landing sites radically reduced. If land landings can be added to the system safely, another major reduction in life cycle costs would result, because the team believed that the system could be made re-usable." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Space Shuttle was {{the first}} {{operational}} orbital spacecraft designed for reuse. It carried different payloads to low Earth orbit, provided crew rotation and supplies for the International Space Station (ISS), and performed satellite servicing and repair. The orbiter could also recover satellites and other payloads from orbit and return them to Earth. Each Shuttle was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or ten years of operational life, although this was later extended. The person in charge of designing the STS was Maxime Faget, who had also overseen the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft designs. The crucial factor in {{the size and shape}} of the Shuttle orbiter was the requirement that it be able to accommodate the largest planned commercial and military satellites, and have over 1,000 mile <b>cross-range</b> recovery range to meet the requirement for classified USAF missions for a once-around abort from a launch to a polar orbit. The militarily specified [...] cross range requirement was one of the primary reasons for the Shuttle's large wings, compared to modern commercial designs with very minimal control surfaces and glide capability. Factors involved in opting for solid rockets and an expendable fuel tank included the desire of the Pentagon to obtain a high-capacity payload vehicle for satellite deployment, and the desire of the Nixon administration to reduce the costs of space exploration by developing a spacecraft with reusable components.|$|E
50|$|In general, a {{microwave}} imaging system has two parts, namely: {{hardware and software}} (or post-processing). The hardware part collects data from the sample under test. A transmitter antenna sends EM waves towards the sample under test (e.g., human body for medical imaging). If the sample is made of only homogeneous material which extends to infinity, theoretically no EM wave will be reflected. Introduction of any anomaly which has different properties (i.e., electrical/magnetic) {{in comparison with the}} surrendering homogeneous medium may reflect a portion of the EM wave. The bigger the difference between the properties of the anomaly and the surrounding medium is, the stronger the reflected wave will be. This reflection will be collected and measured by the same antenna (in monostatic case) or a different receiver antenna (in bistatic case).To increase <b>cross-range</b> resolution of the imaging system, several antennas should be distributed over an area (which is called sampling area) with a spacing less than the operating wavelength. However, by having several antennas placed close to each other, the mutual coupling between antennas may degrade the accuracy of the collected signals. Moreover, transmitter and receiver system will become very complex. To address these problems, one single scanning antenna is used instead of several antennas. Later, when the antenna finishes scanning the entire sampling area, one can put together collected data all over the sampling area and process them together, simultaneously. In fact, a synthetic (virtual) aperture is produced by moving the antenna (similar to the synthetic aperture radar principle). Later, the collected data, which is sometimes referred to as raw data, is fed into the software for processing. Depending on the applied processing algorithm, microwave imaging techniques can be categorized as quantitative and qualitative.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{generalized}} maximum integration angle for ISAR {{imaging system}} before uncorrected rotation produces defocusing in <b>cross-range</b> is presented {{which is in}} terms of allowable two-way phase deviation. It is assumed that the radar is in the far field of the target so that no significant range deviation exists over the targetâ€™s <b>cross-range</b> extent. What remains is the range deviation produced when a scattered first approaches and then recedes from the radar the <b>cross-range</b> resolution in unfocused ISAR is limited by the maximum integration angle, and a Focused Aperture ISAR is desirable for a larger integration angle...|$|E

40|$|Recognition of convoys {{of ground}} {{vehicles}} and {{estimation of the}} <b>cross-range</b> convoy length component during tracking by radar is discussed in this study. Radar with multi-channel array antenna is assumed. Such antenna offers the potential of spatial and space-time signal processing. For estimation of the <b>cross-range</b> length component generalised power estimators are used. In presence of ground clutter such techniques require an moving target indication (MTI) function including clutter suppression. In the case of moving radar space-time clutter suppression such as space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is required. It is shown that the direction of motion {{as well as the}} <b>cross-range</b> of the convoy can be retrieved from data obtained during tracking...|$|E
