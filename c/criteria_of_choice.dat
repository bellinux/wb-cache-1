Traditionally, the analysis of maternal deaths has been the <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for evaluating women's health {{and the quality of}} obstetric care. Due to the success of modern medicine such deaths have become very rare in developed countries, which has led to an increased interest in analyzing so-called [...] "near miss" [...] events.|$|E

(A mapping onto the set of real numbers instead yields real-valued utility.) Formally one posits a mapping V: X→ Rn, where n refers to the arbitrarily many or few dimensions of the vector and corresponds {{to the number of}} <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> Hence, let the vector v(x) = v2(x),… represent the scores vi(x) of an alternative x on various characteristics or criteria i = 1,2,…., arranged in decreasing order of importance. Define v(y) similarly. Then x is better than y if the first nonzero component of the vector difference v(x)- v(y) is positive. The term lexicographic refers to the fact that dictionaries similarly order words by their successive components, i.e. letters.|$|E
5000|$|He {{then goes}} on to show how, {{although}} these criteria admittedly determine theory choice, they are imprecise in practice and relative to individual scientists. According to Kuhn, [...] "When scientists must choose between competing theories, two men fully committed to the same list of criteria for choice may nevertheless reach different conclusions." [...] For this reason, the criteria still are not [...] "objective" [...] in the usual sense of the word because individual scientists reach different conclusions with the same criteria due to valuing one criterion over another or even adding additional criteria for selfish or other subjective reasons. Kuhn {{then goes on}} to say, [...] "I am suggesting, of course, that the <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> with which I began function not as rules, which determine choice, but as values, which influence it." [...] Because Kuhn utilizes the history of science in his account of science, his criteria or values for theory choice are often understood as descriptive normative rules (or more properly, values) of theory choice for the scientific community rather than prescriptive normative rules in the usual sense of the word [...] "criteria", although there are many varied interpretations of Kuhn's account of science.|$|E

50|$|From the Alfonsist {{perspective}} all {{the above}} was irrelevant debates between supporters of usurper dynasty. The Alfonsists were almost entirely united behind their candidate, Don Juan; only minor controversies {{related to his}} older brother, who on basis of his disability renounced all heritage rights in 1933 to backtrack in 1941 and to declare himself head of the House of Bourbon and legitimate heir to the French throne.Franco’s views on monarchy are not entirely clear. He was a loyal subject of Alfonso XIII, who sort of courted his young officer personally. Hence, during the Republic years the Alfonsists were somewhat disappointed by Franco standing clear of monarchist initiatives. His engagement in military plot of 1936 was not motivated by monarchist zeal; {{like most of the}} plotters he was bent on confronting proto-revolutionary Left and preventing apparent implosion of the state. During the Civil War he remained highly ambiguous about a would-be restoration, at some stage concluding that sort of it might be necessary as means of sustaining the regime. He cared little about dynastical debates and it seems compliance with his own vision and acceptance of his own leadership were the key <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> The dictator appreciated Carlism as its anti-democratic outlook to a large extent overlapped his own, but realized also that within the Spanish society it was a minority option and an Alfonsist candidate was more practicable, especially that Alfonsist sympathies prevailed among the top military. Since heads of both branches, Don Juan and Don Javier, refused to be domesticated, caudillo concluded he should proceed on monarchist path as slowly as possible and keeping all options opened. It seems that at that stage Franco considered nothing settled except that a future king is appointed on his own terms.|$|E

The main result of this analysis is, that intergenerational criteria as an aggregation of preferences of current and future individuals do not exist. The extension of social choice theory to intergenerational problems necessarily leads to criteria that are intragenerational in nature. This fact is due to the epistemological difference between actual and potential individuals. The consequences for the structure of welfare functional in presence of intergenerational choice are analysed...|$|E
