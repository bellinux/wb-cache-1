40|$|Mycoplasmas (class mollicutes) are the {{smallest}} self-replicating bacteria. They are obligate parasites {{in a wide}} range of organisms, including humans, plants, and animals. This thesis describes studies related to Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides Small Colony (MmmSC), the etiological agent of <b>contagious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>pleuropneumoniae,</b> Mycoplasma capricolum (Mcap), causing caprine pneumonia, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp), the etiological agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia, Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu), a commensal of human urogenital tract causing nongonococcal urethritis, Mycoplasma genitalium (Mg), a causative agent of nongonococcal, chlamydia-negative urethritis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mpn) causing atypical pneumonia and tracheobronchitis. The first part concerns deoxynucleoside metabolism in Uu and growth inhibition of Uu and Mpn by nucleoside analogs. The uptake and metabolism of the deoxynucleosides, thymidine (dThd), deoxyuridine, deoxycytidine were studied and all these deoxynucleosides were readily taken up by Uu and dThd showed the highest rate of uptake. Pyrimidine nucleosides e. g., fluoropyrimidines gave complete inhibition of Uu growth. The addition of dUrd and dThd to the growth medium abolished inhibitory effect. These results suggested a new pathway of thymidylate synthesis in Uu. The second part deals with identification of a new family of flavin-dependent thymidylate synthases (FDTS) in mycoplasmas. Thymidylate synthases (TS) are essential enzymes in the de novo synthesis of thymidylate and are coded either by thyA or thyX genes. Analysis of the fully sequenced Mycoplasma genomes revealed that there were no TS genes annotated in the genomes of Uu, MmmSC, Mhp, and Mcap. Still, TS activities were detected in Uu and MmmSC extracts. By using a bioinformatics approach together with biochemical methods putative genes for (FDTS) were identified in Uu, MmmSC, Mhp and Mcap genomes and functional verified. New members of this family were also discovered in Mg and Mpn, which also have the thyA genes. These mycoplasma FDTS have similar catalytic activity to the ThyX proteins, but share very little sequence homology to the known bacterial ThyX. The sequence homologies within Mycoplasma FDTS were also very low. Since Mycoplasma FDTS share no sequence or structural homology to ThyA or ThyX this makes them promising targets for future design of new antibiotics...|$|R

Known diseases in this area {{with the potential to}} decrease livestock production and to be exacerbated by climate change include zoonotic tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), <b>contagious</b> <b>bovine</b> and caprine <b>pleuropneumonia</b> (CBPP and CCPP, respectively), trypanosomiasis, brucellosis, protozoal diseases such as giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, and Rift Valley fever (Kazwala et al. 2001; Wilson 2003; Clifford et al. 2008; Mazet et al. 2009; Roug et al. 2014). The availability of livestock health services and laboratory diagnostic tools to identify and treat disease in villages near Ruaha National Park is limited, a situation not uncommon in pastoral regions in Tanzania (Rutabanzibwa 2002).

40|$|Mycoplasmas {{frequently}} infect cattle, causing especially respiratory diseases. Mycoplasma bovis is {{the most}} important pathogenic species in countries free of <b>bovine</b> <b>contagious</b> <b>pleuropneumonia.</b> This species was frequently isolated in Belgium from cattle with respiratory disease. Furthermore, associations were often observed with pasteurellas and bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Of these M. bovis isolates, many were resistant to several antimicrobial agents which are used in cattle practice, except to fluoroquinolones. Inasmuch the high frequency of M. bovis isolation and antibiotic resistances, {{it is very important to}} understand the pathogenicity of this bacteria in order to optimize prophylactic tools. Therefore, the study of the cytadherence of M. bovis is essential since it represents the first step of the bacterial infection. According to our experimental results, PG 45 is not representative of field isolates because of its low adherence rates to various cell lines. This could be explained by the high number of subcultures of this pathogenic strain underwent since its first isolation, which sharply contrasts with other isolates. M. bovis adheres specifically to bovine bronchial epithelial cells in primary culture. Proteins such as variable surface proteins C and F are involved in this step as observed by decreased adherence rates after trypsinization of mycoplasma cells or addition of monoclonal antibodies.

40|$|Abstract Background Ruminant mycoplasmoses are {{important}} diseases worldwide and several are listed by the World Organization for Animal Health {{to be of}} major economic significance. In France the distribution of mycoplasmal species isolated from clinical samples collected from diseased animals upon veterinary request, is monitored by a network known as VIGIMYC (for VIGIlance to MYCoplasmoses of ruminants). The veterinary diagnostic laboratories collaborating with VIGIMYC are responsible for isolating the mycoplasmas while identification of the isolates is centralized by the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA) in Lyon. The VIGIMYC framework {{can also be used}} for specific surveys and one example, on the prevalence of M. bovis in bovine respiratory diseases, is presented here. Results Between 2003 and 2008, 34 laboratories were involved in the network and 1904 mycoplasma isolates, originating from the main ruminant-breeding areas, were identified. For cattle, the high prevalence of M. bovis in bronchopneumonia, notably in young animals, was confirmed by VIGIMYC and an associated specific survey, whereas the non-emergence of species such as M. alkalescens and M. canis was also demonstrated. The etiological agent of <b>bovine</b> <b>contagious</b> <b>pleuropneumonia</b> was never isolated. The principal mycoplasmosis in goats was contagious agalactia with M. mycoides subsp. capri as main agent. Ovine mycoplasmoses, most of which were associated with pneumonia in lambs, were infrequently reported. One exception was ovine contagious agalactia (due to M. agalactiae) that has recently re-emerged in the Pyrénées where it had been endemic for years and was also reported in Corsica, which was previously considered free. Conclusions Although VIGIMYC is a passive network and somewhat biased as regards sample collection and processing, it has provided, in this study, an overview of the main mycoplasmoses of ruminants in France. The French epidemiological situation is compared to those existing elsewhere in the world. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractContagious <b>bovine</b> <b>pleuropneumonia</b> (CBPP) is {{the most}} serious cattle disease in Africa, caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small-colony type (SC).

Recently, an lppQ− mutant of the existing vaccine strain T 1 / 44 has been developed (Janis et al., 2008). This T 1 lppQ− mutant strain is devoid of lipoprotein LppQ, a potential virulence attribute of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. It is designated as a potential live DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccine strain allowing both serological and etiological differentiation. The present paper reports on the validation of a control strategy for CBPP in cattle, whereby a TaqMan real-time PCR based on the lppQ gene has been developed for the direct detection of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC in ex vivo bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of cows and for the discrimination of wild type strains from the lppQ− mutant vaccine strain...|$|R
