5000|$|<b>Chloroprednisone</b> is {{a topical}} {{glucocorticoid}} first reported in 1960. [...] It is a chlorinated derivative of prednisone. The acetate ester prodrug, <b>chloroprednisone</b> 21-acetate, was sold under {{the brand name}} Topilan as an anti-inflammatory agent.|$|E

50|$|There {{is little}} {{published}} about <b>chloroprednisone.</b> This {{may be due}} to limited activity topically because the skin lacks the necessary activating enzyme 11-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Systemically, this agent's activity on Glucocorticoid receptors may not have competed with agents like Fludrocortisone or Dexamethasone.|$|E
40|$|In {{fluprednisolone}} and <b>chloroprednisone</b> acetate, the polarographic {{reduction of}} the carbon—halogen bond in position 6 occurs first. The carbanion—enolate formed is reduced at the dropping mercury electrode at more negative potentials than the conjugate acid. Controlled potential electrolysis at a mercury pool electrode where the carbanion—enolate can be protonated, yields the unsaturated ketone. Polarographic reduction of clobetasol- 17 -propionate and of clobetasone- 17 -butyrate results in cleavage of the C—Cl bond in the side-chain. This process is followed by {{reduction of the}} α,β-unsaturated ketone in the A-ring. Analytical methods for the determination of these compounds in ointments, creams and eye/ear drops gave results with standard deviations of 1 – 2 %...|$|E
