500|$|Dye-bearing lichen {{produce a}} wide range of greens, oranges, yellows, reds, browns, and bright pinks and purples. The lichen Rocella tinctoria was found along the Mediterranean Sea and was used by the ancient Phoenicians. [...] In recent times, lichen dyes have been an {{important}} part of the dye traditions of Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and among native peoples of the southwest and Intermontane Plateaus of the United States. [...] Scottish lichen dyes include cudbear (also called archil in England and litmus in the Netherlands), and <b>crottle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Parmelia saxatilis, {{commonly}} known as the salted shield lichen or <b>crottle,</b> is a species of foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{traditional}} dyes of the Scottish Highlands were made from lichens including red dyes from the cudbear lichen, Lecanora tartarea, the common orange lichen, Xanthoria parietina, and several species of leafy Parmelia lichens. Brown or yellow lichen dyes (called <b>crottle</b> or crotal), made from Parmelia saxatilis scraped off rocks, and red lichen dyes (called corkir) were used extensively to produce tartans.|$|E
50|$|Additional symbolia terms include whiteope, sphericasia, that-a-tron, spurls, oculama, <b>crottles,</b> maledicta balloons, farkles, doozex, staggeration, boozex, digitrons, nittles, and jarns.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s and 80s, Costikyan was {{a leading}} player of Slobbovia. His novel One Quest, Hold the Dragons {{includes}} several stories about <b>crottled</b> greeps, a Slobbovian meme.|$|R
50|$|Slobbovia, being {{a widely}} diversified culture, had a widely varied range of cuisines. Certain foods, however, were ubiquitous, {{such as the}} peasant staples of gravel and dirt and, of course, <b>crottled</b> greeps.|$|R
50|$|Julius Ricardo hitches a lift home {{across the}} English Channel from Lézardrieux to Dartmouth on a friend's ketch in {{response}} to an unexpected visit to London from his friend Inspector Hanaud. En route they pick up an escapee from a prison ship, who holds a grudge against Daniel Horbury, M.P. When Horbury is found dead at his home in Lordship Lane, Hanaud and Ricardo assist Scotland Yard in the investigation, which also involves Septimus <b>Crottle,</b> the patriarchal owner of the Dagger shipping line, and his extended family.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} are the principal dyestuffs with the colours they produce. Several of the tints are very bright, but have now been superseded for convenience of usage by various mineral dyes. The Latin names are given where known and also the Scottish Gaelic names for various ingredients. Amateurs may wish to experiment {{with some of the}} suggestions, as urine (human or animal) is used in many recipes as a mordant. A number of the recipes used are for more than one colour, and that this chart is only a guide, and also that Scottish Gaelic spelling is subject to variations. Many of the dyes are made from lichens, the useful ones for this purpose being known as <b>crottle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Melfans are amphibious, being {{comfortable}} in water or on land. They eat every ten hours, and sleep {{for four hours}} in between. Their favourite dishes include swamp nuts and live <b>crottled</b> greeps, although at Sector General {{they have to make}} do with moving electrically charged substitutes.|$|R
50|$|Nobody {{was sure}} whether greeps were cultivated, herded, hunted, fished or mined, {{or whether they}} were even greeps before <b>crottling.</b> Greeps when first {{introduced}} into the writing were the subject of some competitive and conflicting claims. Each player and story would correct the previous story {{as to whether the}} greep was animal, vegetable or mineral. The matter was finally settled when a biology student wrote an article about the migration of greep DNA through a variety of mediums during its life cycle, and so the various greep dishes depended on the point in the greep's life cycle at which it was harvested.|$|R
5000|$|Several fannish memes {{had their}} origin, were further developed, or were {{introduced}} to a new audience {{in the pages of}} the Slobbinpolit Zhurnal. <b>Crottled</b> greeps, a legendarily indescribable foodstuff long known of in science fiction fanzines, became a Slobbovian staple. The concept of [...] "retrograde progress" [...] (bows and arrows are better than firearms, etc.; see [...] "Technology" [...] above) proved popular. And then there were cronks: small, sub-intelligent beasts with a vocabulary of one word, [...] "Birdie!", meaning [...] "anything edible by a cronk": rooks, people, other cronks, the cronk's foot, etc. also could say [...] "not Birdie" [...] but there are no confirmed reports of any material or thing falling into this latter classification.|$|R
50|$|Kissling {{spent the}} summer of 1934 {{on the island of}} Eriskay in the Western Isles of Scotland. As well as taking many photographs, he also filmed the {{traditional}} way of life on the island. This footage presents the residents of the island at the time (1934), observing them as they go about their season-dependent daily routines. There are scenes of peat collecting, sheep shearing and dipping, and repairing of fishing nets. In addition we are presented with scenes of the various stages in the manufacture of tweel (tweed), including the collecting of <b>crottle</b> (“or lichen, as it is known elsewhere”), and the ‘waulking of the tweed’. These views of the islanders at work are intermingled with panoramic shots of the island and its bays, including shots of the Eriskay fishing boats, as they head off to the fishing grounds, the Eriskay Pony, and Kissling’s own yacht, Elspeth.|$|E
50|$|Adrift in {{deep space}} with a rapidly {{diminishing}} oxygen supply, Abelard Snazz is cryogenically preserved after a passing meteor ruptures his space suit’s thermostat and freezes his body. Two thousand years later, a passing race of morose, Viking-like beings, the Farbians, rescue Snazz and bring him and the corroded remains of Edwin aboard their ship. After Snazz is defrosted and gets his bearings, he gleefully disposes of Edwin’s remains via the ship’s garbage disposal chute. The Farbians take Snazz back to their home planet, Farbus. The Farbians believe that Snazz is a god-like being, the “Toglub of the Two-Fold Gaze,” and worship him accordingly. They also inform Snazz {{that he is the}} fulfillment of a prophecy - that the Toglub has been sent to deliver Farbus from three major calamities: their economic crisis, caused by the “Farbian Crottle” weed killing all their vegetation; their energy crisis, caused by a lack of fuel; and the crisis of a black hole’s imminent approach to the planet. Snazz is duly informed that, should the Toglub fail to solve these three problems in a single stroke, he will be thrown to the Piranha-Dogs. After much thought, Snazz discovers that the Farbian <b>Crottle</b> is overrun and fed on by the intelligent “Farbian Crottle-Worms” - “the most saintly and good-natured beings in known space.” Snazz creates a “virtue converter” to transform the worms’ good thoughts into an unlimited supply of energy - thus solving the energy crisis. Snazz theorises that other races will want to harness this source of energy, and the Farbians can sell abundant supplies of Farbian <b>Crottle</b> to them - thus solving the economic crisis. As for the black hole, Snazz comes {{up with the idea of}} stitching up the hole with a thread-like stream of “cohesive neutrinos” from a faster-than-light spaceship, piloted by himself and powered by Farbian Crottle-Worms. This plan initially works, until the Farbians praise the worms. An enraged Snazz declares that all the thanks should go to him, and that the worms are merely a bunch of “do-gooder maggots” and “mindless invertebrates.” The worms are so insulted that they lose their good thoughts, and thus the ship loses power - and is sucked into the black hole.|$|E
5000|$|Slobbovians {{were also}} heavy drinkers. Think of a {{particularly}} inebriated society, and Slobbovians would put them to shame. Besides beer, wine, whiskey {{and most of the}} other spirits familiar to us, {{there were a number of}} peculiarly Slobbovian alcoholic beverages: Schnarg was fermented from <b>crottled</b> greeps, the best being brewed in gymnasiums in Phumpha where, when the casks started to explode, the brewer knew his schnarg was ready. Schnarq was distilled from what was left behind in the casks from brewing schnarg, and was an extremely popular beverage. Kummis was made from fermented weasel's milk, and was favored by the Huns. Skumjas was distilled from something too disgusting to mention [...] "Skumjack" [...] in Venturian. And screech (based on the Newfoundland drink of that name), like vodka, was distilled from whatever was available. A shot of screech would cause the drinker to screech in agony, thus the name. Its taste did not recommend it. It was a favorite drink of the Venturians, which says something one is reluctant to discuss about either screech or Venturians.|$|R
