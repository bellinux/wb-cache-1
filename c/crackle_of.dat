25|$|Joubert did {{not plan}} on {{fighting}} at Novi Ligure, but {{the position that}} his troops held was well-suited for a defensive battle. Facing north, the French held an arc of high ground from Serravalle {{on the right to}} Pasturana on the left. In the center, Novi was surrounded by a wall and ditch dating to the Middle Ages. One weakness of the position was that the deep ravines of the Riasco and Braghena streams cut across the rear, obstructing any retreat. Kray had the Allied right wing in movement before dawn with Bellegarde on the right and Ott on the left. Seckendorf on the far right aimed for the place where the Riasco stream emerged from its ravine. The <b>crackle</b> <b>of</b> muskets began at 3:20 am as the Austrian columns bumped into French picket lines. This provoked a great racket in the French camps as their surprised troops rushed into formation. At first light, the Allies saw that the heights were crowned by the blue lines of French infantry. Instead of striking the flank of an enemy army on the move, the Austrians of the right wing were making a frontal attack on a strong position.|$|E
500|$|An Enta da Stage {{review on}} OhWord.com praises the {{production}} work, stating [...] "Though the album's success is largely attributable to Buckshot's performance, one cannot ignore the phenomenal production from the Beatminerz. They took the already dark sound of The Low End Theory and one-upped it, filtering out almost all treble and using spare, hardcore drum samples. The compositions of Mr. Walt and Evil Dee are also cleverly structured, propelling Buckshot's raps {{directly into the}} listener's psyche."..."The <b>crackle</b> <b>of</b> scratched vinyl pervades the album, contributing to the feel of warmth and timelessness. Thanks to the Beatminerz, there is something inviting about Enta da Stage, despite its confrontational lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{incorporates}} musical {{references to}} both older and contemporary hip hop. Its production features live instrumentation, orchestral music, R, and boom bap elements. Music journalist Evan Rytlewski denotes [...] "boom-bap drums, lush keyboards, smooth saxophones, {{and the occasional}} Run-D.M.C. and MC Shan sample" [...] to be [...] "tasteful accents" [...] from golden age hip hop. Ryan Hamm of Under the Radar views that Remi and No I.D.'s production [...] "lean toward opulent and epic", while Pitchfork Medias Jayson Greene writes that the latter's produced songs [...] "exude the warm TV-fireplace <b>crackle</b> <b>of</b> ... throwback production." [...] Anupa Mistry of Now writes that [...] "boom bap classicists Salaam Remi and No I.D. weave a raw, funky, orchestral lattice customized for Nas's age-appropriate raps".|$|E

500|$|Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald praised Webber's {{ability to}} [...] "... build {{individual}} moments [...] the <b>crackle</b> <b>of</b> a bed-sheet which has grown an ice overcoat after being hung {{out to dry}} in the wintry air ...," [...] but opined that he failed to [...] "... invest these elegant reproductions {{of the art of}} the period with the emotional charge you've been set up to expect." [...] Griet and Vermeer's relationship, Hall wrote, lacked [...] "... the sense of two people breathing easily in one another's company." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, remarked that Girl with a Pearl Earring [...] "... brings off something that few dramas about artists do. It gets you to see the world through new– which is to say, old– eyes." [...] Gleiberman added that while Johansson is silent for most of the film, [...] "... the interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic." [...] In Sight & Sound, David Jays wrote that [...] "Johansson's marvellous performance builds on the complex innocence of her screen presence (Ghost World, Lost in Translation)." [...] Jays concluded his review by praising Webber and Serra's ability to [...] "... deftly deploy daylight, candle and shadow, denying our desire to see clearly just as Vermeer refuses to explicate the situations in his paintings. The film's scenarios may be unsurprising, but Webber's solemn evocation of art in a grey world gives his story an apt, unspoken gravity." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel {{met with}} [...] "a <b>crackle</b> <b>of</b> {{favorable}} reviews in major papers". The New Republic hailed it as [...] "an exceptional work", both [...] "thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative". The Houston Chronicle described Clarke as [...] "a superb character writer", and the Denver Post {{called her a}} [...] "superb storyteller". The reviews praised Clarke's [...] "deft" [...] handling of the pastiche of styles, but many criticised the novel's pace, The Guardian complaining that [...] "the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles". In his review for Science Fiction Weekly, Clute suggested that [...] "almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately trimmed" [...] (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke's Austenesque tone {{gets in the way}} of plot development. On the other hand, The Baltimore Sun found the novel [...] "a quick read". Complaining that the book leaves the reader [...] "longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry", The Washington Post reviewer noted, with others, that [...] "sex plays virtually no role in the story... one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent". The New Statesman reviewer, Amanda Craig, praised the novel as [...] "a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen– or, perhaps, by the young Mrs Radcliffe, whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key." [...] However, she also criticised the book: [...] "As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards are the ultimate expression of rank's irrelevance to talent". However, reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points.
