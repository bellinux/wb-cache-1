5|$|Prisoners {{would often}} take their {{families}} with them, {{which meant that}} entire communities sprang up inside the debtors' jails. The community created its own economy, with jailers charging for room, food, drink and furniture, or selling concessions to others, and attorneys charging fees in fruitless efforts to get the debtors out. Prisoners' families, including children, often had to find employment simply to <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, Nixon {{received}} an annual salary of $12,500 (about $150,000 in 2009 dollars). While he {{received an}} expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because California {{was one of the}} most populous states), that money went to pay his staff of 12 and to <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses.

5|$|The {{group were}} {{surprised}} to see how small and technically basic the studio was, with only one microphone in {{the centre of the}} room. Phillips demanded that they pay for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 shillings and 6 pence, but he then asked for an extra surcharge (£1) to <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of transferring the tape recording to acetate disc. As this was too expensive, Phillips said that for a cut-rate price they would not be taped first, but record directly to vinyl.|$|E
5|$|A deal {{to upgrade}} {{several of the}} Chinooks was reached in May 1991. Under this arrangement, seven of the {{surviving}} CH-47Cs were sold to the US Army for $A40 million, the funds being used to partly <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of upgrading the remaining four to CH-47D standard. The {{total cost of the}} project was $A62 million, of which $A42 million was required to upgrade the four helicopters and the remainder for spare parts, administration and new facilities for the Chinooks at Townsville. All eleven Chinooks were shipped to the United States in September 1993, and the upgraded helicopters returned to Australia in 1995. It was decided to transfer the Chinooks to the Australian Army, as by this time the RAAF no longer had significant expertise in operating the type and doing so would concentrate all of the ADF's battlefield helicopters with the same service.|$|E

This claim was supported by an alleged letter from Dre to Nicole Threatt Young that indicated that Dre had shared his experience witnessing the Burning Man festival with her.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Cooper {{made her}} Paralympic debut at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona.

The Federation made an {{emergency}} appeal for funding from the public in order to <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of transporting the Australian team to Barcelona. A variety of small donations allowed Cooper and other Australian athletes to compete. She won three gold and two silver medals, and broke two world records and three Paralympic records. She was offered a non-residential Australian Institute of Sport Athletes with a Disability swimming scholarship in 1993 and was supported until 2000.|$|E
5|$|Despite the setbacks, Kasztner, Hansi Brand and {{the rest}} of the {{committee}} secured the release of around 1,684 Jews, including 273 children, who were allowed to leave Budapest for Switzerland by train on 30 June 1944. The committee paid SS officer Kurt Becher $1000 per person in foreign currency, shares, jewellery and gold, raised from the wealthier passengers to <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the rest. After an unexplained detour to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, the passengers arrived in Switzerland in two batches in August and December that year. Joel Brand's mother, sister and niece were on the train, as were 10 members of Kasztner's family and 388 people from the Kolozsvár ghetto in his home town. Kastner's relationship with these passengers led to the criticism that his negotiations with Becher had focused on saving people he knew, an allegation that led to his assassination in 1957.|$|E

5|$|Higher {{education}} students normally attend university from age 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree. There are over 90universities in England, {{all but one}} of which are public institutions. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the government department responsible for higher education in England. Students are generally entitled to student loans to <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of tuition fees and living costs. The first degree offered to undergraduates is the Bachelor's degree, which usually takes three years to complete. Students are then able to work towards a postgraduate degree, which usually takes one year, or towards a doctorate, which takes three or more years.|$|E
5|$|In February 1919, {{with the}} war over, the C {{submitted}} a new bill that included provisions for an extension of time for the tunnel enlargement works approved {{in the act of}} 1913. The resulting act was passed on 19 August 1919 as the City and South London Railway Act, 1919. In 1920, under special wartime provisions, the LER was granted an extension of time to carry out the works for its own 1913 act. Although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were {{not in a position to}} raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the companies could not <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of repaying borrowed capital.|$|E
5|$|No {{immediate}} {{effort was}} made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War I started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which compulsory purchases had to be made of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works.

5|$|The College {{was founded}} by Archbishop of Canterbury William Courtenay in 1395. Courtenay died in 1396 and the College and church were {{completed}} by his successor, Thomas Arundel. Richard II endowed the College with land and income from the Hospital of St Peter and St Paul in Maidstone and from the parishes of Linton, Farleigh, Sutton and Crundale. The College was also granted the advowsons for the parishes. To <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of building the College, Courtenay obtained a bull to levy a charge of fourpence in the pound on all ecclesiastical revenue raised in his archbishopric. For most of its existence, the college had an establishment of a master and six chaplains.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to the dealership to help <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. The customers then negotiate {{the value of their}} items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E
5|$|After {{the move}} to Stoney Lane, Albion held four {{exhibition}} games to help <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the ground. The first of these was a 4–1 win against Third Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers on 5 September 1885, in front of 2,122 spectators. Tommy Green scored a hat-trick, including the first goal to be scored at Stoney Lane. As league football {{had yet to be}} established, the club also played {{in a number of other}} friendly matches throughout the season. Their 31 friendly matches included 21 wins and 9 defeats, while one match against Bolton Wanderers was abandoned with the game still scoreless. Albion's joint biggest friendly victories of the season were their 7–0 wins against Small Heath Alliance, Aston Unity and Halliwell. The season's heaviest friendly defeat was the 0–7 reverse at home to Preston North End. Albion also took part in the Walsall Senior Cup and Birmingham Charity Cup, but entered a reserve team for both competitions.|$|E
