40|$|The {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by a problem concerning the monotonicity of <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> {{with respect to their}} loading parameter: the larger the parameter, the larger the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is expected to be. This property, usually called loading monotonicity, is satisfied by premiums that appear in the literature. The increased interest in constructing new <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> has raised a question as to what weight functions would produce loading-monotonic premiums. In this paper we demonstrate a decisive role of log-supermodularity in answering this question. As a consequence, we establish - at a stroke - the loading monotonicity of a number of well-known <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> and offer a host of further weight functions, and consequently of premiums, thus illustrating the power of the herein suggested methodology for constructing loading-monotonic <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{considers}} {{the impact of}} risk management and monitoring costs on insurer’s monitoring activities and investigates the relationship between risk management and monitoring activities and setting {{the level of the}} <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> The main results of this article are as follows. First, a firm always undertakes risk management when the risk management cost is low. Second, when the insurer can spontaneously choose the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium,</b> the insurer’s incentive to monitor the firm decreases, and risk management activities will not be promoted, because the cost of the accident can be directly reflected in the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> In contrast, when the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is exogenously decided, the insurer’s incentive to monitor the firm increases and risk management activities will be promoted, because the cost of accidents cannot be directly reflected in the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> These results have the following implications for policy making. First, the results imply that policy should be designed to lower risk management costs by offering a platform for firms to exchange useful information with each other and/or reduce taxes for investments that lower risk management costs. Second, the results imply that both heavy <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> regulation and the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> deregulation to realize a fierce competitive insurance market are desirable for promoting risk management activities...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by the observation that countries in adverse extemal financial situations have to make larger use of more expensive trade financing and payment arrangements. It attempts {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the channels through which the external financial situation of debtor countries affects their trade financing, and to identify the determinants of the costs associated with such financing. These costs reflect the higher risk of default associated with credits extended to them and include, for example, interest rate spreads and <b>credit</b> <b>insurance</b> premia. For the purpose of demonstrating the channels through which the perception of such a risk influences these costs, the study adopts the perspective of a "small" creditor or credit insurer, meaning that the risk is exogenous to the creditor/insurer. This leaves the problem of incorporating these risks in the <b>credit</b> <b>insurance</b> premia and interest rate spreads. For this purpose, a theoretical concept of the determination of <b>credit</b> <b>insurance</b> premia is established. Based on the idea that export <b>credit</b> <b>insurance,</b> viewed as a security, is similar to a contingent claim, such as a European put option, the concept uses tools from option pricing theory. Some of its implications are compared with observations and found to be consistent with them, i. e. there is some support for the following hypotheses. The less favourable a country's solvency and liquidity indicators, the higher are the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> rates applying to it, the latter indicators appearing to be relatively more important than the former ones. Moreover, they are higher the greater the volatility of the rates of change in these indicators. The impact of the share of public (and publicly guaranteed) debt in total foreign debt on the costs of external financing is discussed within the same theoretical framework. It is shown that these costs may be a non-monotonic function of that share...|$|R

5000|$|Where {{the life}} {{insurance}} is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held {{outside of the}} superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> This means that no additional deductible contributions {{can be made for}} the funding of <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see [...] "under what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?" [...] and [...] "what is the definition of substantially self-employed?". The <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).|$|R
