During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Brewer participated in several charity hockey games, playing in the four-game Ryan Smyth and Friends All-Star Charity Tour, the three-game Brad May and Friends Hockey <b>Challenge,</b> <b>as</b> well as the Our Game to Give charity hockey game held at Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario. During off-seasons, Brewer has participated in numerous charity golf tournaments, including the Burn Fund Golf Tournament in Prince George and the Recchi-Doan Charity Classic in Kamloops.|$|E
5|$|Chloi Rad (IGN) {{wrote that}} the game was {{theatrical}} and diorama-like in its display and attention to detail. Andrew Reiner (Game Informer) called its graphics among the best-looking smartphone games, from the vibrancy of its environments to the fluidity of its animations. While Rad felt that the game presented little <b>challenge</b> <b>as</b> a minor complaint, Reiner considered its final puzzles disproportionately challenging.|$|E
5|$|For {{its opening}} game, Florida State faced the lightly {{regarded}} Samford Bulldogs and defeated them 59–6. In its second game, No.17 Florida State faced a tougher <b>challenge</b> <b>as</b> it traveled to Norman, Oklahoma {{to play the}} No.10-ranked Oklahoma Sooners. The Seminoles were defeated 47–17, in their third-worst loss since 1991. Florida State rebounded from the loss to defeat Brigham Young University, 34–10, then opened the ACC season by defeating Wake Forest, Virginia, in-state rival Miami and Boston College in succession.|$|E

5|$|For {{their final}} home {{game of the}} season, Michigan hosted the Wisconsin Badgers. Michigan looked to extend its two-game win streak, but faced a tough <b>challenge,</b> <b>as</b> Wisconsin was ranked 6th in the AP Poll and was fresh off of an 83–20 {{pounding}} of Indiana. During the previous meeting between the two schools, Wisconsin won by a score of 45–24, with Scott Tolzien throwing 5 touchdown passes during the game.|$|E
5|$|The European Nucleotide Archive handles {{large volumes}} of data which pose a {{significant}} storage <b>challenge.</b> <b>As</b> of 2012, the ENA's storage requirements continue to grow exponentially, with a doubling time of approximately 10 months. To manage this increase, the ENA selectively discards less-valuable sequencing platform data and implements advanced compression strategies. The CRAM reference-based compression toolkit was developed to help reduce ENA storage requirements.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music is}} {{composed}} by Borislav Slavov and Peter Antovszki, Crytek's in-house composers. Slavov had previously led the soundtrack development of Crysis 3 and Warface. The soundtrack development began in February 2013, {{right after the}} completion of Crysis 3. Slavov considered composing the music for Ryse a great <b>challenge,</b> <b>as</b> he had to compose 250 minutes of music within a short time frame. Crytek also hired an external composer, Tilman Silescu, to help compose the music for the game.|$|E

5|$|Coastal {{scenes were}} filmed at Bass Rock and near Trancas, while other scenes were filmed near Signal Hill. The film's climax was filmed {{around the area}} of the Union Station train depot. The large gas tank, which stood over 300 feet tall, was made {{available}} to the cast and crew by the Southern California Gas Company. Filming at this location proved to be a <b>challenge,</b> <b>as</b> the cast and crew had trouble communicating with each other, with Clarke attempting to direct the film crew while on top of the large structure.|$|E
5|$|From 1906 the CLR {{began to}} {{experience}} a large fall in passenger numbers caused by increased competition from the DR and the MR, which electrified the Inner Circle in 1905, and from the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) which opened its rival route to Hammersmith in 1906. Road traffic also offered a greater <b>challenge</b> <b>as</b> motor buses began replacing the horse drawn variety in greater numbers. In an attempt to maintain income, the company increased the flat fare for longer journeys to three pence in July 1907 and reduced the fare for shorter journeys to one penny in March 1909. Multiple booklets of tickets, which had previously been sold at face value, were offered at discounts, and season tickets were introduced from July 1911.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation <b>challenge,</b> <b>as</b> {{they are a}} dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E

5|$|Louis then targets Henry D'Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is {{charmed by}} his wife, Edith. He {{substitutes}} petrol for paraffin in the lamp of Henry's darkroom, with fatal results. Louis decides the widow is {{fit to be}} his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne is the next victim. Posing as the Anglican Bishop of Matabeleland, Louis poisons his port. From {{the window of his}} flat, Louis then uses a bow to shoot down the balloon from which the suffragette Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is dropping leaflets over London. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne a jar of caviar which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a <b>challenge,</b> <b>as</b> he rarely sets foot on land. However, he insists on going down with his ship after causing a collision at sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Ann Romney {{learned that}} she had {{multiple}} sclerosis; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as {{the worst day of}} his life. After experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease, she found– while living in Park City, Utah, where the couple had built a vacation home– a combination of mainstream, alternative, and equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations. When her husband received a job offer to take over the troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; eager for a new <b>challenge,</b> <b>as</b> well as another chance to prove himself in public life, he did. On February 11, 1999, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2008, Brown's {{leadership}} {{was presented with}} a <b>challenge</b> <b>as</b> some MPs openly called for him to resign. This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from (pre-1974) Lancashire urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of {{holding on to the}} Labour Party leadership. Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest. However, certain prominent MPs, such as Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell, suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis. In the Autumn, Siobhain McDonagh, a MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government, spoke of the need for discussion over Brown's position. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterwards, on 12 September. Whilst McDonagh did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour party to hold a leadership election, she was sacked from her role shortly afterwards. McDonagh was supported by Joan Ryan (who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job), Jim Dowd, Greg Pope, and a string of others who had previously held positions in government, made clear their desire for a contest.|$|E

5|$|New {{environmental}} technologies in heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a <b>challenge,</b> <b>as</b> smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the game's fictional locations, the team tried to represent iconic {{features of the}} American frontier; New Austin features small towns and outposts, Nuevo Paraíso includes rebel outposts and Mexican army forts, and West Elizabeth represents the civilized areas of the world. These three locations represent a developing nation, a province {{on the brink of}} war, and an advanced nation, respectively. The American frontier was extensively researched for the game. The team organized field trips to Washington, visited the Library of Congress, captured a multitude of photographs, and analyzed various classic Western films. A challenge that the team faced {{as a direct result of}} the world's size was to include enough content to interest players. Using this <b>challenge</b> <b>as</b> a strength and a major part of the design process, the team tried to make the countryside wild, with a variety of potential events to occur. They initially believed that it was possible to use the formula of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008)—a large variety of mission styles with different activities and objectives—in Red Dead Redemption; as development continued, they realized that the emptiness of the world resulted in the inability to use this formula.|$|E
