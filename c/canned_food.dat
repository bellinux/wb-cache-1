5|$|Accounts vary, but historians {{estimate}} that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of <b>canned</b> <b>food.</b> They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise. Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the food}} eaten by station crews was frozen, {{refrigerated}} or canned. Menus were prepared by the cosmonauts, {{with the help of}} a dietitian, before their flight to the station. The diet was designed to provide around 100g of protein, 130g of fat and 330g of carbohydrates per day, in addition to appropriate mineral and vitamin supplements. Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation. <b>Canned</b> <b>food</b> such as jellied beef tongue was placed into a niche in the core module's table, where it could be warmed in 5–10 minutes. Usually, crews drank tea, coffee and fruit juices, but, unlike the ISS, the station also had a supply of cognac and vodka for special occasions.|$|E
5|$|At 1500UTC on November19, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Jamaica and was upgraded to a hurricane warning 24hours later. However, by 2100UTC on November20, the hurricane warning was downgraded to {{a tropical}} storm warning. It was further downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} watch and discontinued by November22. Other than hurricane/tropical storm watches and warnings, a flash flood warning was also posted on November20, and sailors were advised to remain at port. Disaster committees cautioned residents {{to stock up on}} supplies such as batteries and <b>canned</b> <b>food.</b> At 1500UTC on November20, a hurricane watch was issued for Haiti and areas east of Camagüey, Cuba, though it was downgraded to a tropical storm watch six hours later.

5|$|At around 1600UTC on August26, the National Hurricane Center issued {{hurricane}} watches for Dominica, Martinique, St. Martin, Anguilla, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis.

Local meteorological agencies {{on the islands}} also declared small craft advisories. The local government in Montserrat mobilized the 100 member police force and 50 off-duty volunteer army members. Supermarkets, hardware stores, banks, and pharmacies were specially opened for residents to purchase plywood, <b>canned</b> <b>food,</b> bottled water, and other hurricane kit items. Around 1300UTC on August27, the hurricane watch for Dominica and Martinique was discontinued as Gustav no longer posed {{a direct threat to}} the islands. Three hours later, all watches and warnings were discontinued except for Antigua and Barbuda where a tropical storm warning and St. Martin where a tropical storm watch were in place. By 1900UTC, once Hurricane Gustav turned towards the north away from the Lesser Antilles, all watches and warnings were discontinued.|$|E

25|$|World {{production}} capacity of Bisphenol A was 1million tons in the 1980s, {{and more than}} 2.2million tons in 2009. It is a high production volume chemical. In 2003, U.S. consumption was 856,000 tons, 72% of which used to make polycarbonate plastic and 21% going into epoxy resins. In the U.S., less than 5% of the BPA produced is used in food contact applications, but remains in the <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> industry and printing applications such as sales receipts.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{study found}} that {{drinking}} from polycarbonate bottles increased urinary bisphenolA levels by two thirds, from 1.2 μg/g creatinine to 2 μg/g creatinine. Consumer groups recommend that people wishing to lower their exposure to bisphenolA avoid <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> and polycarbonate plastic containers (which shares resin identification code 7 with many other plastics) unless the packaging indicates the plastic is bisphenolA-free. To avoid the possibility of BPA leaching into food or drink, the National Toxicology Panel recommends avoiding microwaving food in plastic containers, putting plastics in the dishwasher, or using harsh detergents.|$|E

A 2002 study showed that 99.5% of 1200 tested cans contained below the UK regulatory limit of 200mg/kg of tin, an improvement over most previous studies largely attributed to {{the increased use of}} fully lacquered cans for acidic foods, and concluded that the results do not raise any long term food safety concerns for consumers.

The longer food is in a can, and the warmer and more acidic it is, the more BPA leaches into it. In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance.
