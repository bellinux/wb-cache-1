The Lidar dataset was used to detect areas where <b>canopy</b> height reduction occurred, which were then field-studied to identify the tree damage mechanisms implicated.

40|$|The plant <b>canopy</b> {{surface is}} cooled by {{radiative}} cooling at night. Cooling of the <b>canopy</b> surface results in cooling {{of the surrounding}} air by convective heat exchange between the <b>canopy</b> surface and the air. Convective heat exchange at the <b>canopy</b> surface {{is proportional to the}} convective heat transfer conductance, which depends on the wind speed and the <b>canopy</b> surface area. We conducted physical model experiments using a polyethylene chamber to examine the dependence of the heat exchange at the <b>canopy</b> surface on the <b>canopy</b> surface area during nocturnal radiative cooling. We introduced three <b>canopy</b> models, each having a <b>canopy</b> surface area equivalent to a Leaf Area Index (LAI) of 1, 2, or 4. The models were placed in two polyethylene chambers located outdoors and exposed to a nocturnal radiation regime. The <b>canopy</b> surface temperature of the LAI = 1 model was the lowest among the three models, whereas the convective heat exchange between the <b>canopy</b> surface and the air traveling into the chamber was the smallest for the LAI = 1 model. The convective heat exchange did not differ significantly between the LAI = 2 and 4 <b>canopy</b> models. The results showed that the air traveling through the <b>canopy</b> was cooled more at night, when the <b>canopy</b> LAI was large and the <b>canopy</b> surface temperature was relatively high.

40|$|Nocturnal cooling of air {{within a}} forest <b>canopy</b> and the {{resulting}} temperature profile may drive local thermally driven motions, such as drainage flows, which are believed to impact measurements of ecosystem–atmosphere exchange. To model such flows, {{it is necessary to}} accurately predict the rate of cooling. Cooling occurs primarily due to radiative heat loss. However, much of the radiative loss occurs at the surface of <b>canopy</b> elements (leaves, branches, and boles of trees), while radiative divergence in the <b>canopy</b> air space is small due to high transmissivity of air. Furthermore, sensible heat exchange between the <b>canopy</b> elements and the air space is slow relative to radiative fluxes. Therefore, <b>canopy</b> elements initially cool much more quickly than the <b>canopy</b> air space after the switch from radiative gain during the day to radiative loss during the night. Thus in modeling air cooling within a <b>canopy,</b> it is not appropriate to neglect the storage change of heat in the <b>canopy</b> elements or even to assume equal rates of cooling of the <b>canopy</b> air and <b>canopy</b> elements. Here a simple parameterization of radiatively driven cooling of air within the <b>canopy</b> is presented, which accounts implicitly for radiative cooling of the <b>canopy</b> volume, heat storage in the <b>canopy</b> elements, and heat transfer between the <b>canopy</b> elements and the air. Simulations using this parameterization are compared to temperature data from the Morgan–Monroe State Forest (IN, USA) FLUXNET site. While the model does not perfectly reproduce the measured rates of cooling, particularly {{near the top of the}} <b>canopy,</b> the simulated cooling rates are of the correct order of magnitude...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{well-known}} that conducting experimental research aiming {{the characterization of}} <b>canopy</b> structure of forests can be a difficult and costly task and, generally, requires an expert to extract, in loco, relevant information. Aiming at easing studies related to <b>canopy</b> structures, several techniques have been proposed in the literature and, among them, various are based on <b>canopy</b> digital image analysis. The research work described in this paper empirically compares two techniques that measure {{the integrity of the}} <b>canopy</b> structure of a forest fragment; one of them is based on central parts of <b>canopy</b> cover images and, the other, on <b>canopy</b> closure images. For the experiments, 22 central parts of <b>canopy</b> cover images and 22 <b>canopy</b> closure images were used. The images were captured along two transects: T 1 (located in the conserved area) and T 2 (located in the naturally disturbance area). The <b>canopy</b> digital images were computationally processed and analyzed using the MATLAB platform for the <b>canopy</b> cover images and the Gap Light Analyzer (GLA), for the <b>canopy</b> closure images. The results obtained using these two techniques showed that <b>canopy</b> cover images and, among the employed algorithms, the Jseg, characterize the <b>canopy</b> integrity best. It is worth mentioning that part of the analysis can be automatically conducted, as a quick and precise process, with low material costs involved...|$|R
5|$|On March 25, 1998, {{the station}} at Watsessing Avenue {{was given the}} State Historical Preservation Organization honor that Ampere, Glen Ridge and Bloomfield {{stations}} received just fourteen years prior. The station continued to receive service through the opening of Montclair Connection on September 30, 2002, which ended service as the Montclair Branch and began as the Montclair-Boonton Line, still the first station on the line after Newark Broad Street Station. On September 10, 2007, New Jersey Transit announced the <b>canopies</b> of the old station, then 95 years old, were to be restored and repaired. The service contracted a $1.7 million project to Watertrol Incorporated of Cranford. At that time, the station served an average of 200people daily.

40|$|Functionality of {{training}} systems different in size, shape and geometry are primarily {{a function of}} their ability to intercept and distribute light effectively within the <b>canopy.</b> In peach, methodologies for a rapid and reliable assessment of such features are still lacking. In this study we propose a systemic approach that as unique data entry requires diurnal ground monitoring of the light-shadow windows of a tree <b>canopy.</b> Case studies for <b>canopy</b> shapes were a pyramid (▴, Delayed Vase), a parallelogram (♦, Palmette) and a Y (Tatura trellis) chosen within a 3 -year-old peach orchard. <b>Canopy</b> geometrical and structural parameters calculated from above and below <b>canopy</b> radiation readings taken at full <b>canopy</b> development include Silhouette (S) as sunlit <b>canopy</b> area projected orthogonal to the sunbeam, leaf layer index (LLI), <b>canopy</b> leaf projection coefficient computed orthogonal to sunbeam direction (K⌋), instantaneous <b>canopy</b> photon influx (QCA), instantaneous <b>canopy</b> intercepted photon flux in the 300 – 1100 nm waveband (QC) and <b>canopy</b> photon influx capture efficiency (εQCA→QC). Whole-tree gas exchange was also continuously monitored for a week on each <b>canopy</b> shape to gain a direct measurement of <b>canopy</b> net assimilation rate (AC) and <b>canopy</b> transpiration rate (EC). A positive QC vs. AC correlation was shown by any <b>canopy</b> type, with r = 0. 93, 0. 97 and 0. 92 for ▴, ♦ and Y, respectively. By contrast, while QC and EC were weakly correlated in ▴ and ♦, a close positive correlation (r = 0. 87) was found between these two variables in Y. The Tatura trees also showed, regardless of timing of the day, the highest EC/AC, hence better water use efficiency. This study validates the hypothesis that a systemic assessment of <b>canopy</b> quantum flux absorption (QC) leads to reliable prediction of actual net <b>canopy</b> photosynthetic rates paving the way to: (a) easier and faster evaluation of efficiency of <b>canopy</b> systems differing in size and shape and (b) simplification in whole-canopy photosynthetic models...|$|R

40|$|Tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala DC.) is an ecologically and {{culturally}} important tree species that grows across a narrow 400 km long coastal belt, from the Sabrina River south of Perth, to Jurien Bay in the north. Unfortunately, Tuart {{is also a}} species under considerable threat due to clearing, lack of recruitment and <b>canopy</b> decline. <b>Canopy</b> decline is of particular concern, being increasingly reported throughout the Tuart distribution. Despite this, previous studies of Tuart have generally been limited to localised <b>canopy</b> decline events. This two-phased study firstly involved an assessment of Tuart <b>canopy</b> condition at 46 sites across the species distribution. At each study site the <b>canopy</b> condition of no Jess than 20 Tuart trees was assessed using estimations of <b>canopy</b> completeness, measures of <b>canopy</b> size reduction, and through the scoring of <b>canopy</b> condition indices. The {{second phase of the}} study involved collecting data on a wide selection of environmental factors considered to be important to <b>canopy</b> condition. These included factors of stand structure, understorey composition,landform (soil type, geology, topography, and geography), climate (gradients and change), hydrology (depth, depth change, and chemistry), fire regimes, pollution and anthropogenic disturbance (fragmentation and site disturbance). Assessment of <b>canopy</b> condition indicates that most the Tuart distribution has slight to moderate <b>canopy</b> decline, and is characterised by a mean <b>canopy</b> completeness of 70 percent. Most of this <b>canopy</b> decline is considered to be background (stand level) decline and likely to be a characteristic of the species. However, the lack of comparative studies using similar methodology makes the determination of the current state of Tuart <b>canopy</b> condition difficult. Long-term monitoring of Tuart <b>canopy</b> condition is therefore recommended to determine temporal trends in <b>canopy</b> condition. The main area of concern for Tuart conservation was found to be the Yalgorup region, where trees had typically less than 30 percent <b>canopy</b> completeness. Severe <b>canopy</b> decline in this region is similar to dieback reported in other eucalypt species from across Australia, that is, gradually receding <b>canopy</b> foliage leaving stag-headed trees and abundant epicormic foliage. Localised cases of <b>canopy</b> decline, similar in structure to that of the Yalgorup region, were found at Yellagonga, Neerabup and Ludlow National Park. Investigations into environmental factors found severe <b>canopy</b> decline in the Yalgorup region is associated with higher rainfall, finer and shallower soil, higher groundwater alkalinity and salinity, and greater rates of groundwater salinity increase. Elsewhere Tuart <b>canopy</b> decline was found to be associated with nutrient enrichment (high topsoil ammonium nitrogen) and high levels of fragmentation. Environmental factors other than those mentioned {{do not appear to be}} causing Tuart <b>canopy</b> decline across the distribution, for example understorey competition, altered fire regimes and climate change. Future management of Tuart <b>canopy</b> decline needs to focus on the severe <b>canopy</b> decline in the Yalgorup region, and build upon the hypotheses proposed in this study to explain <b>canopy</b> decline. Low recruitment should also not be forgotten as a major cause of the species decline...|$|R
