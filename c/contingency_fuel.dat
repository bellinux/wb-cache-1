40|$|Airlines and Air Navigation Service Providers {{are united}} in their goal to reduce fuel consumption. While changes to flight {{operations}} and technology investments {{are the focus of}} a number of studies, our study is among the first to investigate an untapped source of aviation fuel consumption: excess <b>contingency</b> <b>fuel</b> loading. Given the downside risk of fuel exhaustion of diverting to an alternate airport, airline dispatchers may load excess fuel onto an aircraft. Such conservatism comes at a cost of consuming excess fuel, as fuel consumed is a function of, among other factors, aircraft weight. The aim {{of this paper is to}} quantify, on a per-flight basis, the fuel burned due to carrying fuel beyond what is needed for foreseeable contingencies, and thereby motivate research, federal guidance, and investments that allow airline dispatchers to reduce fuel uplift while maintaining near zero risks of fuel exhaustion. We merge large publicly available aviation and weather databases with a detailed dataset from a major US airline. Upon estimating factors that capture the quantity fuel consumed due to carrying a pound of weight for a range of aircraft types, we calculate the cost and greenhouse gas emissions from carrying unused fuel on arrival and additional <b>contingency</b> <b>fuel</b> above a conservative buffer for foreseeable contingencies. We establish that the major US carrier does indeed load fuel conservatively. We find that 4. 48 % of the fuel consumed by an average flight is due to carrying unused fuel and 1. 04 % of the fuel consumed by an average flight is due to carrying additional <b>contingency</b> <b>fuel</b> above a reasonable buffer. We find that simple changes in flight dispatching that maintain a statistically minimal risk of fuel exhaustion could result in yearly savings of 338 million lbs of CO 2, the equivalent to the fuel consumed from 4760 flights on midsized commercial aircraft. Moreover, policy changes regarding maximum fuel loads or investments that reduce uncertainty or increase the ability to plan flights under uncertainty could yield far greater benefits...|$|E
40|$|In 1993, fuel {{accounted}} for approximately 15 percent of an airline's expenses. Fuel consumption increases as fuel reserves increase {{because of the}} added weight to the aircraft. Calculating fuel reserves {{is a function of}} Federal Aviation Regulations, airline company policy, and factors that impact or are impacted by fuel usage enroute. This research studied how pilots and dispatchers determined the fuel needed for a flight and identified areas where improvements in methods may yield measurable fuel savings by (1) listing the uncertainties that contribute to adding <b>contingency</b> <b>fuel,</b> (2) obtaining the pilots' and dispatchers' perspective on how often each uncertainty occurred, and (3) obtaining pilots' and dispatchers' perspective on the fuel used for each occurrence. This study found that {{for the majority of the}} time, pilots felt that dispatchers included enough fuel. As for the uncertainties that flight crews and dispatchers account for, air traffic control accounts for 28 % and weather uncertainties account for 58 percent. If improvements can be made in these two areas, a great potential exists to decrease the reserve required, and therefore, fuel usage without jeopardizing safety...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we examine}} how the {{predictability}} of travel time affects both the transportation service providers’ strategic and operational decisions, {{in the context of}} air transportation. Towards this end, we make three main contributions. The first is the development of accurately measuring predictability of travel time in air transportation to best model airline decision behavior. The measure is sensitive to the different nature that’s driving the decision. The second is an empirical investigation {{of the relationship between the}} best-measured travel time predictability and the transportation service providers’ strategic and operational decisions to gain insights into the significance of the impact of predictability. The third contribution is proposing an algorithm to improve predictability in order to save cost in the strategic decision process through re-sequencing the departure queue at the airport. We consider the strategic decision as the setting of the scheduled travel time for each trip that typically happened six months before the travel date. On the operational side, we investigate into the decision of the amount of fuel loaded to each flight in the daily operation. We assume that the decisions are based on the predictability of historical travel time performance. When quantifying predictability, it is important to realize that the service providers have different priority of considerations when making the strategic (scheduling) and the operational (fuel loading) decisions. Therefore, we apply different metrics for predictability to modeling the different decision behaviors and prove that the best-fitting measure of predictability is not uniform across different type of decisions. Regarding the strategic decision making, the profit-driven nature of the service provider encourages discounting the effects of extremely long historical travel times. Therefore, segmenting the historical travel time distribution is crucial in our effort of measuring predictability. On the other hand, when making day-to-day operational decisions, specifically fuel loading decisions in this study, the safety-driven nature of the service provider prevails over others and it pays more attention to extreme events. Therefore a metric capturing the tail effects such as the variance and standard deviation is a more appropriate measure of predictability in this context. In modeling the relationship between predictability and scheduled travel time setting, we seek both analytical insights and empirical evidences. Firstly this relationship is studied with empirical data and multiple regression models. We develop the “percentile model” where the distribution of the historical travel time for an air trip is depicted by the difference between every 10 th percentiles. We find that gate delay plays a minor role in setting scheduled travel time and that scheduled travel times have decreasing sensitivity to historical travel times toward the right tail of the distribution. To specifically link schedule setting with the trip’s on-time performance, a scheduled travel time adjustment model is further developed. Poor on-time performance leads to increased scheduled travel time in the next planning period. With the behavior model results showing that both the median travel time and the “inner right tail” of the distribution affect schedule setting, an impact study is conducted to validate these impacts with evidence in the historical data. This impact from behavioral modeling is validated with real data in year 2006 - 2008 and 2009 - 2011, and their corresponding scheduled travel times in the later period. Furthermore, by studying the travel performance difference based on different changes in scheduled travel time, we conclude that ignoring the impact on schedule changes when considering potential benefits of improved travel time distribution could lead to inaccurate results. We complement the strategic behavioral modeling findings with proposing a practical algorithm that optimizes the sequence of departure queue on the airport to improve travel time predictability. The end objective is to reduce scheduled travel time through improved predictability and thus save cost for travel service providers. We present algorithms to sequence departures on a daily basis. For the objective function, scheduled travel time is viewed as a cost for airlines to be minimized. For each flight, the assigned slot generates a new travel time and this time contributes proportionally to the future scheduled travel time, as revealed in estimating the “percentile model”. Assuring that the on-time performance is not greatly sacrificed is also important. Therefore the objective function also includes delaying the flight’s arrival performance as part of the “cost of assignment”. In this way, we develop a multi-objective algorithm to sequence departure flights to improve predictability, reduce airline scheduled travel time, and increase on-time performance. To investigate the relationship between predictability and fuel loading decisions, we develop a set of multiple regression models considering clusters of standard deviation of the estimates. The unpredictability under performance may cause decision makers (airline dispatchers) to load more fuel onto aircraft, and thus causing extra fuel consumed to carry this excessive fuel. We acquired a large and recent dataset with flight-level fuel loading and consumption information from a major US airline. With this data, firstly the relationship between the amount of loaded fuel and travel time predictability performance is estimated using statistical model. Predictability is measured with metrics such as standard deviation of travel time so that the tail effect of the distribution is properly captured. We find that one minute of standard deviation in airborne time within a month for the same OD pair and shift of day would lead to 0. 95 minute increase in loaded <b>contingency</b> <b>fuel</b> and 1. 85 minute loaded contingency and alternate fuel. Then, the impact of predictability on loaded fuel is translated into fuel consumption and ultimately, fuel cost for US domestic operations. If there is no unpredictability in the aviation system, the reduction in the loaded fuel would be 6. 4 and 12. 5 minute per trip, respectively. This ultimately translates into a cost to US domestic air carriers on the order of $ 88 – $ 345 million per year...|$|E
40|$|The Defense Fuel Supply Point (DFSP) at Point Loma California {{provides}} most of {{the fuel}} that the U. S. Navy assets use in the Southern California operating areas 3, 171, 000 BBLS total of F- 76 and JP- 5 in Fiscal Year 2000. If it were disabled or destroyed, it would be vital that all personnel involved understand the numerous alternative methods of getting fuel to the fleet. This thesis studies the offices and organizations that could {{be affected by the}} sudden removal of DFSP Point Loma as a fueling source, and examines the various alternative fueling options and methods. It looks at the options from the background of current fuel transportation methods and the reasons that might make a <b>contingency</b> <b>fueling</b> plan necessary. It discusses what considerations there would be to choosing an alternative, and gives four generic scenarios, walking through the options that might be best for each. The thesis ends with a summary of the findings, some conclusions, and some recommendations for DoD and for further studies. The research was done through sources at the NPS Library, online, and on site including interviews and searching through files. From all of the information gathered, a number of conclusions can be drawn. The first one is that if DFSP Point Loma is destroyed or disabled that there are definitely other options for getting fuel to the fleet. The second and third conclusions are that the current fueling capabilities in Southern California support the Missions and Visions of MSC and DESC...|$|R
40|$|Recent entry {{guidance}} algorithm development 123 {{has tended}} to focus on numerical integration of trajectories onboard in order to evaluate candidate bank profiles. Such methods enjoy benefits such as flexibility to varying mission profiles and improved robustness to large dispersions. A common element across many of these modern entry guidance algorithms is a reliance upon the concept of Apollo heritage lateral error (or azimuth error) deadbands in which the number of bank reversals to be performed is non-deterministic. This paper presents a closed-loop bank reversal method that operates with a fixed number of bank reversals defined prior to flight. However, this number of bank reversals can be modified at any point, including in flight, based on <b>contingencies</b> such as <b>fuel</b> leaks where propellant usage must be minimized...|$|R
40|$|Flexible work is now endemic {{in modern}} economies. A growing {{literature}} both praises work flexibility for accommodating employees' needs and criticizes it for <b>fueling</b> <b>contingency</b> and job insecurity. Although studies have identified varied effects of flexible work, questions remain about the workplace dimensions of flexibility and how occupational workplace health is managed in these workplaces. This paper presents findings from a qualitative {{study of how}} managers in the computer software industry situate workplace flexibility and approach worker health. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} managers (and some workers) at 30 firms in Ontario, Canada. Using a critical discourse analysis approach, we examine managers' optimistic descriptions of flexibility which emphasize how flexible work contributes to workers' life balance. We then contrast this with managers' depictions of flexibility work practices as intense and inescapable. We suggest that the discourse of flexibility, and the work practices they foster, make possible and reinforce an increased intensity of work that is driven by the demands of technological pace and change that characterize the global information technology and computer software industries. Finally, we propose that flexible knowledge work has led to a re-framing of occupational health management involving a focus on what we call "strategies of resilience" that aim to buttress workers' capacities to withstand intensive and uncertain working conditions.
