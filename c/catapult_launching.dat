25|$|Known by {{the company}} {{designation}} Model X-85, the Stearman XOSS-1 was designed during 1937 {{in response to a}} U.S. Navy specification calling for an observation-scout type aircraft, capable of operating from either water or land, and stressed for <b>catapult</b> <b>launching</b> from battleships and cruisers. The new aircraft was intended to replace the Curtiss SOC as the standard observation and gunnery spotting aircraft in service aboard the Navy's battleships.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the aircraft modified had suffered wear-and-tear serving with front line squadrons, {{so much so that}} at least one example used during trials broke up under the stress of a <b>catapult</b> <b>launching.</b> CAM Sea Hurricanes were launched operationally on eight occasions and the Hurricanes shot down six enemy aircraft for the loss of one Hurricane pilot killed. The first Sea Hurricane IA kill was an FW 200C Condor, shot down on 2 August 1941.|$|E

25|$|In August 2014, the Chinese-language Shanghai Morning Post listed that Liaoning {{would carry}} 36 aircraft: 24 Shenyang J-15 fighters, six Changhe Z-18F anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, four Changhe Z-18J {{airborne}} early warning helicopters and two Harbin Z-9C rescue helicopters. The Chinese carrier aircraft inventory {{is similar to a}} balanced combat and support aircraft approach intended for Soviet aircraft carriers, which supported nuclear submarines, large surface combatants, and land-based strike bombers performing anti-access roles. The air wing lacks long-range radar and anti-submarine fixed-wing aircraft, needing support from shore-based aircraft such as Tupolev Tu-154 ASW and Shaanxi Y-8 AWACS aircraft. The U.S. Department of Defense noted that J-15s will have below normal range and armament when operating from the carrier, due to limits imposed by the ski-jump takeoff system. The lack of a carrier onboard delivery aircraft like the United States Navy (USN) Grumman C-2 Greyhound also limits logistics capabilities. Liaoning would need extensive land-based support to oppose a USN carrier strike group; however, it would be potent against the Vietnam People's Navy and the Philippine Navy. Deficiencies will likely be corrected with future aircraft carriers, which are expected to be larger with conventional takeoff decks and <b>catapult</b> <b>launching</b> for heavier fighters, plus fixed-wing radar and anti-submarine patrol aircraft.|$|E

500|$|In 1930, Ark Royal was recommissioned {{again as}} a {{training}} ship and an aircraft catapult was installed on her forecastle, forward of her cranes. For the next nine years, the ship conducted trials and evaluations of catapults and seaplane launch and recovery equipment and techniques. On 21 December 1934, she was renamed HMS Pegasus to release her name for a new carrier that was then beginning construction. The ship was assigned to Home Fleet when the Second World War began, and was mostly used to train sailors in <b>catapult</b> <b>launching</b> and shipboard recovery techniques. The ship used the Fairey Seafox, Supermarine Walrus, and Fairey Swordfish of the 764 Naval Air Squadron. She also served as an aircraft transport and was present in Scapa Flow, having just delivered some aircraft, on 14 October when the battleship [...] was sunk by the [...] As the closest ship to Royal Oak, Pegasus was able to rescue some 400 survivors.|$|E
