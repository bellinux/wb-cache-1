Evans received shipments of marijuana through the prison kitchen, brought into the prison by a corrupt food services employee, Debra Thompson. Evans or his fellow inmates would then distribute the marijuana to other prisoners for up to $900 an ounce.

40|$|In this paper, we {{formulate}} a model prescribing optimal policy for cash disbursements and seasoned equity offerings {{taking into account}} the principal-agent problems inherent in these decisions. In order to discipline managers, stockholders demand that excess free <b>cash</b> flow be <b>disbursed</b> either as <b>cash</b> dividends or through stock repurchases. Managers resist stockholders in this regard since they prefer to retain excess free cash flow in order to pursue personal interests and reduce the probability that the company will experience financial distress in the future. However, as a consequence of withholding cash disbursements, managers incur disutility due to the possibility that their control of the firm could be threatened by the market for corporate control. We model this situation as a stochastic impulse control problem, and succeed in finding an analytical solution. We derive several testable implications, some of which have not been fully addressed in the corporate finance literature. ...|$|R

We argue that the election month monetary expansion is related to systemic vote buying which requires significant amounts of <b>cash</b> to be <b>disbursed</b> right before elections.

The contracts were written in US Engineering standards. The Army usually paid by electronic funds transfer as pay agents are discouraged from paying cash to contractors in Afghanistan. The projects were paid in phases. Engineers worked through project details with contractors. If the contractors failed the performance work standard, the engineer could recommend that the PRT withhold funds until project deficiencies were corrected. The project could also be cancelled.|$|R
5000|$|Equation {{describes}} {{a firm that}} buys and sells on account. Also, the equation is written to accommodate a firm that buys and sells on account. For a cash-only firm, the equation would only need data from sales operations (e.g. changes in inventory), because <b>disbursing</b> <b>cash</b> would be directly measurable as purchase of inventory, and collecting cash would be directly measurable as sale of inventory. However, no such 1:1 correspondence exists for a firm that buys and sells on account: Increases and decreases in inventory do not occasion cashflows but accounting vehicles (payables and receivables, respectively); increases and decreases in cash will remove these accounting vehicles (receivables and payables, respectively) from the books. Thus, the CCC must be calculated by tracing a change in cash through its effect upon receivables, inventory, payables, and finally back to cash—thus, the term cash conversion cycle, and the observation that these four accounts [...] "articulate" [...] with one another.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} cash {{dividends and}} share repurchases in Japan - discerning between keiretsu and non-keiretsu groupings of firms - {{during the period}} 1990 to 2008, a period of extensive Japanese corporate governance reform. As in the United States, share repurchases in Japan have grown strikingly across firm groupings even relative to cash dividends which have also increased. Unlike in the United States, cash dividends remain the dominant form of payout across the groupings of firms in Japan. Despite extensive corporate governance reform, the keiretsu grouping of firms exhibits a comparative reticence to alter its corporate payout policy. In particular, it remains the case that keiretsu firms disburse relatively large amounts of cash, they rely relatively heavily on cash dividends rather than share repurchases, they exhibit a greater tendency to discontinue cash dividend payouts, their payouts are relatively sensitive to earnings and these payouts respond relatively rapidly with respect to earnings. In addition, the cash dividend payouts in keiretsu firms have been relatively concentrated, while these payouts from non-keiretsu firms concentrate increasingly over time. The findings also suggest that larger firms in Japan {{are more likely to}} payout and if they decide to do so they tend to payout more. As the level of concentration of ownership in Japanese firms increases the amount of <b>cash</b> dividends <b>disbursed</b> decreases. Privatized firms are more likely to pay cash dividends and if they decide to do so and they are not keiretsu affiliated they tend to payout more.

We study month-to-month fluctuations in {{the growth rate of}} M 1 in a sample of 85 low and middle income democracies from 1975 to 2009.

The effect is larger in democracies with many poor and uneducated voters, and in Sub-Saharan Africa and in East-Asia and the Pacific. We show that the election month monetary expansion is demand driven and can be best explained by systemic vote buying. Systemic vote buying requires significant amounts of <b>cash</b> to be <b>disbursed</b> right before elections. The finely timed increase in M 1 that we observe in the data is consistent with this. The timing is inconsistent with a monetary cycle aimed at creating an election time boom and it cannot be, fully, accounted for by other possible explanations. ...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{persistent}} {{disagreement about}} extradition between the United States and South Korea, Tongsun Park ultimately {{came to the}} United States in April 1978 to testify publicly in a House hearing. During the testimony, Park admitted to <b>disbursing</b> <b>cash</b> to thirty members of Congress. In the end, only ten members of Congress were seriously implicated, of whom most decided to resign, while {{the statute of limitations}} expired for three. Park was granted full immunity for his testimony. Congressional members Edward Roybal (D-CA), Charles H. Wilson (D-CA) and John J. McFall (D-CA) were censured and reprimanded; Congressman Edward J. Patten (D-NJ) was found not guilty, and Otto Passman (D-LA) was indicted on bribery, conspiracy, illegal gratuities and tax evasion. He was tried in his home district in Monroe, Louisiana and was acquitted. Richard Hanna was convicted and sentenced to six to thirty months in prison. Though it was a political scandal at the time, and raised serious questions concerning the loyalty of Members of Congress who would accept bribes from a foreign government, Koreagate had surprisingly few and small long-term consequences, especially when compared to the Watergate scandal.|$|R
30|$|More importantly, {{we focus}} on the {{interactive}} effect of ATPs with excess cash. In model (3), we first examine the effect of excess cash and the E-index in isolation. The coefficient on excess cash is negative and statistically insignificant, and that on the E-index remains insignificant. We then consider the interaction of excess cash and the E-index by dividing the sample into high and low excess cash sub-groups based on the median value of excess cash. Models (4) and (5) in Table  4 show that the E-index is associated with lower bidder returns only when acquirers hoard a higher level of excess cash. Thus, consistent with the view that excess cash and ATPs are complements; ATPs hurt acquisition performance only for firms that also have a higher level of excess cash. If the negative relationship suggests poor acquisition performance, the results are consistent with Chi and Lee (2010)’s findings that the negative relationship between Tobin’s q and governance indices exists only for firms with higher agency problems associated with free cash flow and those in Harford et al. (2008) reporting that managers of poorly governed firms <b>disburse</b> <b>cash</b> quickly on suboptimal investments. The other control variables have their expected signs.|$|R

40|$|There {{are some}} who {{consider}} supranational unemployment-based automatic stabilizers to be advantageous for the Euro area and the European Union at large (Deinzer 2004; Dullien 2007, 2012, 2014; French Ministry of Finance and Public Accounts 2014; see Figure 1). An E(MU) -wide unemployment benefit scheme could function as an automatic stabilizer {{but it could also}} create awareness amongst European citizens for the efforts and the advantages of the Union and it could reinforce convergence of social models. This paper focusses on stabilisation purposes and investigates issues of moral hazard. Even though the political climate in Europe is very hostile to further integration – in some countries more so than others – {{it would be wise to}} consider the merits of such proposals as it is the duty for public officials, politicians and researchers to look beyond the problems of today and to contemplate the solutions of tomorrow. If an E(M) U-wide unemployment benefit scheme, or some scheme that reinforces and supports national systems, could actually achieve at least some of the goals stated above, it warrants further investigation. In order to fully appreciate the possibilities and the limitations of a supranational scheme in combination with national schemes, it is paramount to learn from the experiences with actual real world practices of multi-tiered unemployment systems. Nearly everywhere in the European Union, but also in other Western countries, unemployment schemes are already multi-tiered in some form or another. Moreover, there is a strong European tendency to decentralise unemployment administration, social assistance and activation of the unemployed (Van Berkel & Borghi 2008, Wieshaupt 2010, Mosley 2011). It is crucial that, before we even think about adding another layer on top of existing unemployment schemes, we understand the realities and experiences of the (interaction between) existing layers. This paper will focus on the decentralisation efforts and the experiences with multi-tiered systems of unemployment benefits, social assistance and activation that exist today in order to explore the issue of moral hazard. The current European trend of decentralisation is very much linked to activation and moral hazard. The issue of moral hazard is especially relevant for the solidarity among contributors of any unemployment related scheme. This is one of the reasons for enacting activation systems. Passive labour market policies, administrating and <b>disbursing</b> <b>cash</b> benefits, are policies that are often executed at the central level. But the transition from passive to activating unemployment systems requires governments to have more intimate knowledge of unemployed individuals (Van Berkel & Borghi 2008). Activation, in this line of reasoning, requires tailor-made policies and the capacity to administer and monitor those policies. This logic mandates a decentralisation of labour market policies to local governments (OECD 2003 : 12 - 17, Knuth & Larsen 2010). But besides the effort to bring activation closer to the unemployed, there are also other reasons for a multi-tiered system. Because there is a variety of motivations behind multi-tiered systems it does not come as a surprise that there are different forms of decentralisation. Bredgaard and Larsen try to bring order in the multitude of questions considering multi-tiered schemes and reforms. They identify two main dimensions: formal policy and operational policy (Table 1). Formal policy reforms concern the actual content of policies, whereas operational policy reforms deal with the relationship and the responsibilities of actors: who implements policy, who is responsible and to whom? Such questions are exactly the type of questions that are relevant for understanding the possibilities and limitations of multi-tiered systems. Therefore, the main focus of this paper will be on operational policy reforms. In practice, the difference between those two dimensions might not be so clear-cut. This paper will investigate different forms of multi-tiered labour market governance systems to draw lessons for possible E(M) U-wide employment based automatic stabilizers – and especially it will review experiences with issues of moral hazard. Different forms of multi-tiered governance relate to possible European schemes in different ways. First of all, the federal form of labour market governance decentralisation of the United States forms the inspiration for the works by Dullien. Arguably, the way in which the American states and the federal level relate to each other is more akin to the relationship between the member states and the supra-national level of the EU than how municipalities and centralized governments relate to each other. The relation between the American states and the federal government (the leeway they enjoy in labour market governance) but also the size and demographic characteristics resemble the EU member states more closely than the characteristics of municipalities do. In order to assess whether we can draw any lessons from the U. S. experience we need to understand the institutional dimension of the U. S. experience. Secondly, the way in which municipalised or regionalised EU member states deal with issues of moral hazard might provide valuable insights for any policymaker contemplating supranational schemes. The European experiences are, thus, very relevant as well. Thirdly, any European scheme needs to take account of the variety of labour market governance in the European Union itself. In other words, the design of an E(M) U-wide scheme should accommodate or at least recognise the variety of its member states. This paper itself does not represent the full diversity of EU member states, it only deals with a subset of the possible range of constellations. This paper will proceed in the following manner. Firstly, a theoretical framework will be constructed in order to understand the basic concepts inherent to multi-tiered labour market governance systems. Secondly, this theoretical framework will be used to select cases which represent the different forms of multi-tiered governance models. Thirdly, the institutional framework of the cases will be analysed. The insights gained from the cases will be combined with the theoretical framework in the ‘results’ chapter. Finally, the conclusions and pointers for further investigation will be outlined in the last chapter. status: publishe...|$|R
