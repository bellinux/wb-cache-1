5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, thrash {{achieved}} breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream. Metallica's self-titled 1991 album topped the Billboard chart, {{as the band}} established international following. Megadeth's <b>Countdown</b> <b>to</b> Extinction (1992) debuted at number two, Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10, and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth's {{previous}} studio release, <b>Countdown</b> <b>to</b> Extinction, {{became the}} band's biggest commercial accomplishment, entering the Billboard 200 at number two and eventually becoming double platinum. As a result, they continually sold out arenas across North America, {{in addition to}} developing a strong following overseas.

5|$|After {{the lineup}} stabilized, the band {{released}} {{a number of}} platinum-selling albums, including Rust in Peace (1990) and <b>Countdown</b> <b>to</b> Extinction (1992). These albums, along with touring worldwide, helped bring public recognition to Megadeth. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without bassist Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson settled with Mustaine out of court and rejoined the group in 2010. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since mid-2005.|$|E
5|$|<b>Countdown</b> <b>to</b> Extinction {{received}} {{positive reaction}} from music critics, who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound {{in comparison to}} their previous record. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two, the band's highest position ever. It eventually achieved double platinum status and became their most commercially successful album. The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, while the album's title track won the Humane Society's Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues.|$|E

Critical response to Growing the Big One was largely positive; some critics praised the story and Doherty's performance, while others were more critical of the chemistry between the two lead actors. It was released on DVD three days following the film's premiere.|$|E

5|$|Dystopia {{achieved}} {{success on}} international music charts. It charted {{in the top}} ten in a dozen countries, and entered into the top twenty in four more. The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 48,000 copies (and streaming equivocal to another 1,000 copies) in its first week. This both topped the position and sales of the preceding album, Super Collider, and marks the band's second highest domestic chart position, after <b>Countdown</b> <b>to</b> Extinction, which reached number two in 1992. The album also charted at number three in Canada and Finland, and reached number two in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Following the lukewarm {{response}} to the band's previous album, 2013's Super Collider, Dystopia received largely favorable reaction from critics, being considered a return to form for the band. The album holds a Metacritic score of 69/100 as of August 2016. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart, making Dystopia the band's second highest charting album in the U.S. after <b>Countdown</b> <b>to</b> Extinction, which peaked at number two in 1992. Additionally, the title track earned the band its first Grammy win (for Best Metal Performance) at the 59th Grammy Awards after eleven unsuccessful nominations.|$|E

5|$|In games {{subject to}} time control, a chess clock is used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay (a <b>countdown</b> <b>to</b> when a clock starts again) or add (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth's lyrics often {{focus on}} death, war, politics, and religion. The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but {{occasionally}} deals with {{topics such as}} alienation and social problems. The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism. Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as Rust in Peace and <b>Countdown</b> <b>to</b> Extinction. During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on Cryptic Writings, Mustaine said {{that he wanted to}} write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of United Abominations is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized the organization's ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album. Later albums contained lyrics in a similar vein.|$|E
5|$|Swift {{stations}} {{were given a}} number of small improvements after the line opened. Curb bumpers were installed in June 2010 to help guide buses closer to the raised platform, and reduce the gap at the door. In 2012, a queue jump signal was installed northbound {{at the north end of}} the BAT lanes at 148th Street, allow Swift buses to merge into traffic. Real-time arrival signs debuted at Swift stations in 2013, featuring a <b>countdown</b> <b>to</b> the arrival of the next bus that is estimated using GPS units on coaches. In June 2015, the Washington State Department of Transportation removed part of the refuge island at the intersection of State Route 99 and Airport Road to create a through lane exclusively for Swift buses.|$|E

50|$|On {{the weekend}} of March 28, 1998, one week after Westwood One finally {{cancelled}} the three countdowns Kasem was hosting for them after four weeks without him. Chancellor also brought Kasem's AC <b>countdowns</b> <b>to</b> their network, with both now being branded as American Top 20 (see Spin-off programming below). Following the merger between Chancellor/AMFM and Clear Channel Communications (the predecessor {{of what is now}} iHeartMedia) in 1999, AT40 and other syndicated shows from AMFM Radio Networks were transferred into Premiere Radio Networks, which continues to syndicate the show as of today.|$|R
5|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Megadeth's fifth studio album began in January 1992 at Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California. Max Norman {{was chosen to}} produce the album, as the band was pleased with his mixing of Rust in Peace. Megadeth spent nearly four months {{in the studio with}} Norman, writing and recording what became the band's most commercially successful effort, <b>Countdown</b> <b>to</b> Extinction. The album, whose title was suggested by Menza, features songwriting contributions from each band member. Ellefson explained that the band changed its approach to songwriting for this album, beginning to write more melodic songs.|$|E
5|$|Youthanasia is {{the sixth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on November 1, 1994 through Capitol Records. The album {{is not a}} large stylistic departure from the band's earlier recordings; however it marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following {{the footsteps of the}} previous album <b>Countdown</b> <b>to</b> Extinction (1992). The album's title is a play on words, implying that society is euthanizing its youth. The cover art features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline; the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track.|$|E
5|$|Graves and Elizabeth {{moved to}} work at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico {{when it opened in}} 1943. He made it a {{condition}} of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her. This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos. At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Samuel K. Allison's <b>countdown</b> <b>to</b> the explosion on the radio, and monitored the radioactive fallout from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with Geiger counters. The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.|$|E
