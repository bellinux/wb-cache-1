500|$|The {{film was}} a {{critical}} success, though some critics wondered about the social impact of a character that they saw as sympathetic. Cagney was still struggling against his gangster typecasting. He said to a journalist, [...] "It's what the people want me to do. Some day, though, I'd like to make another movie that kids <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> see." [...] However, Warner Bros., perhaps searching for another Yankee Doodle Dandy, assigned Cagney a musical for his next picture, 1950's The West Point Story with Doris Day, an actress he admired.|$|E

500|$|The sleeve artwork for Achtung Baby was {{designed}} by Steve Averill, who had created the majority of U2's album covers, along with Shaughn McGrath. To parallel the band's change in musical direction, Averill and McGrath devised sleeve concepts that used multiple colour images to contrast with {{the seriousness of the}} individual, mostly monochromatic images from previous U2 album sleeves. Rough sketches and designs were created early during the recording sessions, and some experimental designs were conceived to closely resemble, as Averill put it, [...] "dance-music oriented sleeves. We just did them to show how extreme we <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> then everyone came back to levels that they were happy with. But if we hadn't gone to these extremes {{it may not have been}} the cover it is now." ...|$|E
500|$|Adams {{works closely}} with her acting coach Warner Loughlin, and credits Loughlin for helping her {{organize}} and structure her thoughts. She uses an acting method taught by Loughlin, in which she attempts an understanding of her character's psychology by creating the character's back-story {{from the age of}} three. Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn towards both leading and supporting parts. Describing herself as an obsessive performer, Adams has said, [...] "I'm never satisfied with the take. I'll walk away from it, but I <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> go and go. I've had to learn to be OK with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Development of Perfect Dark Zero {{began on}} the Nintendo GameCube with a very small team of roughly ten people. At the time, Nintendo had a 49% stake in Rare, making the company a Nintendo second-party developer. According to lead {{designer}} Chris Tilston, [...] "It was basically prototyping, finding out where we <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> how we could get there." [...] When Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002, the project {{was transferred to the}} Xbox console and the game's multiplayer mode was redesigned for online play. Tilston revealed that at one point they got to 50 players online simultaneously, but the graphics [...] "just couldn't handle it." [...] Since the initial version of the game pushed the original Xbox hardware [...] "pretty hard", the project was ultimately transferred to the Xbox successor, the Xbox 360. Tilston revealed that the original Xbox version was [...] "about 12 months away" [...] from completion when the shift occurred.|$|E

In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E

She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
500|$|In {{the post-war}} period Poulenc crossed swords with composers {{of the younger}} {{generation}} who rejected Stravinsky's recent work and insisted that only the precepts of the Second Viennese School were valid. Poulenc defended Stravinsky and expressed incredulity that [...] "in 1945 we are speaking as if the aesthetic of twelve tones is the only possible salvation for contemporary music". His view that Berg had taken serialism as far as it <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> that Schoenberg's music was now [...] "desert, stone soup, ersatz music, or poetic vitamins" [...] earned him the enmity of composers such as Pierre Boulez. Those disagreeing with Poulenc attempted to paint him as a relic of the pre-war era, frivolous and unprogressive. This led him to focus on his more serious works, and to try to persuade the French public to listen to them. In the US and Britain, with their strong choral traditions, his religious music was frequently performed, but performances in France were much rarer, so that the public and the critics were often unaware of his serious compositions.|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} the summer of 2012 in The Hamptons, New York, where Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z were living. She invited producers and songwriters to accompany them, including Sia, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and The-Dream. Beyoncé described the atmosphere as unconventional, saying, [...] "we had dinners with the producers every day, like a family... it was like a camp. Weekends off. You <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> jump in the pool and ride bikes... the ocean and grass and sunshine... it was really a safe place." [...] She would spend the majority of her day with her newborn daughter, taking some hours out to record music. The album's opening track [...] "Pretty Hurts", co-written by Sia, was completed during these sessions. The project was suspended until 2013 and relocated to New York City's Jungle City and Oven studios where most of the album was recorded. In an interview for Vogue in January 2013, Jason Gay described Beyoncé's attention to detail as [...] "obsessive" [...] when observing her studio, noting the vision boards she created for inspiration, which contained potential song titles, old album covers and pictures of performances.|$|E
500|$|Spider {{decided to}} [...] "dodge his responsibilities" [...] and began {{staying away from}} Toyah, who was {{not happy about it}} as she wanted them to make a commitment. Spider {{eventually}} changed his mind and Hancock commented [...] "The fact is that he really fancies Toyah, and he figures that he may as well be hung for a sheep as a goat." [...] The actor reckoned that Spider and Toyah brought out the best in each other. Spider and Toyah soon began a proper relationship and briefly lived together. However, when Spider announced that he wanted to settle down and buy a house with Toyah, the couple realised that they had started to drift apart. Spider thought that if they got a mortgage together it would help save the relationship, but Toyah did not want that at all. When Spider was offered a promotion, he realised {{that he did not want}} to work for the DSS anymore and quit. He then told Toyah that he had bought them tickets to India so that they <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> [...] "find themselves." [...] However, Toyah insisted that she did not want to leave Weatherfield. Nicole Carmichael from Inside Soap wrote that while Spider did not want to lose Toyah, he felt that he could not stay and soon departed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the servant blessed God for steadfast {{faithfulness}} to Abraham. Rebekah ran and told everything to her mother's household. Rebekah's brother Laban {{ran out to}} the servant at the spring, {{and when he saw}} the nose-ring and the bands on Rebekah's arms, and when he heard his sister tell the story, Laban invited the servant to their house, had the camels unloaded and fed, and had water brought to bathe the feet of the servant and his party. But the servant would not eat before he had told his tale. The servant told how God had greatly blessed Abraham with sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and asses, and a son and sole heir. The servant told how Abraham made him swear to go to Abraham's kindred to get Isaac a wife, and that God would send an angel to make his errand successful. And the servant told how he met Rebekah at the well. The servant then asked whether or not they meant to treat Abraham with true kindness, and Laban and Bethuel answered that the matter had been decreed by God and Rebekah <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> be Isaac's wife. The servant bowed low to God. The fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|Buffy earned {{international}} attention for its unflinching {{focus on the}} relationship between Willow and Tara Maclay. Whedon and the writing staff had been considering developing a story arc in which a character explores his or her sexuality as the Scoobies left high school, but no particular effort was made to assign this arc to Willow. In 1999, {{at the end of the}} third season, the Boston Herald called Buffy [...] "the most gay show on network TV this year" [...] despite having no overtly gay characters among the core cast. It simply presented storylines that resembled coming out stories. In the fourth season episode [...] "Hush", Willow meets Tara, and to avoid being killed by a group of ghouls, they join hands to move a large vending machine telekinetically to barricade a door. The scene was, upon completion, noticeably sensual to Whedon, the producers, and network executives, who encouraged Whedon to develop a romantic storyline between Willow and Tara, but at the same time placed barriers on how far it <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> what could be shown. Two episodes later, Hannigan and Amber Benson were informed that their characters would become romantically involved. The actors were not told the end result of the Willow–Oz–Tara storyline, not sure what the eventual trajectory of the relationship would be, until Hannigan said, [...] "Then finally it was, 'Great!

2500|$|The {{concept for}} Disneyland began when Walt Disney was visiting Griffith Park in Los Angeles with his daughters Diane and Sharon. While {{watching}} them ride the merry-go-round, {{he came up}} with the idea of a place where adults and their children <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> have fun together, though his dream lay dormant for many years. He may have also been influenced by his father's memories of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago (his father worked at the Exposition). The Midway Plaisance there included a set of attractions representing various countries from around the world and others representing various periods of man; it also included many rides including the first Ferris wheel, a [...] "sky" [...] ride, a passenger train that circled the perimeter, and a Wild West Show. Another likely influence was Benton Harbor, Michigan's nationally famous House of David's Eden Springs Park. Disney visited the park and ultimately bought one of the older miniature trains originally used there; the colony had the largest miniature railway setup in the world at the time. The earliest documented draft of Disney's plans was sent as a memo to studio production designer Dick Kelsey on August 31, 1948, where it was referred to as a [...] "Mickey Mouse Park", based on notes Walt made during his and Ward Kimball's trip to Chicago Railroad Fair the same month, with a two-day stop in ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Vita Ansgari by Rimbert, [...] "After this it {{happened}} that a king named Heriold (Latin:Herioldus), who ruled {{over some of the}} Danes, was assailed by hatred and malignity, and was driven from his kingdom by the other kings of the same province. He came to his serene majesty the emperor Ludovic and asked that he might be thought worthy to receive his help so that {{he might be able to}} regain his kingdom. While the emperor kept him at his court he urged him, by personal persuasion and through the instrumentality of others, to accept the Christian faith, because there would then be a more intimate friendship between them, and a Christian people would more readily come to his aid and to the aid of his friends if both peoples were worshippers of the same God. At length, by the assistance of divine grace, he brought about his conversion, and when he had been sprinkled with the holy water of baptism he himself received him from the sacred font and adopted him as his son. When, then, he desired to send him back to his own land in order that he might, by his assistance, seek to recover his dominions, he began to make diligent enquiry in order that he might find a holy and devoted man who <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> continue with him, and who might strengthen him and his people, and by teaching the doctrine of salvation might induce them to receive the faith of the Lord." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the long}} fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah), Joseph told his {{brothers}} {{that he would}} allow them to prove themselves by letting one of them be bound in prison while the others carried grain to their houses and brought their youngest brother to Egypt. They said to one another that surely they were guilty concerning their brother, and so now this distress had come upon them. Reuben said that he had told them not to sin against their brother, but they had not listened. They did not realize that Joseph understood them, for he used an interpreter, and Joseph turned aside and wept. When Joseph returned, he bound Simeon before their eyes, and commanded that their vessels be filled with grain and that their money be restored to their sacks. They loaded their donkeys and departed. When they came to a lodging-place, one of them opened his sack and found his money, and their spirits fell, wondering what God had done to them. They went home and told Jacob all that had happened, and Jacob accused them of bereaving him of his children, first Joseph and now Simeon, and told them that they would not take Benjamin away. Reuben answered that Jacob could kill Reuben's two sons if Reuben failed to bring Benjamin back, but Jacob insisted that his son would not go down with them, for Joseph was dead and only he was left, and if harm befall Benjamin then it would be the death of Jacob. The famine continued, and Jacob told the brothers to buy more grain. But Judah reminded Jacob that the man had warned them that they could not see his face unless their brother came with them, so if Jacob sent their brother they could buy food, but if Jacob did not send him they could not go. Jacob asked them why they had treated him so ill as to tell the man that they had a brother. They explained that the man asked them directly about their kindred, whether their father was alive, and whether they had another brother, and they answered him; how were they to know that he would ask them to bring their brother down? Judah then asked Jacob to send the lad with him, so that they <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> the family could live, and Judah would serve as surety for him, for they could have been to Egypt and back by then if they had not lingered. Relenting, Jacob directed them to take a present for the man, double money in case the return of their payment was an oversight, and also their brother, and Jacob prayed that God might show them mercy before the man and that he might release Simeon and Benjamin to them. So the brothers went to Joseph. The long fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
