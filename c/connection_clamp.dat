50|$|<b>Clamp</b> <b>connections</b> are {{structures}} {{unique to}} the phylum Basidiomycota. Many fungi from this phylum produce spores in basidiocarps (fruiting bodies, or mushrooms), above ground. Though <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> are exclusive to this phylum, not all species of Basidiomycota possess these structures. As such, the presence or absences of <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> has been a tool in categorizing genera and species.|$|R

50|$|A fungal {{mycelium}} containing abundant <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> {{was found}} that dated to the Pennsylvanian era (298.9-323.2 Mya). This fossil, classified in the form genus Palaeancistrus, has hyphae that compare with extant saprophytic basidiomycetes. The oldest known <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> exist in hyphae present in the fossil fern Botryopteris antiqua, which predate Palaeancistrus by about 25 Ma.|$|R
50|$|Microscopic features: Pigmented cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia present. Basidia four-spored. <b>Clamp</b> <b>connections</b> common.|$|R
50|$|Most Phanerochaetaceae {{species are}} crust-like. Their hyphal system is monomitic (containing only {{generative}} hyphae), and these hyphae lack <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b> Their spores are thin-walled, smooth, and hyaline (translucent). Cystidia are often {{present in the}} hymenium. Although rare, some species have a polyporoid form, a dimitic hyphal system, and <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b> Phanerochaetaceae fungi produce a white rot.|$|R
50|$|The hyphal {{system of}} Clavaria species is always monomitic. The context hyphae are inflated, thin-walled, and lack <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> (though Petersen's amended {{concept of the}} genus {{includes}} some species with clamps). The basidia are two- to four-spored, in some species with an open, loop-like <b>clamp</b> <b>connection</b> at the base. Spores are smooth or spiny. Spore prints are white.|$|R
50|$|<b>Clamp</b> <b>connections</b> {{are formed}} by the {{terminal}} hypha during elongation. Before the <b>clamp</b> <b>connection</b> is formed this terminal segment contains two nuclei. Once the terminal segment is long enough it begins to form the <b>clamp</b> <b>connection.</b> At the same time, each nucleus undergoes mitotic division to produce two daughter nuclei. As the clamp continues to develop it uptakes one of the daughter (green circle) nuclei and separates it from its sister nucleus. While this is occurring the remaining nuclei (orange circles) begin to migrate from one another to {{opposite ends of the}} cell. Once all these steps have occurred a septum forms, separating each set of nuclei.|$|R

Largely unbranched tubular hyphae pass from cell to cell, but may sometimes produce a branch from a <b>clamp</b> <b>connection.</b> Other clamp-bearing hyphae occur clustered in individual cells or {{small groups of}} adjacent host cells. These hyphae may be tubular, catenulate with numerous hyphal swellings, or they may display a combination of both.

50|$|Eef Arnolds {{proposed}} an infrageneric classification of Camarophyllopsis {{consisting of two}} subgenera differentiated by {{the structure of the}} cap cuticle (pileipellis). Subgenus Camarophyllis contained species with a trichodermium pileipellis (with hyphae arranged perpendicularly to the cap surface), while species in subgenus Hygrotrama had a hymeniderm pileipellis (with a structure {{similar to that of the}} hymenium). Arnolds further split the latter subgenus into two sections: sect. Hygrotrama (with <b>clamp</b> <b>connections),</b> and sect. Hodophilus (without <b>clamp</b> <b>connections).</b>|$|R
50|$|The spores are rounded {{cylinders}} approximately 5-8 µm x 3-4 µm in size. The hyphal {{structure is}} monomitic with <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of a dikaryon is a plesiomorphic character for the subkingdom Dikarya, which covers both the Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. The {{formation of}} croziers in the Ascomycota and of <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> in the Basidiomycota facilitate maintenance of the dikaryons. However, some fungi {{in each of these}} phyla have evolved other methods for maintaining the dikaryons, and therefore neither croziers nor <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> are ubiquitous in either phylum.Examples of dikaryon can be found in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.|$|R

500|$|Hydnellum is {{classified}} in the family Bankeraceae, which was circumscribed by Marinus Anton Donk in 1961. Donk's original family concept included [...] the genera Bankera and Phellodon, whose species produce hyaline (translucent) and echinulate spores (covered with small spines). Donk also noted that Bankeraceae species lacked <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b> When <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> were discovered in Phellodon fibulatus and tuberculate spore ornamentation (the presence of small nodules on the spores) was found in P.niger, Kenneth Harrison thought the family Bankeraceae was superfluous, and placed Phellodon and Bankera in the family Hydnaceae. This taxonomic rearrangement was rejected by Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus in 1974, who showed that the tuberculate spores of P.niger {{were the result of}} an immature specimen. Richard Baird and Saeed Khan investigated spore ornamentation in North American Phellodon species using scanning electron microscopy, and rejected the placement of Phellodon in the Bankeraceae, preferring to leave it and Bankera in the Hydnaceae. Modern molecular phylogenetic analysis places Phellodon in the thelephoroid clade (roughly equivalent to the order Thelephorales) along with the related genera Bankera, Hydnellum, and Sarcodon. Although the status of the Bankeraceae has not been fully clarified with molecular genetic techniques, Phellodon {{is classified}} in this family by authorities on fungal taxonomy.|$|R
