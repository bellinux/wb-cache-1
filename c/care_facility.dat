30|$|An {{alternative}} {{mechanism that}} could explain our results is the mandatory provision of child <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> at NREGS work sites. Mothers {{who participated in}} NREGS work may have had better access to child <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> This would free up the time of school-going age siblings, particularly girls, who could then attend school more regularly. The 2007 YLS survey respondents were asked whether the NREGS participant had “benefited from child <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> at the worksite.” In the 2009 – 2010 survey, the respondents were asked: “Were there child <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in the last (NREGS) worksite?” Only 1  % of households report using on-site child <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in 2007 while more than 80  % of households report absence of child <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> at the last worksite in 2009 – 2010. We, therefore, do not consider this as a valid explanation of our findings.|$|R

40|$|Adequate and {{equitable}} {{access to health}} <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> by local communities in urban areas {{is an important issue}} of human service provision to both public policy makers and urban planners. Equitable and easy access to health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> is often considered one of the main objectives of many health care systems. Due to spatial variations in population distribution, transportation infrastructure as well as distribution of health <b>care</b> <b>facilities,</b> there exists spatial variation in accessibility to the health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> and locations where accessibility to health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> is poor. This study aims to use a GIS based case study approach and “spatial accessibility” measures, derived from fine spatial resolution datasets, to characterize and reveal spatial variations in access to health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> and identify disadvantaged locations / local communities in a selected urban fringe area in Melbourne, Australia...|$|R
40|$|For a long time, {{provisioning}} {{of health}} <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in Tanzania {{has been based}} on a threshold population and hierarchy of administrative units. Access to health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> is very low particularly within informal settlements in peri-urban areas. Focusing on the case of Charambe and Chamazi Administrative Wards in Dar es Salaam city, the study analyses the location of private health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in the context of rapid urbanisation. Theories which illuminate research questions include neo-liberal planning theory, sustainable urban form theory, interest based theory and central place theory. The study has found that provisioning of health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> based on the hierarchy of administrative units is not successful due to the oversight of the variation that exists among administrative wards as results of rapid urbanisation. Moreover, locational preferences of private health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> are not clearly analysed and integrated into the overall spatial organisation of the health care system. There are limitations of the private health care providers in investing in health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> of higher order and locating health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> based on population size and distribution. Therefore, spatial disparities of health care facilities’ distribution are due to an inability of the Government to regulate spatial location of private health care facilities; it has also failed to adequately locate public health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in less accessible areas including peri-urban area. The paper concludes that location and distribution of health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in rapid urbanising contexts should respond to population dynamics, nature of city growth and infrastructure in general. One of the key challenges is how to promote active participation of the private sector in addressing spatial location and distribution of health <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> Key words: Location, health <b>care</b> <b>facilities,</b> administrative units, privatisation, accessibility, motivations, equity, population dynamics and hierarchy...|$|R

40|$|Space {{management}} {{has been widely}} examined in commercial facilities, educational facilities, and hospitals but not in China’s institutional <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> Poor spatial arrangements, such as wasted space, dysfunctionality, and environment mismanagement, are increasing; in turn, the occupancy rate is decreasing due to residential dissatisfaction. To address these problems, this paper’s objective is to explore the space management goals (SMGs) in institutional <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in China. Systematic literature analysis was adopted to set SMGs’ principles, to identify nine theoretical SMGs, and to develop the conceptual model of SMGs for institutional <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> A total of 19 intensive {{interviews were conducted with}} stakeholders in seven institutional <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> to collect data for qualitative analysis. The qualitative evidence was analyzed through open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. As a result, six major categories as well as their interrelationships were put forward to visualize the path diagram for exploring SMGs in China’s institutional <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> Furthermore, seven expected SMGs that were explored from qualitative evidence were confirmed as China’s SMGs in institutional <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> by a validation test. Finally, a gap analysis among theoretical SMGs and China’s SMGs provided recommendations for implementing space management in China’s institutional <b>care</b> <b>facilities...</b>|$|R

We investigated {{the effects of}} the centralization of obstetricians and obstetric <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> on the perinatal mortality rate in Japan. Methods. We used the Gini coefficient as an index to represent the centralization of obstetricians and obstetric <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> The Gini coefficients were calculated for the number of obstetricians and obstetric <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> of 47 prefectures using secondarymedical care zones as units. Tomeasure {{the effects of the}} centralization of obstetricians and obstetric <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> on the outcomes (perinatal mortality rates), we performedmultiple regression analysis using the perinatal mortality rate as the dependent variable. Results. Obstetric <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> were more evenly distributed than obstetricians. The perinatal mortality rate was found to be significantly negatively correlated with the number of obstetricians per capita and the Gini coefficient of obstetric <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> The latter had a slightly stronger effect on the perinatal mortality rate. Conclusion. The centralization of obstetric <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> can improve the perinatal mortality rate, even when increasing the number of obstetricians is difficult. 1.
