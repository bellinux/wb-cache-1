500|$|The delta {{function}} <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> {{in the sense}} of distributions exactly as above in the one-dimensional case.

5|$|The {{homogeneous}} Poisson process <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> and generalized {{in different}} ways. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> such that its index set {{is the real}} line, and this stochastic process is also called the stationary Poisson process. If the parameter constant of the Poisson process is replaced with some non-negative integrable function of , the resulting process is called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the average density of points of the process is no longer constant. Serving as a fundamental process in queueing theory, the Poisson process is an important process for mathematical models, where it finds applications for models of events randomly occurring in certain time windows.|$|E
5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not {{a black and white}} duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> as being protocarnivorous.|$|E

5|$|For {{the sake}} of convenience, some derived units have special names and symbols. Such units may {{themselves}} be used {{in combination with the}} names and symbols for base units and for other derived units to express the units of other derived quantities. For example, the SI unit of force is the newton (N), the SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa)—and the pascal <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> as one newton per square metre (N/m2).|$|E
5|$|George Mackey {{had asked}} whether Born's rule is a {{necessary}} consequence of {{a particular set of}} axioms for quantum mechanics, and more specifically whether every measure on the lattice of projections of a Hilbert space <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> by a positive operator with unit trace. Though Richard Kadison proved this was false for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, Gleason's theorem (published 1957) shows it to be true for higher dimensions.|$|E

5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> as someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer {{each year in the}} USA.|$|E
5|$|The Universe <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> as {{everything}} that exists, {{everything that has}} existed, and everything that will exist. According to our current understanding, the Universe consists of spacetime, forms of energy (including electromagnetic radiation and matter), and the physical laws that relate them. The Universe encompasses all of life, all of history, and some philosophers and scientists suggest that it even encompasses ideas such as mathematics and logic.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} study prehistoric art is {{dependent}} on surviving artifacts. Art created in mediums such as sand, bark, hides and textiles has not normally endured, while less-perishable materials, such as rock, stone, bone, ivory (and {{to a lesser extent}} wood), later pottery and metal, {{are more likely to be}} extant. Whether all these artifacts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> as works of art is contested between scholars. Alexander Marshack argued that the earliest, non-representational incisions on rock mark the beginnings of human art. More cautiously, Paul Mellars suggests that the relative rarity of these works means they cannot be seen as integral to early human society and evidence of an artistic culture.|$|E

The treatment planning software enables multiple 2D {{images of the}} treatment site to be translated into a 3D ‘virtual patient’, within which {{the position of the}} applicators <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined.</b> The spatial relationships between the applicators, the treatment site and the surrounding healthy tissues within this ‘virtual patient’ are a copy of the relationships in the actual patient.|$|E

The current monarch is Elizabeth II.|$|E
5|$|A finite {{field is}} a set of numbers with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E
