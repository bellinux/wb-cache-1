5|$|The {{religious}} historian R.C. Dhere, {{winner of}} the Sahitya Akademi Award for his book Sri Vitthal: Ek Mahasamanvaya, opines that Vithoba worship may be even older—"Vedic or pre-Vedic", hence pre-dating the worship of Krishna. According to this theory, Vithoba is an amalgam of various local heroes, who gave their lives to save their cattle. He was first worshipped by the Dhangar, the cattle-owning caste of Maharashtra. The rise of the Yadava dynasty, which had <b>cowherd</b> ancestry, could {{have led to the}} glorification of Vithoba as Krishna, who is often depicted as a <b>cowherd.</b> This Vaishnavization of Vithoba also led to conversion of the Shaiva Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik, who—according to legend—brought Vithoba to Pandharpur. There may have been an attempt to assimilate Vithoba into Buddhism; today, both are viewed as a form of Vishnu in Hinduism.|$|E

Draupadi meets Virata's wife Sudeshna at a temple. She introduces herself as Sairandhri, an ill-fated woman married to five Gandharvas and requests {{for a job in}} her palace. Sudeshna agrees and promises that Sairandhri would never be used to perform unethical tasks and jobs. The Pandavas too join Virata's palace in these disguised forms and perform various duties. The Kauravas are in search of the Pandavas and their cousin Krishna learns about this. Arjuna's son Abhimanyu wishes to convey the same to the Pandavas and Krishna reluctantly agrees. Before sending him to Matsya, Krishna warns Abhimanyu not to reveal his real identity. Abhimanyu falls in love with Virata's daughter Uttaraa but does not reveal any details of his. Brihannala, who teaches dance to Uttaraa, learns this and is happy. Uttaraa's brother Uttara Kumara too wishes to see their alliance turn into a reality and waits for the opportunity.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the Pundalik legend, {{two of which are}} attested as textual variants of the Skanda Purana (1.34–67). According to the first, the ascetic Pundarika (Pundalik) is described as a devotee of god Vishnu and dedicated to the service of his parents. The god Gopala-Krishna, a form of Vishnu, comes from Govardhana as a <b>cowherd,</b> accompanied by his grazing cows, to meet Pundarika. Krishna is described as in digambar form, wearing makara-kundala, the srivatsa mark (described above), a head-dress of peacock feathers, resting his hands on his waist and keeping his cow-stick between his thighs. Pundarika asks Krishna to remain in this form {{on the banks of the}} river Bhima. He believes that Krishna's presence will make the site a tirtha and a kshetra. The location is identified with modern-day Pandharpur, which is situated on the banks of the Bhima. The description of Krishna resembles the characteristics of the Pandharpur image of Vithoba.|$|E
25|$|At a {{much later}} time, the Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William <b>Cowherd</b> in 1809 {{followed}} a vegetarian diet. <b>Cowherd</b> {{was one of}} the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. <b>Cowherd</b> encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance.|$|E
25|$|Various church founders have {{recommended}} vegetarianism, such as William <b>Cowherd</b> from the Bible Christian Church and Ellen G. White from the Seventh-day Adventists. <b>Cowherd,</b> {{who founded the}} Bible Christian Church in 1809, helped to establish the world's first Vegetarian Society in 1847.|$|E

The initial hosts were Colin <b>Cowherd,</b> who hosts the Fox Sports Radio morning program The Herd with Colin <b>Cowherd,</b> and Michelle Beadle, who joined ESPN from the YES Network. On June 1, 2012, Beadle left {{to join the}} NBC family of networks as a sports and entertainment contributor {{and was replaced by}} Numbers Never Lie host Charissa Thompson. <b>Cowherd</b> announced his departure from SportsNation in September 2012 to focus more on his radio work (and possibly because {{he did not want to}} make the move across the country; ESPN Radio does not have a west-coast base of operations), and his final episode aired on December 21, 2012. Wiley, who is a contributor to various programs on ESPN and who is based in Los Angeles, was announced as his replacement. On March 3, 2014, Beadle returned to SportsNation.|$|E

25|$|In early 2015, It was {{announced}} that the show would be televised on Fusion starting May 19, 2015. After the departure of Colin <b>Cowherd</b> from ESPN, the network moved the time slot of the show into the 10 AM to 1 PM slot formerly occupied by The Herd with Colin <b>Cowherd,</b> and moved the live simulcast to ESPNU, with the Fusion broadcast shifting to tape delay from 1 to 4 PM. On May 18, 2016, Fusion aired the show {{for the last time}} as the year-long contract with ABC/Disney was expired and was not renewed. The TV portion of the show then remained solely on ESPNU afterwards with the show airing live from 10 AM to 1 PM with no outlet for a tape-delay. On January 10, 2017, the final hour of the show began simulcasting on ESPN2, but in July 2017, the show's final hour returned to airing on ESPNU.|$|E

25|$|While {{there are}} much earlier {{references}} to the worship of this form of God, it is since Jayadeva Goswami wrote a famous poem Gita Govinda in the twelfth century of the Common Era, that {{the topic of the}} spiritual love between the divine Krishna and his devotee Radha, became a theme celebrated throughout India. It is also believed that Radha is not just one <b>cowherd</b> maiden, but is the origin of all the gopis, or divine personalities that participate in the rasa dance.|$|E
