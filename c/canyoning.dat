50|$|Many {{stretches}} of the Fraser are named in their own right, starting with the Little <b>Canyon</b> between Yale and Spuzzum, which is officially the lowest reach of the Fraser <b>Canyon</b> (although in regional terms Hope, 20 mi farther south, is considered a <b>canyon</b> town and to be the southern outlet of the <b>canyon</b> because the highway became more difficult from that point; the river is navigable to Yale). Between the Spuzzum and Boston Bar was known in the gold rush as the Big <b>Canyon</b> or Black Canyon; there are several named subcanyons of the Big <b>Canyon,</b> most famously Hells Gate <b>Canyon</b> (in some descriptions the Black <b>Canyon</b> is below Hell's Gate).
