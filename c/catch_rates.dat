5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on <b>catch</b> <b>rates</b> and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E

Bycatch is often discarded dead or dying by the time it is returned to the sea, and may alter the ecological balance in discarded regions.

25|$|Large {{numbers of}} smooth lanternsharks, {{predominantly}} juvenile, are caught incidentally by commercial longline fisheries, {{and to a}} lesser extent in bottom trawls and fixed bottom nets, in the eastern Atlantic and off Japan. This species is one of the three most common sharks caught as bycatch in deepwater fisheries off southern Portugal, along with the velvet belly lanternshark (E. spinax) and the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus). Most captured smooth lanternsharks are discarded, although some may be sold dried and salted for human consumption or processed into fishmeal. The smooth lanternshark's slow rates of reproduction and growth may render it vulnerable to population collapse under sustained fishing pressure. However, <b>catch</b> <b>rates</b> currently show no evidence of this occurring, which, coupled with the smooth lanternshark's wide geographic range, has led to the IUCN assessing it as of Least Concern.|$|E

40|$|Patch {{exploitation}} dynamics, {{based on}} individual tow data, provided {{new insights into}} the fishing behavior of mixed fisheries. Fishing grounds were determined and their geometry quantified based on the proximity of tow positions. Tows were classified as being part of either searching, sampling, or exploitation behavior based on the intertow distance. Fishers can detect patches of flatfish on a scale of 25 nautical miles 2. <b>Catch</b> <b>rate</b> during exploitation was 24 %– 36 % above the <b>catch</b> <b>rate</b> while searching, and decreased at a rate of 20 %·day– 1.

One of economically important tuna species is bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) which has a proportion of 21 % of the total production of large tuna group.

Data collection was conducted by the scientific observers from August 2005 to June 2014 in the tuna longline vessels were based in the port of Benoa, Bali. Moon phase data were collected from August 2005 to June 2014 from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

In April-July 2002, we conducted a mail survey of anglers with valid licenses fishing on the Lagoon of Venice to gather data on their fishing trips, behaviors and expenditures over the previous year.
