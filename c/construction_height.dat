50|$|This bridge {{opened in}} 1979 and {{eliminated}} {{a considerable amount}} of transit traffic south of Düsseldorf and the South Bridge (B 1), both then the only southern access from the left bank of the Rhine to Düsseldorf. Also, it connected the A 46 with the A 57. The Flehe Bridge has in each direction three vehicle lanes and a hard shoulder. The bridge does not cross the Rhine in a right angle, in order to preserve the area of water procurement of the old water company Flehe. A remarkable feature of the Flehe bridge is the reinforced concrete suspension tower, which looks like a Ypsilon turned on its head. In the handles of the pylons an elevator and stairs are accommodated above the roadway. The handles are in bridge longitudinal direction only 6.4 m broad.

40|$|The wrist {{plays an}} {{important}} role for the function of the human hand. The wrist joint is a complicated anatomical unit, consisting of various bones, ligaments and muscles. The distal and proximal joints combined with the rotation of the forearm excite movements at various levels that bring the hand into different positions. Apart from the rotation, the newly developed wrist with low <b>construction</b> <b>height</b> for myoelectric prostheses allows for volar and dorsal flexion at various locking positions. Besides those typical functions which allow positioning of the hand, the joint must meet further technical requirements. Therefore the prosthetic wrist joint clearly differs from its natural model. The most important difference is the exchangeability of the terminal device. This flexion joint with its additional degrees of freedom in motion considerably enhances the radius of action and thus increases the practical value of the myoelectric system to the patient...|$|E

On the basis of existing researches and by combining the checking method of global and local stability of cooling towers in operation period given in the present design code, this paper presents a method with implementation steps to check the global and local stability of cooling towers during construction. The method is verified to be simple and effective by a cooling tower example. The example analysis indicates that the global stability of cooling towers decreases with the <b>construction</b> <b>height</b> and achieves the minimum when the topmost layer is just built, though it increases bit when all concrete layers reach the design strength. The local stability of cooling towers during construction is poor in the range of 1 / 5 to 3 / 5 tower height and should be paid great attention during construction...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{evaluate}} the reduction of evaporation of Lake Nasser’s water caused by disconnecting (fully or partially) some of its secondary channels (khors). This evaluation integrates remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, aerodynamic principles, and Landsat 7 ETM+ images. Three main procedures were carried out in this study; the first derived the surface temperature from Landsat thermal band; the second derived evaporation depth and approximate evaporation volume for the entire lake, and quantified evaporation loss to the secondary channels’ level over one month (March) by applied aerodynamic principles on surface temperature of the raster data; the third procedure applied GIS suitability analysis to determine which of these secondary channels (khors) should be disconnected. The results showed evaporation depth ranging from 2. 73 mm/day at {{the middle of the}} lake to 9. 58 mm/day at the edge. The evaporated water-loss value throughout the entire lake was about 0. 86 billionm 3 /month (March). The analysis suggests {{that it is possible to}} save an approximate total evaporation volume loss of 19. 7 millionm 3 /month (March), and thus 2. 4 billionm 3 /year, by disconnecting two khors with approximate <b>construction</b> <b>heights</b> of 8 m and 15 m. In conclusion, remote sensing and GIS are useful for applications in remote locations where field-based information is not readily available and thus recommended for decision makers remotely planning in water conservation and management...|$|R
