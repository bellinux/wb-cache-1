40|$|A new {{approach}} to the forecasting of <b>construction</b> cost <b>indices</b> in Taiwan is presented. <b>Construction</b> cost <b>indices</b> have always been {{used to assess the}} variations in construction labour and material costs. These indices have been traditionally based on historical statistical information in Taiwan. However, the indices fall short in forecasting the future cost trends in the construction industry. By investigating the characteristic data that make up the <b>construction</b> cost <b>indices,</b> the major determining factors were identified as (1) 'the number of difference', (2) the required periods of preceding <b>construction</b> cost <b>indices,</b> (3) the weight associated with each preceding <b>construction</b> cost <b>index,</b> (4) the mean value of the series of <b>construction</b> cost <b>indices</b> that have been converted into a stationary series, and (5) the estimation of the errors between the predicted values of <b>construction</b> cost <b>indices</b> and the observed values of <b>construction</b> cost <b>indices.</b> An analytical model has been established to forecast the present and future <b>construction</b> cost <b>indices</b> based on these factors, and its feasibility tested by using the observed data of the <b>construction</b> cost <b>indices</b> obtained from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China. The results suggest that this model is reasonably adequate in forecasting the trend values of <b>construction</b> cost <b>indices</b> in Taiwan. <b>Construction</b> Cost <b>Indices,</b> Determining Factors, Forecasting, Modelling, Taiwan, Experience,...|$|R

In the paper, the Wenchuan Earthquake of China would be chosen as the extreme event and an EMD-based (Empirical Mode Decomposition) analysis approach would be used to test the earthquake’s impact.
