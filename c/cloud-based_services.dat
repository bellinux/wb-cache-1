2500|$|In the {{technology}} industry, the Snowden effect {{had a profound}} impact after it was revealed that the NSA was tapping into the information held by some U.S. <b>cloud-based</b> <b>services.</b> Google, Cisco, and AT lost business internationally due to the public outcry over their roles in NSA spying. A study by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation published in August 2013 estimated that the cloud-based computing industry could have lost up to $35 billion by 2016. The Wall Street Journal named [...] "the Snowden effect" [...] as 2013's top tech story, saying Snowden's leaks [...] "taught businesses that the convenience of the cloud cuts both ways." [...] The Journal predicted the effect would top 2014 news as well, given the number of documents yet to be revealed. In China, the most profitable country for U.S. tech companies, all are [...] "under suspicion as either witting or unwitting collaborators" [...] in the NSA spying, according to the director of the Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University. The effect was also seen in changes to investment in the industry, with security [...] "back on the map" [...] according to Hussein Kanji, Venture Capitalist at Hoxton Ventures.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) {{model is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} {{opportunities}} for <b>cloud-based</b> <b>service</b> providers. It provides an environment that reduces operating and capital expenses while increasing agility and reliability of critical information systems. In this multitenancy environment, <b>cloud-based</b> <b>service</b> providers are challenged with providing a secure isolation service combining different vertical segments, such as financial or public services, while nevertheless meeting industry standards and legal compliance requirements within their data centers. In order to achieve this, new solutions are being designed and proposed to provide traffic isolation for a large numbers of tenants and their resulting traffic volumes. This paper highlights key challenges that <b>cloud-based</b> <b>service</b> providers might encounter while providing multi-tenant environments. It also succinctly describes some key solutions for providing simultaneous tenant and network isolation, as well as highlights their respective advantages and disadvantages. We begin with Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) introduced in 1994 in "RFC 1701 ", and will conclude with today's latest solutions. We detail fifteen of the newest architectures and then compare their complexities, the overhead they induce, their VM migration abilities, their resilience, their scalability, and their multi data center capacities. This paper is intended for, but not limited to, <b>cloud-based</b> <b>service</b> providers who want to deploy the most appropriate isolation solution for their needs, taking into consideration their existing network infrastructure. This survey provides details and comparisons of various proposals while also highlighting possible guidelines for future research on issues pertaining to the design of new network isolation archi-tectures...|$|R
