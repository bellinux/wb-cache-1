The difference between the overheating temperature($T_{OH}$) and the thermodynamical melting point($T_M$) increase for increasing pressure. When particles move into the repulsive part of the potential the properties at $T_{OH}$ change. There is a crossover pressure where the volume jump becomes pressure-independent.

The reason lies in the crystalline matrices having a high capacity to dis-solve great quantities of rare earth trifluorides (up to 50 `%, mol [2 - 4]). Multicomponent non-stoichiometric fluorides that comprise the MI vRvI,+y phases are used as laser and optical materials, superionic con-ductors, scintillators, etc. [5].

5000|$|Due to {{the nature}} of nuclear energy generation, the {{materials}} used in the RPV are constantly bombarded by high-energy particles. These particles can either be neutrons or fragments of an atom created by a fission event. When one of these particles collides with an atom in the material, it will transfer some of its kinetic energy and knock the atom out of its position in the lattice. When this happens, this primary [...] "knock-on" [...] atom (PKA) that was displaced and the energetic particle may rebound and collide with other atoms in the lattice. This creates a chain reaction that can cause many atoms to be displaced from their original position. This atomic movement leads to the creation of many types of defects.The accumulation <b>of</b> various <b>defects</b> can cause microstructural changes that can lead to a degradation in macroscopic properties. As previously mentioned, the chain reaction caused by a PKA often leaves a trail <b>of</b> vacancies and <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> at the edge. This is called a displacement cascade. The vacancy-rich core of a displacement cascade can also collapse in to dislocation loops. Due to irradiation, materials tend to develop a higher concentration <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> than is present in typical steels, and the high temperatures of operation induce migration <b>of</b> the <b>defects.</b> This can cause things like recombination of interstitials and vacancies and <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> like <b>defects,</b> which can either create or dissolve precipitates or voids.
