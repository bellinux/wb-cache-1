Type conversion method proposed to improve performance by overcoming limitation of applications that render characters as shape rather than text which slows down the printer as a PDF file is composed of thousands of character.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Einstein’s conventionalist {{definition}} {{of time is}} sufficient for, but not necessary to the geometric modelling of Special Relativity. A different convention allows that any time interval t, can be measured by dc, the distance travelled from an origin by the spherical wave-front of a light pulse, c. This means that the relationships represented by the hyperbolic geometry of Minkowski can also be represented by circular function geometry (CFG), where the spherical surface of c provides both a fourth set t, of frame-dependent <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>points</b> and a parameter s, for measuring intervals that are invariant between reference frames. However, sine values under the circle range from 1 - 0, rather than 1 -∞. This does not allow that for a reference frame velocity ≈ c, any interval length ≈ ∞. Furthermore, since CFG does not subdivide space-time into past and future zones, it excludes the possibility of backwards time travel for signal velocities > c...|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} {{to develop a}} summary theory about utility and value as categories of value economic behaviour of the individual is justified. They are {{at the root of}} the economy and should be the beginning of each complete or fundamental economic research. The concepts for value and marginal value (which are subjective value and subjective marginal value at the level of a particular individual) are introduced and explained together with well-known in literature formulation of utility and marginal utility. A theory about marginal value could not be less important to the economic science than the theory about marginal utility. A conclusion is drawn that the functions (curves) of the total utility and the total value of a variable quantity of a certain good do not start from co-ordinates' beginning, but from other <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>points,</b> which is found to be crucial for the economic equilibrium of the individual. Formulations of value and marginal value are absolutely compatible with the modern economics. ...|$|R

40|$|Robin Jenkins’s {{short stories}} are {{collected}} in two books: A Far Cry from Bowmore (1973), {{set in the}} far east, in locations such as Malaysia, Afghanistan and Burma, and Lunderston Tales (1996), set in a small seaside town {{on the west coast}} of Scotland. This chapter begins by discussing ideas of distance and proximity in Jenkins’s writing, showing how stylistically he brings together apparently ‘objective’ prose describing events ‘externally’ with more insidious and sly representations of ‘subjective’ or ‘internally’-realised intimations of characters’ motives, prejudices and dispositions. This allows him to explore the relations of difference and continuity between appearance and the deeper currents informing the actions of his characters. The chapter goes through each of the stories in both books, and considers one further story published independently, chronologically between each of the books’ publication dates. The developing argument centres on the relation between ‘realism’ and the sense Jenkins’s writing delivers that realism is not all there is. The unexpected twists in the narratives, the moral ambiguities and unreliable <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>points</b> experienced by many of the characters, the recurrence the inexplicable, make Jenkins’s writing uniquely challenging and compelling in modern Scottish literature, and nowhere more evidently than in his short stories...|$|R

Typically, these tests do not accurately represent the forces and motions the footwear experiences during human use and there is substantial scope to improve this situation. The purpose of this study was to assess the extent to which RoboGuide software can be used as a virtual environment to support the emulation of the ground contact phase of human locomotion on a FANUCTM six degrees of freedom industrial robot. A series of simple (linear and corner) and complex (sagittal plan heelstrike running) movements were completed on both the robot and RoboGuide using the same input kinematics. The effect of movement velocity, level of robotic smoothing and number of <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>points</b> defining the trajectory were also investigated. The resulting movement and timings on the robot and Roboguide were compared to the input kinematics as well as to each other. The results indicated small differences in the robot and RoboGuide trajectories for simple linear motions (< 30 mm), that became much greater for the complex footstrike motion (∼ 100 mm). These differences were affected by levels of smoothing and movement velocity and, notably, only with no smoothing did the robot and Roboguide approach the input trajectory. To conclude, RoboGuide does not accurately represent the motion of the FANUCTM robot and therefore only has limited use in supporting the physical emulation of complex sporting movements...|$|R
30|$|Digital {{close range}} photogrammetry, using a DSLR camera and lighting, is an {{established}} non-contact optical technique from remote sensing {{and is used}} for the documentation of objects by aerial photogrammetry at a variety of scales, amongst them museum artefacts and heritage buildings. Photogrammetry is capable of delivering high-resolution colour images ideal for the documentation of current condition and damages {{on the surface of the}} artefact, enabling the visualisation of details of the order of 50  μm. Structure from Motion (SfM) uses the principle that movement through a scene allows an understanding of the shape of the scene in three dimensions, in the same way as walking through a room allows one to visualise the space and objects placed within it. In SfM, this is represented by a series of systematic viewpoints; overlapping photographs are taken from multiple angles around the object, either by moving around the artefact, or by moving the object on a turntable in front of a camera on a tripod. The result will be of higher quality if there is no directional lighting that produces shadows, for example if photographs are taken with indirect lighting to the ceiling or using a light tent acting as a diffuser with lights. The digital output is a 3 D coloured point cloud, i.e. a large number of <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>points</b> in space, or a surface model, i.e. coloured polygon mesh of triangles, [14] and [15]. In summary, photogrammetry and SfM are applicable for objects of variable scale and surface properties [16] and therefore also applicable to the small Roman coins of this study.|$|R
40|$|The role of CAOS {{systems is}} now well {{established}} {{in several areas}} of orthopaedic surgery. The increasing use of these systems, particularly in knee arthroplasty, has been supported by clinical trials that demonstrate a more accurate final position of implanted devices compared with conventional instrumentation. CAOS technology is constantly evolving along with its expanding list of potential indications. This requires the adaptation of both software and hardware components. It is therefore essential that potential users {{have confidence in the}} accuracy of these systems. The aim of this project was to design and manufacture a standardised measurement object (phantom) to independently evaluate CAOS system performance. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International along with CAOS International recently drafted a standard for measuring technical accuracy of navigation systems. This proposed standard was obtained and its recommendations used to design a phantom model. This consisted of a 150 × 150 × 20 mm base plate and two additional levels including a single 30 ° slope. This created a 3 D surface on which points could be placed. <b>Co-ordinates</b> for 21 <b>points</b> were given to establish the x, y and z axes of a Cartesian system and then to have points at a variety of known locations in this 3 D space. The final model was machined from a billet of marine grade aluminium alloy 6082 -T 6 (chosen for its dimensional stability) using a vertical computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling machine with the <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>points</b> drilled with a Ø 0. 8 mm 60 ° BSO centre drill to a depth of 1. 2 mm. The drill holes, with chamfers of Ø 1. 0 mm, were designed to accommodate a ball-nosed pointer tip of a known diameter. A Perspex base unit with three different sites of rigid tracker attachment was made to hold the phantom and provide its reference frame. This avoided the need to directly modify the phantom itself. The final design has been used to measure the positional accuracy of a novel portable navigation system and demonstrate that it is not yet suitable for clinical evaluation due to errors of 1 – 6 mm in point location. It has also allowed independent technical validation of current pre-existing navigation systems...|$|R

To this aim, 16 young healthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as possible with their eyes closed in two conditions of No-biofeedback and Biofeed-back. Centre of foot pressure (CoP) displacements, re-corded using a force platform, were used to compute the horizontal displacements of the vertical projection of the centre of gravity (CoGv) and those of the difference between the CoP and the vertical projection of the CoG (CoP-CoGv). Analysis of the CoP-CoGv displacements showed larger root mean square (RMS) and mean power frequencies (MPF) in the Biofeedback than in the No-biofeedback condition. Stabilogram-diffusion analysis further showed a concomitant increased spatial and re-duced temporal transition <b>point</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> at which the corrective processes were initiated and an increased per-sistent behaviour of the CoP-CoGv displacements over the short-term region. Analysis of the CoGv displacements showed decreased RMS and increased MPF in the Bio-feedback relative to the No-biofeedback condition.
