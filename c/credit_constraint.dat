40|$|This paper {{employs a}} two-period {{life-cycle}} model to derive the optimal tax policy when educational investments {{are subject to}} <b>credit</b> <b>constraints.</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>constraints</b> arise from the limited commitment of debitors to repay loans and are endogenously determined by private banks under the non-default condition that individuals can-not be better off by defaulting. We show that the optimal redistributive taxation trades the welfare gain of reducing borrowing demand and of changing the <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> against the efficiency costs of distorting education and labor supply. In addition, we compare the optimal taxation with that when <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> are taken as given. If income taxation decreases (increases) the borrowing limit, taking <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> as given leads to a too high (low) labor tax rate. Thus, ignoring the effects of tax policy on <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> overestimates (underestimates) the welfare effects of income taxation. Numerical examples show that income taxation tightens the <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> and the optimal tax rates are lower when credit constrains are endogenized. The intuition is that redistributive taxation reduces the incentive to invest in education and to work, thus exaggerating the moral hazard problems associated with <b>credit</b> <b>constraints.</b> labor taxation, human capital investment, <b>credit</b> <b>constraints...</b>|$|R

Crucially for the policy-making, the <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> plays a double-bladed role in the bubble emergence. That is, with the natural credit limit which is evaluated at the fundamental value of the collateral, a bubble cannot exist; while, if the …nancial intermediary sets the credit limit at the expected value of the collateral, the <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> instead helps support the bubble.

The use of the stochastic frontier approach allows us to define the (unobserved) optimum investment {{that is consistent with}} a firm‟s characteristics such as the Tobin‟s q during each firm-year, and then estimate the deviation from this unobserved optimum {{in the form of an}} (investment) efficiency score that varies between zero and one. This deviation is interpreted as the degree of <b>credit</b> <b>constraint,</b> and we are also able {{to estimate the}} impact of firm characteristics such as leverage and business group affiliation on the degree of <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> via their marginal effects. Our results suggest that the degree of <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> of an average firm increased over time during the sample period, despite significant reforms of the Indian banking sector by the turn of the century. We also find that the degree of <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> decreases with cash flow and assets, which is consistent with the available literature.

We link two existing literatures on <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> and financial exclusion {{to assess the impact of}} these developments on the financial circumstances of low and modest-income consumers. We develop a model that identifies observable measures of <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> and financial exclusion and relate them to consumer characteristics and life cycle behaviour. We estimate this model using the two latest Surveys of Financial Security for 1999 and 2005, which provide consistent evidence of <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> and financial exclusion through time. We find modest overlap among our measures of financial exclusion, which include a zero balance/no account, credit card refusal, and using a pawnshop. Probit regression is used to investigate the factors influencing the incidence of financial exclusion. The results are similar for 1999 and 2005 and indicate rising incidence of financial exclusion as income and wealth fall, although the relationship is nonlinear such that incidence rises much faster at very low levels of income and wealth. Our analysis also suggests potentially important links between financial literacy, formal education, asset building, and financial exclusion and <b>credit</b> <b>constraint.</b> When we combine the samples, we find statistically significant evidence of growth in the incidence of each indicator of financial exclusion when other factors are held constant.

The results provide evidence that the relaxation of all credit constraints would significantly enhance agricultural productivity; hence, contributing favourably to rural development, poverty alleviation, and the improvement of living standards in Tanzania. Moreover, consideration of only quantity constraints was shown to underestimate the full impact of <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> status in the presence of transaction costs and risk constraints.

40|$|Abstract. Previous {{studies on}} {{financial}} frictions {{have been unable}} to establish the empirical significance of <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> in macroeconomic fluctuations. This paper argues that the muted impact of <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> stems from the absence of a mechanism to explain the observed persistent comovements between housing prices and business investment. We develop such a mechanism by incorporating two key features into a DSGE model: we identify shocks that shift the demand for collateral assets and we allow productive agents to be credit-constrained. A combination of these two features enables our model to successfully generate an empirically important mechanism that amplifies and propagates macroeconomic fluctuations through <b>credit</b> <b>constraints.</b> [T]he degree of amplification provided by <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> seems to depend crucially on the parameters of the economy. This sets up a clear challenge for future work: to demonstrate, in a carefully calibrated model environment, that the amplification and propagation possible by <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> are quantitatively significant (Kocherlakota, 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> faced by a firm and the unit value prices of its exports. The paper modifies Arkolakis’s (2010) model of trade with heterogeneous firms by introducing endogenous quality and <b>credit</b> <b>constraints.</b> The model predicts that tighter <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> faced by a firm reduce its optimal prices as its choice of lower-quality products dominates the price distortion effect resulting from <b>credit</b> <b>constraints.</b> However, a competing theory based on the alternative assumption that quality is exogenous across firms would predict completely opposite results: Prices increase as firms face tighter <b>credit</b> <b>constraints.</b> An empirical analysis using Chinese bank loans data, Chinese firm-level data from theNational Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC), and Chinese customs data strongly supports the predictions of the endogenous-quality model. Moreover, the predictions of the exogenous-quality model are supported by using quality-adjusted prices in regression analy-sis.

The study examined the factors influencing <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> (CC) and production efficiency of farming households in Oyo State, Nigeria. Primary data was randomly collected using structured questionnaire from 120 mixed farmers in the study area. Data was analyzed using descriptive analysis, probit regression and stochastic frontier analysis. The results shows that 79. 2 {{percent of the respondents}} were credit constrained and this has negative influence on their production efficiency as credit constrained farming households (CCFH) were found to be less efficient with mean efficiency of 0. 721 than unconstrained farming households with 0. 913. Age, gender, education, and dependency ratio of farmers are significant variables that influenced <b>credit</b> <b>constraint</b> conditions of the farmers while the maximum likelihood estimate of the production frontier revealed that farm size, labour and quantity of agro-chemical used are positively and significantly related to the production efficiency of farmers.

If previous <b>credit</b> <b>constraints</b> were large, requested amounts increase more moderately, while granted amounts increase more strongly than in the case of small previous constraints. The findings are a sign of the use of dynamic incentives at the bank side to overcome information problems when contracting repeatedly with opaque borrowers.
