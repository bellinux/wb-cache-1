5|$|The Court's {{right to}} give damages was reiterated in Phelps v Prothero in 1855, where the Court of Appeal in Chancery held {{that if a}} {{plaintiff}} starts an action in a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> for specific performance and damages are also appropriate, the <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> may choose to award damages. This authorisation was limited to certain circumstances, and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that lawyers at the time commented as if the Court had not previously {{been able to do}} so.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas, a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E
25|$|After US courts merged law and equity, American law courts adopted {{many of the}} {{procedures}} of equity courts. The procedures in a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> were much more flexible than the courts at common law. In American practice, certain devices such as joinder, counterclaim, cross-claim and interpleader originated in the courts of equity. Also, the modern class action evolved out of the equitable doctrine of virtual representation, which enabled a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> to fully dispose of an estate even though it might contain contingent interests held by persons over which {{the court did not}} have direct jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|United States {{bankruptcy}} {{courts are}} the one example <b>of</b> US federal <b>courts</b> which operate as <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> Some common law jurisdictions—such as the U.S. states of Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Tennessee—preserve the distinctions between law and <b>equity</b> and between <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b>|$|R

25|$|Historically, solicitors {{existed in}} America, though the term {{referred}} to a lawyer who argued cases in a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity,</b> {{as opposed to an}} attorney who appeared only in courts of law. With the chancery or equity courts disappearing or being subsumed under courts of law, solicitors became obsolete by the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In {{suits against}} private parties, the United States {{is not a}} {{necessary}} party. Similarly, historically, a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> could not set aside fraudulent transfers of aboriginal title unless all parties to the fraud were before it. Old lower court decisions have expressed the view that aboriginal title is a political, non-justiciable question. But, this view was subsequently rejected by the Supreme Court in Oneida II.|$|E
25|$|Trusts may {{be created}} by the {{expressed}} intentions of the settlor (express trusts) or they may {{be created by}} operation of law known as implied trusts. An implied trust is one created by a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> because of acts or situations of the parties. Implied trusts are divided into two categories: resulting and constructive. A resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties, but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent. A constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.|$|E

5000|$|Nevertheless, <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> also {{developed}} a doctrine that an applicant must assert a [...] "property interest". This was a limitation on their own power to issue relief. This {{does not mean that}} the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> had taken jurisdiction over property. Rather, it means that they came to require that the applicant assert a right of some significant substance as opposed to a claim for relief based on an injury to mere emotional or dignitary interests.|$|R

25|$|Delaware {{chartered}} corporations {{rely on the}} state's Court of Chancery {{to decide}} legal disputes, which places legal decisions with a judge instead of a jury. The Court of Chancery, known both nationally and internationally for its speed, competence, and knowledgeable judiciary as a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity,</b> is empowered to grant broad relief {{in the form of}} injunctions and restraining orders, which is of particular importance when shareholders seek to block or enjoin corporate actions such as mergers or acquisitions. The Court of Chancery, as a statewide court, may hear cases in any of the state's three counties. A dedicated-use Chancery courthouse was constructed in 2003 in Georgetown, Sussex County. It has hosted high-profile complex corporate trials such as the Disney shareholder litigation.|$|E
500|$|Only Serjeants-at-Law {{could become}} judges {{of the common}} law courts; this rule came into being in the 14th century for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, and was {{extended}} to the Exchequer of Pleas in the 16th century; it {{did not apply to}} the Court of Chancery, a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity,</b> or the Ecclesiastical Courts. The Serjeants-at-Law also had social privileges; they ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath, and their wives had the right to be addressed as [...] "Lady —", {{in the same way as}} the wives of knights or baronets. A Serjeant made a King's Counsel or judge would still retain these social privileges. As the cream of the legal profession, Serjeants earned higher fees than normal barristers.|$|E

500|$|Kenyon's {{appointment}} was initially greeted with caution by his fellow barristers, who worried that, {{as he had}} practised in a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> rather than a court of common law, he might be unfamiliar with the area covered by his new posting in the Court of King's Bench. Despite this, he was noted as an excellent judge, although one who suffered from an [...] "excess of zeal" [...] in moral issues. One of his flaws was his defective education; he was too proud to avoid exhibiting his ignorance. He was particularly noted for using Latin incorrectly, leading George III to say [...] "My Lord... it would be well if you would stick to your good law and leave off your bad Latin". As a judge, Kenyon over-ruled the principles that {{a court of law}} could not consider trusts or a pecuniary legacy; it was said that he [...] "restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law". After nearly one and a half decades as a judge, Kenyon died on 4 April 1802 in Bath.|$|E
500|$|The Court of Chancery was a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> in England and Wales that {{followed}} {{a set of}} loose rules to avoid {{the slow pace of}} change and possible harshness (or [...] "inequity") of the common law. The Chancery had jurisdiction over all matters of equity, including trusts, land law, the administration of the estates of lunatics and the guardianship of infants. Its initial role was somewhat different, however; {{as an extension of the}} Lord Chancellor's role as Keeper of the King's Conscience, the Court was an administrative body primarily concerned with conscientious law. Thus the Court of Chancery had a far greater remit than the common law courts, whose decisions it had the jurisdiction to overrule for much of its existence, and was far more flexible. Until the 19th century, the Court of Chancery could apply a far wider range of remedies than the common law courts, such as specific performance and injunctions, and also had some power to grant damages in special circumstances. With the shift of the Exchequer of Pleas towards a common law court and loss of its equitable jurisdiction by the Administration of Justice Act 1841, the Chancery became the only national equitable body in the English legal system.|$|E
500|$|Exchequer {{business}} increased under James and Charles I, {{before the}} English Civil War disrupted the courts. With the {{increasing use of}} the Writ of Quominus, which allowed royal debtors to bring a case against a third party who owed them money if it was that lack of money which prevented them paying the king and the new regime, the Exchequer actively transformed from a [...] "tax court" [...] dealing with civil cases to a dedicated <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> and common law. The Civil War caused four equitable courts to be dissolved; the Court of Star Chamber was formally dissolved in 1641, the Council of the North and Council of Wales and the Marches had their equity jurisdiction stripped by the same Act of Parliament, and the Court of Requests became invalid after the Privy Seal was invalidated by the outcome of the English Civil War, as it was dependent on the Seal for its authority. After the War ended there were only two equity courts remaining, the Exchequer and Court of Chancery, the latter publicly reviled for its slow pace and because it was led by the Lord Chancellor, a political figure who had been intimately involved in the conflict. As a result, the Exchequer increased in importance as a court, although it is not known whether its active transformation was a judicial or political decision.|$|E
