40|$|The {{attention}} to rapid pavement repair has grown fast in recent decades: this topic is strategic {{for the airport}} management process for civil purposes and peacekeeping missions. This work {{presents the results of}} laboratory and on-site tests for rapid runway repair, in order to analyse and compare technical and mechanical performances of 12 different materials currently used in airport. The study focuses on site repairs, a technique adopted most frequently than repairs with modular elements. After describing mechanical and physical properties of the examined materials (2 bituminous emulsions, 5 cement mortars, 4 cold bituminous mixtures and 1 expanding resin), the study presents the results of carried out mechanical tests. The results demonstrate that the best performing material is a one-component fast setting and hardening cement mortar with graded aggregates. This material allows the runway reopening 6 h after the work. A <b>cold</b> <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture</b> (bicomponent premixed cold asphalt with water as catalyst) and the ordinary cement concrete allow the reopening to traffic after 18 h, but both ensure a lower service life (1000 coverages) than the cement mortar (10, 000 coverages). The obtained results include important information both laboratory level and field, and they could be used by airport management bodies and road agencies when scheduling and evaluating pavement repairs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rational structural design methodology termed the ‘cumulative damage approach’ for road, port and airport pavements incorporating <b>cold</b> <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> with foamed bitumen. This {{has been developed}} along with a laboratory test, the uniaxial indirect tensile test, to evaluate the fatigue characteristics of these mixtures. The test was developed {{with a view to}} addressing the limitations of conventional fatigue tests for foamed bitumen mixtures. The new design approach takes account of the actual stiffness evolution of the mixtures obtained from the fatigue test. It is compared with a traditional approach for conventional flexible pavements, which is based on pavement life as a function of computed tensile strain in the material and interpretation of fatigue data in a conventional way. The results show that the traditional design approach yields conservative outcomes for pavements with foamed bitumen mixtures if the same transfer function or shift factor used for hot mix asphalt is applied. The results also show that if all factors other than induced load influence are the same, the shift factor for foamed bitumen mixtures could be 25 – 35 % higher than for hot mix asphalt...|$|R
40|$|A {{weakness}} in early {{strength and the}} need for longer curing times in the case of <b>cold</b> <b>bituminous</b> emulsion <b>mixtures</b> (CBEMs) compared to hot mix asphalt have been cited as barriers to the wider utilization of these mixtures. A binary blended filler material produced from high calcium fly ash (HCFA) and a fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (FC 3 R) was found to be very effective in providing microstructural integrity with a novel fast-curing cold asphalt concrete for the binder course (CACB) mixture. Balanced oxide compositions within the novel filler were identified as responsible for an enhanced hydration reaction, resulting in a very high early strength and a significant improvement in permanent deformation and fatigue resistance. Improved water sensitivity for progressive hydration with the new binary filler was also established while SEM analysis confirmed the formation of hydration products after various curing ages. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The little {{stiffness}} modulus, high voidage {{and long}} curing time has limited {{the use of}} CBEM’s (<b>cold</b> <b>bituminous</b> emulsion <b>mixtures)</b> in road and highways to pavement experiencing low traffic. The {{aim of this study}} is to improve the properties of gap graded CRA (cold rolled asphalt) containing OPC (ordinary portland cement) as filler by addition of a by-product material as an activator. OPC was added to the CRA as a replacement to the conventional mineral filler (0 %- 100 %), while LJMUA (Liverpool John Moores University Activator) was added as an additive in the range from 0 %- 3 % by total mass of aggregate. Laboratory tests included stiffness modulus and uniaxial creep test to assess the mechanical properties. The results have shown a considerable improvement in the mechanical properties from the addition of LJMUA to the CRA containing OPC especially for the early life stiffness modulus that is the main disadvantage of the cold mixtures...|$|R

It was found that the CBEMs, with or without cement, preferably to be compacted soon after mixing. When there is a delay in compaction, the loose mixture should be kept in a sealed container and to be compacted within 24 hours (without cement) or after 24 hours when incorporating cement (rapid setting cement-RSC).

A considerable improvement was identified by the ITSM test in addition to a substantial enhancement in rutting resistance, temperature susceptibility and water sensitivity.

40|$|Currently, {{there exists}} no universally {{accepted}} <b>Cold</b> <b>Bituminous</b> Emulsion <b>Mixtures</b> (CBEMs) design procedure. Three {{of the most}} popular design procedures, which in essence were based on AASHTO and the Asphalt Institute design guidelines were studied and tested in detail {{during the course of this}} investigation. In general, the design procedures investigated were found to be not user-friendly or simple to implement. The main obstacles that restrict the adoption of CBEMs as the first choice material as opposed to conventional hot asphalts, for all bound pavement layers are: the high compacted mixture porosity, low early life strength and long curing times. CBEMs are more widely accepted in low to medium trafficked pavements. The key aims of this investigation were to improve and simplify the design procedure of CBEMs, and to investigate ways of improving CBEMs volumetric and mechanical properties. The main aggregate materials used in this investigation were carboniferous limestone and quartzitic asphalt sand.

The use of the retained strength ratios obtained from laboratory moisture damage tests is a useful tool in making quantitative predictions of the related damage caused by water. This study involved laboratory work on the effect of water on the performance of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Comparisons are made between the performances of Hot-rolled Asphalt (HRA) <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> containing base bitumen of 50 pen grade to that of a polymer-fibre reinforced HRA mixture. Two types of polymer fibre were studied, namely polypropylene and polyester and these fibre were added in different concentrations in the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Changes in both the cohesive properties of the bitumen and the adhesion of the bitumen to the aggregate surface were observed as a result of exposing the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> to moisture. The effect of polymer fibre reinforcement in <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> helps reduce the level of moisture damage. This was evident in the lower moisture susceptibility achieved in the polymer fibre reinforced <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> as compared to the control mixture. The additional bitumen in the fibre reinforced mixtures also afforded an increased film thickness on the aggregate particles, thus affording additional protection of the mixtures from moisture. The reinforcement of polymer fibres in <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> also acts to decrease the moisture sensitivity of the bitumen to aggregate bonding.

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>Bituminous</b> Emulsion <b>Mixtures</b> (BEMs) means {{manufacturing}} {{of asphalt}} {{at ambient temperature}} using bitumen emulsion as the binder. It has been widely utilised in many countries such as the USA and France. The use and development of BEMs were not brought forward in the UK due to the country’s relatively wet/cold climatic conditions, which are not favourable to the application of cold BEM {{in terms of the}} long curing process and low early strength. Decreasing wastes from aggregate production processes, reducing land-filling and reducing CO 2 emissions during hot <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture</b> production and laying are the main target schemes for the environmentally friendly processes. Cold BEM is one of the attractive methods of producing <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> to tackle the mentioned disadvantages when incorporating some waste and/or by-product materials individually or collectively into these mixtures. Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) in production of BEMs in the UK and around the world. Three benefits can be stated when using SCM in BEMs; these are upgraded mechanical properties, gaining economic advantage and the ecological advantage factor. Mainly due to some inherent problems associated with the performance of the pavement produced by the BEMs process, they are regarded as “inferior” to conventional HMA. The major problems with this kind of application are the long curing time (evaporation of trapped water) required to achieve the required performance, the weak early life strength (because of the existence of water) and high air voids content. The full curing in the field of these mixtures may occur between 2 − 24 months depending on the mixture’s ingredients and weather conditions. Considering the above disadvantages, this study investigated the possible ways of developing a new BEM/s with gap graded mixtures similar to the conventional Hot Rolled Asphalt (HRA) gradation. HRA is extensively used for surfacing major roads in the UK because it provides a dense, impervious layer, resulting in a weather-resistant durable surface able to endure the demands of today’s traffic loads and providing good resistance to fatigue cracking. The mentioned new product is termed Cold Rolled Asphalt (CRA). The main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate producing high strength, fast curing and sustainable CRA mixtures for heavily trafficked road and highway surfacing layers by using different waste and by-product materials (normally used as SCM) individually and/or collectively as a replacement for conventional mineral filler. To achieve the above aim, four SCMs have been used which were: Waste Paper Sludge Ash (WPSA), which has high lime and gelenite content, Poultry Litter Fly Ash (PLFA), which has high alkali components, Silica Fume (SF), and Rice Husk Ash (RHA), which is high silica content and cost-plus material, collectively instead of conventional mineral filler. In addition, besides the production of the new high-quality CRA mixtures, the research includes a detailed comparison study of conventional HRA mixtures, CRA mixtures containing conventional mineral filler and CRA mixtures containing hydraulic filler, i. e. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). This laboratory study was conducted by utilising different types of testing and curing and conditioning methods to characterise the mechanical properties and durability of the produced CRA mixtures. Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus (ITSM), Uniaxial Compression Cyclic Test (UCCT), Four Point Bending fatigue test on prismatic shaped specimens (4 PB) and Semi-Circular Bending monotonic test (SCB) were used to assess the mechanical properties of these mixtures while Stiffness Modulus Ratio (SMR) and Long Term Oven Aging (LTOA) were used to investigate the main durability features, i. e. water sensitivity and long-term aging, respectively. Furthermore, Scan Electron Microscopy (SEM) technique and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis have been used to investigate the reasons behind the improvement in the mechanical properties of the novel mixtures.

Most of single load application tests were carried out by means of flexure; and the mode of failure, relationships between strength vs. temperature, strain at failure vs. temperature, and stiffness at failure vs. temperature were obtained; and convergence of the strain in ductile failure zone, (2 ~ 5) × 10 ^[- 2], and in the brittle failure zone, (1 ~ 2) × 10 ^[- 3], was obtained. As a result of beam flexure tests, the movement of the transition point at which the mode of failure showed a change in the mode from brittle to ductile was observed. It was found that the movement depended upon the rate of strain, binder content, and type of mixture, but failure strains at transition points converged to 4 × 10 ^[- 3] to 6 × 10 ^[- 3], independently of the type of binder, rate of strain etc. The effects of rate of strain, binder content, type of mixture and type of binder on rheological properties (strength, strain at failure etc.) of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> were investigated.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters to define <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture</b> behavior in service is the toughness that the bitumen provides when binding the aggregate particles; that is; the dissipated energy during the materials fracture process. The greater the dissipated energy in fracture, the better the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture</b> quality is. Hence, a relationship will have to exist if the toughness is removed during one load cycle (direct tension) or during many cycles along time (fatigue). The {{purpose of this study is}} to determinate relationships between the toughness of different bitumens and the fatigue behavior of their corresponding <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures,</b> for which, the toughness has been obtained by means of direct tension test and has been compared with the value of the fatigue law and dissipated energy obtained by fatigue bending test. Results showed that, this study expect to give important means for further research to predict fatigue life from a static test. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{reclaimed}} {{asphalt pavement}} (RAP) in <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> is considerably increasing {{due to the}} environmental and economic benefits of recycled materials. However, stiffer mixes, usually resulting from RAP addition, have raised concern about long-term properties of the pavement; a mechanical characterization of these mixes is thus needed. In this study, the effect of mixing condition on <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> containing RAP was evaluated. Volumetric and mechanical properties were analyzed. An experimental program, {{with the aim of}} measuring stiffness modulus, water sensitivity, and cracking resistance, was conducted. Cracking resistance was evaluated according to the Fénix test because it {{has proved to be a}} convenient and effective method for characterizing cracking behavior of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> at different temperatures. Mixtures containing 20 or 40 % of RAP material were tested; virgin aggregates and RAP mixing temperatures as well as mixing time were varied and comparisons with a reference mix were conducted to characterize fracture energy and mechanical performance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive study {{to evaluate the}} mechanical properties and environmental suitability of electric arc furnace (EAF) steel slag in <b>bituminous</b> paving <b>mixtures.</b> A variety of tests were executed on samples of EAF slag to characterize the physical, geometrical, mechanical and chemical properties as required by UNI EN specifications, focusing additionally on the volumetric expansion associated with hydration of free CaO and MgO. Five <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> of aggregates for flexible road pavement were designed containing up to 40 % of EAF slag and were tested to determine Marshall stability and indirect tensile strength. The leaching behaviour of slag samples and <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> was evaluated according to the UNI EN leaching test. The tested slag showed satisfactory physical and mechanical properties and a release of pollutants generally below the limits set by the Italian code. Tests on volume stability of fresh materials confirmed that a period of 2 - 3 months is necessary to reduce effects of oxides hydration. The results of tests performed on <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> with EAF slag were comparable {{with the performance of}} mixtures containing natural aggregates and the leaching tests provided satisfactory results...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the {{flexible}} road pavements {{have been subjected}} to the action of a more intense traffic, which has often originated their premature degradation. Among others, to guarantee a better performance of the pavement, it is essential that the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> show an appropriate behaviour in situ for the high solicitations to which they will be submitted. The <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> behaviour is evaluated through tests that allow the study of their properties. The bond between the mastic and the coarse aggregates may possibly influence the behaviour of a <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture</b> in the pavement. Thus, the main aim of this work was the study of the bond between mastic and coarse aggregates, trying not only to contribute to a better knowledge of this property, but also to a better behaviour of the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> in situ. A proceeding to study the mastic composition was developed and mechanical tests were used in order to evaluate the bond between mastic and coarse aggregates, which is determined through the tensile and shear strengths. The results of the mechanical tests were used to evaluate the influence of the mastic binder content on the strength of the bond between mastic and coarse aggregates. In the same tests, it was also observed the main type of failure of the bond between mastic and coarse aggregates...|$|R
