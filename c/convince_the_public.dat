25|$|Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., {{a charismatic}} Republican presidential hopeful, Senator Jasper Irving, has invited liberal TV {{journalist}} Janine Roth {{to his office}} to announce a new war strategy in Afghanistan: the use of small units to seize strategic positions in the mountains ("forward operating points") before the Taliban can occupy them. The senator hopes that Roth's positive coverage will help <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that the plan is sound.|$|E
25|$|Concerns were {{expressed}} over {{the lack of}} checks on the Minister's power to issue a prohibiting or restraining order. It was suggested that the Minister's decision {{should be subject to}} judicial review or an appeal process since a decision made by a single minister could be fairly subjective, and if the decision-making power lay solely within the Minister's purview this might may fail to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that any decision made was just and fair. Another suggestion raised in Parliament was to widen the purely advisory powers of the PCMR and grant it a more substantial power to act as a check and balance to the powers of the Minister.|$|E
500|$|Though Microsoft used {{forms of}} viral {{marketing}} for promotion (including the alternate reality game or ARG), {{the main focus}} of the company's efforts was traditional media outlets. [...] Because there already was interest in the title among the gaming community, Microsoft did not feel the need to run a social media campaign, instead banking on the gaming community to spread the word itself. The focus on traditional media would help expand the fan base beyond established gamers and <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that the game was a cultural milestone. To build public interest, Microsoft made public statements that Halo 3 would surpass media sales records, including the July 2007 record of $166 million set by the launch of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, the {{fertilization}} experiment {{began with}} Lake 227, and in 1973, the double-basin eutrophication experiment on Lake 226 began, {{in which a}} section of the Lake 226S was overfertilized with carbon and nitrogen and the other section 226N with carbon and nitrogen as well as phosphorus. The iconic image of the green eutrophied section 226N has been described as the most important in the history of limnology. It <b>convinced</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and policy-makers that phosphorus levels needed to be controlled.|$|R

To protect the girls' anonymity, Frances and Elsie were called Alice and Iris respectively, and the Wright family {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Carpenters". An enthusiastic and committed spiritualist, Doyle hoped that if <b>the</b> photographs <b>convinced</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> of <b>the</b> existence of fairies then they might more readily accept other psychic phenomena.

5000|$|The {{documentary}} {{claims that}} psychiatrists have <b>convinced</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that normal negative human experiences are mental illnesses. An example {{used in the}} movie is the assertion that psychiatrists seek to label typical shyness as a [...] "social anxiety disorder"; however, patients are diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder only at debilitating levels, where there is an [...] "intense fear in social situations". Unlike a shy individual, a person diagnosed with social anxiety disorder is {{likely to suffer from}} symptoms such as nausea, stammering, and panic attacks.|$|R
500|$|In the 1930s, the National Association of Manufacturers {{was one of}} {{the first}} to create a major {{campaign}} promoting capitalism and pro-business viewpoints. It lobbied against unions, The New Deal and the 8-hour work-day. NAM tried mostly unsuccessfully to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that the interests of the public were aligned with corporate interests and to create an association between commerce and democratic principles. During the Second World War, Coca-Cola promised that [...] "every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for five cents, wherever he is and whatever it costs the company." [...] The company persuaded politicians that it was crucial to the war-effort and was exempted from sugar rationing. During the European Recovery Program PR became more established in Europe as US-based companies with PR departments created European subsidiaries.|$|E
500|$|The film had broader {{cultural}} repercussions, as well. Similar {{to the way}} {{the pivotal}} scene in 1960's Psycho made showers a new source of anxiety, Jaws led many viewers to fear going into the ocean. Reduced beach attendance in 1975 was attributed to it, as well as an increased number of reported shark sightings. It is still seen as responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about sharks and their behavior, and for producing the so-called [...] "Jaws effect", which allegedly inspired [...] "legions of fishermen [...] piled into boats and killed thousands of the ocean predators in shark-fishing tournaments." [...] Benchley stated that he would not have written the original novel had he known what sharks are really like in the wild. Conservation groups have bemoaned the fact that the film has made it considerably harder to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that sharks should be protected.|$|E
500|$|In the 1990s, the CIAR's {{executive}} director met with head investigators from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), hoping {{to persuade them}} to cooperate with CIAR. These efforts were mostly unsuccessful, though the CIAR did hire one IARC investigator to conduct a study. Tobacco companies, through the CIAR, subsequently funded research aimed at undermining the validity of epidemiologic research, intending to have these studies published before the IARC released its then-ongoing study on secondhand smoke. In 1997, the CIAR co-hosted a conference in China, along with the Guangzhou Institute for Chemical Carcinogens and the Chinese Epidemiological Association. The conference, entitled [...] "International Workshop on Risk Assessment and Good Epidemiological Practices", brought together over 100 lung cancer researchers, {{some of whom had}} received tobacco industry funding. The workshop was part of the industry's [...] "Asia-specific IARC preparation" [...] effort to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and the media to view the IARC report skeptically when it was published.|$|E

500|$|Between 1886 and 1887 Purvis {{attempted}} {{to undermine the}} Gibson administration. He was alleged to be the author or co-author, along with Alatau T. Atkinson, of The Grand Duke of Gynbergdrinkenstein and the Gynberg Ballad, two anonymous political satires that parodied {{the corruption of the}} Hawaiian court and mocked Kalākaua, Gibson, and other people in their inner circle. According to Ralph Simpson Kuykendall, these were [...] "a satirical take-off on various features and incidents of the Kalakaua–Gibson regime" [...] used [...] "to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that the administration of the kingdom was not only corrupt and unworthy of trust, but also ridiculous". To the annoyance of the government, these two pamphlets were widely circulated in Honolulu and even sent to London by the British ambassador to Hawaii. These works and other factors including the Aki opium scandal and the failed attempt to form a Polynesian Confederacy contributed to the demise of the Gibson administration and the passage of the Bayonet Constitution of 1887, which severely limited the power of the king.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, the EPB discussed {{that after}} its latest message, the organization meditates about {{its decision to}} reorganize in 1990. After discussing the significance of September 23 to the philosophies of Betances, Albizu and Correrjer, the group discussed the interventions against the independence movement and claimed that the general public was [...] "being manipulated" [...] to facilitate the success of those that opposes that ideal. The organization also expressed its belief that the current system was one where [...] "the corruption of power was an integral part" [...] and blamed the CIA, FBI, secret service and naval forces for perpetuating it in what they called [...] "an strategy to appropriate" [...] Puerto Rico by [...] "controlling its economy, destroying Puerto Rican culture, [...] promoting divisions [...] and institutionalizing a colonial administrative, judicial and politic system." [...] As examples, the EPB once again mentioned the devaluation of the Puerto Rican dollar, the post-invasion Americanization process and {{the imposition of a}} military government and the political [...] "intimidation and bribing" [...] among others. The organization reaffirmed its belief that the general elections were inconsequential and held to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that their concerns were being noticed and that September 23 should only serve to rememorate the insurrection with no connection to political parties or ambitions.|$|E
500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E
50|$|He says that, Unfortunately, {{many are}} led to {{believe this is the}} primary goal of public {{administration}}...the media and others have <b>convinced</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that public administration should be able to function like business. Self-serving politicians preach this, too. They moralize that everything in government should be based on the consideration of economics and efficiency. All public administrators who enter upon public service take an ‘oath' affirming they will be faithful to the Constitution of the United States. If public administrators are to remain faithful to the Constitution then they need to defend the values, principles and ethics underpinning that document. When you get right down to it, I believe most people would agree fairness is the most important attribute for a <b>public</b> servant. However, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> are misguided by the market paradigm to believe efficiency and returns on investment be the guiding principles for a public servant.|$|R

In another scene, April refers to Ron as [...] "Duke Silver", his secret jazz saxophonist alter ego first revealed in the episode [...] "Practice Date". It also features several running gags from throughout the series, including angrily complaining Pawnee citizens, Ann helping parks employees despite not working there, and extremely gory and racist historical Pawnee murals.|$|R
2500|$|Simpson's {{original}} {{definition of}} the metrosexual was sexually ambiguous, or at least went beyond the straight/gay dichotomy. Marketers, in contrast, insisted that the metrosexual was always [...] "straight" [...] – they even tried to pretend {{that he was not}} vain. However, they failed to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> hence, says Simpson, their attempt to create the uber-straight ubersexual.|$|E
2500|$|CICIG {{reported}} its cases {{so often}} on Thursdays that Guatemalans {{coined the term}} [...] "CICIG Thursdays". But a Friday press conference brought the crisis to its peak: on Friday 21 August 2015, the CICIG and Attorney General Thelma Aldana presented enough evidence to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that both president Pérez Molina and former vice president Baldetti were the actual leaders of [...] "La Línea". Baldetti was arrested the same day and an impeachment was requested for the president. Several cabinet members resigned and the clamor for the president's resignation grew after Perez Molina defiantly assured the nation in a televised message broadcast on 23 August 2015 {{that he was not}} going to resign.|$|E

Since the Labor government came to power, Labor said, employment and property value had risen and the state debt had been greatly reduced. Labor attributed this economic success to their stable and strong leadership. Others including federal Treasurer Peter Costello claimed {{that it was the}} GST revenue and the Liberal federal government's economic policies that have caused Tasmania's economy to grow. [...] Labor also claimed that under their government the number of tourists visiting the state had risen. They attributed this to a marketing campaign and the purchase of the three Spirit of Tasmania ferries. Others claimed that the increase in tourists had been caused by cheaper air-fares from operators such as Jetstar and Virgin Blue.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origins of}} the HDI {{are found in the}} annual Human Development Reports {{produced}} by the Human Development Reports Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq in 1990, and had the explicit purpose [...] "to shift the focus of development [...] economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies." [...] To produce the Human Development Reports, Mahbub ul Haq formed a group of development economists including Paul Streeten, Frances Stewart, Gustav Ranis, Keith Griffin, Sudhir Anand, and Meghnad Desai. Nobel laureate Amartya Sen utilized Haq's work in his own work on human capabilities. Haq believed that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with the}} warrant {{to search the}} {{premises}} was a warrant for the arrest of Jackson. Michael was in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the time recording a music video for his most recent hit single [...] "One More Chance" [...] from his greatest-hits album 'Number Ones,' which had been released at midnight, just hours before the warrants were issued and the allegations broke in the media. On November 20, Jackson flew in a leased jet to Santa Barbara Municipal Airport and surrendered himself to California police. Driven by police to the Santa Barbara County Jail, he emerged from the police vehicle in handcuffs. Many lawyers and Jackson supporters saw it as an attempt by both police and media to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> of Jackson's guilt, while some attached a racial element to the police's actions. He was charged with [...] "lewd or lascivious acts" [...] with a child younger than 14 under section 288(a) of the California Penal Code.|$|E

He is a critic of Darwinism, which he has described as [...] "fully naturalistic evolution, involving chance mechanisms and natural selection". [...] The wedge strategy aims to change public opinion and scientific consensus, and seeks to convince the scientific community to allow a role for theism, or causes beyond naturalistic explanation, in scientific discourse. [...] Johnson has argued that scientists accepted the theory of evolution [...] "before it was rigorously tested, and thereafter used all their authority to <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that naturalistic processes are sufficient to produce a human from a bacterium, and a bacterium from a mix of chemicals." ...|$|E

40|$|When presidents {{attempt to}} {{influence}} a nation, their most direct mode of persuasion is rhetoric. Often, the positions {{they choose to}} champion are those of which <b>the</b> <b>public</b> has, {{and will continue to}} possess, limited knowledge.

This paper seeks to holistically analyze President George W. Bush’s Social Security Reform campaign rhetorical strategy, and finds that he chose manipulation over education to pursue policy success. 	Most people interested in politics have heard and read about the debate during President Bush’s 2005 Social Security reform campaign over what to call his accounts, “private” or “personal”.
