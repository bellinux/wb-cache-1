Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work together for the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> non-Christians within their territories. He urged the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> the heretical Arians in Italy and elsewhere, as well as the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> Jews.
