5|$|The dhcp (double {{hexagonal}} <b>close-packed)</b> form of β-cerium is {{the equilibrium}} structure approximately from room temperature to −150°C.|$|E
5|$|At room {{temperature}} zirconium exhibits a hexagonally <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure, α-Zr, which changes to β-Zr, a body-centered cubic crystal structure, at 863°C. Zirconium {{exists in the}} β-phase until the melting point.|$|E
5|$|Krypton is {{characterized}} by several sharp emission lines (spectral signatures) the strongest being green and yellow. Krypton {{is one of the}} products of uranium fission. Solid krypton is white and has a face-centered cubic crystal structure, which is a common property of all noble gases (except helium, which has a hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure).|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used crystal lattice structures in metals are the body-centred cubic, face-centred cubic and <b>close-packed</b> hexagonal. Ferritic steel has a body-centred cubic structure and austenitic steel, non-ferrous metals like aluminum, copper and nickel have the face-centred cubic structure.|$|E
5|$|Lead's <b>close-packed</b> face-centered cubic {{structure}} and high atomic weight {{result in a}} density of 11.34g/cm3, which is {{greater than that of}} common metals such as iron (7.87g/cm3), copper (8.93g/cm3), and zinc (7.14g/cm3). This density is the origin of the idiom to go over like a lead balloon. Some rarer metals are denser: tungsten and gold are both 19.3g/cm3, and osmium—the densest metal known—has a density of 22.59g/cm3, almost twice that of lead.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium forms mixed binary oxides {{with various}} metals. With alkali metals A, the {{crystals}} have a chemical formula APaO3 and perovskite structure, or A3PaO4 and distorted rock-salt structure, or A7PaO6 where oxygen atoms form a hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> lattice. In all these materials, protactinium ions are octahedrally coordinated. The pentoxide Pa2O5 combines with rare-earth metal oxides R2O3 to form various nonstoichiometric mixed-oxides, also of perovskite structure.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium is a silvery-white metal {{with one}} of the highest melting points of all elements, {{exceeded}} by only tungsten and carbon. It also {{has one of the highest}} boiling points of all elements. It is also one of the densest, exceeded only by platinum, iridium and osmium. Rhenium has a hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=276.1pm and c=445.6pm.|$|E
5|$|Samarium is a {{rare earth}} metal having a {{hardness}} and density {{similar to those of}} zinc. With the boiling point of 1794°C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, samarium normally assumes a rhombohedral structure (α form). Upon heating to 731°C, its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally <b>close-packed</b> (hcp), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922°C transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase. Heating to 300°C combined with compression to 40kbar results in a double-hexagonally <b>close-packed</b> structure (dhcp). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900kbar. In one study, the dhcp phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700°C, confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions.|$|E
5|$|Silver readily forms alloys with {{copper and}} gold, {{as well as}} zinc. Zinc-silver alloys with low zinc {{concentration}} may be considered as face-centred cubic solid solutions of zinc in silver, as {{the structure of the}} silver is largely unchanged while the electron concentration rises as more zinc is added. Increasing the electron concentration further leads to body-centred cubic (electron concentration 1.5), complex cubic (1.615), and hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> phases (1.75).|$|E
5|$|The element has two {{crystalline}} forms under 1 {{standard atmosphere}} of pressure: a double-hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> form dubbed alpha (α) and a face-centered cubic form designated beta (β). The α form exists below 600–800°C with a density of 15.10 g/cm3 and the β form exists above 600–800°C with a density of 8.74 g/cm3. At 48GPa of pressure the β form changes into an orthorhombic crystal system due to delocalization of the atom's 5f electrons, which frees them to bond.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{category}} of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned {{in the gaps}} in a metallic cubic or hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500°C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Using an even simpler {{approximation}} of the ions as impenetrable hard spheres, {{the arrangement of}} anions in these systems are often related to <b>close-packed</b> arrangements of spheres, with the cations occupying tetrahedral or octahedral interstices. Depending on the stoichiometry of the ionic compound, and the coordination (principally determined by the radius ratio) of cations and anions, a variety of structures are commonly observed, and theoretically rationalized by Pauling's rules.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener rhenium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37.1g/cm3, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and hassium (41g/cm3), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak and flows {{in the form of}} glaciers and on Triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a <b>close-packed</b> hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E
5|$|Calcium metal melts at 842°C and boils at 1494°C, {{higher than}} its {{adjacent}} group 2 metals do. It crystallises in the face-centered cubic arrangement like strontium; above 450°C, it changes to an anisotropic hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> arrangement like magnesium. The density of 1.55g·cm−3 {{is the lowest}} in its group, with others decreasing towards it. Calcium can be cut with a knife with effort, although it is still harder than lead. While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume, it is a better conductor than both of them by mass due to its very low density. Although it is infeasible for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen, its use as a conductor in space has been considered.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Hence copernicium may not be a noble metal, but rather a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2eV. Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid noble gases, though its cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) should be on the order of that of mercury rather than be near the lower value of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|Like most lanthanides, {{praseodymium}} {{usually only}} uses three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons. Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560°C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935°C.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure (c/a=1.61), similar to its lighter congener hafnium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.2g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61g/cm3. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius for rutherfordium {{is expected}} to be around 150pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Rf+ and Rf2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic bonding tends to involve <b>close-packed</b> centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{members of}} group 8 have relatively high melting points (Fe, 1538°C; Ru, 2334°C; Os, 3033°C). Much like them, hassium {{is predicted to}} be a solid at room temperature, although the melting point of hassium has not been precisely calculated. Hassium should crystallize in the hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> structure (c/a=1.59), similarly to its lighter congener osmium. Pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a bulk modulus (resistance to uniform compression) {{comparable to that of}} diamond (442GPa). Hassium is expected to have a bulk density of 40.7g/cm3, the highest of any of the 118 known elements and nearly twice the density of osmium, the most dense measured element, at 22.61g/cm3. This results from hassium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough hassium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. Osmium is the densest element of the first 6 periods, and its heavier congener hassium {{is expected to be the}} densest element of the first 7 periods.|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the {{actinide}} series and is sometimes {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and lutetium, as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th-period transition metals. In the periodic table, it is located {{to the right of the}} actinide nobelium, to the left of the 6d transition metal rutherfordium, and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons delocalized, a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization, bulk modulus, and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171pm. It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6g·cm−3. It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900K (1627°C), not far from the value for lutetium (1925K).|$|E
25|$|When {{the second}} sphere {{is much smaller}} than the first, it is {{possible}} to arrange the large spheres in a <b>close-packed</b> arrangement, and then arrange the small spheres within the octahedral and tetrahedral gaps. The density of this interstitial packing depends sensitively on the radius ratio, but in the limit of extreme size ratios, the smaller spheres can fill the gaps with the same density as the larger spheres filled space. Even if the large spheres are not in a <b>close-packed</b> arrangement, it is always possible to insert some smaller spheres of up to 0.29099 of the radius of the larger sphere.|$|E
25|$|In Lyramoprha parens, nymphs {{are also}} {{known to be}} highly gregarious, forming massed feeding groups and moving to new feeding sites in <b>close-packed</b> groups. This behavior, along with their bright colorations and stink glands is {{believed}} to help in discouraging potential predators.|$|E
25|$|The {{unit cell}} of a ccp {{arrangement}} of atoms is the face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cell. This is not immediately obvious as the closely packed layers are {{parallel to the}} {111} planes of the fcc unit cell. There are four different orientations of the <b>close-packed</b> layers.|$|E
25|$|The metametals are zinc, cadmium, mercury, indium, thallium, tin and lead. They are ductile {{elements}} but, {{compared to}} their metallic periodic table neighbours to the left, have lower melting points, relatively low electrical and thermal conductivities, and show distortions from <b>close-packed</b> forms. Sometimes beryllium and gallium are included as metametals despite having low ductility.|$|E
25|$|The {{melting point}} of the {{refractory}} metals are the highest for all elements except carbon, osmium and iridium. This high melting point defines most of their applications. All the metals are body-centered cubic except rhenium which is hexagonal <b>close-packed.</b> Most physical properties of the elements in this group vary significantly because they are members of different groups.|$|E
25|$|At {{the atomic}} or {{molecular}} level, {{it depends on}} the frequencies of atomic or molecular vibrations or chemical bonds, how <b>close-packed</b> its atoms or molecules are, and whether or not the atoms or molecules exhibit long-range order. These factors will determine the capacity of the material transmitting longer wavelengths in the infrared (IR), far IR, radio and microwave ranges.|$|E
25|$|The B-subgroup metals show {{nonmetallic}} properties; this {{is particularly}} apparent in moving from group 12 to group 16. Although the group 11 metals have normal <b>close-packed</b> metallic structures they show an overlap in chemical properties. In their +1 compounds (the stable state for silver; less so for copper) they are typical B-subgroup metals. In their +2 and +3 states their chemistry is typical of transition metal compounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form of {{crystalline}} aluminium oxide is known as corundum, which is the thermodynamically stable form. The oxygen ions nearly form a hexagonal <b>close-packed</b> structure with the aluminium ions filling two-thirds of the octahedral interstices. Each Al3+ center is octahedral. In terms of its crystallography, corundum adopts a trigonal Bravais lattice with a space group of R-3c (number 167 in the International Tables). The primitive cell contains two formula units of aluminium oxide.|$|E
25|$|When {{the smaller}} sphere has a radius greater than 0.41421 of the {{radius of the}} larger sphere, {{it is no longer}} {{possible}} to fit into even the octahedral holes of the <b>close-packed</b> structure. Thus, beyond this point, either the host structure must expand to accommodate the interstitials (which compromises the overall density), or rearrange into a more complex crystalline compound structure. Structures are known which exceed the close packing density for radius ratios up to 0.659786.|$|E
25|$|Many {{problems}} in the chemical and physical sciences {{can be related to}} packing problems where more than one size of sphere is available. Here there is a choice between separating the spheres into regions of <b>close-packed</b> equal spheres, or combining the multiple sizes of spheres into a compound or interstitial packing. When many sizes of spheres (or a distribution) are available, the problem quickly becomes intractable, but some studies of binary hard spheres (two sizes) are available.|$|E
25|$|Gold is a {{soft metal}} (MH 2.5–3) that is easily deformed. It has a <b>close-packed</b> face-centred cubic {{structure}} (BCN 12). The chemistry of gold {{is dominated by}} its +3 valence state; all such compounds of gold feature covalent bonding, as do its stable +1 compounds. Gold oxide (Au2O3) is amphoteric, with acidic properties predominating; it forms anionic hydroxoaurates M where M = Na, K, Ba, Tl; and aurates such as NaAuO2. Gold is a constituent of Zintl phases such as M2AuBi (M = Li or Na); Li2AuM (M = In, Tl, Ge, Pb, Sn) and Ca5Au4.|$|E
25|$|Copper is a {{soft metal}} (MH 2.5–3.0) with low {{mechanical}} strength. It has a <b>close-packed</b> face-centred cubic structure (BCN 12). Copper behaves like {{a transition metal}} in its preferred oxidation state of +2. Stable compounds in which copper is in its less preferred oxidation state of +1 (Cu2O, CuCl, CuBr, CuI and CuCN, for example) have significant covalent character. The oxide (CuO) is amphoteric, with predominating basic properties; it can be fused with alkali oxides (M2O; M = Na, K) to give anionic oxycuprates (M2CuO2). Copper forms Zintl phases such as Li7CuSi2 and M3Cu3Sb4 (M = Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, or Er).|$|E
25|$|There are however {{problems}} with the shell model when an attempt is made to account for nuclear properties well away from closed shells. This has led to complex post hoc distortions of {{the shape of the}} potential well to fit experimental data, but the question remains whether these mathematical manipulations actually correspond to the spatial deformations in real nuclei. Problems with the shell model have led some to propose realistic two-body and three-body nuclear force effects involving nucleon clusters and then build the nucleus on this basis. Two such cluster models are the <b>Close-Packed</b> Spheron Model of Linus Pauling and the 2D Ising Model of MacGregor.|$|E
25|$|Silicate and {{aluminosilicate}} minerals {{have many}} different structures and varying stoichiometry, {{but they may}} be classified following some general principles. Tetrahedral {SiO4} units are common to almost all these compounds, either as discrete structures, or combined into larger units by the sharing of corner oxygen atoms. These may be divided into neso-silicates (discrete {SiO4} units) sharing no oxygen atoms, soro-silicates (discrete {Si2O7} units) sharing one, cyclo-silicates (closed ring structures) and ino-silicates (continuous chain or ribbon structures) both sharing two, phyllo-silicates (continuous sheets) sharing three, and tecto-silicates (continuous three-dimensional frameworks) sharing four. The lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually <b>close-packed</b> or close to it, with the charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size.|$|E
