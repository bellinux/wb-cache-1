50|$|E&M was {{originally}} developed to allow PABXs in different geographic locations to communicate over an analog private circuit. Some digital interfaces such as <b>Channel</b> <b>Associated</b> <b>Signaling</b> also use versions of E&M signaling. E&M {{is considered an}} obsolete technology for new installations, which generally use Basic Rate (BRI) or Primary Rate (PRI) digital interfaces.|$|E
50|$|For CCS signaling, {{messages}} of several bytes are transmitted through the 64 kbit/s channel {{provided by the}} TS16 of the frame, with these messages providing the signaling for all the channels in the frame. Each message contains information that determines the channel that is signaling. The signaling circuits access the 64 kbit/s channel of the TS16, and they are also common to all the channels signaled. There are different CCS systems that constitute complex protocols. In the following section and by way of example, <b>channel</b> <b>associated</b> <b>signaling</b> will be looked.|$|E
50|$|However, in the T-carrier systems {{used in the}} U.S. and Canada, a {{technique}} called bit-robbing uses, in every sixth frame, the least significant bit in the time slot associated with the voice channel for <b>Channel</b> <b>Associated</b> <b>Signaling</b> (CAS). This effectively renders the lowest bit of the 8 speech bits unusable for data transmission, and so a 56 kbit/s line used only 7 of the 8 data bits in each sample period to send data, thus giving a data rate of 8000 Hz × 7 bits = 56 kbit/s.|$|E

For example, for E1 trunks the CAS signaling bits are updated once per multiframe of 16 frames (every 2 milliseconds) while for T1 ESF trunks the superframe is 24 frames (3 milliseconds).

40|$|AbstractChapsyn- 110, a novel membrane-associated {{putative}} guanylate kinase (MAGUK) {{that binds}} directly to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and Shaker K+ channel subunits, is 70 %– 80 % identical to, and shares an identical domain organization with, PSD- 95 /SAP 90 and SAP 97. In rat brain, chapsyn- 110 protein shows a somatodendritic expression pattern that overlaps partly with PSD- 95 but that {{contrasts with the}} axonal distribution of SAP 97. Chapsyn- 110 associates tightly with the postsynaptic density in brain, and mediates the clustering of both NMDA receptors and K+ channels in heterologous cells. Indeed, chapsyn- 110 and PSD- 95 can heteromultimerize {{with each other and}} are recruited into the same NMDA receptor and K+ channel clusters. Thus, chapsyn- 110 and PSD- 95 may interact at postsynaptic sites to form a multimeric scaffold for the clustering of receptors, ion <b>channels,</b> and <b>associated</b> <b>signalling</b> proteins...|$|R
50|$|PSD-95 is {{a member}} of the membrane-associated {{guanylate}} kinase (MAGUK) family. With PSD-93 it is recruited into the same NMDA receptor and potassium channel clusters. These two MAGUK proteins may interact at postsynaptic sites to form a multimeric scaffold for the clustering of receptors, ion <b>channels,</b> and <b>associated</b> <b>signaling</b> proteins. PSD-95 is the best studied member of the MAGUK-family of PDZ domain-containing proteins. Like all MAGUK-family proteins, its basic structure includes three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase-like domain (GK) connected by disordered linker regions. It is almost exclusively located in the post synaptic density of neurons, and is involved in anchoring synaptic proteins. Its direct and indirect binding partners include neuroligin, NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, and potassium channels. It plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and the stabilization of synaptic changes during long-term potentiation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIon <b>channels</b> and <b>associated</b> <b>signal</b> {{transduction}} cascades {{are clustered}} at excitatory synapses by PSD- 95 and related PDZ-containing proteins. Mechanisms that target PSD- 95 to synaptic membranes, however, are unknown. Here, PSD- 95 {{is shown to}} partition as an integral membrane protein in brain homogenates. Metabolic labeling of brain slices or cultured cells demonstrates that PSD- 95 is modified by thioester-linked palmitate, a long chain fatty acid that targets proteins to cell membranes. In fact, PSD- 95 is a major palmitoylated protein in intact cells, and palmitoylated PSD- 95 partitions exclusively with cell membranes. Mutagenesis indicates that palmitoylation of PSD- 95 occurs on conserved N-terminal cysteines 3 and 5. Palmitoylation-deficient mutants of PSD- 95 do not partition as integral membrane proteins and {{do not participate in}} PDZ–ion channel interactions in vivo. This work identifies palmitoylation as a critical regulatory mechanism for receptor interactions with PSD- 95...|$|R
5|$|Purified MAM from {{subcellular}} fractionation {{has been}} shown to be enriched in enzymes involved in phospholipid exchange, in addition to <b>channels</b> <b>associated</b> with Ca2+ <b>signaling.</b> These hints of a prominent role for the MAM in the regulation of cellular lipid stores and signal transduction have been borne out, with significant implications for mitochondrial-associated cellular phenomena, as discussed below. Not only has the MAM provided insight into the mechanistic basis underlying such physiological processes as intrinsic apoptosis and the propagation of calcium signaling, but it also favors a more refined view of the mitochondria. Though often seen as static, isolated 'powerhouses' hijacked for cellular metabolism through an ancient endosymbiotic event, the evolution of the MAM underscores the extent to which mitochondria have been integrated into overall cellular physiology, with intimate physical and functional coupling to the endomembrane system.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Redox {{reactions}} {{have been}} established as major biological players in many cellular signaling pathways. Here we review mechanisms of redox signaling {{with an emphasis on}} redox-active signaling endosomes. Signals are transduced by relatively few reactive oxygen species (ROS), through very specific redox modifications of numerous proteins and enzymes. Although ROS <b>signals</b> are typically <b>associated</b> with cellular injury, these signaling pathways are also critical for maintaining cellular health at homeostasis. An important component of ROS signaling pertains to localization and tightly regulated signal transduction events within discrete microenvironments of the cell. One major aspect of this specificity is ROS compartmentalization within membrane-enclosed organelles such as redoxosomes (redox-active endosomes) and the nuclear envelope. Among the cellular proteins that produce superoxide are the NADPH oxidases (NOXes), transmembrane proteins that are implicated in many types of redox signaling. NOXes produce superoxide on only one side of a lipid bilayer; as such, their orientation dictates the compartmentalization of ROS and the local control of signaling events limited by ROS diffusion and/or movement through <b>channels</b> <b>associated</b> with the <b>signaling</b> membrane. NOX-dependent ROS signaling pathways can also be self-regulating, with molecular redox sensors that limit the local production of ROS required for effective signaling. ROS regulation of the Rac-GTPase, a required co-activator of many NOXes, is an example of this type of sensor. A deeper understanding of redox signaling pathways and the mechanisms that control their specificity will provide unique therapeutic opportunities for aging, cancer, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R

40|$|Drosophila is {{a premier}} genetic {{model for the}} study of both {{embryonic}} development and functional neuroscience. Traditionally, these fields are quite isolated from each other, with largely independent histories and scientific communities. However, the interface between these usually disparate fields is the developmental programs underlying acquisition of functional electrical signaling properties and differentiation of functional chemical synapses during the final phases of neural circuit formation. This interface is a critically important area for investigation. In Drosophila, these phases of functional development occur during a period of < 8 hours (at 25 °C) during the last third of embryogenesis. This late developmental period was long considered intractable to investigation owing to the deposition of a tough, impermeable epidermal cuticle. A breakthrough advance was the application of water-polymerizing surgical glue that can be locally applied to the cuticle to enable controlled dissection of late-stage embryos. With a dorsal longitudinal incision, the embryo can be laid flat, exposing the ventral nerve cord and body wall musculature to experimental investigation. Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques can then be employed to record from individually-identifiable neurons and somatic muscles. These recording configurations have been used to track the appearance and maturation of ionic currents and action potential propagation in both neurons and muscles. Genetic mutants affecting these electrical properties have been characterized to reveal the molecular composition of ion <b>channels</b> and <b>associated</b> <b>signaling</b> complexes, and to begin exploration of the molecular mechanisms of functional differentiation. A particular focus has been the assembly of synaptic connections, both in the central nervous system and periphery. The glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is most accessible to a combination of optical imaging and electrophysiological recording. A glass suction electrode is used to stimulate the peripheral nerve, with excitatory junction current (EJC) recordings made in the voltage-clamped muscle. This recording configuration has been used to chart the functional differentiation of the synapse, and track the appearance and maturation of presynaptic glutamate release properties. In addition, postsynaptic properties can be assayed independently via iontophoretic or pressure application of glutamate directly to the muscle surface, to measure the appearance and maturation of the glutamate receptor fields. Thus, both pre- and postsynaptic elements can be monitored separately or in combination during embryonic synaptogenesis. This system has been heavily used to isolate and characterize genetic mutants that impair embryonic synapse formation, and thus reveal the molecular mechanisms governing the specification and differentiation of synapse connections and functional synaptic signaling properties...|$|R
