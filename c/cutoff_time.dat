500|$|Wiggins and Froome {{were able}} to make their way back up to Nibali, {{sandwiching}} him with Froome on the front and Wiggins {{at the back of the}} trio. Voeckler cemented his mountains classification lead by reaching the summit of the Col de Peyresourde first, with the remaining riders of the breakaway spread out between him and the group of Wiggins, Froome and Nibali. Sørensen trailed Voeckler by a minute-and-a-half. Nibali attacked twice more on the steepest part of the climb, but Wiggins shadowed the move and kept himself up with Nibali. At the front, Voeckler descended towards the finish in Bagnères-de-Luchon with a 1' 40" [...] lead over Sørensen, and held the lead to the end for his second stage win of the race, and repeated his 2010 stage victory in the town. Sørensen remained 1' 40" [...] behind in second, while [...] rider Gorka Izagirre bested Alexander Vinokourov (...) for third place.

The average time to finish this race is 41:10:15, which is longer than the <b>cutoff</b> <b>times</b> of most 100 mi races. This is due largely to the high elevations, which can cause altitude sickness or edema in some runners. In addition, the course covers extremely rugged terrain including steep scree climbs and descents, snow packs, river crossings, and boulder fields. The race starts at 6am, so runners who finish in over 40 hours see the sun set twice before finishing. Runners continue at night using flashlights or headlamps.

30|$|The test {{procedure}} is as follows. First, we obtain a 1 -bit value {{from the beginning}} of the random numbers as a reference value. Second, we obtain one block from the succeeding random numbers. The bit length of a block is represented by the window size, and if the reference value appears greater than the <b>cutoff</b> <b>times</b> in a block, the random numbers are a failure. The size of the cutoff is defined by the false positive rate, min-entropy, and window size. This procedure is repeated until the end of the random numbers. In our evaluations, the window size and cutoff were 64 and 55 for test settings I and 4096 and 2240 for test settings II. That is, about 84, 700 blocks were evaluated for test settings I, and about 1350 blocks were evaluated for test settings II, in each case of random numbers.|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} version of the multiple-interaction code SPUT 2 has been used to simulate impacts of 63 -atom Cu clusters on six–layer Cu targets. Simulations were carried out with <b>cutoff</b> <b>times</b> of 100 and 500 fs for an incident cluster energy of 63 keV (1 keV/atom). Significant enhancements were observed in the maximum potential and kinetic energies achieved in the early phase of the collision cascade. Some hard collisions yielded atoms with potential energies as high as 925 eV (in the CM frame). This is almost twice the energy allowed in an isolated two-body collision. The number of hard collisions per time-step vs potential energy is well-fitted with a decaying exponential, allowing extrapolation to higher energies. These results together with similar results for Al clusters impacting Au targets suggest that non-linear collisional effects cannot explain the high D–D fusion rates seen in Beuhler, Friedlander, and Friedman's recent experiment...|$|R

40|$|Prompted {{by recent}} results {{reported}} by Carla Gomes, Bart Selman, and Henry Kautz, {{and in the}} context of my ongoing project with Thomas Stützle on characterising the behaviour of state-of-the-art algorithms for SAT, I measured some run-time distributions for Satz-Rand, the randomised version of the Satz algorithm, when applied to problem instances from various domains. I could not nd truly heavy-tailed behaviour (in the sense of the definition used by Carla Gomes et. al.). Instead, I found evidence for multimodal distributions which might be characterisable using mixtures of the generalised exponential distributions introduced in [6]. However, the observed RTDs typically have long tails and random restart, using suitable <b>cutoff</b> <b>times,</b> increases the efficiency of the algorithm, as claimed by Gomes et. al. Furthermore, taking another look at the issue of heavy tails at the left-hand side of run-time distributions, I raise some questions regarding the arguments found in [5]...|$|R
40|$|Interpretation of {{the results}} of {{atmospheric}} baekscattering experiments, when using a Q-switched ruby laser as the source of photons, requires consideration of several sources of noise in the statistical analysis. This paper discusses the effects of directly backscattered ruby fluorescence in detail. It is found that, for an unshuttered system, fluorescense noise will be equal to the signal expected from altitudes above about 50 - 60 km (assuming only a molecular atmosphere). The "crossover" altitude is lowered if aerosols are present. When a shutter is used as a fluorescence block, it is found that a spurious "layer" structure may be produced [...] but only for shutter <b>cutoff</b> <b>times</b> of greater than about 375 [mu]sec. It is concluded that, for a properly designed optical radar system, ruby fluorescence will not be a significant source of spurious returns.

40|$|Attrition clauses {{in hotel}} group sales {{agreements}} are potentially contentious issues for hotel operators and meeting planners. However, {{an analysis of}} the classic case of Hyatt Corporation v. Women’s International Bowling Congress, Inc. shows the pitfalls of a poorly drawn agreement. Based on that analysis, the most effective attrition clauses would, among other things, balance the competing needs of the hotel and its clients. Such an agreement would specify the <b>cutoff</b> <b>times</b> for cancellation of the room block and permit slippage of the block. It would also provide for liqui-dated damages for the loss of business to the hotel for rooms not picked up. While the agreement would allow the hotel to sell rooms not picked up, it would at the same time reduce the attrition charges by whatever profit the hotel realizes from those sales. Likewise, if the hotel shortcuts the block, damages would be reduced. Finally, the contract should address compensation to the group if the hotel must walk group members due to overbooking...|$|R

40|$|Automated {{impedance}} measurements {{can be used}} {{to rapidly}} assess whether a sample of frozen vegetables contains greater or less than 10 (5) organisms per g. Microorganisms growing pureed food samples cause a change in the impedance of the medium when the organisms reach a threshold concentration of between 10 (6) and 10 (7) organisms per ml. Estimates of the concentration of microorganisms initially present in the food sample can be made by recording the time required for the organisms in the sample to replicate to threshold levels. In this study, the detection times for 357 samples of frozen vegetables were compared with standard plate counts for each sample. The agreement between the two methods in distinguishing samples containing more than 10 (5) organisms per g was 92. 6 % for 257 assorted frozen vegetables and somewhat higher (93 to 96 %) when separate <b>cutoff</b> <b>times</b> were used for each type of vegetable.

40|$|Using {{analysis}} {{results from the}} post trajectory optimization program, an adaptive guidance algorithm is developed to compensate for density, aerodynamic and thrust perturbations during an atmospheric orbital plane change maneuver. The maneuver offers increased mission flexibility along with potential fuel savings for future reentry vehicles.

The plane change analysis provides insight suggesting a straight-forward algorithm based on an optimized nominal command profile. Bank angle, angle of attack, and engine thrust level, ignition and <b>cutoff</b> <b>times</b> are modulated to adjust the vehicle's trajectory to achieve the desired end-conditions. A performance evaluation of the scheme demonstrates a capability to guide to within 0. 05 degrees of the desired plane change and five nautical miles of the desired apogee altitude while maintaining heating constraints. The algorithm is tested under off-nominal conditions of + or - 30 % density biases, two density profile models, + or - 15 % aerodynamic uncertainty, and a 33 % thrust loss and for various combinations of these conditions...|$|R

For the random-to-random transposition shuffle we show <b>cutoff</b> at <b>time</b> (1 / 2) n k for the same conditions on k. Finally, we analyse the cyclic-to-random transposition shuffle and show partial mixing occurs at time <α n k for some α just larger than 1 / 2.

40|$|Time-definite express common {{carriers}} provide time guaranteed door-to-door {{express service}} for small parcel shipments. Centers {{pick up and}} deliver parcels, while hubs consolidate partial loads. Each center is connected through a secondary route to its primary hub, while hubs are mutually connected by primary routes in a hierarchical hub-and-spoke network. The carriers may dispatch large trucks/aircraft on the primary routes but utilize smaller trucks/aircraft on the secondary routes. The time-constrained hierarchical hub-and-spoke network design problem involves determining the fleet size and schedules on the primary and secondary routes to minimize the total operating cost, while satisfying the desired level of service. We developed a route-space directed network and modeled the problem as a 0 - 1 binary program. An implicit enumeration method with an embedded least time path subproblem was developed. The sensitivity analysis on the service level in a partial line-haul operations network for the second largest carrier in Taiwan showed that the costs are not strictly monotonically increasing with the service levels, rather they are monotonically non-decreasing according to a step function.

40|$|Let (X_t) _t = 0 ^∞ be an {{irreducible}} reversible discrete time Markov chain on {{a finite}} state space Ω. Denote its transition matrix by P. To avoid periodicity issues (and thus ensuring convergence to equilibrium) one often considers the continuous-time {{version of the}} chain (X_t^c) _t > 0 whose kernel is given by H_t:=e^-t∑_k (tP) ^k/k!. Another possibility is to consider the associated averaged chain (X_t^ave) _t = 0 ^∞, whose distribution at time t is obtained by replacing P by A_t:=(P^t+P^t+ 1) / 2. A sequence of Markov chains is said to exhibit (total-variation) cutoff if the convergence to stationarity in total-variation distance is abrupt.
