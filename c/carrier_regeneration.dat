[...] The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.). [...] However its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using envelope detection, providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands. [...] In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the intermediate frequency) from a greatly reduced [...] "pilot" [...] carrier (in reduced-carrier transmission or DSB-RC) to use in the demodulation process.

Single sideband is nevertheless used widely in amateur radio and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in medium wave and short wave broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers.

40|$|Chemical looping {{combustion}} (CLC) {{of methane}} {{has been proposed}} {{in the past decade}} as an efficient method for CO 2 capture without important cost penalties. The combustion is carried out in a two-step process using, in the first one, the lattice oxygen of a reducible inorganic oxide for methane combustion and, in the second one, air for further <b>carrier</b> <b>regeneration.</b> An additional advantage of the CLC is the improbable generation of thermal NOx because the operating temperature used for <b>carrier</b> <b>regeneration</b> is relatively low. Copper-based oxygen carriers with different copper contents have been prepared by successive wet impregnations on porous titania, used as support, with an aqueous solution of copper nitrate. The prepared oxygen carriers have been subsequently studied in five-cycle reduction-regeneration tests in a fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure with the aim of carrier characterization, analysis of the components in the outlet gas, and the study of the effect of some of the main parameters influencing the problem, including copper content and operating temperature. A further 20 -cycle performance test has also been carried out with the oxygen carrier with the highest copper loading. The study reveals that copper does not interact with titania as support, which remains unaltered as rutile along all the two steps involved in the process. However, it is redistributed on the support because the melting points of some of the involved copper phases are close to the operating temperature. Neither carbonaceous deposits on the carrier in the reduction step nor subsidiary chemical reactions, especially those involving CO formation, takes place. The copper-based oxygen carriers exhibited a good performance in 20 -cycle tests in a fixed bed reactor showing high reactivity and no substantial decay in efficiency with the number of cycle. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

For this reason, considering the effects of non-uniform structures in {{fluidized bed}} reactors, the regeneration process of oxygen carriers in fluidized bed is investigated by means of simulation. Gas-solid flow behavior and temperature field in fluidized bed are obtained. The impact of air to fuel ratio on the oxygen conversion rate is evaluated. The results indicate that a high air to fuel ratio will reduce oxygen conversion efficiency.

40|$|Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} technologies to achieve the CO 2 capture at a low economic and energetic penalty. In CLC the combustion is split in two steps: fuel combustion assisted by an oxygen carrier in the fuel reactor, and oxygen <b>carrier</b> <b>regeneration</b> in the air reactor by oxygen in air. Usually, the air and fuel reactors are interconnected fluidized beds, with the oxygen carrier circulating between them. Thus, the CO 2 capture is inherent to the CLC process. The use of solid fuels in CLC is attracting great attention due to coal is the most abundant fuel, and burning biomass with CO 2 capture would allow to reduce the atmospheric CO 2 concentration. The in situ Gasification CLC (iG-CLC) allows the conversion of the solid fuel by performing both gasification and combustion of gasification products in the fuel reactor. In iG-CLC complete combustion is not reached, and an oxygen polishing step is required downstream by using a small fraction of pure oxygen.

Data communications over a satellite can be easily achieved by the use of excessive power and bandwidth but efficient management of the satellite resource requires more elegant means of transmission. The optimum modulator and demodulator can be described by mathematical expressions to represent the physical processes that are required to transmit and receive a signal. Digital Signal Processing circuits can be use to implement these mathematical functions and once correctly designed are not susceptible to variations in accuracy and hence can maintain an accurate representation of the mathematical model. This thesis documents an investigation into the algorithms and techniques {{that can be used in}} the digital implementation of a Satellite Data Modem.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The cold vapor atomic {{absorption}} spectrometry (CVAAS) technique has been commercially used in a Hg continuous emissions monitor (CEM) for flue gas and ambient air; however, it fails in detecting the Hg concentration in fuel gases containing interference components, such as aromatic hydrocarbons, because of the detection cell contamination and the overlap of adsorption peaks. Although the Hg separation method by gold trap was developed to eliminate the interference, {{it was only a}} semi-continuous measurement technology. Therefore, this study proposed novel Hg CEM to continuously measure the Hg concentration in fuel gases. The novel Hg CEM mainly consisted of a chemical looping combustion (CLC) pretreatment unit and a CVAAS Hg detector. The pretreatment unit was an electric-heated quartz tube reactor filled with an oxygen carrier (NiO), which was dispersed into quartz sand. The proposed Hg CEM worked in the following way: First, the gas with a controlled flow rate was fed into the reactor at an elevated temperature. All of the flammable gases were converted into CO 2 and H 2 O, and all Hg species were transformed into elemental vapor. Then, the product gases were introduced into the condenser to remove water. Finally, the concentration of elemental Hg in CO 2 was detected by CVAAS without any interference problem. With regard to the oxygen carrier, it was reduced to metal and then regenerated in air by oxidation. With two reactors, the real-time continuous Hg measurement via the proposed configuration can be realized by gas switch and oxygen <b>carrier</b> <b>regeneration.</b> Two types of gases containing Hg (toluene and coal pyrolysis gas) were continuously measured by the proposed Hg CEM. The results showed that satisfactory Hg recoveries were attained with CLC pretreatment, whereas the data without CLC pretreatment were totally distorted. Some technical challenges still remain unsolved, but it is believed that the proposed Hg CEM has a bright future for fuel gas. 1...|$|E

A choice to the traditional approaches could be represented by tissue engineering that use cells (and/or their products) and innovative biomaterials to perform bone substitutes biologically active {{as an alternative to}} artificial devices. In the last years, there was a wide improvement in biology on stem cells potential research and in biomedical engineering through development of new biomaterials designed to resemble the physiological tissues. Tissue engineering strategies and smart materials aim together to stimulate in vivo bone regeneration. This approaches drive at restore not only structure integrity and/or function of the original tissue, but also to induce new tissue deposition in situ. An intelligent bone substitute is now designed like not only a scaffold but also as <b>carrier</b> of <b>regeneration</b> biomolecular signals. Biomimetics has helped to project new tissue engineered devices to simulate the physiological substrates architecture, such extracellular matrix (ECM), and molecular signals that drive the integration at the interface between pre-existing tissue and scaffold.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} in the combustion of carbonaceous compounds CO 2 and NOx emissions to the atmosphere can be substantially reduced by using a two-stage chemical-looping process. In this process, the reduction stage is undertaken in a first reactor in which the framework oxygen of a reducible inorganic oxide is used, {{instead of the usual}} atmospheric oxygen, for the combustion of a carbonaceous compound, for instance, methane. The outlet gas from this reactor is mostly composed of CO 2 and steam as reaction products and further separation of these two components can be carried out easily by simple condensation of steam. Then, the oxygen carrier found in a reduced state is transported to a second reactor in which <b>carrier</b> <b>regeneration</b> with air takes place at relatively low temperatures, consequently preventing the formation of thermal NOx. Afterward, the regenerated carrier is carried to the first reactor to reinitiate a new cycle and so on for a number of repetitive cycles, while the carrier is able to withstand the severe chemical and thermal stresses involved in every cycle. In this paper, the performance of titania-supported nickel oxides has been investigated in a fixed-bed reactor as oxygen carriers for chemical-looping combustion of methane. Samples with different nickel oxide contents were prepared by successive incipient wet impregnations, and their performance as oxygen carriers was investigated at 900 °C and atmospheric pressure in five-cycle fixed-bed reactor tests using pure methane and pure air for the respective reduction and regeneration stages. The evolution of the outlet gas composition in each stage was followed by gas chromatography, and the involved chemical, structural, and textural changes of the carrier in the reactor bed were studied by using different characterization techniques. From the study, it is deduced that the reactivity of these nickel-based oxygen carriers is in the two involved stages and almost independent of the nickel loading. However, in the reduction stage, carbon deposition, from the thermal decomposition of methane, and CO emissions, mainly derived from the partial reduction of titania as support acting as an additional oxygen source, may impose some constraints to the efficiency of the overall chemical-looping combustion process in CO 2 capture. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

40|$|International audienceThe {{process of}} Chemical Looping Combustion necessitates {{the use of}} two reactors. In the first one, called “fuelreactor”, the {{reaction}} of combustion of methane with an oxygen carrier takes place (reduction step of the oxygencarrier), then, the oxygen carrier is re-oxidised with air in the second reactor called “oxidation reactor” (oxidation step). Diminution of the oxygen carrier performances after some cycles of reduction and oxidation are observed. The main objective {{of this study is}} to understand the phenomena leading to a decrease of the process performances. For this purpose, some experiments and modelling of fixed bed reactor have been performed to determine the relation between oxygen carrier structure changes (variation of porosity, chemical composition, structural organisation,…) and process performances decrease (variation of methane conversion and oxygen <b>carrier</b> <b>regeneration</b> rate, …). In order to qualify the variation of physical properties of the oxygen carrier material, analysis like X-ray diffraction, BET surface measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, are done to bring out the variation of structure of oxygen carrier particles. The model of the used fixed bed is modified to take into account all the phenomena observed. Several points will be presented concerning the degradation of the oxygen carrier particles:- even in case of fixed bed reactor (avoiding high friction between particles), the shape of the oxygen carrier grains mayvaries after several cycles of oxidation/reduction of the material. BET analysis will be done to quantify the impact of thosemodifications on the reacting surface of each grain,- X-ray diffraction analyses will show the evolution of the proportion of NiO, Ni and NiAl 2 O 4 in the oxygen carrier grains. Theanalysis of the X-ray signals should indicate that there are some structural modifications of the oxygen carrier. - after the reoxidation of the oxygen carrier, the grains are stuck to each other and form aggregates, measurements will bedone to determine if these aggregates impact the diffusion of gas species through the grains,- a complete analysis of the impact of experimental conditions on the structure of the oxygen carrier will be presented,- carbon deposition has a strong impact on the performances of the oxygen carrier. ConclusionThe modification of the oxygen carrier structure and composition has an impact on its performances in the CLC process(variation of methane conversion, …). A model was developed to represent one cycle of oxidation/reduction of the oxygen carrier in a previous study. The description of the modifications of the material will be used to extend the validity of this model to several cycles.

In this thesis, the author develops a series of versatile techniques, including polymer self-assembly and novel emulsification methods, to simultaneously control the physical and chemical structure of spheres.

40|$|Knee {{injuries}} {{are a major}} cause of orthopedic disabilities in the United States. Current reconstruction techniques for torn anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) require extensive surgery and long physical rehabilitation times since the tissue does not heal upon injury. A common ACL injury occurs where the gap at the rupture site remains open after injury and fails to heal, which can lead to premature osteoarthritis and disability. Hydrogels are a popular material used for tissue engineering applications due to their ability to retain water and good biocompatibility. Previous work has shown that hydrogels can be made through the mixed-mode reaction of radically crosslinked thiol groups and acrylate end groups. This project explores mixed-mode oligo[poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate] (OPF) -based hydrogels as alternate <b>carriers</b> for <b>regeneration</b> of partial tear ligament defects. The main purpose of this project was to determine the degradative properties of and cell response to thiol-PEG-thiol (PEG-diSH), a novel hydrogel material. The swelling and degradative properties of hydrogels containing three components OPF, PEG-diacrylate (PEG-DA), and PEG-diSH were characterized by their fold swelling. In addition, cell viability, morphology changes, proliferation and collagen production were analyzed in tri-ratio hydrogels with and without the presence of RGD over three weeks. Results showed that the hydrogels containing PEG-diSH demonstrated significantly larger fold swelling and promoted cell clustering (as shown by increased area of clusters), probably due to the larger mesh size and possibly due to the presence of free thiol functional groups present in the network from the mixed-mode reaction. However, an increase in cell number was not found in these gels up to eight days, suggesting that cell migration {{may play a role in}} the appearance of clusters. Additionally, increased cell spreading in response to RGD was observed inside gels containing PEG-diSH; no spreading was seen in the non PEG-diSH gels (± RGD), possibly because the mesh size was too small to allow for clustering or spreading within the matrix. Results from this work suggest that the presence of PEG-diSH could promote cell-cell contact within the clusters which could be useful in systems where direct contact promotes tissue formation or cell differentiation.

First, a critical-size osteochondral defect {{was created in the}} femora of the animals and subsequently filled with the ELR-based hydrogel alone or with embedded hMSCs. Regeneration outcomes were evaluated after three months by gross assessment, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, showing complete filling of the defect and the de novo formation of hyaline-like cartilage and subchondral bone in the hMSC-treated knees. Furthermore, histological sectioning and staining of every sample confirmed regeneration of the full cartilage thickness and early subchondral bone repair, which was more similar to the native cartilage {{in the case of the}} cell-loaded ELR-based hydrogel. Overall histological differences between the two groups were assessed semi-quantitatively using the Wakitani scale and found to be statistically significant (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Immunofluorescence against a human mitochondrial antibody three months post-implantation showed that the hMSCs were integrated into the de novo formed tissue, thus suggesting their ability to overcome the interspecies barrier.

40|$|Specific problem: Our {{previous}} {{study showed that}} the nanofibrous poly-l-lactic acid (NF-PLLA) microspheres are excellent cell <b>carriers</b> for tissue <b>regeneration.</b> However, these injectable microspheres are not fluorescent biomaterials. Incorporation of fluorescent chromophore into NF-PLLA microspheres will allow imaging for proper delivery of scaffold at the specified site and monitor time related degradation in the scaffold, and tissue regeneration by live fluorescent imaging, without the need of sacrificing the animals or undertaking elaborate histological procedures. To date, there is no report on the synthesis of fluorescent PLLA. In this research, we aim to develop an injectable fluorescent PLLA scaffold for tissue regeneration by using Eosin Y (EY) fluorophore as initiator. Method: The fluorescent polymer (PLLA-EY) was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of l-lactide by bulk polymerization method using stannous octoate Sn(Oct) _(2) catalyst and EY fluorophore initiator, at four different monomer/initiator (M/I) molar ratios (20 : 1, 100 : 1, 200 : 1, 400 : 1). The PLLA-EY polymer was characterized by FT-IR, UV-visible spectrophotometry and molecular weight (MW). The smooth walled (SW) and nanofibrous (NF) microspheres were fabricated from PLLA-EY 200 : 1 and 400 : 1 from methods previously described. These were characterized by SEM, confocal, in vitro biodegradation in PBS (pH change and SEM) and cytotoxicity testing (MTS assay) on dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Results: EY initiator generated free radicals causing ROP of l-lactide and incorporation of EY in the PLLA polymer chain. FT-IR and UV-vis spectra confirmed incorporation of EY in the polymer. Increasing the M/I ratio increased MW of PLLA-EY polymer. Microspheres formed from PLLA-EY were auto-fluorescent and increasing the polymer MW resulted in more well-defined nanofibers. Both short term (7 d) and long term (21 d) cytotoxicity results confirmed non-toxicity of the fluorescent polymer to DPSCs. NF microspheres formed small aggregates with cellular extensions between the DPSCs. Biodegradation of NF microspheres was not seen until 6 weeks in PBS solution under SEM. Conclusion: Fluorescent PLLA-EY polymer and its microparticles can be manufactured, and appear to be very promising candidates for dental pulp regeneration. Future studies should evaluate the ability to track the polymer and their microparticles in vivo, {{and their ability to}} accommodate cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and in vivo implantation...|$|R
40|$|It is {{predicted}} that with increased life expectancy {{in the developed}} world, {{there will be a}} greater demand for synthetic materials to repair or regenerate lost, injured or diseased bone (Hench & Thompson 2010). There are still few synthetic materials having true bone inductivity, which limits their application for bone regeneration, especially in large-size bone defects. To solve this problem, growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), have been incorporated into synthetic materials in order to stimulate de novo bone formation in the center of large-size bone defects. The greatest obstacle with this approach is that the rapid diffusion of the protein from the carrier material, leading to a precipitous loss of bioactivity; the result is often insufficient local induction or failure of bone regeneration (Wei et al. 2007). It is critical that the protein is loaded in the carrier material in conditions which maintains its bioactivity (van de Manakker et al. 2009). For this reason, the efficient loading and controlled release of a protein from a synthetic material has remained a significant challenge. The use of microspheres as protein/drug carriers has received considerable attention in recent years (Lee et al. 2010; Pareta & Edirisinghe 2006; Wu & Zreiqat 2010). Compared to macroporous block scaffolds, the chief advantage of microspheres is their superior protein-delivery properties and ability to fill bone defects with irregular and complex shapes and sizes. Upon implantation, the microspheres are easily conformed to the irregular implant site, and the interstices between the particles provide space for both tissue and vascular ingrowth, which are important for effective and functional bone regeneration (Hsu et al. 1999). Alginates are natural polysaccharides and their production does not have the implicit risk of contamination with allo or xeno-proteins or viruses (Xie et al. 2010). Because alginate is generally cytocompatible, it has been used extensively in medicine, including cell therapy and tissue engineering applications (Tampieri et al. 2005; Xie et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2007). Calcium cross-linked alginate hydrogel is considered a promising material as a delivery matrix for drugs and proteins, since its gel microspheres form readily in aqueous solutions at room temperature, eliminating the need for harsh organic solvents, thereby maintaining the bioactivity of proteins in the process of loading into the microspheres (Jay & Saltzman 2009; Kikuchi et al. 1999). In addition, calcium cross-linked alginate hydrogel is degradable under physiological conditions (Kibat PG et al. 1990; Park K et al. 1993), which makes alginate stand out as an attractive candidate material for the protein <b>carrier</b> and bone <b>regeneration</b> (Hosoya et al. 2004; Matsuno et al. 2008; Turco et al. 2009). However, the major disadvantages of alginate microspheres is their low loading efficiency and also rapid release of proteins due to the mesh-like networks of the gel (Halder et al. 2005). Previous studies have shown that a core-shell structure in drug/protein carriers can overcome the issues of limited loading efficiencies and rapid release of drug or protein (Chang et al. 2010; Molvinger et al. 2004; Soppimath et al. 2007). We therefore hypothesized that introducing a core-shell structure into the alginate microspheres could solve the shortcomings of the pure alginate. Calcium silicate (CS) has been tested as a biodegradable biomaterial for bone tissue regeneration. CS is capable of inducing bone-like apatite formation in simulated body fluid (SBF) and its apatite-formation rate in SBF is faster than that of Bioglass® and A-W glass-ceramics (De Aza et al. 2000; Siriphannon et al. 2002). Titanium alloys plasma-spray coated with CS have excellent in vivo bioactivity (Xue et al. 2005) and porous CS scaffolds have enhanced in vivo bone formation ability compared to porous β-tricalcium phosphate ceramics (Xu et al. 2008). In light of the many advantages of this material, we decided to prepare CS/alginate composite microspheres by combining a CS shell with an alginate core to improve their protein delivery and mineralization for potential protein delivery and bone repair application...|$|R
