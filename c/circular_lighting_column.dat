40|$|In {{general the}} hazards caused by falling <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> are not {{equal to the}} hazards of a {{collision}} with rigid columns. Tests have shown that <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> mostly fall {{at the side of}} the traffic lane. In cases where the <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> falls on the cycle track beside the highway there is a hazard for cyclists and moped riders, particularly in darkness. Another danger arises from falling <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> hitting road users. Recommendations to decrease these hazards are presented...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} severe and fatal crashes {{that result from}} {{vehicles}} colliding with street <b>columns</b> such as <b>lighting</b> <b>columns.</b> These cause extremely high impact forces and deformation on the frontal area of the car. The objective {{of the study is}} to demonstrate the frontal crash simulation of vehicle against <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> to examine injury risk and potential of safety. In particular, various FE models are used to perform contact–impact nonlinear dynamic analysis of <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> with vehicle. In this paper Abaqus explicit code is used to numerically simulate the crash of the vehicle with present <b>columns</b> and other <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> fabricated from a new suggested material. The acceleration, contact force and deformed energy at the frontal region of the vehicle are traced. It is found that the <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> with new suggested material have impact properties to decelerate the vehicle and absorb higher energy during impact...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} performance of consumer products {{is a major}} concern for many companies. In this work, an attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study was performed to identify the Best Practicable Environmental Option of three <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> made in alternative materials. These are a glass fibre reinforced polymer composite, and two traditional materials, steel and aluminium. Analysis of an alternative composite <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> with the same matrix, but reinforced with natural fibres (jute) was also performed. The results showed that the <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> made of steel has the worst overall environmental profile, although steel production is less energy intensive. The composite <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> is environmentally preferable due to its extended lifespan and lack of maintenance. The production of the raw material is responsible for most of the impacts in all three cases. The glass fibre production is the main contributor for the overall environmental burden of the composite column. In this case, the results also show that there are environmental advantages in replacing glass fibre for jute fibre. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologi...|$|R

40|$|A {{photoinduced}} {{current of}} a layered MoS 2 -based transistor is studied from first-principles. Under the illumination of <b>circular</b> polarized <b>light,</b> a valley-polarized current is generated, {{which can be}} tuned by the gate voltage. For monolayer MoS 2, the valley-polarized spin-up (down) electron current at K (K') points is induced by the right (left) <b>circular</b> polarized <b>light.</b> The valley polarization is found to reach + 1. 0 (- 1. 0) for the valley current that carried such a K (K') index. For bilayer MoS 2, the spin-up (down) current can be induced at both K and K' valleys by the right (left) <b>circular</b> <b>light.</b> In contrast to monolayer MoS 2, the photoinduced valley polarization shows asymmetric behavior upon reversal of the gate voltage.

40|$|We {{show that}} the image by the Lorentz {{transformation}} of a spherical (<b>circular)</b> <b>light</b> wave, emitted by a moving source, is not a spherical (<b>circular)</b> <b>light</b> wave but an ellipsoidal (elliptical) light wave. Poincare's ellipsoid (ellipse) is the direct geometrical representation of Poincare's relativity of simultaneity. Einstein's spheres (circles) are the direct geometrical representation of Einstein's convention of synchronisation. Poincare adopts another convention for the definition of space-time units involving that the Lorentz transformation of an unit of length is directly proportional to Lorentz transformation of an unit of time. Poincare's relativistic kinematics predicts both a dilation of time and an expansion of space as well.

40|$|Purpose Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) studies allow understanding {{all relevant}} processes and environmental impacts {{involved in the}} life cycle of products. However, in order to fully assess their sustainability, these studies should be complemented by economic (LCC) and societal analyses. In this context, the present work aims at assessing all costs (internal and external) and the environmental performance associated to the full life cycle of specific engineering products. These products are <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> for roadway illumination made with three different materials: a glass fibre reinforced polymer composite, steel and aluminium. Methods The LCA/LCC integrated methodology used was based in a “cradle-to-grave” assessment which considers the raw materials production, manufacture, on-site installation, use and maintenance, dismantlement and end-of-life (EoL) of the <b>lighting</b> <b>columns.</b> The fossil fuels environmental impact category was selected as the key environmental impact indicator to perform the integrated environmental and cost analysis. Results The potential total costs obtained for the full life cycle of the <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> demonstrated that the one made in steel performs globally worse than those made in composite or aluminium. Although the three systems present very similar internal costs, the steel column has higher external costs in the use phase that contribute for its higher total cost. This column has very high costs associated to safety features, since it constitutes a significant risk to the life of individuals. The raw material and column production stages are the main contributors for the total internal life cycle costs. The EoL treatment is a revenue source in all systems because it generates energy (in the case of the composite incineration) or materials (in the case of metal recycling). The composite and aluminium <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> present similar “cradle-to-grave” life cycle total cost. However, until the dismantlement phase, the aluminium column presents the highest environmental impact, whereas in the EoL treatment phase this scenario is reversed. The “cradle-to-grave” life cycle potential total cost and the environmental impact (fossil fuels) indicator of the steel <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> are higher than those of the other columns. Conclusions Even though the uncertainties in the LCC are larger if external costs are included, their consideration when modelling the economic performance of engineering products increases the probability of developing a more sustainable solution from a societal perspective.

A simple method is proposed based on quasi-static stiffness measurements obtained from impact tests. The method is validated using measurements of a laboratory scale structure...|$|R
