50|$|In Australia, {{where it}} is known as phytophthora dieback, dieback, jarrah dieback or <b>cinnamon</b> <b>fungus,</b> Phytophthora cinnamomi infects a number of native plants, causing damage to forests and {{removing}} habitats for small mammals.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} vegetation {{community is}} coastal heath, dominated by Acacia, Banksia, Leptospermum, Melaleuca and Westringia species. Blackberry {{is a problem}} weed.

50|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{pathogens}} {{found at the}} park {{have not yet been}} conducted. The <b>cinnamon</b> <b>fungus</b> (Phytophthora cinnamomi), a pathogenic soil fungus resulting in devastating effects on plant communities, has not yet been recorded as occurring in the park. Myrtle wilt is suspected as occurring in the park. It is caused by a fungus, Chalara australia, that infects myrtle beech trees and results in their gradual death. The pathogen has been suggested for listing as a potentially threatening process under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act.|$|E
50|$|Over 180 native {{plant species}} and 46 weed {{species have been}} identified. Gorse, {{blackberry}} and bridal creeper are listed as Weeds of National Significance; they are seen as South Australia's most environmentally threatening weeds. Blackberry, dog rose and African daisy are mainly confined to drainage lines and areas near the Dam. Montpellier broom (Genista monspessulana) is another prominent weed in the park. Phalaris dominates much of the leased area. In the early 21st century two new weed species were found: pussy-tails (Pentaschistis thunbergia) and African orchids (Disa bracteata). <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>fungus</b> (Phytophtora cinnamomi) is a significant pathogen, damaging plant species throughout the Adelaide hills. It has not been found yet in the park, but is suspected as being present in the southern section. The park has native plant communities that are of conservation significance due to their rarity in the contemporary Adelaide Hills including messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua) woodland and open forest, and manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis) woodland.|$|E
40|$|Managing {{the spread}} of <b>cinnamon</b> <b>fungus,</b> an exotic root-rotting {{pathogen}} which kills {{a wide range of}} native plants, is an over-riding management concern in the Brisbane Ranges National Park of south-eastern Australia. Parks Victoria has implemented a suite of approaches for informing recreational users about the disease and its ecological impacts. To assess longitudinal changes in the effectiveness of the educative programme, recreational users were surveyed in 1993 and in 2003. 81 % were not aware of <b>cinnamon</b> <b>fungus</b> dieback in 1993; the proportion in 2003 was almost unchanged at 83 %. Despite the lack of awareness of <b>cinnamon</b> <b>fungus</b> dieback, a large majority (76 % in 1993; 74 % in 2003) of respondents replied that they had viewed information boards in the park or read visitor guides with information on the disease and its ecological impacts. When recreational users were informed of the impact of infection, there was unanimous support for track closures for quarantine purposes. Our findings indicate that current methods of educating recreational users about <b>cinnamon</b> <b>fungus</b> dieback are not effective. Recommendations are made to improve the penetration of the educational and interpretive information, including the incorporation of affective and cognitive approaches...|$|E
40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi (<b>Cinnamon</b> <b>fungus)</b> is a {{pathogenic}} soil fungus which infects plant communities {{along the}} south-eastern coast of Australia, and the south-western corner of Western Australia. The symptoms {{of this disease}} include chlorosis, death of branches (ie. ‘dieback’), retarded growth and the eventual death of infected plants. This leads to devastating effects upon plant communities by altering both the structural and floristic characteristics of these communities. Small mammal species are dependent on specific features of their habitat such as vegetation structure and floristics. This thesis investigated alterations to the habitat of the insectivorous marsupial mouse, Antechinus stuartii, due {{to the presence of}} P. cinnamomi. The study was undertaken in an area of an open forest in the Brisbane Ranges, Victoria. Significant changes were found in both the floristic composition and structure of the vegetation at study sites infected with P, cinnamomi, compared to uninfected sites. The habitat utilization by A. stuartii of uninfected and infected vegetation was investigated using live trapping and radio-telemetric techniques. Capture rates were higher at sites uninfected by P. cinnamomi, and both male and females selected areas free from infection. Home range areas of males were significantly larger than those of females as assessed by telemetry. Both sexes spent a high proportion of time in areas dominated by Xanthorrhoea australis (Austral grass tree). There were significant relationships between the abundance of A. stuartii and the denseness of vegetation above 1 metre in height, and in particular, the proportion of cover afforded by X. australis. There {{were no significant differences in}} the cover of Eucalyptus spp. between uninfected and infected sites, but there were significantly more nest hollows in infected areas. The abundance of invertebrates was examined using pitfall traps. There were no significant differences in the abundance of the larger invertebrate taxa at infected and uninfected sites, but higher abundances of some micro-invertebrate groups in infected areas were recorded. The most likely factors considered to be influential in the habitat selection of A. stuartii were vegetation structure, and the presence of X. australis. To assess whether these factors were important the leaves of X. australis were removed with a brushcutter, to mimic the early effects of infection with P. cinnamomi. Animals did not respond to the alteration of vegetation structure in the short term (3 - 4 days). Longer-term experiments are required to assess the habitat utilization of A. stuartii at different periods following habitat manipulation. The implications of the presence of P. cinnamomi on the conservation of fauna are discussed. The destructive nature of the pathogen, and the slow rate of recovery from the disease, means that P. cinnamomi can be considered a threatening process to plant communities and the fauna that reside within that habitat. Future management of this disease within natural areas must therefore be cognisant of the potential of P. cinnamomi to significantly affect faunal as well as vegetative communities...|$|E
