25|$|The {{inflection}} point in that evolution is produced {{between the end}} of 1906 and beginnings of 1907. On those dates, his concern about social subjects is becoming bigger and his critic position becoming more radical. Possibly it was the time required to assimilate the tough American reality ("the Paraguayan pain"), after of contact it, Barret enriches his spirit. The exuberant and conflictive American vitality filled the hole that the European intellectual ambient <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> on him.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{existence}} of these fine double grooves on the gold lamella which provides the key for identifying MS5236 as being stamped and not written. Because {{it is a matter of}} mechanical necessity that the engraved letters appear with their raised double edges on the substrate as parallel, sunken lines when being printed, as can be observed on the amulet. Thus, the inscription is a bas-relief, which was produced by a bas-relief stamp. If the text had been carved directly into the foil as with other amulets, the stylus <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> only simple lines. According to Brekle, the applied printing technique has much in common with the later method of drypoint etching, by which an image is incised into a copper plate; however, unlike drypoint, MS5236 is a colourless blind print.|$|E
25|$|The result meant Buemi {{remained}} the Drivers' Championship leader on 157 points, increasing his advantage over di Grassi to 32 points. Rosenqvist's second-place finish {{enabled him to}} move into third position with 86 points. Prost fell to fourth place on 72 points and was nine points ahead of fifth-placed Heidfeld. e.Dams-Renault increased their Teams' Championship advantage to 58 points ahead of Audi Sport ABT. Mahindra consolidated third place on 149 points. Virgin remained in fourth position with 97 points and Vergne's sixth-place finish enabled Techeetah to pass NextEV for fifth place with four races left in the season. 24,000 people attended the race weekend. Despite his lead, Buemi lamented that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> Berlin with the same advantage he held entering the ePrix weekend and would seek an arrangement with his team which would have allowed him {{to participate in the}} New York City ePrix which clashed with another racing event that he was due to attend.|$|E

Since the murderer had always sent secret messages to Dexter, he searches his apartment for clues that Rudy <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>left,</b> and finds a picture of the shipping container where his mother was killed. When Dexter is about to leave, Doakes and LaGuerta arrive, telling him that they think Rudy Cooper was the one who stabbed Batista. Doakes insists that Dexter knows something, and he reveals that the blood on Angel's collar matched Rudy's. The pair leave, and Dexter goes to find the shipping container. At the station, LaGuerta orders a search for Rudy. Matthews walks in and introduces Esmee Pascal, the new lieutenant replacing LaGuerta.|$|E
500|$|Pauline was grief-stricken {{and later}} said [...] "My poor little boy. If only I {{had been with}} him...I would have nursed him as I nursed his father". She came to blame Borghese for his {{decision}} to send Dermide to Frascati and called him [...] "the butcher of my son", believing that, {{had it not been}} for her husband, her son [...] "would still be alive". Leclerc's parents accused Pauline of having neglected Dermide, leaving him to die under the care of servants, when she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> him in France, to live with them. Nonetheless, Pauline had her son buried at the Château de Montgobert, next to General Leclerc. Dermide's inheritance reverted to his father's family and, in spite of her wishes to be buried beside her son and first husband at Montgobert, Pauline was buried at the Saint Mary Major Basilica in Rome upon her death in 1825.|$|E

[...] He said he felt like he was in [...] "internal exile" [...] following September 11 attacks as the US media had become [...] "conservative and timid" [...] and did not welcome the provocative art that he felt the need to create.

500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{is written}} in the sentimental and melodramatic style common to 19th century sentimental novels and {{domestic}} fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion. Even though Stowe's novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on a large theme like slavery and by having a man as the main character, she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her readers. The power {{in this type of}} writing {{can be seen in the}} reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: [...] "I was up last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing Uncle Tom's Cabin. I could not leave it any more than I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> a dying child." [...] Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva. Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.|$|E
500|$|After Cattermole's departure, {{vowing to}} not disband, the {{remaining}} six members stayed {{together under the}} name S Club. Despite losing {{a member of the}} group, the future remained positive as, although they were very sad to see Cattermole leave the group, they were [...] "delighted" [...] to have extended their contracts meaning they could look forward to new material, a new series of their television show as well as their first feature film. However, media reports of the time weren't so optimistic stating that, as neither the Spice Girls nor Take That had survived once they lost a member of their group, {{it would be difficult for}} S Club to remain together in an industry which has a [...] "horrible habit of leaving bands in tatters once the first member has left". After only peaking at number-five in the UK charts with Alive, their first single as a six, was S Club's positivism diminished. Although their progressive musical style was once again furthered with the release of their fourth studio album, Seeing Double, it failed to make an impact on the UK charts, stalling at number-seventeen. S Club's time at the top of the charts was slowly coming to an end, and when O'Meara announced that she had an immobilising back condition which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> her in a wheelchair, and she was unable to take part in television performances, the group was left devastated.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1870, MacKillop and {{her sister}} Josephites heard of {{allegations}} that Keating, of Kapunda parish to Adelaide's north, had been sexually abusing children. The Josephites informed Father Woods, who in turn informed the vicar general Father John Smyth, who ultimately sent Keating back to Ireland. The reason for Keating's dismissal was publicly thought to be alcohol abuse. Keating's former Kapunda colleague, Father Charles Horan OFM, was angered by Keating's removal and {{there is evidence to}} suggest he sought revenge against Woods by attacking the Josephites. Horan became acting vicar general after the death of Smyth in June 1870 and from this position sought to influence Bishop Sheil. Horan met with Sheil on 21 September 1871 and convinced him that the Josephites' constitution should be changed in a way that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the Josephite nuns homeless; the following day, when MacKillop apparently did not accede to the request, Sheil excommunicated her, citing insubordination as the reason. Though the Josephites were not disbanded, most of their schools were closed in the wake of this action. Forbidden to have contact with anyone in the church, MacKillop lived with a Jewish family and was also sheltered by Jesuit priests. Some of the sisters chose to remain under diocesan control, becoming popularly known as [...] "Black Joeys".|$|E
