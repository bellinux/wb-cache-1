5|$|Horizontal frames often {{featured}} in Bacon's 1950s and 1960s paintings. The motif {{may have been}} borrowed from the sculptor Alberto Giacometti, who Bacon greatly admired and often corresponded with. Giacometti had employed the device in The Nose (1947) and The Cage (1950). Bacon's use of frames has suggested imprisonment to many commentators. Writing on their use in Fragment, Zweite mentions that the diagonal lines transform the <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> a guillotine.|$|E
5|$|Wary of Skanderbeg, Venice {{no longer}} openly {{challenged}} him. Another treaty {{was signed in}} 1463, when Venice went to war with the Turks. However, no peace was made between the Ottomans and Skanderbeg until 1463, before the Ottoman-Venetian war was of the same year, who retreated to Macedonia and prepared for another invasion of Albania after their defeat at Oronichea. During the Albanian-Venetian war, they had taken Svetigrad after several months of siege. Thence, they could <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> Albania uninhibited.|$|E

5|$|As soon as Kantakouzenos left Constantinople in July 1341 to {{campaign}} against the Empire's enemies who were assaulting it, Apokaukos made his first moves. Although as commander of the fleet it was his duty to guard the Dardanelles against any attempt by Turks to <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> Europe, he deliberately allowed this to happen in order to cause disruption in Thrace. Apokaukos tried to kidnap the young John V, but failed {{and was forced to}} flee to his house at Epibatai. However, when Kantakouzenos returned victorious to the capital, instead of depriving Apokaukos of his offices, and against the counsel of his friends, he pardoned his protégé. Apokaukos put on an exaggerated display of deference to Kantakouzenos, who allowed him to resume his offices and return to Constantinople, while Kantakouzenos left on yet another campaign.|$|E
5|$|Athens was {{prevented}} from sending more effective aid by events on Euboea in 348 BC. A pre-eminent politician from Chalcis, Callias, sought {{to unite the}} cities of Euboea in a new confederation, inevitably meaning {{the end of the}} hitherto strong Athenian presence on the island. Strategically, this was unacceptable for the Athenians. In 410 BC, the strait between Euboea and the mainland, the Euripos, had been narrowed, and then bridged at Chalcis. If Euboea, and in particular Chalcis, was no longer controlled by Athens then Philip could potentially <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> Euboea from Thessaly, and then cross back into Boeotia via the bridge at Chalcis, thus outflanking Thermopylae. The whole Athenian strategy in the years after 352 BC therefore required that they hold Euboea.|$|E

5|$|By {{capturing}} Glina, the HV trapped {{the bulk}} of the ARSK Kordun Corps and about 35,000 evacuating civilians in the area of Topusko, prompting its commander to request UNCRO protection. The 1st Guards Brigade, approaching Topusko from Vojnić, received orders to engage the ARSK Kordun Corps, but the orders were cancelled at midnight by the chief of the HV General Staff. Instead, the Zagreb Corps was instructed to prepare a brigade-strength unit to escort unarmed persons and ARSK officers and non-commissioned officers with side arms to Dvor and allow them to <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina. Based on information obtained from UN troops, it was believed that the ARSK forces in Banovina were about to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Liverpool {{had a chance to}} score. Callaghan took a throw-in, which he threw to Lawler, his <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> the Leeds penalty area was met by Hunt, but his header went wide of the goal. Liverpool {{continued}} to pressure and only an interception from Bremner, before Stevenson could reach the ball, prevented a Liverpool goal. Leeds had a free-kick a few minutes later, but Giles' effort was saved by Lawrence. A few minutes later, St. John found Peter Thompson, who ran past Bremner and shot, but it was diverted wide by Sprake. The ball found dropped to hunt, but his cross was gathered by the Leeds goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Highway 35, {{like many}} {{highways}} that begin at Lake Ontario and eventually <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> the Canadian Shield, began as several trails connecting settlements.

5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the match}} {{and they had}} first chance of the match in the fourth minute, but the free-kick by midfielder Murphy was caught by United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Defender Henchoz was shown a yellow card in the 12th minute and United midfielder Giggs had the first shot of the match, which was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. Twice {{in the next few}} minutes, Liverpool had chances from moves down the {{right-hand}} side of the pitch. On both occasions, however, the pass into the penalty area was intercepted. United had a chance to score in the 20th minute. Keane passed to Scholes, who found Giggs on the left-hand side of the pitch. His <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> the penalty area found striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, but his shot went wide of the Liverpool goal.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool pressed and Thompson forced Sprake into {{a number}} of saves. Leeds had another chance as Bremner had a shot saved by Lawrence after {{receiving}} the ball from Reaney. A few minutes later, Strong forced Sprake into a save, which resulted in a corner. St. John came close to scoring from the subsequent corner, but his shot went over the Leeds goal. However, with three minutes of extra time remaining, St. John scored. Smith found Callaghan, who ran past two Leeds defenders, his <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> the Leeds penalty area was headed into the goal by St. John to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead.|$|E
5|$|Luton {{came close}} to scoring their second goal of the match when Harford got away from Caesar and ran towards the left byline. His <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> the penalty area was met by Brian Stein's head, but Lukic made a crucial save, tipping the ball wide. Both {{managers}} brought on substitutes after the hour mark – Mark Stein came on for Harford, while Martin Hayes replaced Groves. The latter substitution worked to Arsenal's advantage, as it brought about their equaliser in the 72nd minute. Davis' free kick delivered in was only half cleared by Foster and amongst the scramble, Hayes drove {{the ball in the}} net. Arsenal continued to pile on pressure, and took the lead three minutes later, when Smith received a pass from Thomas to score.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the start}} of the second half in extra time, Galatasaray's first {{opportunity}} came, when Şükür attempted a shot from a Popescu cross, but the ball hit the side netting. After seven minutes, Kanu beat a defender, dribbled into the Galatasaray area and shot the ball twice, only to be denied twice by Taffarel. In the dying minutes both teams continued to create decisive chances – Galatasaray's Popescu was given a free–kick, after Şükür was brought down by Keown. However, the ball flew straight into Seaman's arms. Arsenal's Sylvinho put in a <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> the Galatasaray area to Henry, but ball was cleared away. The final whistle was blown and the match moved into a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|On May 22, 2006, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) CPC (CPC) {{released}} their forecasts for the 2006 Atlantic and Pacific hurricane seasons. The Pacific {{season was}} expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in 1995, which generally increased wind shear across the basin. NOAA predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 12–16named storms, of which 6–8 were expected to become hurricanes, and 1–3 expected to become major hurricanes. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility was also expected to be below average, with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> the area. They expected that neither El Niño nor La Niña would affect conditions significantly.|$|E

5|$|On May17, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{issued its}} {{seasonal}} forecast for the 2004 central Pacific season, predicting {{four or five}} tropical cyclones to form or <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> the basin. Likewise to the SMN, near average activity was expected {{largely as a result}} of a Neutral ENSO. The organization issued its experimental eastern Pacific outlook on May21, highlighting a 45 percent change of below-average activity, 45 percent chance of near-average activity, and only a 10 percent chance of above-average activity in the basin. A total of 13 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes was forecast.|$|E
5|$|On May21, 2007, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Central Pacific Hurricane Center {{released}} its {{outlook for the}} 2007 Central Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 2–3 tropical cyclones to form or <b>cross</b> <b>into</b> the basin; in a typical season, 4–5 systems cross or form in the Central Pacific.
