5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges.

Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water <b>closes</b> the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E
