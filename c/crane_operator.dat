5|$|A narrator {{explains}} how humans were unaware that {{a race of}} extraterrestrials was making plans to occupy Earth. Ray Ferrier is a divorced <b>crane</b> <b>operator</b> longshoreman {{who works at a}} dock in Brooklyn, New York and lives in Bayonne, New Jersey. Ray is estranged from his children. His former wife, Mary Ann, later drops off the children, 10-year-old daughter Rachel and teenage son Robbie, at Ray's house on her way to visit her parents in Boston. Unexplained changes in the weather occur, including lightning that strikes multiple times {{in the middle of an}} intersection and disrupts all electricity.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the <b>crane</b> <b>operator</b> a better view of the process.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{arriving}} at the plant is checked in and weighed, before being delivered to the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a <b>crane</b> <b>operator,</b> who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises {{the efficiency of the}} plant.|$|E
40|$|The {{information}} on job strain among <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> in Malaysia is lacking. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the prevalence and contributing factors of job strain among <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> working in port container terminals. A cross sectional study was carried out at a port container terminal in Malaysia. Data was collected using validated self-administered questionnaires, which consisted of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS- 21). All <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> in the selected terminal participated in the study. Data was analyzed using SSPS version 19. Two-hundred-and-forty <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> participated in the study [...] The prevalence of job strain determined from the JCQ was 43. 8 %. Job strain was significantly associated with psychological job demand, decision latitude, anxiety, physical isometric loads and muscle ache. The prevalence of job strain in this study was high. There is an urgent need to recognize the existence of this problem among <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> by their respective management. Implementation of comprehensive stress management programs are recommended to reduce job strain among these workers...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{investigated the}} current inadequate holistic training practices given to tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> which significantly impact {{health and safety}} in Gauteng, South African construction projects. The primary motivation for conducting the research was due to tower crane related accidents, fatalities and related project delays which have become endemic in the construction industry. These occurrences have not been researched {{from the perspective of}} the basic training given to tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> in the SA construction industry. The study sought to examine the current structure and characteristics of the training programmes used in developing the skills of tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators.</b> This included exploring the current barriers and the effectiveness experienced in the training programmes given to tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators.</b> The study also sought to find the major improvements or restructuring that is still needed in skills development and training of tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> from the perspective of tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators.</b> It consisted of a sample of 25 tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> trained in various skills development programmes used in the South African construction industry. The research also included interviews from 9 site foremen and managers who manage the operations of tower cranes during construction project delivery, who also provided key data in relation to the training practices of tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> from the manner in which their contractors conduct them. The study found several major factors contributing to inadequate holistic training of tower <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> related to the following: the manner in which the current training programmes were structured in terms of theoretical and practical training; lack of effectiveness of the training programmes in terms of safety, communication, rigging and hoisting and the important knowledge of tower crane operations; inefficiency of tower cranes in terms of the technological aspects that relate to giving a clearer site view of the environment in which lifting and unloading of construction materials was conducted; inadequately trained banksman or signalers and lack of training in general personalities needed in operating tower cranes as the main contributing factors. These major factors that the study found to contribute to tower crane related accidents need to be addressed if the continuing accidents and fatalities are to be significantly reduced in Gauteng, South African construction projects during project delivery and execution...|$|R

25|$|When I was a kid, {{my father}} told me about an {{accident}} that happened while he was working on Grand Coulee Dam in Washington. (At the time, Grand Coulee Dam was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a <b>crane</b> <b>operator</b> failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung out with it, and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E

25|$|Jackson {{was born}} December 11, 1954 in Gary, Indiana, after his brother Tito Jackson. He {{is the fourth}} child born to Joseph and Katherine Jackson. His {{siblings}} are Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, La Toya, Marlon, Michael, Randy, and Janet. His father Joseph had musical aspirations, playing guitar with his brother’s band, The Falcons, and Katherine was a passionate pianist and singer. But their large family and lack of money ended their dreams with Katherine becoming a housewife, and Joseph, a steel worker at nearby Inland Steel Company in East Chicago, Indiana (his parents lived there before they moved to Gary in 1950). While his father worked long hours as a <b>crane</b> <b>operator,</b> Jermaine and his brothers, Tito and Jackie, secretly practiced their own songs using their father's guitar. Jermaine became the original lead singer of the Jackson Brothers—an earlier incarnation of The Jackson Five until 1966, when younger brother (Michael Jackson) began singing lead. Jermaine would continue to provide some leads over the years. Jermaine graduated from Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California in 1973.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of crane {{accidents}} is human failure. Many crane accidents could be avoided by a specific safety training for <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> that exposes the users to specific hazardous situations. Intention of the presented research project is the composition of a safety training program for <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> as well as the development and realisation of the according Virtual Reality (VR) crane simulator. The VR simulation of a ground controlled gantry <b>crane</b> allows the <b>operator</b> to train safety behaviour schemes at wide range of different realistic hazardous situations, while neither persons nor goods nor machinery get compromised. Investigations based on this project show that the developed VR crane simulator is suitable for a behaviour training in specific hazardous situations. The acquired experiences can be transferred and applied into practice. The experiences in a virtual training environment lead to an increased awareness of hazardous factors as well as a more rule compliant behaviour. Safety training at the VR crane simulator augments the existing training program VDI 2194 for crane operation and {{turns out to be a}} surplus for job training of <b>crane</b> <b>operators...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Apex Building was {{the last}} to be {{constructed}} and dedicated. A major impetus for the building's construction came in June 1935, when the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) headquarters at C Street NW and 21st Street NW was razed {{to make way for the}} Federal Reserve Board Building. The FTC petitioned the Commission on Fine Arts to permit it to occupy the Apex Building. Testing for the foundation began in September 1936, and was completed shortly thereafter. With design work long completed and President Roosevelt expressing his wish that the structure be built, a $3.1 million contract for the building was signed on December 29, 1936. Using the George Washington trowel, President Roosevelt laid the cornerstone for the building on July 12, 1937. The building's $3.665 million cost was paid for out of Public Works Administration funds, and officials estimated it would be ready for occupation by January 1, 1938. Demolition of the old foundation for the unbuilt Washington Memorial occurred in July 1937, and much of the Apex Building's steel superstructure was rising by then as well. The great depth of the building's foundation meant that the <b>crane</b> <b>operator</b> lifting the steel beams into place was out of sight in the basement, and a series of telephone links from observers on the street relayed instructions to him. By December 1937, the building was two months ahead of schedule.|$|E
500|$|Strikes did {{not occur}} merely due to {{problems}} that had emerged shortly before the labor unrest, but due to governmental and economic difficulties spanning more than a decade. In July 1980, Edward Gierek's government, facing economic crisis, decided to raise prices while slowing the growth of wages. At once there ensued a wave of strikes and factory occupations, with the biggest strikes {{taking place in the}} area of Lublin. The first strike started on July 8, 1980 in the State Aviation Works in Świdnik. Although the strike movement had no coordinating center, the workers had developed an information network to spread news of their struggle. A [...] "dissident" [...] group, the Workers' Defence Committee (KOR), which had originally been set up in 1976 to organize aid for victimized workers, attracted small groups of working-class militants in major industrial centers. At the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, the firing of Anna Walentynowicz, a popular <b>crane</b> <b>operator</b> and activist, galvanized the outraged workers into action.|$|E

40|$|In The Netherlands so far little {{research}} has been carried out to investigate the health effects of exposure to whole-body vibration at work. In a retrospective (10 -year) follow-up study, the incidence of permanent work disabilities in <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> exposed to vibration was compared to that of a control group. The emphasis in this presentation is on disablement because of back disorders. Among the <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> with more than 5 years of exposure to vibration, more disability due to back trouble occurred than in the control group. The incidence density ratio (IDR) exceeded 2 for disability because of degeneration of the intervertebral disc, after adjustment for age, nationality, shift work and calendar year. With increasing years of exposure, the risk ratio for disability because of intervertebral disc disorders also increased. The risk ratio for a disability pension due to disease of the intervertebral disc for <b>crane</b> <b>operators</b> with more than 5 years of exposure was almost 3 compared to the control group. A combination of exposure to whole-body vibration, an unfavorable posture, and climatic conditions is responsible for the development of these health effect...|$|R

THE TECHNOLOGY CRANIUM is a video system designed to improve productivity and safety of crane operations by improving communications.

2500|$|Chinook {{winds are}} said to {{sometimes}} cause {{a sharp increase in}} the number of migraine headaches suffered by the locals. At least one study conducted by the department of clinical neurosciences at the University of Calgary supports that belief. They are popularly believed to increase irritability and sleeplessness. In mid-winter over major centres such as Calgary, Chinooks can often override cold air in the city, trapping the pollutants in the cold air and causing inversion smog. At such times, it is possible for it to be cold at street level and much warmer at the tops of the skyscrapers and in higher terrain. In 1983, on the 45th floor [...] of the Petro-Canada Center, carpenters worked shirtless in +12°C, windy conditions (temperature reported to them by overhead <b>crane</b> <b>operator),</b> but were chagrined to find out the street temperature was still 20°C as they left work at 3:30 that afternoon.|$|E
