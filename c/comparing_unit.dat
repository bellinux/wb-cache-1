40|$|Due to {{weaknesses}} in traditional tests a Bayesian {{approach is developed}} to investigate whether unit roots exist in macroeconomic time-series. Bayesian posterior odds <b>comparing</b> <b>unit</b> root models to stationary and trend-stationary alternatives are calculated using informative priors. Two classes of reference priors which are informative but require minimal subjective prior input are used. In this sense the Bayesian unit root tests developed here are objective. Bayesian procedures are carried out on the C. Nelson-C. Plosser (1982) and R. Shiller (1981) data sets {{as well as on}} generated data. The conclusion is that the failure of classical procedures to reject the unit root hypothesis is not necessarily proof that a unit root is present with high probability.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the oil and}} gas industry, one way {{of laying}} pipes on the {{seafloor}} is by the reeling process. In this process the pipe is subjected to a cyclic plastic deformation. Due to this plastic deformation the mechanical properties of the material are changed. In this study the finite element method is used to predict the influence of the cyclic plastic deformations on the mechanical behaviour of the material. The fraction model is used to describe the cyclic stress-strain behaviour. In {{order to be able to}} predict fracture of the material the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman damage model is used in conjunction with the fraction model. By <b>comparing</b> <b>unit</b> cell calculations with the damage model, the parameters q 1 and q 2 were determined for both the monotonic and cyclic loading conditions...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{a new system}} of purpose built {{landfill}} (PBLF) has been proposed for the control of methane emissions from municipal solid waste (MSW), by considering all favourable conditions for improved methane generation in tropical climates. Based on certain theoretical considerations multivariate functional models (MFMs) are developed to estimate methane mitigation and energy generating potential of the proposed system. Comparison was made between the existing waste management system and proposed PBLF system. It has been found that the proposed methodology not only controlled methane emissions to the atmo-sphere but also could yield considerable energy in terms of landfill gas (LFG). Economic feasibility of the proposed system has been tested by <b>comparing</b> <b>unit</b> cost of waste disposal in conventional as well as PBLF systems. In a case study of MSW management in Mumbai (INDIA), {{it was found that the}} unit cost of waste disposal with PBLF system is seven times lesser than that of the con-ventional waste management system. The proposed system showed promising energy generation potential with production of methane worth of Rs. 244 millions/y ($ 5. 2 million/y). Thus, the new waste management methodology could give an adaptable solution for the conflict between development, environmental degradation and natural resources depletion. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain a better {{understanding}} of the ways in which children conceptualise fractions as quantities when they are asked to compare the size of fractions. One hundred children aged 11 and 12 were asked to choose the larger of two fractions and to explain their reasoning. The questions progressed from <b>comparing</b> <b>unit</b> fractions to comparing fractions close to one-whole with different denominators. By coding the children’s responses according to the comparative strategy evident in their explanations, a range of strategy categories was identified and exemplified. When students encounter problems involving fractions, they often solve the problems by using their knowledge of whole numbers (Behr, Wachsmuth, Post & Lesh, 1984; Mack, 1995; Yoshida & Kuriyama, 1995). With common fractions students may reason that 18 is larger than 17 because 8 is larger than 7, or they may believe that 34 is the same as 45 because in both fractions the difference between numerator and denominator is 1 (Behr, Wachsmuth, Post et al., 1984). This reasoning appears to be based on students continuing to use properties they learned from operating with whole numbers. “For all children, their previous whole-number schemas have influenced their ability to reason about the order relation for fractions ” (Post & Cramer, 1987). When comparing fractions, students often focus on the whole number numerators, the whole number denominators or both whole numbers. In the Concepts in Secondary Mathematics and Science (CSMS) project, approximately one-quarter of 14 and 15 year-olds responded with 13 when asked to write down a fraction that came between 12 and 23 (Hart, Brown, Kuchemann, Kerslake, Ruddock & McCartney, 1981). Such a response is consistent with comparing both numerators (23 > 13) and denominators (3 > 2) as whole numbers. Vinner (1997) described similar fraction comparison strategies, such as “the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction”, as pseudo-analytical behaviour. The application of these spurious or incomplete strategies can result in correct answers for the wrong reasons...|$|E

From the application context suggestions emerge for the pursuit of a methodological path, the principal end objectives of which are the classification or ordering of a set of <b>compared</b> <b>units</b> against a complex multidimensional phenomenon, and the synthesis of a variety of indicators. A methodological solution in the nonparametric field is represented by the nonparametric combination of dependent tests and dependent rankings (NPC ranking; Pesarin & Salmaso, 2010), that allows the combination of rankings derived from orderings of statistical units against appropriate indicators, without the need to specify the dependence structure underlying the considered indicators that can be calculated, for example, on the same statistical units. This methodology represents an important surpassing of the usual synthesis of performance indicators made up of the simple arithmetic mean. The research contribution consists mainly in the extension of nonparametric methodological solutions above, such as those concerning the nonparametric combination of dependent tests and NPC ranking, {{in order for them to}} be used in the evaluation of satisfaction about products or services. Thus this research activity has a twofold purpose. From one side it aims to suggest innovative methodological tools with reference to problems of multivariate ranking and of combination of indicators, from the other hand it allows to solve practical problems. Indeed methodological solutions proposed in this work have been applied in the field of university teaching evaluation by analyzing data from student satisfaction surveys and in the field of the customer satisfaction related to services provided by the ski schools of Alto Adige. Other kinds of applications in industrial field, in development of new products and in life cycle of products assessment are also discussed. ...|$|R
