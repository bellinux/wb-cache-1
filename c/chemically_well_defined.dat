By pulsed field gradient 1 H-NMR, the diffusion coefficients of all three components in a cubic phase composed of soybean phosphatidylcholine, diacylglycerol, and heavy water have been determined at 25 and 59 degrees C and also for the corresponding cubic phase composed of the <b>chemically</b> more <b>well</b> <b>defined</b> synthetic components 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DOPC), 1, 2 -dioleoylglycerol (DOG), and heavy water.

However, due to increased interface to volume ratios at reduced dimensions, charge carrier recombination and scattering at Si SiO 2 interfaces might dominate the photoelectrical properties and gain critical impact on mobility lifetime products amp; 956; amp; 964; and thus internal quantum efficiencies [1]. To circumvent this drawback, the effect of hydrogen treatment on charge carrier recombination and electronic densities of states at the interface of ultrathin oxides layers is analyzed.

40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of mankind, {{microorganisms}} have been of enormous social and economic importance. Without even being aware of their existence, very early on in history man was using them {{in the production of}} food and beverages. The Sumerians and Babylonians were practising the brewing of beer before 6000 BC, references to wine making {{can be found in the}} Book of Genesis and the Egyptians used yeast for baking bread. However, knowledge of the production of chemicals such as alcohols and organic acids through fermentation is relatively recent and the first reports in the literature only appeared in the second half of the 19 th century. Lactic acid was probably the first optically active compound to be produced industrially by fermentation. This was accomplished in the USA in 1880 [1]. In 1921, Chapman reviewed a number of early industrial fermentation processes for organic chemicals [2]. In the course of time, it was discovered that microorganisms could modify certain compounds by simple, <b>chemically</b> <b>well</b> <b>defined</b> reactions, which were further catalyzed by enzymes. Nowadays, these processes are called “biotransformations”. The essential difference between fermentation and biotransformation is that there are several catalytic steps between the substrate and the product in a fermentation while there are only one or two in a biotransformation. The distinction is also in the fact that the chemical structures of the substrate and the product resemble one another in a biotransformation, but not necessarily in a fermentation...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation into}} the effect of surface chemistry on bacterial adhesion was carried out. In particular, a number of physicochemical factors important in defining the surface {{at the molecular level}} were assessed for their effect on the adhesion of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The primary experiments involved the grafting of groups varying in hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, chain length, and chemical functionality onto glass substrates such that the surfaces were homogeneous and densely packed with functional groups. All of the surfaces were found to be <b>chemically</b> <b>well</b> <b>defined,</b> and their measured surface energies varied from 15 to 41 mJ · m− 2. Protein adsorption experiments were performed with 3 H-labelled bovine serum albumin and cytochrome c prior to bacterial attachment studies. Hydrophilic uncharged surfaces showed the greatest resistance to protein adsorption; however, our studies also showed that the effectiveness of poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO) polymers was not simply a result of its hydrophilicity and molecular weight alone. The adsorption of the two proteins approximately correlated with short-term cell adhesion, and bacterial attachment for L. monocytogenes and E. coli also correlated with the chemistry of the underlying substrate. However, for S. aureus and S. typhimurium a different pattern of attachment occurred, suggesting a dissimilar mechanism of cell attachment, although high-molecular-weight PEO was still the least-cell-adsorbing surface. The implications of this for in vivo attachment of cells suggest that hydrophilic passivating groups may be the best method for preventing cell adsorption to synthetic substrates provided they can be grafted uniformly and in sufficient density at the surface...|$|E

40|$|DNA {{assemblies}} {{containing a}} pendant dipyridophenazine complex of Ru(II) {{along with two}} oxidative traps, a site containing the nucleoside analog methylindole (5 ′-GMG- 3 ′) and a 5 ′-GGG- 3 ′ site, have been constructed to explore long-range charge transport through the base pair stack. With these <b>chemically</b> <b>well</b> <b>defined</b> assemblies, {{in combination with the}} flash/quench technique, formation of the methylindole cation radical and the neutral guanine radical is monitored directly by using transient absorption spectroscopy, and yields of oxidative damage are quantitated biochemically by gel electrophoresis. In these assemblies the base radicals form with a rate of ≥ 107 s– 1. The rate of base radical formation does not change upon the addition of a second radical trap, the 5 ′-GGG- 3 ′ site; however, the yield of methylindole oxidation is significantly lower. This observation indicates that the 5 ′-GGG- 3 ′ site is effective in competing for the migrating charge and provides a second trapping site. Switching the orientation of the two trapping sites does not affect the yield of oxidized products at either site. Therefore, in DNA both forward and reverse charge transport occur so as to provide equilibration across the duplex on a timescale that is fast compared with trapping at a particular site. Further evidence of charge equilibration results from incorporating an intervening base-stacking perturbation and monitoring the fate of the injected charge. These experiments underscore the dynamic nature of DNA charge transport and reveal the importance of considering radical propagation in both directions along the DNA duplex...|$|E

The microstructures in atomic scale and the bonding states (electronic structures) of soot particles emitted by advanced commercial vehicles engines will be elucidated by means of TEM, HRTEM and EELS. Core-shelled spheroidal primary particles are found as described in the literature, but more primary particles do not exhibit a defined structure. The high-resolution imaging reveals irregular shaped primary particles with a deformed fullerenoid structure (size between 10 and 20 nm) and fullerene-like clusters or molecules on the surface of the primary particles [Sum 03]. XPS, FTIR (DRIFTS) spectroscopy are applied to reveal the functional groups on surface and the bulk composition of the soot particles.

40|$|Evidence has {{accumulated}} that the voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC), {{located on the}} outer membrane of mitochondria, plays {{a central role in}} apoptosis. The involvement of VDAC oligomerization in apoptosis has been suggested in various studies. However, it still remains unknown how exactly VDAC supra-molecular assembly can be regulated in the membrane. Previous studies suggested the possible influence of various proteins on the formation of VDAC oligomers, but the important issue of the VDAC oligomeric state regulation by lipids has not been studied so far. Nevertheless, the effect of lipids on the oligomerization of several membrane proteins has been mentioned in the literature and in general, protein-lipid interactions are under extensive investigation. In the present work, I addressed the influence of lipids on VDAC oligomerization experimentally by reconstituting the fluorescently labelled VDAC in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) —a <b>chemically</b> <b>well</b> <b>defined,</b> cell-free minimal model system. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy was performed to determine the oligomeric state of VDAC. I investigated the effect of important for apoptosis anionic lipids, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, on VDAC oligomerization. I demonstrated that phosphatidylglycerol significantly enhances VDAC oligomerization in the membrane, whereas cardiolipin disrupts VDAC oligomers. These results suggest that up- or down- regulation of these lipids in mitochondria during apoptosis can tune VDAC oligomerization in the membrane. Thus, this study sheds light on the role played by the above-mentioned lipids in the regulation of VDAC oligomerization during apoptosis and provides additional information on the molecular mechanisms of the programmed cell death. Another objective of this work was to investigate the partitioning of VDAC into liquid disordered or liquid ordered lipid phases. The existence of lipid domains or the lipid rafts in mitochondria and VDAC enrichment in these rafts is still under debate. Additionally, mitochondrial VDAC was recently found in the plasma membrane. The role of this VDAC is not known, however, it was shown to be located in caveolae (specialized lipid rafts) and {{play an important role in}} neuronal apotosis and Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, VDAC partitioning to the lipid rafts is an interesting question for investigation. The possibility to reconstitute VDAC into minimal model systems–GUVs with phase separation, allowed to reveal the preferential partitioning of VDAC into liquid disordered lipid domain, which suggests either non-raft localization of VDAC or the requirement of the other factors for the recruitment of VDAC into lipid rafts...|$|E

40|$|The syntheses and {{in vitro}} {{biological}} evaluation of three series of glycodendrimers is presented herein. This dissertation marks three "firsts" {{in the field}} of glycobiology. <b>Chemically</b> <b>well</b> <b>defined</b> hypervalent neoglycoconjugates, termed glycodendrimers, have been designed and prepared. These concepts were extended to include the enzymatic elongation of a glycoside on a dendritic core. Furthermore, the first direct correlation of the number of carbohydrate residues and the multivalent effect has been reported. To further the understanding of multivalency and its role in carbohydrate-protein interactions, glycoconjugates with differing carbohydrate densities, conformations, and interglycosidic spacings must be prepared. The design and synthesis of glycodendrimers addresses these issues. Solid phase synthesis on Wang resin was used to construct dendritic α-thiosialosides. The design of these new, hyperbranched clusters was based on the rational scaffolding of L-lysine core structures using established 9 -fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protecting group and activated benzotriazolyl ester (HOBt) coupling procedures. Chain extension of the lysyl amino groups with chloroacetylglycylglycine active ester allowed introduction of the required functionality necessary for the coupling to an α-thiosialoside derivative prepared under phase transfer catalysed conditions. Well defined di-, tetra-, octa-, and hexadeca-valent dendritic α-thiosialosides were thus prepared. The synthesis of structurally similar divergent and spherical dendrimers, with even valencies of between two and sixteen and ending with equidistant α-thiosialoside residues is also described. The synthesis of the dendritic core was based on the regioselective protection of the primary amines of 3, 3 '-iminobis(propylamine) using benzylcyanoformate. The resulting secondary amine was monoalkylated with tert-butyl bromoacetate to provide a divalent core structure orthogonally protected with carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) protected amines and a tert-butyl ester. Selective deprotection via hydrogenation or trifluoroacetolysis afforded amine and acid key precursors, respectively. These were conjugated using standard HOBt/DIC strategy to give divergent, Cbz-protected dendrimers with valencies between two and sixteen in the first through fourth generations. Tethering of the dimer and tetramer to both hexamethylenediamine and tris-(2 -aminoethyl) amine provided spherical, hyperbranched dendritic structures with valencies between four and twelve. All Cbz-protected dendrimers were transformed into N-chloroacetylated dendrimers which were coupled to a thiolated sialic acid derivative. Thiourelene p-phenyl α-thiosialoside containing dendrimers scaffolded on Starburst PAMAM dendrimers were prepared using an isothiocyanate conjugation strategy. PAMAM cores, generation G 0 to G 3, were coupled to a sialic acid isothiocyanate derivative to give spherical, hypervalent thiourea derivatives containing four to thirty-two surface sialic acid residues. The above concepts were easily extended to include the preparation of dendrimers with covalently attached N-acetylglucosamine, lactose, N-acetyllactosamine, mannose, Galβ-(1, 3) -GalNAcα (T-antigen), and 3 '-sulfo-Lewis X-(Glc) residues. Furthermore, glycodendrimers were shown to be amenable to both chemical and enzymatic transformations via the 9 -O-acetylation of octavalent α-thiosialodendrimers and the enzymatic galactosylation of dendritic N-acetylglucosamine. The preparation of a custom designed heterobifunctional dendrimer containing biotin and four sialic acid residues is also presented. The synthesis was based on the tethering of a tetravalent, Cbz-protected, 3, 3 '-iminobis(propylamine) -based core to an amine functionalized biotin derivative using established HOBt/DIC coupling chemistry. Cbz deprotection via hydrogenation afforded the biotin-containing tetraamine which was conjugated to a sialic acid p-isothiocyanatophenyl derivative to provide the desired bi-directional glycodendrimer. Binding studies via double immunodiffusion and/or turbidimetric analysis confirmed the ability of the glycodendrimers to cross-link and precipitate appropriate model lectins. In addition, when used in competitive enzyme linked lectin assays, all glycodendrimers showed improved inhibitory potentials...|$|E
