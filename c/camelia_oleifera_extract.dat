However, Histopathology {{is a function of}} toxicity test to determine the safety level of exposure to toxicants in aquatic environment. Histopathological lesions in the gills of Oreochromis niloticus juveniles were assessed after 12 -week exposure to fresh root-bark cold water <b>extract</b> of Moringa <b>oleifera</b> at chronic-sublethal concentrations of 0, 3 and 6 mg l− 1, where 0 mg l− 1 served as the control group. Gills of O. niloticus juveniles exposed to 3 and 6 mg l− 1 were collected and processed in an absolute ethanol along with the control group. They were later transferred and stained with haematoxylin and eosin according to the standard routine histological methods. Histopathological changes were recorded in the gills of Oreochromis niloticus juveniles exposed to chronic sublethal concentrations of M. <b>oleifera</b> fresh root-bark <b>extract</b> after 12 -week exposure. After long exposure to the M. <b>oleifera</b> <b>extract,</b> major histopathological changes that occurred during the exposure were, gill lesions, gill arches vacuolation, lamellar hyperemia, complete degeneration of lamellae and reduction in the contents of all parts of gills. There were no lesions in gills of control fish as sign of histopathological changes. Moringa oleifera is toxic even at sublethal concentrations to freshwater fish, O. niloticus juveniles.

40|$|Problem statement: At present, the {{therapeutic}} outcome of cerebral ischemia {{is still not}} in the satisfaction level. Therefore, the preventive strategy is considered. Based on the protective effect against oxidative damage of Moringa <b>oleifera</b> Lam. Leaves <b>extract,</b> we hypothesized that this plant extract might protect against cerebral ischemia, one of the challenge problems nowadays. In order to test this hypothesis, we aimed to determine the protective effect of M. <b>oleifera</b> leaves <b>extract</b> in animal model of focal cerebral ischemia induced by permanent occlusion of right middle cerebral artery. Approach: Male Wistar rats, weighing 300 - 350 g, were orally given the extract once daily at doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg kg - 1 BW at a period of 2 weeks, then, they were permanently occluded the right Middle Cerebral Artery (MCAO). The animals were assessed the cerebral infarction volume and oxidative damage markers including MDA level and the activities of SOD, CAT and GSHPx enzymes at 24 h after occlusion. Results: Rats subjected to M. <b>oleifera</b> <b>extract</b> at all doses {{used in this study}} significantly decreased brain infarct volume both at cortical and subcortical structures in accompany with the elevation of SOD activity in both hippocampus and striatum while only the rats exposed to the extract at doses of 100 and 400 mg kg - 1 BW showed the increased GSHPx activity in hippocampus. No the changes were observed. Therefore, our results demonstrates the potential benefit of M. oleifera leaves to decrease oxidative stress damage and brain infarct volume. Conclusion: This study is the first study to demonstrate the neuroprotective effect against focal cerebral ischemia of M. oleifera leaves. It suggests that M. oleifera may be served as natural resource for developing neuroprotectant against focal cerebral ischemia. However, the precise underlying mechanism and possible active ingredient are still required further study...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the effect of ethanol leaf-extracts of Ficus capensis and Moringa oleifera on some haematological indices in normal albino rats. Forty albino rats were randomly assigned to four experimental groups A, B, C and D. Group A with 5 rats received water and feed only and served as the positive control. Group B with five rats received feed, water and astyfer (multivitamin) and served as standard control. Groups C and D were sub divided into 3 groups designated as C 1, C 2, C 3, D 1, D 2 and D 3 with 5 rats each. The two sub-groups were administered twice daily of the ethanol leaf-extracts of Ficus capensis and Moringa oleifera at the doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg. Haematological indices were determined by standard methods. The result of the study showed a significant (P< 0. 05) increase in the mean body weight of the albino rats in groups that received the extracts and multivitamin. The result also revealed a significant (P < 0. 05) increments in the levels of haemoglobin(Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell counts in the groups administered with ethanol leaf-extracts of Ficus capensis and Moringa oleifera relative to positive control. A significant (p< 0. 05) increase in PCV and Hb levels in albino rats administered ethanol leaf-extract of Moringa oleifera in a dose dependent manner relative to groups administered ethanol leaf extract of Ficus capensis except in WBC and RBC where a significant (p< 0. 05) increase was recorded in those groups administered Ficus capensis ethanol leaf extract relative to groups administered Moringa <b>oleifera</b> <b>extract.</b> Generally there was no significant (p< 0. 05) effect on the haematological indices in rats administered ethanol leaf extract of Ficus capensis relative to rats administered Moringa <b>oleifera</b> <b>extract.</b> This confirms the use of Ficus capensis and Moringa oleifera in ethno-medicine to boast blood for anaemic patient and pregnant women.

40|$|Moringa oleifera Lam (Moringaceae) is {{promising}} plant for biomedicine applications {{because it has}} an impressive range of medicinal purposes with high nutritional value. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic effect of Moringa <b>oleifera</b> leaf <b>extract</b> (MOLE) on Ehrlich's solid tumor implanted mice (EST-mice). Swiss male albino mice were implanted intramuscularly with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC). Three doses of MOLE extract (125, 250 and 500 mg kg- 1) were administrated to EST-mice for 14 days. The standard drug vincristine (VCR) was i. p injected (0. 1 mg kg 1 -) after the implantation of EST. The antitumor activity of MOLE was assessed using several tumor markers. Modulating activity of MOLE against EST was evaluated using comet assay, micronucleus test and morphological apoptotic changes as well as DNA fragmentation assay. The expression analysis of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and apoptosis related genes (p 53, p 21 and bcl 2) were evaluated. Treatment of EST-mice with the highest dose of MOLE exhibited inhibition of tumor growth and the tumor markers in solid tumor. MOLE inhibited the apoptotic/necrotic cells, decrease of micronucleus formation and DNA damage in EST-mice. Expression of iNOS, VEGF, p 53 mutation, p 21 and bcl 2 genes in EST-mice were significantly over-expressed compared with control group. These observations were markedly inhibited with the highest dose of <b>extract.</b> Moringa <b>oleifera</b> leaf <b>extract</b> revealed antitumor, antigenotoxic and anticytotoxic activities in EST-mice.

40|$|Moringa oleifera Lam. is an {{important}} plant with huge medicinal potentials. This study is aim at investigating the effect of leaf <b>extract</b> of Moringa <b>oleifera</b> on some haematological parameters in salt loaded albino Wistar rats. A total of twenty four (24) male albino Wistar rats weighing between 200 to 250 g {{were used for the}} experiment and were divided into four groups of six rats each. They were given either normal rat feed and drinking water, high salt diet (8 % NaCl diet) + 1 % NaCl drinking water and/or Moringa <b>oleifera</b> <b>extract</b> (600 mg/kg b. w., orally, once daily). The feeding regimens lasted for six weeks. After an overnight fast, blood was collected and analyzed for hematological parameters. The salt fed untreated rats had significant (p< 0. 05) increase in red blood cell count (RBC) and packed cell volume (PCV), (P< 0. 01). These parameters were significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced to near control values following extract treatment. Salt fed untreated rats were observed to have significant (p< 0. 05) reduction in total white blood cell count (TWBC) and platelet (PLT) count (P< 0. 01), but the reverse was the case following extract treatment. In conclusion consumption of Moringa <b>oleifera</b> leaf <b>extract</b> ameliorates the adverse effects of salt loading on the blood cells.
