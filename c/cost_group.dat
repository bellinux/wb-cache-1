40|$|To {{identify}} {{factors that}} contribute to regional differences in medical expenses, this study divided all prefectures into three groups of high, medium, and low medical costs according to the degree of medical expenses for each elderly in each prefecture. Medical expenses for the elderly in each prefecture were analyzed based on medical expense-related data and eight indexes: “number of hospital beds,” “enrollment limit in long-term care insurance facilities,” “number of physicians,” “number of public health nurses,” “average family size,” “owned housing ratio,” “annual health examination ratio,” and “annual prefectural income. ” The findings are as follows: There is little difference in outpatient expenses among the three groups. Inpatient expenses are higher with the high medical <b>costs</b> <b>group,</b> with a large difference between outpatient and inpatient expenses. This demonstrates that the degree of inpatient expenses is the cause of regional differences. Based on results of a multiple regression analysis performed on each <b>group,</b> the <b>cost</b> structure varies depending on the factors affecting a given group. For the high/medium medical <b>costs</b> <b>groups,</b> the factors causing an increase in medical expenses are the “number of hospital beds” and “enrollment limit in long-term care insurance facility,” while “owned housing ratio” and “number of public health nurses” show lower expenses. Thus, intervention in social/financial problems is also needed. The cost structure for the low medical <b>costs</b> <b>group</b> cannot be explained by analyzing the eight indexes, and it is thought that more complex factors are involved. This indicates that a reduction in “number of hospital beds” is not a consideration for moderating medical expenses. 本研究では都道府県別の１人あたり老人医療費の多寡で３グループ化し、老人医療費の地域差に影響を及ぼす要因を明らかにし、医療費の適正化について検討することを目的とした。老人医療費関連のデータと、「病床数」「介護保険施設定員」「医師数」「保健師数」「世帯平均人員」「持ち家比率」「基本健診受診率」「年間県民所得」の８指標で分析を行った。その結果、外来費は３群間の差は小さかったが、入院費は高額群ほど高く外来費との差が拡大しており、入院費の多寡が都道府県格差を生み出す原因とされた。群ごとに重回帰分析した結果、費用構造は群によって異なり高・中額群では「病床数」や「介護保険施設定員」が老人医療費の増加要因、「持ち家比率」「保健師数」は減少要因とされ、社会・経済的な問題への介入も必要とされた。低額群は８指標では費用構造が説明されず複雑な原因が関係していると考えられ、「病床数」の削減が医療費適正化の視点ではないことが示唆された...|$|R

5000|$|Debate {{over whether}} other-helping {{behavior}} {{is motivated by}} self- or other interest has raged over the last 20 years. The prime actors in this debate are Daniel Batson arguing for empathy-altruism and Robert Cialdini arguing for self-interest.However, Batson recognized that people sometimes helped out of selfish reasons. He and his team were interested in finding ways to distinguish between motives. In one experiment, {{students were asked to}} listen to tapes from a radio program. One of the interviews was with a woman named Carol, who talked about her bad car accident in which both of her legs were broken, her struggles and how behind she was becoming in class. Students who were listening to this particular interview were given a letter asking the student to share lecture notes and meet with her. The experimenters changed the level of empathy by telling one group to try to focus on how she was feeling (high empathy level) and the other group not to be concerned with that (low empathy level). The experimenters also varied the cost of not helping: the high <b>cost</b> <b>group</b> was told that Carol would be in their psychology class after returning to school and the low <b>cost</b> <b>group</b> believed she would finish the class at home. The results confirmed the empathy-altruism hypothesis: those in the high empathy group were almost equally as likely to help her in either circumstance, while the low empathy group helped out of self-interest. Seeing her in class every day made them feel guilty if they did not help (Batson & Toi, 1982).|$|E

40|$|Two theories, {{which have}} been {{hypothesized}} to mediate acquisition in daily time-place learning (TPL) tasks were investigated: the Response-Cost (RC) hypothesis and the Species-Typical Behaviours (STB) hypothesis. According to the RC hypothesis, rats only learn daily TPL tasks if there is high cost in either effort or time for making an incorrect choice. According to the STB hypothesis, rats learn the daily TPL tasks, however the intrusion of species typical behaviours such as patrolling mask evidence of this learning. Two experiments tested the validity of these hypotheses. Rats were trained that one lever {{at the end of}} one choice arm of a T-maze provided food in the morning and six hours later a lever in the other choice arm provided food. In Experiment 1, two groups tested the RC theory by manipulating the density of the reinforcement schedule used. A third group tested the importance of the STB by giving the rats time to patrol the maze prior to the start of the experiment. If only first arm choice data were considered there was little evidence of learning. However, both first press and percentage of presses on the correct lever, revealed of TPL in all groups tested. Unexpectedly, the low response <b>cost</b> <b>group</b> performed better than the high response <b>cost</b> <b>group</b> and the species typical behaviour group performed the worst. To control for the fact that the high response <b>cost</b> <b>group</b> was on the maze for a longer period of time than the rats in the other two groups, a second experiment was conducted. Experiment 2 also used a low response <b>cost</b> <b>group</b> and a species typical behaviour group, except these animals remained on the maze for the same amount of time as the rats in the high response <b>cost</b> <b>group</b> from Experiment 1.

This article aims to propose a budgetary setup for operating costs using the methods of ABC/ABM (Activity Based Costing/Activity Based Management) in state organisational units (SOU). Essence of the proposed procedure towards budgetary setup as well as cost management is specification of such cost drivers that reflect the causal link between activities of the given organisation and indirect operating costs. Through a system of linear equations there is in turn resolved parity between demands on budgetary funding of a specific activity and full costs of activities.
