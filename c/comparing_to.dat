5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when <b>comparing</b> <b>to</b> a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E
5|$|Sabah's {{economy is}} mainly based on primary sector such as agriculture, {{forestry}} and petroleum. Currently, the tertiary sector {{plays an important}} part to the state economy, especially in tourism and services. With its richness in biodiversity, the state is offering ecotourism. Although {{in recent years the}} tourism industry has been affected by attacks and kidnapping of tourists by militant groups based in the southern Philippines, it remained stable with the increase of security in eastern Sabah and the Sulu Sea. The tourism sector contribute 10% share of the state GDP and was predicted to increase more. Majority of the tourists come from China (60.3%), followed by South Korea (33.9%), Australia (16.3%) and Taiwan (8.3%). Since the 1950s, rubber and copra are the main source of agricultural economy of North Borneo. The timber industry start to emerged in the 1960s due to high demand of raw materials from industrial countries. This was however replaced by petroleum in the 1970s after the discovery of oil in the area of west coast Sabah. In the same year, cocoa and palm oil was added to the list. The Sabah state government managed to increase the state fund from RM6million to RM12billion and poverty was down by almost half to 33.1% in 1980. The state rapid development on primary sector has attracted those job seekers in neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines as the state labour force itself are not sufficient. The state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the time ranked behind Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, being the third richest although the manufacturing sector remained small. However, by 2000, the state started to become the poorest as it still dependent on natural resources as its primary sources of income <b>comparing</b> <b>to</b> those secondary sector producer states. Thus the Sabah Development Corridor (SDC) was established in 2008 by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi with a total investment of RM105billion for 18 years to increase the state GDP to RM63.2billion by 2025. Around RM5.83billion were allocated each year for infrastructures development along with the creation of 900,000 jobs. The federal government targeted to eradicate hardcore poverty by the end Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP) with overall poverty halved from 23% in 2004 to 12% in 2010 and 8.1% in 2012. Since its establishment in 2008, the state GDP increase to 10.7% which was higher than the national economic growth of 4.8% and the world economic growth of 2.7%. Following the world financial crisis in 2009, Sabah GDP recorded 4.8% growth compared to −1.5% for national level and −0.4% for world level.|$|E

30|$|From Table 1, it {{is clear}} that SGO {{provides}} better optimal results in as many as 12 functions <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> GA, 5 functions <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> PSO, 4 functions <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> DE, 3 functions <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> ABC and 2 functions <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> TLBO. It can be arrived at a conclusion here that SGO is very competitive <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> ABC and especially with TLBO. However, we have noted that SGO is faster when <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> other algorithms. It takes 1 / 500 th function evaluations <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> GA, PSO, DE and ABC for all functions except for Rosenbrock wherein it takes 1 / 50 th of total function evaluations. And it is computing almost in half of the total function evaluations <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> TLBO except for Rosenbrock for which SGO takes 1 / 5 th number of function evaluation as against TLBO. From the above findings, we may arrive at a conclusion that our proposed algorithm not only performs better <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> many state-of-the art algorithms like GA, PSO, DE but also very competitive with ABC and TLBO in providing optimal solutions. Importantly, SGO takes less computation efforts <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> all other algorithms investigated in this section.|$|R
