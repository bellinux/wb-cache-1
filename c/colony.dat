5|$|Both {{independent}} and dependent <b>colony</b> foundation can occur after mating. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns {{have been recorded}} with M. pilosula queens, where nests that tend to be closer together were more genetically {{related to each other}} in comparison to other nests further away. Independent <b>colony</b> foundation is closely associated with queens which engage in nuptial flight in areas far from their home <b>colony,</b> showing that dependent <b>colony</b> foundation mostly occurs if they mate near their nest. In some cases, queens could seek adoption into alien colonies if there are no suitable areas to find a nest or independent <b>colony</b> foundation cannot be carried out. Other queens could try and return to their home nest after nuptial flight, but they may end up in another nest near the nest they originally came from. In multiple-queen societies, the egg-laying queens are generally unrelated to one another, but one study showed that it is possible for multiple queens in the same <b>colony</b> to be genetically related to each other. Depending on the species, the number of individuals present in a <b>colony</b> can range from 50 to over 2,200 individuals. A <b>colony</b> with less than 100 workers is not considered a mature <b>colony.</b> M. dispar colonies have around 15 to 329 ants, M. nigrocincta have over 1,000, M. pyriformis have from 200 to over 1,400 and M. gulosa have nearly 1,600. A <b>colony</b> can last for a number of years. Foraging behaviour among smaller workers which never usually leave the nest can be a sign of a colony's impending demise.|$|E

Absconding day {{did not differ significantly}} between treatment or bee race but absconding was greater between the two treatments in European <b>colonies</b> than in Cape ones. Cape bees used significantly more propolis than European bees. Honey stores were significantly greater in Cape honey bee <b>colonies</b> than in European ones. Bee weight did not differ significantly between treatments or bee race. Treatment did not significantly affect bee populations, brood area, or average flight activity in Cape <b>colonies</b> but it did significantly lower all of these in European <b>colonies.</b> The effects of treatment in European <b>colonies</b> are symptomatic of absconding preparation.

40|$|Extensive {{bleaching}} of corals {{occurred at}} Heron Island Reef during the 1998 mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Two hundred coral <b>colonies</b> were labelled and sampled on the reef flat at Heron Island in March 1998 (when approximately 80 % of corals {{growing in the}} intertidal reef flat were bleached). These included both bleached and unbleached <b>colonies</b> of many species. Bleached <b>colonies</b> of all sampled species had lower densities of symbiotic dinoflagellates and lower chlorophyll a concentrations per surface area of coral tissue than unbleached <b>colonies.</b> Samples of the <b>colonies</b> were decalcified and polyps dissected to determine fecundity. There were significantly fewer eggs present in the bleached than unbleached <b>colonies</b> in all sampled species. In many species, no eggs {{were present in the}} bleached <b>colonies.</b> Eggs that were present were also significantly smaller in the bleached than the unbleached <b>colonies</b> of the majority of species sampled. There were also significantly fewer polyps containing eggs and testes in the bleached than the unbleached <b>colonies.</b> The percentage of tissue made up by lipids in the bleached <b>colonies</b> was significantly lower than that of the unbleached <b>colonies</b> in some species. By July 1998, 23 % of the sampled <b>colonies</b> had died and many of the previously bleached <b>colonies</b> had regained their colour, suggesting visually that they had recovered. However, previously bleached <b>colonies</b> in November 1998 still had fewer eggs and reproductive polyps than <b>colonies</b> that had been previously unbleached. In July of the following year, {{in the middle of the}} Australian winter, many of the corals that had bleached the year before bleached again and more <b>colonies</b> had died. In contrast, none of the previously unbleached <b>colonies</b> bleached at this time. In November 1999, just prior to the spawning period, there were large areas of coral on the reef slope that were noticeably pale. These pale <b>colonies</b> were sampled along with adjacent normally pigmented corals and the pale <b>colonies</b> were almost entirely devoid of eggs. During the 1998 bleaching event approximately 80 % of the reef slope <b>colonies</b> were bleached, so it is likely that these pale <b>colonies</b> were previously bleached <b>colonies.</b> These data suggest that bleaching has adverse and long-lasting effects on coral reproduction and that previously bleached <b>colonies</b> may be more susceptible to future stress...|$|R
