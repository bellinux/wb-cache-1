5|$|The {{range of}} {{structural}} and biochemical effects that viruses {{have on the}} host cell is extensive. These are called <b>cytopathic</b> effects. Most virus infections eventually result {{in the death of}} the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis, alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis. Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activities because of suppression by virus-specific proteins, not all of which are components of the virus particle.|$|E
25|$|C. difficile toxins have a <b>cytopathic</b> {{effect in}} cell culture, and {{neutralization}} of any effect observed with specific antisera is the practical {{gold standard for}} studies investigating new CDI diagnostic techniques. Toxigenic culture, in which organisms are cultured on selective media and tested for toxin production, remains the gold standard and is the most sensitive and specific test, although it is slow and labor-intensive.|$|E
500|$|The {{range of}} {{structural}} and biochemical effects that viruses {{have on the}} host cell is extensive. These are called <b>cytopathic</b> effects. Most virus infections eventually result {{in the death of}} the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis (bursting), alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis (cell [...] "suicide"). Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activity due to proteins produced by the virus, not all of which are components of the virus particle.|$|E
2500|$|Cytocidal {{infections are}} often {{associated}} with changes in cell morphology, physiology and are thus important for the complete viral replication and transformation. [...] <b>Cytopathic</b> Effects, often include a change in cell's morphology such as fusion with adjacent cells to form polykaryocytes {{as well as the}} synthesis of nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. [...] Physiological changes include the insufficient movement of ions, formation of secondary messengers, and activation of cellular cascades to continue cellular activity. [...] Biochemically, many viruses inhibit the synthesis of host DNA, RNA, proteins directly or even interfere with protein-protein, DNA-protein, RNA-protein interactions at the subcellular level. [...] Genotoxicity involves breaking, fragmenting, or rearranging chromosomes of the host. [...] Lastly, biologic effects include the viruses' ability to affect the activity of antigens and immunologlobulins in the host cell.|$|E
50|$|Collectively, {{these types}} of changes are called a <b>cytopathic</b> effect; various types of <b>cytopathic</b> effect {{can be seen in}} many {{different}} cell types infected by many different types of virus.|$|E

50|$|The {{virus has}} been {{investigated}} for its antitumor capabilities, as {{it is capable of}} replicating within breast cancer cell lines and producing a <b>cytopathic</b> effect in human monocytes.|$|E
50|$|BVDV strains can {{be further}} divided into {{distinct}} biotypes (<b>cytopathic</b> or non-cytopathic) according to their effects on tissue cell culture; <b>cytopathic</b> (cp) biotypes, formed via mutation of non-cytopathic (ncp) biotypes, induce apoptosis in cultured cells. Ncp viruses can induce persistent infection in cells and have an intact NS2/3 protein. In cp viruses the NS2/3 protein is either cleaved to NS2 and NS3 or there is a duplication of viral RNA containing an additional NS3 region. The majority of BVDV infections {{in the field are}} caused by the ncp biotype.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these functions NS1 enhances transcription from a viral capsid promoter, may assist in packing DNA into newly formed capsids and {{is responsible for the}} <b>cytopathic</b> effect of parvoviruses.|$|E
50|$|The {{virus is}} shown to have a <b>cytopathic</b> effect on both human(HeLa) and monkey (vero)cells. As part of the minimal {{research}} that has been done, death occurred in mice that were infected with the virus.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the virus}} has <b>cytopathic</b> effects in productively {{infected}} cells, this effect may not directly contribute to HIV pathogenesis (see above). Importantly, the virus can remain inactive (latent) in these productively infected cells for long periods.|$|E

50|$|Many enteroviruses are {{referred}} to as ECHO, enteric <b>cytopathic</b> human orphan viruses, because they were originally not associated with any disease. Even though many of them are associated with severe diseases, the name ECHO still continues to be used.|$|E
50|$|The virus can {{be grown}} in cell culture but <b>cytopathic</b> effects may be absent. Acidophilic, intracytoplasmic {{inclusion}} bodies may be visible in biopsies or post mortem material. Replication is cytoplasmic and the virons mature by budding from plasma membrane.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{culture is}} a {{laboratory}} test in which samples are placed with a cell type that the virus being tested for is able to infect. If the cells show changes, known as <b>cytopathic</b> effects, then the culture is positive.|$|E

50|$|The Aichivirus A {{formerly}} Aichi virus (AiV) is a small, round, <b>cytopathic</b> positive {{sense and}} ssRNA virus. Originally identified after a 1989 outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in the Aichi Prefecture, probably linked to raw oyster, genetic analysis has classified it {{as belonging to}} the family Picornaviridae, genus Kobuvirus.|$|E
50|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{potential of}} oncolytic virotherapy {{is not a}} simple consequence of the <b>cytopathic</b> effect but strongly relies on the induction of an endogenous immune response against transformed cells. Superior anticancer effects have been observed when oncolytic viruses are engineered to express (or be co-administered with) immunostimulatory molecules such as GM-CSF.|$|E
50|$|An ECHO (enteric <b>cytopathic</b> human orphan) {{virus is}} a type of RNA virus that belongs to the species Enterovirus B, genus Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family. Echoviruses are found in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract (hence it being part of the enterovirus genus) and exposure to the virus causes other opportunistic infections and diseases.|$|E
50|$|The first {{confirmed}} case {{was reported in}} Saudi Arabia in 2012. Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from the man's lungs. Dr. Zaki then posted his findings on 24 September 2012 on ProMED-mail. The isolated cells showed <b>cytopathic</b> effects (CPE), {{in the form of}} rounding and syncytia formation.|$|E
50|$|Enterovirus E (formerly bovine {{enterovirus}} (BEV)) is a picornavirus of {{the genus}} Enterovirus. The virus may also {{be referred to as}} enteric <b>cytopathic</b> bovine orphan virus (ECBO). It is endemic in cattle populations worldwide, and although normally fairly nonpathogenic, it can cause reproductive, respiratory, or enteric disease - particularly when the animal is concurrently infected with another pathogen.|$|E
50|$|Human virus {{types that}} can be {{identified}} by viral culture include adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella zoster virus, measles and mumps. For these, the final identification method is generally by immunofluorescence, with exception of cytomegalovirus and rhinovirus, whose identification in a viral culture are determined by <b>cytopathic</b> effects.|$|E
50|$|Human {{foamy virus}} (HFV) is a {{retrovirus}} and specifically {{belongs to the}} genus Spumavirus. The spumaviruses are complex and {{significantly different from the}} other six genera of retroviruses in several ways. The foamy viruses derive their name from the characteristic ‘foamy’ appearance of the <b>cytopathic</b> effect (CPE) induced in the cells.Foamy virus in humans occurs only as a result of zoonotic infection.|$|E
5000|$|The Eilat virus {{shows an}} {{evolutionary}} change {{which may have}} occurred to alphaviruses. Normally, an alphavirus {{similar to that of}} the EILV would use mosquitoes as the vector of transmission to other (usually vertebrates) creatures. However, the Eilat virus can replicate consummately in an insect host and fails completely to even enter the cells of vertebrates. Based on experimental evidence when a relativity similar virus (SINV) was injected into vertebrate cell lines, the cells showed to have a great <b>cytopathic</b> effect. While when the same test was done on the EILV, the virus showed no <b>cytopathic</b> effect on the vertebrate cell lines. [...] Therefore, evolutionary these results aid in suggesting that EILV lost its capability in infecting vertebrate cells. Thus, EILV appears to be mosquito-specific and represents a previously undescribed complex within the genus Alphavirus. Reverse genetic studies of EILV may help in the discovery of determinants of alphavirus host range which balances disease emergence.http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22908261 ...|$|E
