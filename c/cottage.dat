5|$|Modern <b>cottage</b> garden {{plants are}} {{typically}} flowers chosen for their old-fashioned and informal appeal. Many modern day gardeners use heirloom or 'old-fashioned' plants and varieties—even though these {{may not have}} been authentic or traditional <b>cottage</b> garden plants. In addition, there are modern varieties of flowers that fit into the <b>cottage</b> garden look. For example, modern roses developed by David Austin have been chosen for <b>cottage</b> gardens because of their old-fashioned look (multi-petaled form and rosette-shaped flowers) and fragrance—combined with modern virtues of hardiness, repeat blooming, and disease-resistance. Modern <b>cottage</b> gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the local climate, rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environment—though many of the old favorites thrive in <b>cottage</b> gardens throughout the world.|$|E

Another old fragrant <b>cottage</b> garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|E
