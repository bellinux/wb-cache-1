50|$|With {{the rules}} {{governing}} inter-planar travel, characters can move from plane to plane via portals, elemental vortices, and astral conduits. A vortex works like a doorway; a conduit {{is nothing more than}} a tunnel. Depending upon the parameters of the campaign, players may choose from the standard AD&D game archetypes, including humans, dwarves, and halflings, or opt for planar races, such as bariaur, githzerai, and tieflings. A player also may assign his PC to one of the character factions, which derive from philosophies and alignments, and most factions accept every <b>class.</b> <b>Wizard</b> and priest spells are affected in different ways based on the caster's location.|$|E
5000|$|In The Bard's Tale, {{the wizard}} was only {{available}} as a class change from another magic-user <b>class.</b> The <b>wizard</b> <b>class</b> was the most advanced class level, with the character needing to master the third level of spells from {{at least two other}} magic-user classes.|$|R
50|$|With Wizards Presents: Races and <b>Classes,</b> <b>Wizards</b> of the Coast {{presented}} {{its first}} {{preview of the}} 4th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Written by the new edition's designers, Races and Classes explores the concepts and decisions that went into creating the new version, in terms of mechanics, art and ideas.

50|$|Wizards' Realm is {{a fantasy}} {{system with a}} simplified, back-to-basics approach. Character {{creation}} employs a class-and-level system; <b>classes</b> include <b>wizards,</b> spellcasters, knights, and anti-paladins. The combat system is quite simple. The game includes maps, a sample town, and an introductory scenario.|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} with the wizard exam of second <b>class</b> jr. <b>wizard</b> Ben Muzzy. Things go awry when he accidentally teleports himself to a mysterious forest. There he meets twins named Gemma and Joel who pledge to help the lost wizard find his way back home.|$|R
5000|$|In Nox, {{there are}} <b>Wizard</b> and Conjurer <b>classes.</b> The <b>Wizard</b> has {{a variety of}} attack and utility spells {{including}} teleportation effects, invisibility and invulnerability. The Conjurer specializes in summoning creatures to fight. It has more effective healing and protection spells, and uses bows and crossbows in combination with offensive spell-casting.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout D&D history, {{up to and}} {{including}} the third edition Player's Handbook, spellcaster gnomes were either illusionists or had illusionist as their favored class. [...] However, in Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5, gnomes' favored class has been changed to bard, as the favored class of [...] "illusionist" [...] was a subset of the <b>wizard</b> <b>class.</b> The <b>wizard</b> favored <b>class</b> was also already used by elves. In D&D v.3.5, gnomes are inventors and alchemists who love pranks and excel at engineering. The tinker gnomes of Dragonlance are mechanically skilled, though their devices are quite prone to backfiring. It has been suggested that gnomes be given the Eberron class artificer as a favored class, due to their technical aptitude.|$|R
5000|$|Players {{have the}} option of playing one of four professions, with no more than three {{characters}} per server. Professions range from Taoist, healers who use magical and melee attacks. This is the support class of mir and not suited to solo game play. Taoists can summon pets to assist in battle, poison targets and heal. Warriors, who are the [...] "tanks" [...] of Mir use melee attacks and have the highest defense and attack attributes of all <b>classes.</b> <b>Wizards</b> depend on magic and can kill multiple monsters with ease using AoE spells. Wizards have low health and defense against physical damage and are especially weak against higher level warrior magic attacks. Assassins have taken over as the primary melee damage dealing class but have much weaker defense attributes than warriors. Conversely this instead of undermining the warrior class, has strengthened its position and clarified its role as the 'tank'.|$|R
50|$|The sorcerer {{class was}} {{introduced}} in third edition as being separate from the <b>wizard</b> <b>class,</b> having {{more in common with}} contemporary fantasy fiction than the Vancian spell system. Sorcerers were introduced in the 3rd edition Player's Handbook, and updated in the 3.5 edition Player's Handbook.|$|R
50|$|Volga Montor (age 13): <b>Wizard</b> <b>class</b> character. Velga's {{twin brother}} who, unlike his sister, is often very quiet and {{less prone to}} making rash decisions. As {{a student of the}} magic arts, Volga is able to call upon the very {{elements}} of the world to aid him in battle.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a ninja was {{presented}} in 3rd edition as a prestige class titled the Master Ninja and went on as further prestige classes like the Ninja Spy from the 3rd edition Oriental Adventures. The first ninja base <b>class</b> produced by <b>Wizards</b> of the Coast made its debut in the Complete Adventurer supplemental book.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically {{the class}} is most similar to the <b>wizard</b> core <b>class.</b> The class {{provides}} no armor proficiencies and the worst attack progression. However, it offers a devastating and broad mix of spells. Compared with the <b>wizard</b> <b>class,</b> the wu jen class's spells are more limited (and {{in some specific cases}} weaker) however it benefits from some free meta-magic options.|$|R
50|$|Champions: Return to Arms {{features}} multiple character <b>classes,</b> such as <b>wizard,</b> cleric, ranger, and warrior. The game {{also features}} an online mode where a player can join {{up to three}} other players from around the world. Gameplay consists of killing monsters and completing quests to earn experience, in a traditional hack-and-slash style. When the character attains enough experience, he or she gains a level.|$|R
5000|$|Clerics of Talos {{celebrate}} Talassan festivals with ceremonies that summon {{lightning and}} storms. Their most sacred ritual, Calling Down the Thunder, involves {{the sacrifice of}} an intelligent being by lightning. The most frequent cleric ritual is the Fury, in which the cleric prays, makes berserk attacks to wreak as much destruction as possible in {{a small amount of}} time, then prays again. Clerics of Talos are nicknamed [...] "doom crows" [...] because of their formal dress: they wear black robes and cloaks shot through with teardrops and jagged lines of gold and silver. High clergy wear blue-white ceremonial robes streaked with crimson. All clerics wear an eye patch. Talassan clerics generally multiclass to barbarian, sorcerer, the stormlord prestige <b>class,</b> and <b>wizard.</b>|$|R
50|$|Heroes of the Fallen Lands {{includes}} new builds {{and character}} {{options for the}} cleric, fighter, rogue, and <b>wizard</b> <b>classes.</b> Each class comes {{with a set of}} new powers, class features, paragon paths, epic destinies, and more that beginning and experienced players can use to build their characters. In addition to new builds, this book presents expanded information and racial traits for some of the game's races, including dwarves, eladrin, elves, halflings, and humans.|$|R
50|$|This {{product line}} debuted in September 2010 and {{consisted}} of ten products intended to lower the barrier of entry into the game. Essentials uses the D&D 4th edition rule set and provides simple player character options intended for first-time players. Many of the new player character options emulated features from previous editions, such as schools of magic for the <b>wizard</b> <b>class,</b> as to appeal to older players who had not adopted 4th edition.|$|R
50|$|In Advanced d20 Magic each spell in the SRD is {{assigned}} a Difficulty Class. This Difficulty Class is nominally {{based on the}} <b>Wizard</b> <b>class</b> in the Dungeons & Dragons game, and the base difficulty class ranges from 10 for 0-level spells, to 51 for 9th level spells. These DCs are further modified by other properties of the spellâ€”whether or not if they require time to cast the spell or material components in the regular Vancian system.|$|R
50|$|When {{beginning}} the game, the player may create {{up to six}} player characters, chosen from among the following classes: bard, hunter, monk, paladin, rogue, warrior, magician, and conjurer. The <b>classes</b> sorcerer and <b>wizard</b> were available to experienced conjurers and magicians. A typical well-balanced party might consist {{of a couple of}} fighters, a rogue, a bard, and a couple of magic users. On some platforms, the player could import previously created characters from Wizardry and/or Ultima III, which was somewhat revolutionary at the time.|$|R
50|$|As {{revealed}} in an advertisement {{in the trade}} publication ICv2 and later confirmed by Mark Rosewater in his column, Morningtide expands upon Lorwyn flavor and theme by focusing on at least five <b>classes</b> (Soldiers, Shamans, <b>Wizards,</b> Warriors, and Rogues) {{as well as a}} few minor class-based tribes (Druids, Archers, Knights, Clerics, and Assassins) in addition to the eight races of Lorwyn (Kithkin, Merfolk, Faeries, Elementals and Greater, Goblins, Giants, Treefolk, and Elves). Additionally, three new mechanics were keyworded with this expansion, namely; Prowl, Reinforce, and Kinship.|$|R
5000|$|Alex and Justin {{are sent}} back to level one in the wizard {{competition}} after [...] "exposing" [...] wizardry in [...] "Alex Tells the World", leaving Max as the most expected to become the family wizard. In [...] "Alex Gives Up", Alex quits the competition, but eventually decides {{to stay in the}} competition in [...] "Journey to the Center of Mason" [...] to be with Mason. Before then, Harper tries to get Alex to enjoy life without wizardry. Meanwhile, Justin tries to tutor a <b>class</b> of delinquent <b>wizards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the first}} edition, the Player's Handbook has {{contained}} tables and rules for creating characters, {{lists of the}} abilities of the different character classes, the properties and costs of equipment, descriptions of spells that magic-using character <b>classes</b> (such as <b>wizards</b> or clerics) can cast, and numerous other rules governing gameplay. Both the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Player's Handbook give advice, tips, and suggestions for various styles of play. [...] The Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual make up the core D&D rulebooks.|$|R
5000|$|Section 9 is radically {{reformed}} {{after the}} Major leaves {{in order to}} pursue investigations of her own. The section has increased in size, and is now run by Togusa because Batou declined the position. Solid State Society initially focuses on the cyberbrain suicides of members of a terrorist organization that gained asylum in Japan. This case leads to the discovery that around twenty thousand children may have been abducted. The mastermind behind the crimes is known as [...] "The Puppeteer," [...] and is classified as a Super <b>Wizard</b> <b>Class</b> Hacker.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{differences}} abound, but {{reflect the}} 4th Edition rules. For example, in Second Edition defilers were a separate <b>wizard</b> <b>class.</b> In 4th Edition {{there are many}} arcane classes, so defiling became an at-will power applicable when using daily arcane powers. Elemental priests are now a new Shaman build, the Animist Shaman. Elemental worship {{is tied to the}} Primal power source, because the Divine power source (which includes clerics and paladins) is unavailable to player characters by default. Finally, non-metal weapons and armor are considered the baselines for 4e Dark Sun characters. Metal weapons, however, are more durable and less prone to breakage.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the game the players can choose between three {{different}} character <b>classes</b> - Dark <b>Wizard,</b> Dark Knight, Elf. Players can unlock a Magic Gladiator and a Dark Lord as they progress. Also, character cards can be purchased in order to use three more character classes -Summoner, Rage Fighter and Grow Lancer. Each class has its specific powers and items. As characters level up and complete quests, they can transform themselves into stronger classes. Each progressive class change grants, gain access to new spells, skills, weapons and wings as well as an associated change in appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Rolemaster: Magestorm (since 2001, Magestorm Millennium) was an online-only first-person shooter using magical spells as weapons. It was {{developed}} in 1996 by Interworld Productions (now Mythic Entertainment). It centered on team-based gameplay and included some role-playing video game elements, notably the character class and level-based systems. The four character <b>classes</b> were the <b>Wizard,</b> Psionic, [...] and Healer; but prior to Magestorm Millennium, the character classes were named as Magician, Mentalist, Arcanist and Cleric, respectively. A character could gain experience points by hitting other players and raise up to level 30. Each gained level gave spell picks which allowed to unlock new spells.|$|R
5000|$|Champions of the Mists {{provides}} {{notes on}} how the various character classes interact with the Ravenloft setting, and the book provides new character class kits, {{and a number of}} NPCs from various sources of TSR's fiction line, as well as past gaming modules and editions of Ravenloft. The book opens with a brief introduction of the various classes of Champions of the Mists, covering the four core <b>classes</b> of warrior, <b>wizard,</b> cleric, and thief, but does not cover the new classes found in Domains of Dread nor the optional classes from the Player's Handbook. The next section is titled [...] "The Crucible" [...] and lists new kits.|$|R
5000|$|Magician: Usually {{referred}} to as Mages, Magicians {{are similar to the}} <b>Wizard</b> <b>class</b> but with noticeably less direct-damage spell power. They are able to summon strong elemental pets, from the domains of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. They have the ability to conjure pet armor and weapons, food, drink, and mod rods, which allow players to convert their health into mana. Magicians can summon party members to different parts of a zone with the Call of the Hero spell, which can be helpful in raid zones. Magicians' direct damage spells are generally from the fire school of magic.|$|R
50|$|The 14 classes {{currently}} available are Wizard, Priest, Archer, Rogue, Warrior, Knight, Paladin, Assassin, Necromancer, Huntress, Mystic, Trickster, Ninja, and Sorcerer. Players begin {{with only the}} <b>Wizard</b> <b>class</b> unlocked and successively unlock the remaining classes as they gain experience with each class. There are 8 main stats, defense, attack, speed, dexterity, vitality, wisdom, mana, and life. Each class has its own weapon, armor and ability specifications, base statistic averages and statistic caps. For example, Warriors, Knights, and Paladins have high defense and {{are the only ones}} that can use swords and heavy armor, while the Assassin, Rogue and Trickster have the highest potential movement speed and dexterity (rate of fire) statistics and can only use daggers and leather armor.|$|R
50|$|The runecaster or runepriest is a playable {{character}} {{class in the}} Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. The runecaster appeared in multiple forms in second edition and third edition and as the runepriest in fourth edition, with rune magic also appearing in other editions of the game. The runecaster has been implemented as a warrior or fighter class, an arcane or <b>wizard</b> <b>class,</b> and a divine or priest class {{as well as a}} set of options for including rune magic without need of a specialized class. While rune magic is found in all editions of Dungeons & Dragons, at least as spells, specialized runecasters have not appeared as classes or class-like options in every edition.|$|R
