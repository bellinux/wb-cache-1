The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate, under field conditions, the effect of {{vaccination}} on sow reproductive performance and their litters, the effect on health status of boars as well as the characteristics and fertilizing capacity of their semen. Furthermore, the presence of antibodies against PRRS virus (PRRSV) in non vaccinated animals of different ages was investigated with serological tests, in order the circulation of PRRSV at farm level months after the start of vaccinations to be evaluated. Serological tests were also performed in vaccinated pregnant sows, in order the seroconversion of sows, the level and degree of obtained immunity after the booster vaccination, as well as the degree of maternal immunity in newborn piglets after sows vaccination to be evaluated. During this study, cross and histopathological tests were performed on samples from the reproductive system (horns of uterus and ovaries) of <b>culled</b> <b>sows</b> at slaughter-house, in order to investigate the possibility of positive effects of vaccination, expressed as a decrease of the percentage of <b>culled</b> <b>sows</b> with cysts. Farm’s reproductive and litter characteristics were longitudinally recorded for this period and historically compared with those of the last year prior to vaccination. For each sow, reproductive and litter data were collected 2 semesters prior to 3 semesters after the start of vaccinations and they compared per semester and total prior to after the start of vaccinations. The number of sows returning to oestrus, giving premature farrowings, aborted and being non-pregnant (“empty”), as well as gestation length, lactation period and weaning to service interval have been recorded. Also the number of piglets totally born, born alive, stillborn, mummified, weak (unable to move and suck without help), weighting less than 1 kg, having “splay-leg” or being alive 24 hours after birth and weaned have been noted.

40|$|Lameness is a {{major reason}} for <b>culling</b> <b>sows</b> from the {{commercial}} breeding herds. Stalder reported that <b>sows</b> <b>culled</b> for feet, leg, and locomotion disorders ranged between 6 to 15 %. In the U. S., commercial sow farms evaluate lameness using subjective methods. An objective and standardize method for assigning lameness scores to a sow would likely be more accurate than subjective scoring measures and provide producers with a useful tool to assess lameness. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} design and build a static force plate to measure weight distribution on four legs of a standing sow. Faculty and students in Animal Science, Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, and Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine developed a static force plate system with automated characteristics to objectively detect lameness in sows. The static force plate system has many advantages over other alternative systems. The static force plate is made of durable materials, is accurate, fits gestation or farrowing stalls, and can measure the weight placed on each hoof independently. The static force plate is a practical application for the commercial swine industry and may allow for earlier detection of lameness problems when compared to subjective lameness evaluation. This in turn will allow for more timely treatment or <b>culling</b> of individual <b>sows</b> from the breeding herd...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} impact of alternative sowculling strategies was examined by simulating costs and returns for a farrowing-to-weaning swine operation. Culling strategies considered were to sell sows after parity 1 (P 1) through parity 10 (P 10). These 10 culling strategies resulted in different parity distributions. The optimal parity distribution is a complex issue, because it is related to conception rates, litter size, feed intake, {{as well as other}} factors. Results of this analysis indicate that the most economical time to <b>cull</b> a <b>sow</b> is after her eighth or ninth parity. This results in a breeding herd comprised of 18 to 20 % gilts and a herd average parity of 3. 5 to 4. 0. However, the additional benefits of keeping a sow beyond about six parities are relatively small. The optimal time to <b>cull</b> a <b>sow</b> decreases as the cost of replacement gilts increases and vice versa.

40|$|Sow {{productive}} lifetime {{continues to}} challenge U. S. commercial swine herds and worldwide pork operations in general. The increased prevalence of hoof abnormalities (e. g. hoof and dew claw overgrowth, hoof wall cracks, and foot pad abrasions) in <b>cull</b> <b>sow</b> populations observed at harvest lend {{evidence to the}} hypothesis that these abnormalities are detrimental to sow performance. The objectives of this thesis were four-fold. The first objective was to summarize sow behaviors associated with increased sow welfare productive lifetime, specifically maintenance (feed and drink), social (aggression, sow-piglet interaction, and expression of sexual behaviors), and stereotypical behaviors. Results from this review suggest that detrimental behaviors were stereotypical behaviors such as bar bitting, aggression between sows through lower feed intake, aggression toward caretakers, and piglet savaging and cannibalism. The second objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of excessive toe growth, presence of cracks in the outer hoof wall, and the difference in length between the medial and lateral toe of the hoof on lactation performance and sow behavior in mid-lactation. This study concluded that sows with overgrown toes stand less than sows with normal hooves, and those findings are consistent with other studies. Sows were observed standing and eating between 3. 3 and 9. 1 % of the observation period, and, of the variables collected, eating was the primary activity performed while standing. Post feeding, each OG lesion score increase was associated with a 40. 0 % decrease in time spent standing and eating. This observation held true for total time spent standing and eating during the observation period [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0. 45]. Results from this study demonstrate that foot lesions can impair productivity and behavior of lactating sows. The degree to which foot lesions impair production and behavior is dependent on lesion type and severity. The third objective {{of this study was to}} estimate observer accuracy and repeatability of body condition scoring sows when scorers have different levels of prior experience. Participants body condition scores were positively associated with body condition scores (BCS) derived by backfat measurements. Averaging over all participants, the ultrasonic trait of last rib backfat yielded the greatest correlation (0. 58) with BCS using a 9 -pt scale, followed by tenth rib backfat (0. 51), tenth rib loin eye area (0. 47), and last rib loin eye area (0. 43). Similar trends were observed for the BCS 5 scale. Therefore, practice assigning independent BCS should lower repeatability variance, but training to calibrate specific participants may only influence total test variance to a relatively small degree. The final objective of this study was to estimate the amount of feed and associated costs of adding body weight to <b>cull</b> <b>sows,</b> in an evaluation to improve producer profitability.

40|$|Abstract Background Using {{conventional}} {{measurements of}} lifetime, {{it is not}} possible to differentiate between productive and non-productive days during a sow's lifetime and this can lead to estimated breeding values favoring less productive animals. By rescaling the time axis from continuous to several discrete classes, grouped survival data (discrete survival time) models can be used instead. Methods The productive life length of 12319 Large White and 9833 Landrace sows was analyzed with continuous scale and grouped data models. Random effect of herd*year, fixed effects of interaction between parity and relative number of piglets, age at first farrowing and annual herd size change were included in the analysis. The genetic component was estimated from sire, sire-maternal grandsire, sire-dam, sire-maternal grandsire and animal models, and the heritabilities computed for each model type in both breeds. Results If age at first farrowing was under 43 weeks or above 60 weeks, the risk of <b>culling</b> <b>sows</b> increased. An interaction between parity and relative litter size was observed, expressed by limited culling during first parity and severe risk increase of <b>culling</b> <b>sows</b> having small litters later in life. In the Landrace breed, heritabilities ranged between 0. 05 and 0. 08 (s. e. 0. 014 - 0. 020) for the continuous and between 0. 07 and 0. 11 (s. e. 0. 016 - 0. 023) for the grouped data models, and in the Large White breed, they ranged between 0. 08 and 0. 14 (s. e. 0. 012 - 0. 026) for the continuous and between 0. 08 and 0. 13 (s. e. 0. 012 - 0. 025) for the grouped data models.

This retrospective observational study used ambient temperature and humidity data from weather stations near United States slaughter plants collected from 2010 to 2015 to predict the incidence and risk of death among swine in-transit and just prior to slaughter. The risk of death for market swine at a heat index (HI), which combines the effects of temperature and humidity, indicating moderately hot weather conditions between 85 and 92 °F was 1. 37 times {{greater than that of}} the baseline temperature range of 54 – 79 °F.

One hundred and fifty four <b>culled</b> <b>sows</b> of the Landrace breed were used. Slaughter was performed by the method of desensitization by electrical stimulation and subsequent exsanguination. Then 5 mL of whole blood was collected to evaluate concentrations of GGT and AST. During evisceration, liver condition was assessed by visual inspection and classified as good or condemned by perihepatitis. Also, fragments of the liver were collected to histopathologic examination. The alterations in the liver parenchyma were classified as degenerative, inflammatory or reparative. The alterations found in liver tissues, considered as perihepatitis by visual inspection, were often due to fibrosis, fatty degeneration or mild hepatitis. The serum concentrations of GGT were high. Moreover, it concentrations were higher in livers with lesions of inflammatory and degenerative nature when compared to livers without injuries (p 0. 05). Concluding, the perihepatitis diagnosis from the FIS showed low specificity and sensitivity, and the enzyme GGT was a good indicator of liver injuries in swine. ...|$|R
40|$|Half of Sweden’s 140 000 - 150 000 <b>sows</b> are <b>culled</b> and {{replaced}} by 75 000 gilts annually. <b>Culling</b> of old <b>sows</b> is necessary and allows new breeding material to enter the herd. However, many of the <b>culled</b> <b>sows</b> are young, and have not yet become profitable at the time for culling. Therefore, {{it is an important}} question for the pig industry, how to raise gilts to sows with a high and sustainable production level. Several rearing factors are thought to influence the reproductive performance as well as the longevity of the sow. However, it is not well studied in which way these factors act. This thesis aims to find relationships between rearing factors and the performance of sows, so that a suitable way of raising gilts can be proposed. As a part of this work a study was performed, with the purpose of comparing how herds with high respectively low production results and culling frequencies raised their gilts. It is also described how gilt rearing is performed and varies between herds. Data was based on an interview study and the herd monitoring program PigWin Sugg. The analysis at herd level showed that purchasing gilts was associated with a lower annual sow removal rate, compared with raising gilts on the own farm. In herds with own production of replacement gilts, the use of a breeding computer program when selecting gilts, resulted in a small proportion of litters from gilts in the farm. Herds with the highest average mating age for gilts had the highest number of live born pigs in the first litter and the herds that accepted more returns to oestrus had better longevity and most pigs born alive during lifetime of their sows. Housing gilts in pens with slatted floor and concrete during mating and pregnancy was associated with a high proportion of <b>sows</b> <b>culled</b> due to leg and claw injuries and few pigs born alive in the first litter compared with gilts housed on deep straw litter. However, gilts raised in pens with slatted floor and concrete between the age of 12 and 24 weeks had most live born pigs in the first litter. The crude protein content in the gilt feed did not influence the production results or culling reasons. However, a low feeding intensity gave a high proportion of <b>sows</b> <b>culled</b> due to leg and claw injuries. A high feeding intensity at mating (flushing) was associated with better longevity. Only 55 of the total contacted 125 herds participated in this study and the result showed great variations in how gilts were reared in different herds. Several other rearing factors, beyond those analysed in this paper, can be of interest to analyse in how they affect the performance of sows. To successfully raise gilts to sows with a high and sustainable production, {{it is important to consider}} already known relationships between rearing and performance. Therefore, advices in how to raise gilts (based on literature and the results from this study) are presented in the end of this paper...|$|R
40|$|Lameness in sows is an {{emerging}} disease condition with major effects on animal welfare and economics. Yet the {{direct impact on}} reproduction results remains unclear. The present field study investigated the impact of lameness and claw lesions throughout the reproductive cycle on (re) production results of sows. In five farms, a total of 491 group-housed sows were followed up {{for a period of}} one reproductive cycle. Sows were assessed for lameness every time they were moved to another area in the farm. Claw lesions were scored at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the cycle. Reproduction results included the number of live-born piglets, stillborn piglets, mummified fetuses and crushed piglets, weaning-to-oestrus interval and the presence of sows not showing oestrus post weaning, returning to service and aborting. Sows that left the group were recorded and the reason was noted. A mean prevalence of lameness of 5. 9 % was found, although it depended on the time in the productive cycle. The highest percentage of lame sows (8. 1 %) was found when sows were moved from the post-weaning to the gestation stable. No significant associations were found between lameness and reproduction parameters with the exception of the effect on mummified foetuses. Wall cracks, white line lesions, heel lesions and skin lesions did have an effect on farrowing performance. Of all sows, 22 % left the group throughout the study, and almost half of these sows were removed from the farm. Lameness was the second most important reason for <b>culling.</b> <b>Sows</b> <b>culled</b> because of lameness were significantly younger compared with <b>sows</b> <b>culled</b> for other reasons (parity: 2. 6 +/- 1. 3 v. 4. 0 +/- 1. 8). In conclusion, the present results indicate that lameness mainly affects farm productivity indirectly through its effect on sow longevity whereas claw lesions directly affect some reproductive parameters. The high percentage of lame sows in the insemination stable indicate that risk factor studies should not only focus on the gestation stable, but also on housing conditions in the insemination stable...|$|R
40|$|Lameness {{is one of}} {{the leading}} reasons for <b>culling</b> <b>sows</b> in many {{commercial}} swine production systems. Current research is being done on a chemically induced, transient lameness model in sows (Karriker et al, 2009). The lameness model allows comparisons to be made about gait and posture of the same sow; when a sow is sound versus when the same sow is lame. The lameness model has lacked the ability to study more than the distal interphalangeal joint. Therefore, the objective of this study was to (1) select proper needle size and estimate joint volume and (2) determine possible joint candidates for future incorporation into the lameness model and administration of future therapies. Fourteen clinically normal, mixed-parity crossbred sows were purchased from a commercial producer in Iowa and housed individual pens at Iowa State University. Fourteen front and fourteen rear sow legs were obtained post-mortem for injection of various joints. Of the twenty eight post-mortem legs, one front and one back leg were used to examine anatomy, estimate joint volume, select proper needle size, and practice injecting. Results are expressed as a percentage of success. The results conclude that the joints with greater success rates are potential candidates for incorporation into the lameness model. For that reason, the elbow and tarsocrural (hock) joints would not be good candidates for further research. Therefore it is beneficial to utilize the medial and lateral metacarpophalangeal/ metatarsophalangeal joints in the chemically induced, transient lameness model...|$|R

A factorial arrangement created 9 dietary treatments: (1) 0 % gestation diet, 0 % lactation diet; (2) 0 % gestation diet, 15 % DDGS lactation diet; (3) 0 % gestation diet, 30 % DDGS lactation diet; (4) 15 % DDGS gestation diet, 0 % lactation diet; (5) 15 % DDGS gestation diet, 15 % DDGS lactation diet; (6) 15 % DDGS gestation diet, 30 % DDGS lactation diet; (7) 30 % DDGS gestation diet, 0 % lactation diet; (8) 30 % DDGS gestation diet, 15 % DDGS lactation diet; (9) 30 % DDGS gestation diet, 30 % DDGS lactation diet. Individual sow BW and backfat thickness were recorded initially (d 56 mid-gestation), d 0 of lactation, at weaning, and d 8 post-weaning. Individual sow’s litter performance was recorded (number born, number born alive, number weaned, litter weaning weight and days of lactation). Litter size was adjusted to 9 piglets by d 2 of lactation. Postweaning, sows were transferred back to gestation crates for an 8 d drying period prior to slaughter. Sows were harvested 8 d following weaning at a commercial processing plant and samples of lean and fat were collected for fatty acid profiles. Bratwurst and breakfast links were prepared and assessed for quality, color, cooking characteristics and taste panel evaluation. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results {{from a series of}} studies related to factors influencing fertility of sows in New Zealand. The conclusion from an analysis of longitudinal pig reproductive performance data is that summer-autumn infertility was not a significant problem on the farms included in this study during the time period investigated. In New Zealand there are probably certain specific conditions when seasonal infertility does become a problem for a particular pig herd, and this may be more evident on farms in the South Island which are using a group housing husbandry system for their sows. The intervention trials into increased dry sow ration in newly mated sows and of the management technique of split weaning both failed to demonstrate these techniques improved reproductive performance. Economic simulation modelling suggests that while there {{does not seem to be}} an overall benefit from the increased dry sow feed intake, it would yield an economic benefit on some farms. Possible explanations for this are discussed in this thesis. The investigation into the usefulness of ultrasound scanning for determining early pregnancy status in sows demonstrated the effectiveness of this diagnostic technique in detecting pregnancy, but did not show a level of loss of early pregnancies sufficient to justify more intensive investigation of embryonic mortality. <b>Cull</b> <b>sows</b> sent to slaughter were examined for their pregnancy status and any pathological changes. A large proportion of these animals showed endometritis and urinary tract pathology, indicating that both of these conditions were more common in the cooperating herds than had been suggested by earlier clinical evidence...|$|R
