50|$|The closed {{drainage}} basin of Salar de Talar encompasses about 476 km² and is adjacent to other endorheic basins, including Laguna Miscanti, Laguna Tuyajto and Salar de <b>Capur</b> basins.|$|E
50|$|Caichinque is a {{volcanic}} complex lying between Salar de Talar and Salar de <b>Capur,</b> {{in the high}} Andean plateau of the Antofagasta Region, in Chile. It is located southwest of the Salar de Atacama, directly S of Cerro Miñiques and SE of Cordón Puntas Negras forming part of the main branch of the Andean volcanic chain in this area.Route CH-23 is an approach road to the volcano area.|$|E
40|$|Examination of {{epididymides}} from 6 {{sexually mature}} male rhesus monkeys revealed epididymal epithelial and stereocilial height was maximal in the <b>capur</b> region and minimal at the cauda. Lumi-nal diameter {{was just the}} reverse. Strong acid phosphatase activity was localized principally in the supranuclear area of the columnar cells in the distal caput and corpus epithelia. Stereocilia were practically devoid of this activity. Moderate alkaline phosphatase activity was localized in the basal cells of the corpus and proximal cauda epididymidis, while activity in the principal cells was slight. Luminal contents of ductuli efferentes and epididymis had much more alkaline phosphatase activity than tissues. PAS positive materials were most evident in the apical epithelium of the ductuli efferentes and distal caput and in the luminal contents beyond the proximal caput. Location of the cytoplasmic droplet on the sperm midpiece changed from proximal to distal between distal caput and proximal corpus. Progressive sperm motility changed dramatically between distal corpus (15 %) and proximal cauda (75 %). It was hypothesized that some rhesus sperm within the distal corpus (second portion of the middle segment) would have acquired fertilizing ability...|$|E
