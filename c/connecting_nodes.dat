The roof is {{supported}} by a structure of laminated oak beams joined with a total of 112 stainless steel connectors (each slightly different), which in turn are suspended on steel rods from the walls. The <b>connecting</b> <b>nodes</b> were fabricated by welders for Scotland's oil industry. Such a structure enables the debating chamber to span over 30metres (100ft) without any supporting columns. In entering the chamber, MSPs pass under a stone lintel—the Arniston Stone—that was once part of the pre-1707 Parliament building, Parliament House. The use of the Arniston Stone {{in the structure of the}} debating chamber symbolises the connection between the historical Parliament of Scotland and the present day Scottish Parliament.|$|E

50|$|Spreading {{activation}} {{can also}} demonstrate how memory errors may occur. As {{the network of}} memory associations increases {{in the number of}} connections-the connection density-the likelihood of memory gaps and errors occurring also increases. Put simply, the amount of activation a secondary connection receives depends on how many connections the initial node has associated with it. This is because the initial node must divide the amount of activation it spreads to related nodes by the number of <b>connecting</b> <b>nodes</b> it is associated with. If node 1 has three <b>connecting</b> <b>nodes,</b> and node 2 has 15 <b>connecting</b> <b>nodes,</b> the three <b>connecting</b> <b>nodes</b> from node 1 will receive greater activation levels (the activation level is divided less) than for the 15 <b>connecting</b> <b>nodes</b> from node 2, and the components of these nodes will be more easily brought to mind. What this means is that, with more connections a node has, the more difficulty there is bringing to mind one of its connecting features. This can lead to memory errors, in that if the connection density is so great that there is not enough activation reaching the secondary nodes, then the person may not recall a target memory that is actually present, and a memory error occurs.|$|E

Thus gene regulatory networks approximate a hierarchical scale free network topology. This is consistent with the view that most genes have limited pleiotropy and operate within regulatory modules.

Recent work has also shown that natural selection tends to favor networks with sparse connectivity.|$|R
