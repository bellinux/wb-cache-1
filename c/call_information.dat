25|$|As technology, and {{particularly}} computer technology, evolved, the dispatching of EMS resources {{took on an}} entirely new dimension, and required completely new skill sets. The process of dispatching was supported by computers, and moved in many locales to a paperless system that required above average computer skills. Computer-aided dispatch (CAD) systems not only permitted the dispatcher to record the <b>call</b> <b>information,</b> but also automated the call triage process, allowing EMD systems to become algorithm-based decision support tools. Technologies once available only to the military, such as satellite-based Automatic Vehicle Location allowed CAD systems to constantly monitor the location and status of response resources, making response resource assignment recommendations to human dispatchers, allowing human dispatchers to watch the physical movement of their resources across a computerized map, and creating a permanent record of the call for future use.|$|E
25|$|VRS {{providers}} encounter difficulties routing 911 {{calls to}} the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). When a VRS user dials 911, the call is first delivered to the VRS, as with any other call placed. However, when the VRS interpreter attempts {{to connect with the}} user's local PSAP, the call is instead connected to the PSAP that services the VRS provider's location. Additionally, the information displayed at the PSAP will be that of the VRS provider, not the VRS user. In order to route emergency calls and accurate information to the appropriate PSAP, VRS providers can send the <b>call</b> <b>information</b> to a national call-routing service. This service determines the appropriate local PSAP for the VRS user and delivers the VRS interpreter's 911 call accordingly. The VRS user can then communicate with the PSAP dispatcher via the VRS interpreter, in order to receive the appropriate emergency services. The European Union improves access to emergency services 112 for people with disabilities. The REACH112 project intends to implement a 12-month pilot in Sweden, UK, The Netherlands, France and Spain allowing disabled users to communicate at a distance with each other and directly with the emergency services.|$|E
2500|$|In {{most modern}} EMS systems, the Emergency Medical Dispatcher will fill {{a number of}} {{critical}} functions. [...] The first {{of these is the}} identification of basic <b>call</b> <b>information,</b> including the location and telephone number of the caller, the location of the patient, the general nature of the problem, and any special circumstances. In most EMS systems, the telephone remains almost a singular point of access for those needing assistance.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with many}} things in Hong Kong, the {{dispatch}} of emergency vehicles continues {{to be influenced by}} the British legacy. [...] The telephone number for emergency services throughout Hong Kong is 999, just as in Britain. [...] All 999 calls are answered by the Hong Kong Police Force. [...] If an ambulance is the only response required, the call is passed directly to Hong Kong Fire Services dispatchers. [...] If the <b>call</b> <b>information</b> is complex, as with a traffic accident, the police dispatchers will notify the ambulance service when they suspect that ambulances might be required. [...] Both ambulances and fire apparatus are co-dispatched by the Hong Kong Fire Service dispatchers. The system operates technologies and decision support software that are approximately equivalent with those found in Europe and North America.|$|E
2500|$|According to Iván Velásquez, CICIG's Chief Commissioner, {{the crime}} network {{had been under}} {{investigation}} since May 2014, when the CICIG got tips that there were connections between importers and customs officers, who found ways for the importers to pay fewer taxes. Telephone <b>call</b> <b>information</b> for [...] "La Línea" [...] was given to importers. [...] "La Línea" [...] operated mainly in the major harbors and in the central customs building. [...] Velásquez did not specify the total amount embezzled but said that the ring charged between 20,000 and 100,000quetzals per container. Finally, informed that the intercepted phone conversation showed that from the 40% of tax paid, 30% came from bribes, to decrease the amount of taxes that the importer had to pay. [...] "La Línea" [...] possibly embezzled more than 2millones quetzals per week in bribes. More than a thousand companies may have used [...] "La Línea" [...] to avoid paying some taxes, and these companies are under investigation as well.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, the EMD {{ensures that}} the {{information}} regarding each call is collected in a consistent manner, for both legal and quality assurance purposes. In most jurisdictions, all EMS records, including both patient care and dispatch records, and also recordings of dispatch radio and telephone conversations, {{are considered to be}} legal documents. Dispatch records are often a subject of interest in legal proceedings, particularly with respect to initial information obtained, statements made by the caller, and response times for resources. Any or all may be demanded by a criminal court or civil court, a public inquiry, or a Coroner's Inquest, and may have to be produced as evidence. It is not uncommon in some jurisdictions for EMDs to be summoned to court, in order to provide evidence regarding their activities. As a result, there is frequently a legal requirement for the long-term storage of such information, and the specific requirements are likely to vary by both country and jurisdiction. [...] Additionally, medical directors will frequently rely on information provided by EMDs for the purpose of medical quality assurance for paramedics; in particular analyzing conversations between paramedics and dispatchers or physicians, analyzing the paramedic's actions and judgments {{in the light of the}} information that they were provided with. [...] As a direct result of these two factors, there is a requirement for all <b>call</b> <b>information</b> to be collected and stored in a regular, consistent, and professional manner, and this too, will often fall to the EMD, at least in the initial stages.|$|E
