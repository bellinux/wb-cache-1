40|$|Future long-duration {{missions}} to Mars using in situ resource production to obtain oxygen from the Martian atmosphere {{for use as}} a propellant or for life support will require long term oxygen storage facilities. This report describes preliminary analysis of design concepts for lightweight, collapsible liquid oxygen storage tanks to be used on the surface of Mars. With storage at relatively low pressures, an inflatable tank concept in which the cryogen is stored within a fiber-reinforced Teflon FEP bladder is an efficient approach. The technology required for such a tank is well-developed through similar previous applications in positive expulsion bladders for zero-g liquid fuel rocket tanks and inflatable space habitat technology, though the liquid oxygen environment presents unique challenges. The weight of the proposed structure is largely dominated by the support structure needed to hold the tank off the ground and permit a vacuum insulation space to be maintained around the tank. In addition to the inflatable tank concept, telescoping tank concepts are studied. For a telescoping tank, the greatest difficulty is in making effective joints and seals. The use of shape memory alloy to produce a passive <b>clamping</b> <b>ring</b> is evaluated.

40|$|AbstractThe Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding Process is a {{solid state}} joining process {{manufacturing}} excellent mechanical properties of the joint. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the influence of the tool wear on selected quality criteria such as the lap shear strength and the surface quality of the joint as well as the required electric current that is an indicator for the process forces and torques. Based on the result of 22 duration tests with 3, 500 welding points the sleeve can be identified as the most stressed tool part with a maximum wear of 0. 3 mm. The tool wear depends on the gap size between the tool parts that are loaded with plasticized work piece material. The volume of the material influences the required torque of the main spindle and the tool temperature. At reaching 70 % to 80 % of the maximum tool wear the process temperature rapidly increases. Another result is the independence of lap shear strength of the joints on tool wear. But within the duration tests the mechanical characteristics were increased (about 7, 000 N before and 8, 300 N after one duration test in average) by achieving larger temperatures. The surface quality is slightly influenced by the tool wear. The height of the surrounding burr that occurs at the boundary of <b>clamping</b> <b>ring</b> and sleeve is 0. 25 mm for a worn out tool. Furthermore key indicators that were developed in past studies are validated to be useful for a condition monitoring approach by showing significant changes for increasing tool wear...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the {{characterization}} and explanation of roughness formation on silicon during plasma etching, the design, construction and sealing of silicon microfluidics and application of this microfluidics in affinity chromatography of phosphopeptides. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, an extensive study of the roughness formation on silicon surface during plasma etching is done, in order to know the maximum roughness expected during the fabrication processes of microfluidic devices, and its possible impact on their flow and other properties. SF 6 gas is used for silicon etching in an ICP plasma reactor. Silicon surface etching leads to a dual scale morphology, which consists of underlying nano-roughness and superimposed much higher nano-mounds. For the dual-scale surface characterization a methodology is proposed, which is based on five roughness metrics: a) the root mean square of the surface heights rms, b) the correlation length ξ, c) the roughness component α, d) the mean width of the nano-mounds, and e) the mean distance of the nano-mounds. A mechanism which explains the dual scale roughness formation is proposed, according to which, inhibitors were deposited in the surface during etching and decrease the etching rate locally. There are two kinds of inhibitors: 1) the “hard” AlXFY that come from the alumina Al 2 O 3 reactor dome and/or the anodised Al from the <b>clamping</b> <b>ring,</b> and are removed from the surface with ion sputtering, and 2) the “soft” inhibitors which can be large molecules or radicals and may be coming from the plasma e. g. SFx ή CFx or even products from the chemical reaction of the etching process In the second part of this thesis, we designed and fabricated two microfluidic devices, on Silicon one for liquid chromatography and another for gas flow. For the anisotropic etching of the silicon, the Bosch process was preferred method rather than the cryogenic method due to the higher etching rate and the smaller induced roughness. Regarding the sealing of the microfluidic devices, we preferred a bonding method with an intermediate layer. A lamination film with chemically inert and uniform glue was used for sealing the microfluidic devices for liquid flow. A bonding method with an intermediate layer provides a cheap, quick and easy solution, without the use of special equipment. In the third part of the thesis, the microfluidic devices for liquid chromatography were used for the separation of phosphopeptides with affinity chromatography and TiO 2 as ligand. The deposition of TiO 2 films in microfluidics devices may be made by bombardment of targets (rf sputtering) or by means of wet deposition by precipitation from “fluorotitanate” solution. In this thesis we used a solution of a mixture H 2 TiF 6 -H 2 ZrF 6. The liquid deposition method creates TiO 2 -ZrO 2 crystalline films. Affinity chromatography with TiO 2 is a very good method for separating phosphopeptides. ...|$|E

40|$|Permanent magnet {{generators}} (PMG) {{represent the}} cutting edge technology in modern wind mills. The efficiency remains high (over 90 %) at partial loads. To improve the machine efficiency even further, every aspect of machine losses has to be analyzed. Additional losses are often given as a certain percentage without providing any detailed information about the actual calculation process; meanwhile, there are many design-dependent losses that {{have an effect on}} the total amount of additional losses and that have to be taken into consideration. Additional losses are most often eddy current losses in different parts of the machine. These losses are usually difficult to calculate in the design process. In this doctoral thesis, some additional losses are identified and modeled. Further, suggestions on how to minimize the losses are given. Iron losses can differ significantly between the measured no-load values and the loss values under load. In addition, with embedded magnet rotors, the quadrature-axis armature reaction adds losses to the stator iron by manipulating the harmonic content of the flux. It was, therefore, re-evaluated that in salient pole machines, to minimize the losses and the loss difference between the no-load and load operation, the flux density has to be kept below 1. 5 T in the stator yoke, which is the traditional guideline for machine designers. Eddy current losses may occur in the end-winding area and in the support structure of the machine, that is, in the finger plate and the <b>clamping</b> <b>ring.</b> With construction steel, these losses account for 0. 08 % of the input power of the machine. These losses can be reduced almost to zero by using nonmagnetic stainless steel. In addition, the machine housing may be subjected to eddy current losses if the flux density exceeds 1. 5 T in the stator yoke. Winding losses can rise rapidly when high frequencies and 10 – 15 mm high conductors are used. In general, minimizing the winding losses is simple. For example, it can be done by dividing the conductor into transposed subconductors. However, this comes with the expense of an increase in the DC resistance. In the doctoral thesis, a new method is presented to minimize the winding losses by applying a litz wire with noninsulated strands. The construction is the same as in a normal litz wire but the insulation between the subconductors has been left out. The idea is that the connection is kept weak to prevent harmful eddy currents from flowing. Moreover, the analytical solution for calculating the AC resistance factor of the litz-wire is supplemented by including an end-winding resistance in the analytical solution. A simple measurement device is developed to measure the AC resistance in the windings. In the case of a litz-wire with originally noninsulated strands, vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI) is used to insulate the subconductors. In one of the two cases studied, the VPI affected the AC resistance factor, but in the other case, it did not have any effect. However, more research is needed to determine the effect of the VPI on litz-wire with noninsulated strands. An empirical model is developed to calculate the AC resistance factor of a single-layer formwound winding. The model includes the end-winding length and the number of strands and turns. The end winding includes the circulating current (eddy currents that are traveling through the whole winding between parallel strands) and the main current. The end-winding length also affects the total AC resistance factor...|$|E

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of the out-of-plane buckling strength of rings attached to cone-cylinder intersections. Simple formulae {{which can be}} used to estimate the stiffness of the rotational restraint provided by adjacent shell walls are first developed from a finite element parametric study. These formulae are then combined with an existing closed-form solution based on thin-walled member theory to predict the flexural-torsional buckling strength of rings with an elastic rotational restraint. Numerical results are obtained for angle section rings from the closed-form solution and a finite element shell buckling analysis which is able to model cross-section distortion. Comparisons between the two approaches show that when the restraint stiffness is small, they agree with each other closely. Beyond a certain level of restraint stiffness, the buckling strength predicted by the finite element analysis falls increasingly below that given by the closed-form solution due to cross-section distortion and approaches the strength of an inner edge <b>clamped</b> <b>ring.</b> The paper concludes with suggestions for safely approximating the stiffness of the shell wall rotational restraint for use in design.
