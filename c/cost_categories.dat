40|$|Category 3, Class C/D {{missions}} {{have the}} benefit of delivering worthwhile science at minimal cost which is increasingly important in NASA's constrained budget environment. Although higher <b>cost</b> <b>Category</b> 1 and 2 missions are necessary to achieve NASA's science objectives, Category 3 missions are shown to be an effective way to provide significant science return at a low <b>cost.</b> <b>Category</b> 3 missions, however, are often reviewed the same as the more risk averse Category 1 and 2 missions. Acknowledging that reviews are not the only aspect of a total engineering effort, reviews are still a significant concern for NASA programs.

This paper quantifies the benefit and performance of Category 3 missions by looking at the cost vs. capability relative to Category 1 and 2 missions.

40|$|Abstract: The track {{maintenance}} and renewal <b>cost</b> <b>categories</b> used by infrastructure managers (IMs) {{have an important}} role to play in pricing transport infrastructure access, improving the efficiency of IM performance, and helping to focus efforts to reduce track costs. However, very little work has been done so far to identify a common set of European <b>cost</b> <b>categories,</b> capable of supporting progress in these areas. This paper describes an analysis of the IMs ’ existing <b>cost</b> <b>categories,</b> carried out to identify those accounting for the largest proportion of the annual maintenance budget and to develop a common European set of <b>cost</b> <b>categories</b> to support future pricing and efficiency work. The study found five maintenance activities, which account for over 80 per cent of the overall annual {{track maintenance}} expenditure, and on which further research should be focused to achieve cost reductions. These were, in the descending order of importance: switches and crossings, inspection, rail changing, tamping, and re-sleepering.

This thesis examines the cost to operate the Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) per mile driven. The central objective {{of this study was to}} establish a framework for analyzing the applicable LAV cost drivers so as to derive a total operational cost per mile driven. To address this issue, research of relevant cost data as well as field research and interviews were conducted. The research and interviews obtained information about major <b>cost</b> <b>categories</b> associated with LAV operations, whether those <b>cost</b> <b>categories</b> should be estimated as direct or indirect costs and the proper allocation method for indirect costs. The major findings resulted in two alternative costing models which estimate the operational cost for the LAV family of vehicles as well as for the individual LAV variants based on a full costing approach and a material costing approach.
