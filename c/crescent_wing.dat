5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was {{commonly}} {{described as}} having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed flight characteristics. During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, {{in part due to}} its narrowness and flexibility of the <b>crescent</b> <b>wing.</b> One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once lined up with the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink, giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot.|$|E
5|$|The HP.80 and Avro's Type 698 {{were chosen}} as the best two of the {{proposed}} designs to B.35/46, and orders for two prototypes of each were placed. It was recognised, however, {{that there were many}} unknowns associated with both designs, and an order was also placed for Vickers' design, which became the Valiant. Although not fully meeting the requirements of the specification, the Valiant design posed little risk of failure and could therefore reach service earlier. The HP.80's <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> was tested on a ⅓-scale glider, the HP.87, and a heavily modified Supermarine Attacker, which was given the Handley Page HP.88 designation. The HP.88 crashed on 26 August 1951 after completing only about thirty flights and little useful data was gained during its brief two months of existence. By the time the HP.88 was ready, the HP.80 wing had changed such that the former was no longer representative. The design of the HP.80 had sufficiently advanced that the loss of the HP.88 had little effect on the programme.|$|E
2500|$|The Supermarine 545 was a {{development}} of the Swift for intended operation as a naval fighter to meet Air Ministry specification F.105D2. It had a <b>crescent</b> shaped <b>wing</b> and was intended to fly at supersonic speeds. It was powered by a single afterburning Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet fed from an elliptical nose air intake with a central, bullet shaped centrebody. [...] The intake was the most obvious difference between the Type 545 and its precursor, which had side intakes.|$|R
40|$|This {{contract}} {{began in}} April 1990 with {{studies on the}} effect of wingtip shape on induced drag. That work considered problems of determining induced drag from computational aerodynamic methods and examined effects of wake roll up on the induced drag of elliptical and <b>crescent</b> <b>wings.</b> The research contract was continued in April 1991 and again in April 1992 with scope augmented to include considerations other than induced drag. The idea was to develop methods for comparing wing tip shapes {{on the basis of their}} effects on total drag, structural weight, and high lift performance. To accomplish this, work was done to improve methods for multidisciplinary analysis and optimization of wings. This report describes results of research conducted from April 1992 through March 1993. The general objective was to improve an existing wing optimization method and apply the method to specific problems of interest. The method, while a valuable tool for wing tip design studies, can be applied to more general problems, and has been applied to some of these other problems during its development. Specific goals that were accomplished are listed below and are explained in more detail in attached reports: analysis methods were improved in the area of structural modeling; small improvements to the high lift model were made, and ideas were collected on how clean wing c(sub l(sub max)) should vary with sweep - these ideas should provide a guide for future examination of high lift with experiment or CFD; and a calculation for drag due to the loss of leading edge suction was added to the wing analysis...|$|R
50|$|Thomas Pemberton {{described}} the Crescent {{at the time}} of completion as “a range of sixteen well built and handsome dwelling houses, extending four hundred and eighty feet in length…The general appearance is simple and uniform.” As Bulfinch’s elevation shows, the chief feature was a central pavilion, slightly higher than the <b>Crescent’s</b> <b>wings,</b> with a large arch that spanned a passageway passing entirely through the structure, an attic story and two secondary pavilions projecting 6’ forward from the middle section. The form was suggested by Queen’s Square in Bath, constructed {{more than half a century}} earlier by John Wood, the Elder; the arch, with Palladian window, was probably taken from the Market in High Street, Bristol, traditionally attributed to Wood also. However, in style the Tontine Crescent was Neoclassical rather than Neo-Palladian, and its main architectural distinction, three ranges of pilasters rising two stories above an architectural basement, is taken from the Adelphi. Moreover, the structure contained all the Neoclassical elements of the new Federal style: attenuated pilasters on the central pavilion and two end pavilions that projected forward several feet, swag panels, and delicate fanlights and lunettes. The plan, which featured two large rooms (about 18’ x 18’) on each floor offset by a hallway with main and service staircases, was traditional with London row-house builders since the 17th century. Indeed, the Neoclassical façade of the Adam brothers’ Royal Society of Arts building in London was another inspiration for the central building. The houses’ brick exterior walls were painted gray to simulate masonry and the architectural detail, apparently all of wood, was painted white. Delicate decorative devices were present on the handsome three-floor houses, each 27’ wide, but ornament was so restrained that there were no frames around the windows. The identical doorways were spaced two to a porch. Each floor consisted of two large rooms, described by Massachusetts Magazine as “spacious and lofty”, with a hallway on one side containing both the main and service stairways.|$|R
500|$|The Beverly Hills Hotel was {{established}} in May 1912, before the city's existence. The original owners were Margaret J. Anderson, a wealthy widow, and her son, Stanley S. Anderson, who had been managing the Hollywood Hotel. The original hotel was designed by Pasadena architect Elmer Grey, in the Mediterranean Revival style. From 1928 to 1932, the hotel was owned by the Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company. In 1941, Hernando Courtright, {{the vice president of}} the Bank of America, purchased the hotel with friends including Irene Dunne, [...] Loretta Young and Harry Warner. Courtright established the Polo Lounge, which was for many years the premier dining spot in Los Angeles, hosting luminaries such as the Rat Pack, Humphrey Bogart and Marlene Dietrich.

From these, the press quickly coined the new terms [...] "flying saucer" [...] and [...] "flying disc" [...] to describe such objects, many of which were reported within days after Arnold's sighting. Later Arnold would add that one of the objects actually resembled a <b>crescent</b> or flying <b>wing.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Handley Page HP.88 was a British {{research}} aircraft, {{built in}} the early 1950s for Handley Page to test the aerodynamics of the Victor <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> design, and {{was intended to be}} a scaled-down version of that aircraft.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s the {{collection}} had outgrown its accommodation, and Foster {{was asked to}} design an extension. Rather than simply extending the existing structure as had been envisaged 15 years earlier, {{it was decided to}} look below ground. The sloping site allowed for an enlarged basement to emerge at a curved glass frontage overlooking a man-made lake (an echo of the nearby 13th century Norfolk Broads). There is little clue of the extent of the new wing, except when viewed from the position of this lake. The <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> was built by Anthony Hunt Associates and opened in 1991.|$|E
50|$|The HP.88 had a 0.36 {{scaled-down}} {{equivalent of}} the Victor's <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> and T-tail with slab tailplane. However where the Victor had a high wing, the Type 521 set the wing low on the fuselage. Also, the Victor design continued to be refined, so the HP.88 was no longer representative of the Victor. The HP.88 wing featured inboard trailing-edge flaps, which badly affected trim when deployed. The tailplane {{was too small to}} counter the trim change, so a system was developed where the ailerons deflected upwards together to balance the trim forces. The system was wholly automatic with no pilot intervention, and in the event of any failure all surfaces would return to their normal positions.|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} to this problem took on many forms. One was the addition of a fin known as a wing fence on the upper surface of the wing to redirect the flow to the rear (see the MiG-15 as an example.) Another closely related design was addition of a dogtooth notch to the leading edge (Avro Arrow). Other designs took a more radical approach, including the Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor's wing that grew wider towards the tip to provide more lift at the tip. The Handley Page Victor had a <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> with substantial sweep-back near the wing root where the wing was thickest, and progressively reducing sweep along the span as the wing thickness reduced towards the tip.|$|E

40|$|Lift {{and drag}} forces were {{compared}} for elliptic and <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> models at cruise and climb {{conditions in the}} NASA/Langley 14 x 22 -ft subsonic tunnel. The force measurements were obtained for an angle-of-attack range from - 3 to 10 deg at a Reynolds number of about 1. 7 million. The results indicate that for attached flow conditions, the <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> with its highly swept tips generates less lift-dependent drag than the elliptic wing for given lift force, wing span, and freestream conditions. The drag reduction {{is thought to be}} the result of the favorable influence of trailing wake deformations on the pressure distribution of the highly swept outboard region of the <b>crescent</b> <b>wing...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{interest}} in the induced drag characteristics of crescent-shaped wings {{has led to a}} closer look at the methods used for determination of induced drag from computational aerodynamic methods. Induced drag may be computed by integration of surface pressure, or by evaluation of a contour integral in the Trefftz plane. A high-order panel method was used to study the induced drag of crescent and elliptical wings using both techniques. Induced drag computations using surface-pressure integration were strongly affected by panel density and angle of attack. Accurate drag computations for the <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> were obtained only when the spanwise as well as chordwise panel density was extremely high. Trefftz-plane results for the two wing planforms do not show this sensitivity to panel density or angle of attack. Span efficiencies of 0. 994 for the <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> and 0. 987 for the elliptical wing were computed by the Trefftz-plane technique. Substitution of a force-free, rolled-up wake geometry on the <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> did not change the pressure-integrated drag significantly. The slightly higher span efficiency of the <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> is attributed to a more nearly elliptical spanwise lift distribution. The chord distribution of the elliptical wing was modified to produce an elliptical span-loading on a wing with an unswept quarter-chord line. This wing demonstrated a span efficiency equal to that of the <b>crescent</b> <b>wing...</b>|$|E

The force and moment data and the flow-visualization {{results indicated that the}} <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> model with its highly swept tips produced much better high-angle-of-attack aerodynamic characteristics than the elliptic model. Leading-edge separation-induced vortex flow over the highly swept tips of the <b>crescent</b> <b>wing</b> is thought to produce this improved behavior at high angles of attack.
