25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. I noticed {{his head was}} warm, that his <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So we gave him some black powder and put him to bed. During the night he was rather restless {{and in the morning}} he still had the dry fever.|$|E
500|$|Ellen became {{something}} of a tourist attraction for Turville. She was visited by journalists, medical professionals, religious personnel and the [...] "plain curious" [...] from across the country, many of whom donated money to Ellen's family {{to be allowed to}} see her. Some paid to take cuts of Ellen's hair, until the [...] "supply" [...] began to run out. A Bucks Free Press journalist recounted his visit: Her breathing was regular and natural, the skin soft and the body warm, as in a healthy subject; the pulse rather fast. The hands were small and thin, but the fingers quite flexible; the body somewhat emaciated; the feet and legs like those of a dead child, almost ice cold... the aspect of her features was pleasant, more so than might be expected under the circumstances... her eyes and <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> sunken, and the appearance was that of death... but although there was no colour on her cheeks, the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death.|$|E
2500|$|The crank <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> used as {{main bearing}} journals, and were [...] in diameter. This was {{necessary}} to keep the crankshaft length {{the same as the}} 1A-1500 engine so that 1A-1500 components could be used, and to keep the weight as low as possible. The single piece crankcase was designed to save weight and give maximum strength, but made assembly of the engine difficult. The engine was finished by August 1927.|$|E

2500|$|In 1863 H. B. Tristram, {{wrote about}} the [...] "bright faces and bright colours" [...] he saw there, and the [...] "peculiar" [...] costumes: [...] "long tight gowns, or cassocks, of scarlet silk, with {{diagonal}} yellow stripes, and generally a bright red and blue or yellow jacket over them; while their <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> encircled by dollars and piastres, after Nazareth fashion, {{and some of the}} more wealthy wore necklaces of gold coins, with a doubloon for pendant in front." [...] In 1875 Victor Guérin visited the village, mentioning in his writings that there was a local tradition that alleged that the tomb of Jethro (Neby Chaʾīb), the father-in-law of Moses, was {{to be found in the}} village.|$|E
2500|$|The first prototypes of the ASh-73 {{were built}} in 1945 {{and by the end}} of 1946 testing had {{completed}} successfully. The first models to enter production in 1947 lacked turbo-superchargers. They weighed [...] and had [...] during take-off. The ASh-73TK had two TK-19 turbochargers and an intercooler fitted which were direct copies of the units used on the R-3350. The engine was upgraded over the course of its production. On the fourth series of engines the crankshaft nose was changed, the articulated connecting rods were strengthened and the accessory drive was changed. The middle part of the crankcase and the pistons were strengthened and the ignition was improved in the fifth series. In the sixth series the master connecting rod and the crankshaft <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> strengthened, the pistons were lightened and shortened. For the seventh series exhaust valves with floating seats were introduced and the reduction gearing was improved.|$|E
2500|$|Women often applied toxic {{substances}} to {{their faces and}} chests such as mercury, alum, and ceruse to lighten the skin and remove freckles. [...] However, these products, such as ceruse, a lead derivative severely irritated the skin, leaving women’s faces blemished and burned. [...] Although safer alternatives existed, women preferred the consistency and coverage offered by ceruse. [...] Not all cosmetics were dangerous, many women relied on lotions and balms containing almonds, olive oil, lemon juice, bread crumbs, eggs, honey, rosewater and snake fat to clarify and cleanse the skin. [...] Red lips and rosy <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> achieved primarily {{through the application of}} vermilion; ceruse mixed with organic dyes such as henna and cochineal (a powder made from the ground exoskeleton of insects). [...] In Italy especially, women sought to achieve the light tresses that were viewed as the ideal. [...] Women applied mixtures of lemon juice, alum and white wine and sat in the sun to lighten their hair. [...] In order to produce loose curls, women wrapped hair saturated in gum arabic or beer around clay curlers. [...] Finally, the appearance of a high forehead was achieved by plucking hairs along the hairline, and severely arching or removing the eyebrows altogether. [...] Although at this time, women could not cosmetologically alter the symmetry of their face, or the structure of their nose in order to obtain the ideal, the products available allowed them to come close.|$|E

2500|$|Qizhou {{was a major}} {{fortress}} city situated {{near the}} Yangtze and a 25 thousand strong Jin army advanced on it in 1221. News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand [...] "great leather bombs" [...] (皮大炮), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, {{they were unable to}} match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, [...] "The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb , whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [...] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> exploded to bits, and only one half [...] was left." [...] Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: [...] "The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [...] at the eastern gate, as well as my own quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, {{to the point that they}} struck even on top of [...] sleeping quarters and [...] nearly perished! Some said there was a traitor. If not, how would they have known the way to strike at both of these places?" [...] Zhao was able to examine the new iron bombs himself and described thus, [...] "In shape they are like gourds, but with a small mouth. They are made with pig iron, about two inches thick, and they cause the city's walls to shake." [...] Houses were blown apart, towers battered, and defenders blasted from their placements. Within four weeks all four gates were under heavy bombardment. Finally the Jin made a frontal assault on the walls and scaled them, after which followed a merciless hunt for soldiers, officers, and officials of every level. Zhao managed an escape by clambering over the battlement and making a hasty retreat across the river, but his family remained in the city. Upon returning at a later date to search the ruins, he found that the [...] "bones and skeletons were so mixed up that there was no way to tell who was who." ...|$|E
