5|$|The old Brazilian {{province}} of Cisplatina had become independent Oriental Republic of Uruguay after the Cisplatine War of the 1820s.

5|$|During Artavasdes' imprisonment, a <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> the Parthians later took place, {{which gave}} him the {{opportunity}} to escape prison. He took refuge with Augustus, who received him with friendliness, gave him back his daughter Iotapa and made him a Client King of Lesser Armenia. He died around 20 BC probably in Rome. Artavasdes I was succeeded in the Kingship of Media Atropatene by Asinnalus.|$|E
5|$|In 1628 {{the castle}} site was {{granted by the}} Crown to Giles Clutterbuck; the local gentry complained, leading to a legal {{case in which the}} county {{successfully}} reclaimed the site. In 1642 England descended into a period of <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Worcester's city walls were refortified and a sconce, or small fort, was built on top of the motte of Worcester Castle.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Caldera Bay, or the Sinking of the Blanco Encalada, was an {{engagement}} {{fought in the}} port of Caldera Bay during the 1891 Chilean <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>between</b> Balmacedist and Congressional naval forces on 23 April 1891. It involved two Balmacedist torpedo boats, Almirante Lynch and Almirante Condell, and the Congressional armored frigate Blanco Encalada.|$|E
5|$|The Senate, now {{alarmed at}} the {{apparently}} unstoppable rebellion occurring within Italy, gave {{the task of}} putting down the rebellion to Marcus Licinius Crassus.

5|$|A {{prime example}} of Roman loss in battle was the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where three entire legions led by Publius Quinctilius Varus were {{destroyed}} by Arminius, leader of the Cherusci, an apparent Roman ally. Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany. Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> Arminius and Segestes; they defeated Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.|$|E
5|$|It {{was still}} garrisoned in the mid-1620s and was {{probably}} still in active {{service at the}} start of the English <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>between</b> the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament in 1642. Captain Swaley, a Parliamentary naval commander, seized Netley at the end of that year and decommissioned it as a fortification. During the Interregnum, the castle was restored to use, due to concerns about a potential Royalist invasion, but was abandoned as obsolete after the restoration of Charles II to the throne. By the time that Alexander Pope visited in 1734, the castle was overgrown and in ruins.|$|E

5|$|King Stephen II died {{in early}} 1131. A late sourcethe Ottoman Turkish chronicle known as Tarih-i Üngürüs or The History of the Hungariansnarrates that Béla ascended the throne after his predecessor's nephew, Saul whom Stephen II had {{nominated}} as his heir had died. Béla II was crowned in Székesfehérvár on 28 April, substantiating {{the reliability of}} this report. However, no scholarly consensus on the exact circumstances of Béla's ascension exists. According to Gyula Kristó, Béla was crowned by Archbishop Felician after a <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> his and Saul's partisans, but Pál Engel does not mention any conflict related to Béla's succession.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{was held}} in captivity in a small house in Buda.

The <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> the rebels and the barons loyal to the monarch continued until the sudden death of the young King on 23 November 1457.

5|$|The Edwardian castles {{and town}} walls in Gwynedd were {{built as a}} {{consequence}} of the wars fought for the control of Wales in the late 13th century. The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of the region since the 1070s, with Norman and English nobles and settlers slowly expanding their territories over several centuries. In the 1260s, however, the Welsh leader Llywelyn ap Gruffudd exploited a <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> Henry III and rebel barons in England to become the dominant power, and was formally recognised as the prince of Wales under the Treaty of Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|The Korean War was an {{escalation}} of a <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> two rival Korean regimes, {{each of which}} was supported by external powers, {{with each of the}} regimes trying to topple the other through political and guerrilla tactics. The conflict was expanded by the United States and the Soviet Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950, until the armistice (ceasefire agreement) was signed on July 27, 1953.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Deddington was {{extensively}} {{involved in the}} English <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>between</b> 1641 and 1645, owing to its location on the route between Banbury and Oxford.

The agreement, an attempt to end a <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included provisions that required the removal of all foreign military forces and precluded the use of Lao territory for interfering {{in the internal affairs}} of another country – a blatant effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine.

He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian <b>Civil</b> <b>War,</b> <b>between</b> the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.|$|E
5|$|Akroinon {{was a major}} {{success for}} the Byzantines, {{as it was the}} first {{large-scale}} victory they had scored in a pitched battle against the Arabs. Seeing it as evidence of God's renewed favour, the victory also served to strengthen Leo's belief in the policy of iconoclasm that he had adopted some years before. In the immediate aftermath, this success opened up the way for a more aggressive stance by the Byzantines, who in 741 attacked the major Arab base of Melitene. In 742 and 743, the Umayyads were able to exploit a <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> Constantine V and Artabasdos and raid into Anatolia with relative impunity, but the Arab sources do not report any major achievements.|$|E
