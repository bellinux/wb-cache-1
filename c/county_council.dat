5|$|The local {{authority}} {{of the city was}} the City of Ely Urban District Council from 1894 to 1974. The Isle of Ely <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> governed the Isle of Ely administrative county that surrounding and included the city from 1889 to 1965. In 1965 there was a reform of local government that merged the <b>county</b> <b>council</b> with that of Cambridgeshire to form the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely <b>County</b> <b>Council.</b> In 1974 as part of a national reform of local government, the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> merged with the Huntingdon and Peterborough <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> to form the Cambridgeshire <b>County</b> <b>Council.</b> The City of Ely Urban District Council became the City of Ely Council, a parish council which covers the same area but with fewer powers, and the East Cambridgeshire District Council which covers a wider area.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke {{is part of}} a two-tier local {{government}} structure and returns county councillors to Hampshire <b>County</b> <b>Council.</b> When the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth attained unitary authority status in 1998, Basingstoke became the largest settlement in the county administered by the <b>county</b> <b>council,</b> although it remains the third largest settlement in the ceremonial county.|$|E
5|$|Following the Local Government Act 1888, the {{remaining}} county {{came under the}} control of Middlesex <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> except for the parish of Monken Hadley, which became part of Hertfordshire. The area of responsibility of the Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex was reduced accordingly. Middlesex did not contain any county boroughs, so the county and administrative county (the area of <b>county</b> <b>council</b> control) were identical.|$|E

50|$|<b>County</b> <b>Councils</b> were {{introduced}} in England and Wales on 22 September 1889 by the Local Government Act of 1888. <b>County</b> <b>councils</b> were responsible for their area's strategic services, with smaller urban district councils and rural district councils responsible for other activities. The writ of the <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> did not extend everywhere: county boroughs were independent of the <b>council</b> for the <b>county</b> {{in which they were}} geographically situated, and <b>county</b> borough <b>councils</b> exercised the functions of both <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> and district councils.|$|R

5|$|The Nordland Line {{was first}} {{publicly}} proposed by Ole Tobias Olsen {{in a letter}} to the editor in Morgenbladet in 1872, where he argued for a railway between Trondheim and his home county of Nordland. The same year, Nord-Trøndelag <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> voted in favor to start planning of a railway between Trondheim and Namsos. The <b>county</b> <b>council</b> appointed a railway committee in 1875, who on 23 August 1876 published a report to encourage national authorities to consider the line, which resulted in surveying starting in 1877. On 27 April 1881, the committee made its recommendation to the <b>county</b> <b>council</b> and ceased its work. No planning was done the next three years, until three county councilors, Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen, Peter Theodor Holst and Bernhard Øverland, made a new proposal. However, it was not until 1889 that the <b>county</b> <b>council</b> appointed a new railway committee, which was led by Wexelsen.|$|E
5|$|The {{administrative}} {{county was}} formed in 1974, incorporating most of the historic county of Huntingdonshire. Local government is divided between Cambridgeshire <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> and Peterborough City Council, which is a separate unitary authority. Under the <b>county</b> <b>council,</b> there are five district councils, Cambridge City Council, South Cambridgeshire District Council, East Cambridgeshire District Council, Huntingdonshire District Council and Fenland District Council.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is governed}} locally by a two-tier council system, {{being a part}} of both Lancashire <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> and Wyre Borough Council with both councils having {{different}} responsibilities for the area. Elections are held for Lancashire <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> every four years with elections to Wyre Borough Council also taking place every four years, but two years after the county elections. For borough elections Poulton contains four wards; Breck, Hardhorn, Highcross and Tithebarn. All four wards elect two councillors each to Wyre Borough Council. Poulton-le-Fylde is also a county division for the Lancashire <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> elections which is made up {{of the majority of the}} four wards and elects one councillor to the <b>county</b> <b>council.</b> At the most recent borough election in 2011 the town's four wards each elected two Conservative Party councillors, including the mayor of Wyre for 2011 David Bannister and the current leader of the council Peter Gibson.|$|E
40|$|A purchaser/provider split {{together}} with output- based reimbursement were recently introduced by several Swedish <b>county</b> <b>councils.</b> These {{changes have been}} motivated by arguments of efficiency and consumer choice. This paper tests the null hypothesis that hospital services are provided as efficiently by <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> with internal markets as by <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> with budget reimbursement. We first estimate technical efficiency using data envelopment analysis and then we regress the efficiency scores {{as the dependent variable}} on new internal organisations in a multiple regression by use of pooled cross-section data for the 26 <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> for two years (1993 and 1994). The results reject our null hypothesis and we conclude that the organizational changes in the <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> improve health care efficiency. Our results further indicate that the potential savings in costs due to a hypothetical switch from a budget based allocation to a performance based allocation is about 13 %. We also found some evidence indicating that <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> with a non-socialist political majority are relatively more efficient than those with a socialist regime and that large <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> are more efficient than small <b>county</b> <b>councils.</b> Internal markets; productivity; regression; analysis; pooled data...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish {{health care}} system is to a large extent {{publicly}} managed by 21 local <b>county</b> <b>councils.</b> During recent years there has been a movement were local <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> have opted to allow more of the production to be performed by alternative producers (i. e. private firms, cooperatives etc.). The {{purpose of this paper is}} thus to study if local <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> who has a large proportion of health care performed by alternative producers are more economically efficient than other <b>county</b> <b>councils.</b> The results indicate that <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> with more alternative caregivers are supplying their services more efficiently.

5|$|By April 1970, the British Waterways Board {{had agreed}} to give the canal to Devon <b>County</b> <b>Council,</b> with £30,000 for maintenance. The actual {{contract}} was signed on 5 May 1971 at Tiverton Town Hall, when General Sir Hugh Stockwell of the BWB also handed over a cheque for £38,750 to Colonel Eric Palmer, chairman of Devon <b>County</b> <b>Council.</b> The transfer of the canal was effective from 24 June 1971.|$|E

50|$|Metropolitan {{districts were}} {{originally}} {{parts of a}} two-tier structure of local government, and shared power with the metropolitan <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> (MCCs). They differed from non-metropolitan districts in the division of powers between district and <b>county</b> <b>councils.</b> Metropolitan districts were local education authorities, and were also responsible for social services and libraries, but in non-metropolitan counties these services were the responsibility of <b>county</b> <b>councils.</b>|$|R
5|$|From {{the late}} 1960s, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} {{of the benefits of}} retaining the canal. The Inland Waterways Association produced a report, entitled The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal - Waterway with a Future, suggesting that the canal had the potential for development as a linear Country Park, and the County Planning Officer for Somerset <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> produced a second report, suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration, which the <b>County</b> <b>Council</b> duly adopted. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for such action, and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal as part of the creation of the Brecon Beacons National Park convinced the Council of the wisdom of such a course of action. By 1974, Higher and Lower Maunsel locks, which are listed buildings, had been refurbished by the British Waterways Board, with funding from the <b>County</b> <b>Council.</b> Funding for towpath maintenance and weed cutting was also provided.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Malone married Elinor Lucy (née Penn). The couple would {{eventually}} have five children, {{a daughter and}} four sons.

5000|$|Sweden's entire {{population}} has {{equal access to}} the public health care services. The Swedish {{health care system is}} publicly funded and run by the <b>county</b> <b>councils.</b> The health care system in Sweden is financed primarily through taxes levied by <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> and municipalities. The health care providers of the public system are generally owned by the <b>county</b> <b>councils,</b> although the managing of the hospitals is often done by private companies after a public tender. During the last decade several <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> have started using a Fee-for-service system for primary health care under the name [...] "VårdVal".|$|R
5000|$|The {{elections}} held on 12 April saw a {{very impressive}} performance by the Labour Party, which regained control of the Greater London Council and took control of all six of the new metropolitan <b>county</b> <b>councils.</b> In the rest of England, they won seven <b>county</b> <b>councils,</b> including two of the new [...] "estuary" [...] counties: Cleveland and Humberside.

5|$|In 1998, {{the city}} gained {{autonomy}} from <b>county</b> <b>council</b> control as a unitary authority area, but {{it continues to}} form part of Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes. Policing in the city remains the responsibility of Cambridgeshire Constabulary. The police authority comprises 17 members, including nine councillors, of which seven are nominated by Cambridgeshire <b>county</b> <b>council</b> and two are nominated by Peterborough city council. Firefighting remains the responsibility of Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service. The joint fire authority comprises 17 elected councillors, 13 from Cambridgeshire <b>county</b> <b>council</b> and four from Peterborough city council. Nowadays the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade, one of few of its kind, effectively functions as a retained fire station, responding to calls as directed by Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service.|$|E

40|$|The new Swedish Patient Act, {{which allows}} {{patients}} to choose {{health care in}} <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> other than their own, creates {{the need to be}} able to share health-related information contained in electronic health records [EHRs) across <b>county</b> <b>councils.</b> This demands interoperability in terms of structured and standardized data. Headings in EHR could also be a part of structured and standardized data. The aim was to study to what extent terminology is shared and standardized across <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> in Sweden. Headings from three <b>county</b> <b>councils</b> were analyzed to see to what extent they were shared and to what extent they corresponded to concepts in SNOMED CT and the National Board of Health and Welfare’s term dictionary [NBHW’s TD). In total 41 % of the headings were shared across two or three <b>county</b> <b>councils.</b> A third of the shared headings corresponded to concepts in SNOMED CT.
