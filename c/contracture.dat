5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like <b>contracture.</b> There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} capsular <b>contracture</b> is unknown, but the common {{incidence}} factors include bacterial contamination, device-shell rupture, filler leakage, and hematoma. The surgical implantation procedures that {{have reduced the}} incidence of capsular <b>contracture</b> include submuscular emplacement, the use of breast implants with a textured surface (polyurethane-coated); limited pre-operative handling of the implants, limited contact with the chest skin of the implant pocket before the emplacement of the breast implant, and irrigation of the recipient site with triple-antibiotic solutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{correction}} of capsular <b>contracture</b> might require an open capsulotomy (surgical release) of the collagen-fiber capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, {{of the breast}} implant. Furthermore, in treating capsular <b>contracture,</b> the closed capsulotomy (disruption via external manipulation) once was a common maneuver for treating hard capsules, but now is a discouraged technique, because it can rupture the breast implant.

40|$|Abstract Background Knee flexion <b>contractures</b> {{prevent the}} full {{extension}} of the knee joint and cause disability. The etiology is not well defined. Extended periods of immobilization of joints lead to <b>contractures</b> difficult to completely reverse by rehabilitation treatments. Recovery of the complete range of motion without intervention has not been studied but is of importance to optimize clinical management. This {{study was designed to}} quantify the spontaneous reversibility of knee flexion <b>contractures</b> over time. Methods Knee flexion <b>contractures</b> of increasing severities were induced by internally fixing one knee of 250 adult male rats for 6 increasing durations. The <b>contractures</b> were followed for four different durations of spontaneous recovery up to 48  weeks (24 groups, target n[*]=[*] 10 per group). The angle of knee of extension at a standardized torque was measured. Contralateral knees constituted controls. Results Full reversibility characterized by knee extension similar to controls was only measured in the lowest severity group where 4  weeks of spontaneous recovery reversed early-onset <b>contractures.</b> Spontaneous recovery of 2, 4 and 8  weeks caused partial gain of knee extension in longer-lasting <b>contractures</b> (P[*]≤[*] 0. 05; all 4 comparisons). Extending the durations of spontaneous recovery failed to further improve knee extension (P[*]>[*] 0. 05, all 12 comparisons). No reversal occurred in the highest severity group (32  week; P[*]>[*] 0. 05). Conclusions Reversibility of knee flexion <b>contractures</b> was dependent on their severity. Full spontaneous recovery was limited to the least severe <b>contractures.</b> While <b>contractures</b> initially improved, a plateau was reached beyond which additional durations of spontaneous recovery led to no additional gain of knee extension. These results support our view that without treatment, permanent losses in knee mobility must be anticipated in immobility-induced <b>contractures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective Little {{knowledge}} {{exists on}} the development of elbow flexion <b>contractures</b> in children with obstetrical brachial plexus lesion (OBPL). This study aims to evaluate the prognostic significance of several neuromuscular parameters in infants with OBPL regarding the later development of elbow flexion <b>contractures.</b> Methods Twenty infants with OBPL with insufficient signs of recovery in the first months of life who were neurosurgically reconstructed were included. At a mean age of 4. 6 months, the following neuromuscular parameters were assessed: existence of flexion <b>contractures,</b> cross-sectional area (CSA) of upper arm muscles on MRI, Narakas classification, EMG results, and elbow muscle function using the Gilbert score. In childhood at follow-up at mean age of 7. 7 years, we measured the amount of flexion <b>contractures</b> and the upper arm peak force (Newton). Statistical analysis is used to assess relations between these parameters. Results Flexion <b>contractures</b> of greater than 10 degrees occurred in 55 % of our patient group. The relation between the parameters in infancy and the flexion <b>contractures</b> in childhood is almost nonexistent. Only the Narakas classification was related to the development of flexion <b>contractures</b> in childhood (p = 0. 006). Infant muscle CSA is related to childhood peak muscle force. Conclusion The role of infancy upper arm muscle hypotrophy/hypertrophy, reinnervation, and early elbow muscle function in the development of childhood elbow <b>contractures</b> remains unclear. In this cohort prediction of childhood flexion, <b>contractures</b> were not possible using infancy neuromuscular parameters. We suggest that <b>contractures</b> might be an adaptive process to optimize residual muscle function...|$|R
25|$|Dupuytren's <b>contracture,</b> {{a disease}} of the fasciae in the palm and fingers that {{permanently}} bends the fingers (usually the little and ring fingers) toward the palm, was first noted to be highly prevalent in epileptic people in 1941 by a Dr. Lund, fourteen years before primidone was on the market. Lund also noted that it was equally prevalent in individuals with idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that {{the severity of the}} epilepsy did not matter. However, only one quarter of the women were affected vs. half of the men. Thirty-five years later, Critcheley et al. reported a correlation between how long a patient had had epilepsy and his or her chance of getting Dupuytren's <b>contracture.</b> They suspected that this was due to phenobarbital therapy, and that the phenobarbital was stimulating peripheral tissue growth factors. Dupuytren's <b>contracture</b> is almost exclusively found in Caucasians, especially those of Viking descent, and highest rates are reported in Northern Scotland, Norway, Iceland, and Australia. It has also been associated with alcoholism, heavy smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical trauma (either penetrating in nature or due to manual labor), tuberculosis, and HIV. People with rheumatoid arthritis are less likely to get this, and Drs. Hart and Hooper speculate that this is also true of gout due to the use of allopurinol This is the only susceptibility factor that is generally agreed upon. Anticonvulsants do not seem to increase the incidence of Dupuytren's <b>contracture</b> in non-whites.|$|E

40|$|A 14 -year-old boy was {{suspected}} of having a myopathy with joint <b>contractures.</b> He presented with progressive painless joint <b>contractures</b> of his right wrist and fingers, and reduced muscle strength of his right arm, without obvious skin changes. Laboratory investigation showed a normal CK, hypergammaglobulinemia and eosinophilia. Ultrasonography revealed thickened fasciae in the forearm. A full thickness biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis. The <b>contractures</b> diminished quickly with prednisolone and methotrexate. The ultrasound scans 2 years after diagnosis showed improvement, although some thickening of the fasciae was still present, indicating residual changes. In conclusion, eosinophilic fasciitis has {{to be regarded as}} a differential diagnosis of painless joint <b>contractures</b> in children.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hypertonic}} solutions on the caffeine- and KCl-induced <b>contractures</b> of isolated fibers of frog skeletal muscle was tested. Hypertonic solutions, twice the normal osmotic strength, prepared by adding NaCl or sucrose, potentiate the caffeine-induced <b>contractures.</b> The fibers may develop tensions of 3. 6 kg/cm 2 of fiber transverse section. The same hypertonic medium reduced the peak tension of KCl-induced <b>contractures.</b> Thus the hypertonic condition {{does not affect}} the contractile mechanism itself. These findings give further support to the view that the differential effect of hypertonic solution is on the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism. Extracellular calcium is not essentially required for the first few of a series of caffeine-induced <b>contractures</b> either in hypertonic or in isotonic solutions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The clue to {{understanding}} joint <b>contractures</b> rests within the smaller word “contract. ” Something that contracts {{can be said}} to pull up, shorten, or shrink. A contracted joint becomes rigid because the muscles that cross the joint have shortened. This shortening limits a joint's movement. The fluid-filled spaces inside the joint shrink and dry up and are replaced by a network of interwoven fibers. Most often <b>contractures</b> affect the joints important to daily living hips, knees, ankles, wrists and shoulders. So <b>contractures</b> can cause problems with dressing, eating, transferring, sleeping comfortably, using a wheelchair, or doing any tasks that require full joint movement. Problems in any of these areas can decrease a person's independence. <b>Contractures</b> can occur in anyone whose joints have become immobile. They affect nearly everyone who has a SCI, so everyone with a SCI must stay on the alert for signs of stiffening joints. Two basic things can help people prevent <b>contractures.</b> First, people need information. If they know what causes <b>contractures,</b> they'll be more likely to know how to prevent them. Second, they must commit themselves to a routine of good self-care. Taking care of your joint...|$|R
40|$|When <b>contractures</b> were induced in {{isolated}} frog sartorius muscles with 4 mM caffeine, {{there was an}} increase in permeability of the muscle cells to 3 -methylglucose. This observation suggests that the changes in permeability to sugar that are known to occur in electrically stimulated muscles may not be intimately related to the depolarization phase of the tissue response. <b>Contractures</b> that were elicited by exposing the muscles to a high concentration of K+ were also associated with an increased permeability to sugar. As the concentration of 45 Ca in the medium was raised, more 45 Ca entered the muscles during potassium <b>contractures,</b> and the <b>contractures</b> lasted longer, in agreement with the observations of other investigators. There was also a greater change in permeability to sugar when potassium <b>contractures</b> were elicited in the presence of higher concentrations of Ca++. The possibility that the enhanced permeability to sugar may be related to changes in the intracellular concentration of Ca++ is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aim: An {{overview}} {{of a series}} of severe burn <b>contractures</b> in 44 hands reconstructed over a 20 month period with an easy to follow algorithm.
