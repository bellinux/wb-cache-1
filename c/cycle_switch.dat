40|$|The species Beta vulgaris {{encompasses}} {{wild and}} cultivated members {{with a broad}} range of phenological development. The annual life cycle is commonly found in wild beets, which germinate, bolt and flower within one season. Biennials such as sugar beet require prolonged exposure to cold temperature over winter to acquire floral competence. Sugar beet is the only sucrose-storing crop grown for sugar production in Europe. Flowering time strongly affects yield and is a trait of high agronomic relevance. From Arabidopsis, we learned about the prominent module of CONSTANS (CO) and the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), which induces flowering and appears conserved among various plant species. In beet, two FT paralogs, BvFT 1 and BvFT 2, have been detected, having evolved antagonistic functions. Despite, BOLTING TIME CONTROL 1 (BTC 1) and BvBBX 19, encoding a DOUBLE B-BOX TYPE ZINC FINGER protein, were identified to control life <b>cycle</b> <b>switch</b> in beet. However, a true orthologue of CO has not yet been found. This study aimed at extending the knowledge of the genetic factors behind bolting in Beta species. Mapping of a new bolting locus led to the identification of the btc 1 l allele which caused life <b>cycle</b> <b>switch</b> in beet, due to minor sequence variation in the coding region. Phenotyping of a diverse Beta panel revealed that geographical origin has a strong impact on life cycle adaptation. Haplotype analysis of BTC 1, BvBBX 19, BvFT 1 and BvFT 2 uncovered a high conservation of the protein-domains with regard to SNP occurrence and indicate that domestication of cultivated sugar beets is mainly attributed to BTC 1. The results of this work notably contribute to the knowledge about the evolution of life cycle variation in Beta species under natural conditions and under breeding selection. Moreover, the identified btc 1 l allele may provide a future resource for breeding winter beets...|$|E

In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), mutations in either CCS 52 A 1 or CCS 52 A 2 activators result in a delayed endocycle onset, whereas their overexpression triggers increased DNA ploidy levels. Here, the relative contribution of the APC/C-CCS 52 A 1 and APC/C-CCS 52 A 2 complexes to different developmental processes was studied through analysis of their negative regulators, being the ULTRAVIOLET-B-INSENSITIVE 4 protein and the DP-E 2 F-Like 1 transcriptional repressor, respectively. Our data illustrate cooperative activity of the APC/C-CCS 52 A 1 and APC/C-CCS 52 A 2 complexes during root and trichome development, but functional interdependency during leaf development.

A synthetic promoter containing multiple copies of a MEF 2 D site from Zp, {{in conjunction with a}} CREB/AP- 1 site (ZII) from Zp, exhibits CsA-sensitive inducibility. Furthermore, the Zp MEF 2 D sites were functionally interchangeable with MEF 2 sites derived from heterologous promoters. While no evidence of a NFAT family member binding to either the MEF 2 or CREB/AP- 1 sites was obtained, it could be demonstrated that CsA-sensitive induction of Zp was mediated by calcineurin and NFATc 2 in synergy with either phorbol ester or especially with the EBV-induced Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent kinase type IV/Gr.

However, although the APC/C is highly conserved among eukaryotes, no APC/C inhibitors are known in plants.

The cell <b>cycle</b> <b>switch</b> gene CCS 52 A, a substrate specific activator of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), controls the mitotic arrest and the transition of mitotic cycles to endoreduplication (ER) cycles as part of cell differentiation. Arabidopsis, unlike other organisms, contains 2 CCS 52 A isoforms. Here, we show that both of them are active and regulate meristem maintenance in the root tip, although through different mechanisms. The CCS 52 A 1 activity in the elongation zone of the root stimulates ER and mitotic exit, and contributes to the border delineation between dividing and expanding cells. In contrast, CCS 52 A 2 acts directly in the distal region of the root meristem to control identity of the quiescent center (QC) cells and stem cell maintenance. Cell proliferation assays in roots suggest that this control involves CCS 52 A 2 mediated repression of mitotic activity in the QC cells. The data indicate that the CCS 52 A genes favor a low mitotic state in different cell types of the root tip that is required for meristem maintenance, and reveal a previously undescribed mechanism for APC/C mediated control in plant development...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} automatically verifying that a parameterized family of probabilistic concurrent systems terminates with probability one for all instances against adversarial schedulers. A parameterized family defines an infinite-state system: for each number n, the family consists of an instance with n finite-state processes. In contrast to safety, the parameterized verification of liveness is currently still considered extremely challenging especially {{in the presence of}} probabilities in the model. One major challenge is to provide a sufficiently powerful symbolic framework. One well-known symbolic framework for the parameterized verification of non-probabilistic concurrent systems is regular model checking. Although the framework was recently extended to probabilistic systems, incorporating fairness in the framework - often crucial for verifying termination - has been especially difficult due to the presence of an infinite number of fairness constraints (one for each process). Our main contribution is a systematic, regularity-preserving, encoding of finitary fairness (a realistic notion of fairness proposed by Alur & Henzinger) in the framework of regular model checking for probabilistic parameterized systems. Our encoding reduces termination with finitary fairness to verifying parameterized termination without fairness over probabilistic systems in regular model checking (for which a verification framework already exists).

The butyrate response element was mapped to a consensus Sp 1 -binding site. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays, both Sp 1 and Sp 3 were shown to form complexes in vitro with the ORF 50 promoter at the Sp 1 site. Butyrate induced the formation of a group of novel complexes, including several Sp 3 -containing complexes, one Sp 1 -containing complex, and several other complexes that were not identified with antibodies to Sp 1 or Sp 3. Formation of all butyrate-induced DNA-protein complexes was mediated by the consensus Sp 1 site. In insect and mammalian cell lines, Sp 1 significantly activated the ORF 50 promoter linked to luciferase. Chromatin immunoprecipita-tion experiments in a PEL cell line showed that butyrate induced Sp 1, CBP, and p 300 binding to the ORF 50 promoter in vivo in an on-off manner. The results suggest that induction of the KSHV lytic cycle by butyrate is mediated through interactions at the Sp 1 /Sp 3 site located 103 to 112 nucleotides upstream of the transla-tional initiation of ORF 50 presumably by enhancing the binding of Sp 1 to this site...|$|E

Although Notch pathway is involved in numerous important aspects of oogenesis in invertebrate species, whether it plays roles in early oogenesis events in mammals is unknown. Therefore, the rationale {{of the present study}} was to investigate the roles of Notch signaling in crucial processes of early oogenesis, such as meiosis entry and early oocyte growth. Notch receptors and ligands were localized in mouse embryonic female gonads and 2 Notch inhibitors, namely DAPT and L- 685, 458, were used to attenuate its signaling in an in vitro culture system of ovarian tissues from 12. 5 days post coitum (dpc) fetus. The results demonstrated that the expression of Stra 8, a master gene for germ cell meiosis, and its stimulation by retinoic acid (RA) were reduced after suppression of Notch signaling, and the other meiotic genes, Dazl, Dmc 1, and Rec 8, were abolished or markedly decreased. Furthermore, RNAi of Notch 1 also markedly inhibited the expression of Stra 8 and SCP 3 in cultured female germ cells. The increased methylation status of CpG islands within the Stra 8 promoter of the oocytes was observed in the presence of DAPT, indicating that Notch signaling is probably necessary for maintaining the epigenetic state of this gene in a way suitable for RA stimulation. Furthermore, in the presence of Notch inhibitors, progression of oocytes through meiosis I was markedly delayed. At later culture periods, the rate of oocyte growth was decreased, which impaired subsequent primordial follicle assembly in cultured ovarian tissues. Taken together, these results suggested new roles of the Notch signaling pathway in female germ cell meiosis progression and early oogenesis events in mammals...|$|E

Plants were grown under different day length regimes with and without vernalization. Haplotype analysis of BTC 1, BvBBX 19, BvFT 1, and BvFT 2 was performed to identify natural diversity of these genes and their impact on flowering.

I identify epigenetic modifications that occur on histone proteins at promoters of SBF and MBF genes during the cell cycle. The histone deacetylase Rpd 3 has also been investigated as to the role it plays in regulating G 1 /S transcription. Finally, I have identified a new class of G 1 /S genes, named switch genes, which are regulated independently by G 1 /S transcription factors during different phases of the cell <b>cycle.</b> <b>Switch</b> genes are regulated by SBF during G 1 and MBF upon entry into S phase, and are enriched for dosage sensitive and replication induced G 1 /S genes.

In addition, through switching a potential defect in one of the transcriptional factor complexes will not result in overexpression of these genes.

QC cells divide with a three- to ten-fold lower frequency than mitotically active root cells (2, 5 – 7). Combined with the suppression of stem cell differentiation, a low QC proliferation rate is fundamental to maintain root structure and meristem function (7).

The cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2) gene was one of the host cell genes that was highly up-regulated at 2 and 4 h postinfection (p. i.) of HMVEC-d and HFF cells (P. P. Naranatt, H. H. Krishnan, S. R. Svojanovsky, C. Bloomer, S. Mathur, and B. Chandran, Cancer Res. 64 : 72 - 84, 2004). Since COX- 2 is an important mediator of inflammatory and angiogenic responses, here, using real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence assays, we characterized the COX- 2 stimulation and its role in KSHV infection. KSHV induced a robust COX- 2 expression, which reached a maximum at 2 h p. i. in HMVEC-d cells and at 8 h p. i. in HFF cells, and significantly higher levels were continuously detected for up to 72 h p. i. Constitutive COX- 1 protein levels were not modulated by KSHV infection. Moderate levels of COX- 2 were also induced by UV-irradiated KSHV and by envelope glycoproteins gB and gpK 8. 1 A; however, viral gene expression appears to be essential for the increased COX- 2 induction. High levels of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), a COX- 2 product, were released in the culture supernatant medium of infected cells. PGE 2 synthase, catalyzing the biosynthesis of PGE 2, also increased upon infection and inhibition of COX- 2 by NS- 398, and indomethacin drastically reduced the levels of PGE 2 and PGE 2 synthase. COX- 2 inhibition did not affect KSHV binding, internalization of virus, or the trafficking to the infected cell nuclei. However, latent ORF 73 gene expression and ORF 73 promoter activity were significantly reduced by COX- 2 inhibitors, and this inhibition was relieved by exogenous supplementation with PGE 2. In contrast, lytic ORF 50 gene expression and ORF 50 promoter activity were unaffected. These studies demonstrate that COX- 2 and PGE 2 play roles in facilitating latent viral gene expression and the establishment and maintenance of latency and suggest that KSHV has evolved to utilize the inflammatory responses induced during infection of endothelial cells for the maintenance of viral latent gene expression...|$|E
