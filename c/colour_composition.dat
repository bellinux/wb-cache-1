6000|$|However, I wander wild--by which I mean I {{look too}} far ahead; my {{intention}} having been only {{to let my}} sense of the merciless June beauty of Naples Bay at the sunset hour and on the island terrace associate itself with the whole inexpressible taste of our two motor-days' feast of scenery. That queer question of the exquisite grand manner as the most emphasised all of things--of what it may, seated so predominant in nature, insidiously, through the centuries, let generations and populations [...] "in for," [...] hadn't in the least waited for the special emphasis I speak of to hang about me. I must have found myself more or less consciously entertaining it by the way--since how couldn't it be of {{the very essence of}} the truth, constantly and intensely before us, that Italy is really so much the most beautiful country in the world, taking all things together, that others must stand off and be hushed while she speaks? Seen thus in great comprehensive iridescent stretches, it is the incomparable wrought fusion, fusion of human history and mortal passion with the elements of earth and air, of <b>colour,</b> <b>composition</b> and form, that constitutes her appeal and gives it the supreme heroic grace. The chariot of fire favours fusion rather than promotes analysis, and leaves much of that first June picture for me, doubtless, a great accepted blur of violet and silver. The various hours and successive aspects, the different strong passages of our reverse process, on the other hand, still figure for me even as some series of sublime landscape-frescoes-- if the great Claude, say, had ever used that medium--in the immense gallery of a palace; the homeward run by Capua, Terracina, Gaeta and its storied headland fortress, across the deep, strong, indescribable Pontine Marshes, white-cattled, strangely pastoral, sleeping in the afternoon glow, yet stirred by the near sea-breath. Thick somehow to the imagination as some full-bodied sweetness of syrup is thick to the palate the atmosphere of that region--thick with the sense of history and the very taste of time; as if the haunt and home (which indeed it is) of some great fair bovine aristocracy attended and guarded by halberdiers {{in the form of the}} mounted and long-lanced herdsmen, admirably congruous with the whole picture at every point, and never more so than in their manner of gaily taking up, as with bell-voices of golden bronze, the offered wayside greeting.|$|E

Biomorphic forms with supple, non-geometric outlines appear in his paintings—forms which suggest microscopic organisms but express the artist's inner life.

50|$|However, he is {{best known}} for his {{illustrations}} for children's books, most frequently for texts by Georges Montorgueil. His major <b>colour</b> <b>compositions</b> contributed to the cult of 'heroes of the nation' such as Napoleon I and Joachim Murat. Several of his illustrations appear in La Vieille Garde impériale (The Old Imperial Guard), published in 1932 by Alfred Mame and fils de Tours. His eye for detail can be seen in L'Épopée du costume militaire français - even in works intended for children, he tried to reproduce uniforms with extreme precision.|$|R

In this way, it has been possible to replace synthetic colours with natural one. Herbal Gulal can be manufactured at higher scale and people who were scared about synthetic powders can now enjoy rituals with no restrictions.|$|E

50|$|The {{stones were}} {{sometimes}} engraved or were instead distinctive {{in terms of}} <b>colour,</b> <b>composition</b> or shape. The use of these stones may relate to the common practice of using boundary stones to establish precise limits to areas of land ownership but differ in that the proof of the land ownership was invested in them. Being stone they had a permanence that gave them an advantage over charters written on vellum, etc. An essential element was that the stone in question had once belonged to the donor and was next held by the grantee. The size, weight and individuality of charter stones helped {{to ensure that they}} were not easily stolen or moved any significant distance.|$|E
5000|$|By {{means of}} squares, Parris began {{to draw the}} {{outlines}} in chalk, on a scale 16-times larger each way, or, in other words, 256-times {{the area of the}} original drawings. This was a work of much labour, and demanding close attention; but it was, nevertheless, completed by the following April. The painting (in oil) was then started. Hornor engaged several artists to assist Parris in the undertaking, but progress was slow and unsatisfactory due to their unfamiliarity with the type of work required. There were also problems of consistency of <b>colour,</b> <b>composition</b> etc.,and on several occasions it was necessary to repaint sections. Eventually, Parris decided to take charge and do the whole thing himself with the assistance of several house-painters; this proved to be the right choice.|$|E

50|$|Niğde is {{the market}} {{place for the}} {{surrounding}} area, and many rugs woven in the surrounding villages are sold under the trade name of Niğde. If a prayer rug design is used, the niche and spandrels are typically tall and narrow. Likewise, the central field is not substantially larger than the main border. Typical for Taşpınar are elongated, almost ogival central medallions, the dominant colours are warm red, blue, and light green. Fertek rugs are distinguished by their simple, floral ornaments. The main field is often not separated from the main border, as usual, by a smaller secondary border. The outermost secondary border often has reciprocal crenellation patterns. The <b>colour</b> <b>composition</b> often contains soft reds, dark olive greens, and blue. Maden rugs used coccineal red for their main fields, which are narrow and slim, as typical for Niğde rugs. The foundation of their main border is often dyed in corrosive brown, which caused deterioration of the carpet pile in these areas, and produces a relief effect. Yahali is a regional center and market place for its surroundings. Carpets from this region often have a hexagonal central medallion, with double-hooked ornaments {{in the fields and}} carnations in the main border.|$|E
