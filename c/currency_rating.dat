40|$|Mind the gap: {{domestic}} versus {{foreign currency}} sovereign ratings 1 Over the past decade, {{it has become}} common practice for rating agencies to assign a domestic <b>currency</b> <b>rating</b> to the debt of sovereign nationals {{in addition to a}} foreign currency one. Often the domestic rating is higher, reflecting the presumed greater ability and willingness of sovereigns to service debt denominated in their own currency. However, the gap between the two ratings is neither omnipresent nor uniform. These rating differences are likely to have increasingly important implications for the development of global capital markets. Many governments have embraced the goal of developing local currency bond markets as an alternative to inflows of foreign capital, 2 and differential rating policies for foreign and domestic currency debt are likely to reinforce this policy intention through their effect on investor acceptance and market pricing.

40|$|Summary We predict {{sovereign}} ratings {{for developing countries}} {{that do not have}} risk ratings from agencies such as Fitch, Moody's, and Standard and Poor's. Ratings are important in determining the volume and cost of capital flows to developing countries through international bond, loan, and equity markets. Sovereign rating also acts as a ceiling for the foreign <b>currency</b> <b>rating</b> of sub-sovereign borrowers and can be important for their access to international debt and equity capital. We generate shadow ratings for several developing countries that have never been rated and find that unrated countries are not always {{at the bottom of the}} rating spectrum. Several of them are projected to have a "B" or higher rating, in a similar range to that of the emerging market economies with capital market access. developing countries sovereign rating country risk development finance...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} rating change timing {{differences between the two}} leading agencies, namely, Standard and Poor&# 039;s and Moody&# 039;s with particular focus on the stock market impact of Standard and Poor&# 039;s Foreign <b>Currency</b> <b>rating</b> changes and Moody&# 039;s Bonds and Notes rating changes. The analysis focuses on whether there is a rating change pattern between these agencies and undertakes a comparison of the impact of rating changes on the markets between single rating changes and joint rating changes. The paper equally determines whether rating changes induce different reactions depending on the level of rating. The findings indicate that in contrast to the results obtained in previous literature, rating change announcements do not impart additional information to the market. An interesting finding is that joint downgrades seem to impact on the market only in-between the announcement dates for the two agencies. In addition, the reason of the rating change needs to be taken into consideration to assess the stock market reaction to rating changes...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{attempt to}} predict {{sovereign}} ratings {{for developing countries}} {{that do not have}} risk ratings from agencies such as Fitch, Moody’s, and Standard and Poor’s. Ratings affect capital flows to developing countries through international bond, loan and equity markets. Sovereign rating also acts as a ceiling for the foreign <b>currency</b> <b>rating</b> of sub-sovereign borrowers. As of the end of 2006, however, only 86 developing countries have been rated by the rating agencies. Of these, 15 countries have not been rated since 2004. Nearly 70 developing countries have never been rated. The results indicate that the unrated countries are not always {{at the bottom of the}} rating spectrum. Several unrated poor countries appear to have a ‘B ’ or higher rating, in a similar range as the emerging market economies with capital market access. Drawing on the literature, the analysis presents a stylized relationship between borrowing costs and the credit rating of sovereign bonds. The launch spread rises as the credit rating deteriorates, registering a sharp rise at the investment grade threshold. Based on these findings, a case can be made in favor of helping poor countries obtain credit ratings not only for sovereign borrowing, but for sub-sovereign entities ' access to international debt and equity capital. The rating model along with the stylized relationship between spreads and ratings can be useful for securitization and other financial structures, and for leveraging official aid, for improving borrowing terms in poor countries...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2010. As major {{corporate}} entities {{are investing}} into Sub-Saharan Africa and other African countries {{at a fast}} pace, percentages like the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the impairment discount rate, are becoming important measurements of assessing current investments for impairment and/or proposals of future capital investments. One of the important constituents of these percentages is the country/equity risk premium. The country risk premium {{can be defined as}} the price for taking risk for investing in that specific country. A widely used method to determine the country risk premium is to multiply the country bond default spread with an equity to bond market risk adjustment. Country bond default spreads are the spreads that investors charge for buying bonds issued by the country. These ratings measure default risk, rather than equity risk, but they are affected by many factors that drive equity risk, like the stability of a country’s currency, the budget and trade balances and the political stability. Analysis that uses spreads as a measure of country risk, usually adds them to both the cost of equity and debt of entities that trade in that country. There are several ways in determining the bond default spreads, but it is most often done in a random and unsystematic manner. Two of the major obstacles in determining these spreads for countries, especially countries of sub-Saharan Africa, are when countries do not issue bonds in another currency such as Euro or US dollar and/or do not have a sovereign credit rating. What could also be a measure of country risk, are the two major country risk polls conducted globally: 1) Euromoney Country Risk Poll; and 2) PRS (Political Risk Group) Composite Risk Ratings. Most of sub-Saharan African countries form part of these risk polls. The usefulness of the PRS scores as a measure of country risk has been previously examined to find that they are correlated with the cost of capital of emerging markets. The aim of the research is to overcome the obstacles in determining default spreads for countries such as sub-Saharan Africa where bond markets are inactive and/or sovereign credit ratings are not assigned, by deriving a predictive model. The predictive model is derived by analysing the relationship between the available estimated default spreads that are assigned to a specific country, depending on their Moody’s sovereign local <b>currency</b> <b>rating</b> and the countries’ respective country risk scores conducted by Euromoney and PRS respectively. The stability of the relationship is also analysed by comparing the prediction of the sub-Saharan’s Africa default spreads based on the 2010 predictive model to the analyses conducted on 2008 data sets. Other similar models have been developed, but this model is focused on the total risk score of a country and not only on the credit risk or related constituents. One of the definitions of country risk is that it relates to the likelihood that changes in the business environment will occur that reduce the profitability of doing business in a country, which can negatively affect operating profits as well as the value of assets. One can conclude that this derived model is a good reflection of prevailing political and economic stability of the countries and a useful measure of country risk {{that can be used in}} assessing the profitability of current investments in a specific country and for proposals of future capital investments. Key words: Country bond default spreads, Sovereign credit ratings, Euromoney risk scores, PRS composite ratings, sub-Saharan African countries...|$|E
