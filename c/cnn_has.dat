The company has 42 bureaus (11 domestic, 31 international), more than 900 affiliated local stations (which also receive news and features content via the video newswire service CNN Newsource), and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world. The channel's success made a bona-fide mogul of founder Ted Turner and set the stage for conglomerate Time Warner's eventual acquisition of the Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.|$|E
500|$|On November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party {{executive}} council voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. [...] "The {{general sense of}} the council was that he wasn't a serious candidate {{and that was why}} he wasn't selected to be on the ballot", stated John Werner, the party's director. In addition, he was declared [...] "not viable", as he was running in only one state. Several days later he announced that he was dropping out of the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle. <b>CNN</b> <b>has</b> reported that Obama supporters pressured the South Carolina Democratic Executive Council to keep Colbert off the ballot. One anonymous member of the council told CNN that former State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum had placed pressure on them to refuse Colbert's application despite his steady rise in polls.|$|E

At the end of the film, a message is displayed saying that reports of testing of BZ, NATO code for a deliriant and hallucinogen known as 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, on U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War were denied by the Pentagon. Lyne said a part of the inspiration for this motif was Martin A. Lee's book , but noted that [...] "nothing in the book suggests that the drug BZ — a super-hallucinogen that has a tendency to elicit maniac behavior — was used on U.S. troops."

30|$|The use of <b>CNNs</b> <b>has</b> gained much {{popularity}} recently {{within the}} field. This popularity can partly {{be attributed to}} the availability of large datasets and high performance, affordable computational hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs). The use of <b>CNNs</b> <b>have</b> also increased after the significant increase in ImageNet classification performance achieved by Krizhevsky et al. [51] with AlexNet. Many of the current leading classifiers on benchmark datasets such as MNIST [22, 52], CIFAR- 10 [53, 54], and CIFAR- 100 [53, 55] are based on <b>CNNs.</b> This <b>has</b> been particularly evident in computer vision where CNNs or deep learning has provided effective solutions for face detection, facial landmark prediction, and other problems.|$|R
30|$|Deep {{learning}} schemes, especially convolutional {{neural network}} (<b>CNN),</b> <b>have</b> been successfully used in face analysis tasks including face detection, face alignment [204], face verification [205], and demographic estimation [206]. Wang et al. [207] extracted feature maps obtained in different layers as age features based on deep learning model. Huerta et al. [135] provide a thorough evaluation on deep learning for age estimation using fused features and compare it with hand-crafted fusion features. <b>CNN</b> <b>have</b> been used in different recent studies on age estimation and have demonstrated superior performance compared to other methods. Niu et al. [208] used ordinal regression and multiple output CNN for age estimation and reported a MAE of 3.27 on MORPH II and a private Asian Face Age Dataset (AFAD). Chen et al. [209] presented a cascaded <b>CNN</b> that <b>had</b> 0.297 Gaussian error on age estimation. As further demonstrated in [210 – 212], <b>CNN</b> <b>have</b> posted better results in age estimation tasks. Although CNN performs better than other traditional methods, their applicability is limited by high processing demand required for their implementation. Table  3 shows a summary of studies in age-group and age estimation.|$|R

2500|$|<b>CNN</b> <b>has</b> {{often been}} the subject of {{allegations}} of liberal bias. In research conducted by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the authors found disparate treatment by the three major cable networks of Republican and Democratic candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007: [...] "The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates – by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain faring the worst (63% negative) and Romney faring a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. With the exception of Obama, Democrats tended not to fare well either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator’s stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative, but both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. While Democrats on average tended to have more positive coverage, the trend was skewed by particularly positive coverage of Obama." ...|$|E
