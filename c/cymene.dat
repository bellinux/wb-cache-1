50|$|Ascaridole was the first, {{and for a}} {{long time}} only, {{discovered}} naturally occurring organic peroxide. It was isolated from Chenopodium oil and named by Hüthig in 1908, who described its explosive character and determined its chemical formula as C10H16O2. Hüthig also noted the indifference of ascaridole to aldehydes, ketones or phenols that characterized it as non-alcohol. When reacted with sulfuric acid, or reduced with zinc powder and acetic acid, ascaridole formed <b>cymene.</b> These results were confirmed in a detailed study by E. K. Nelson in 1911, in particular that ascaridole explodes upon heating, reacting with sulfuric, hydrochloric, nitric, or phosphoric acids. Nelson showed that the new substance contained neither a hydroxyl nor a carbonyl group and that upon reduction with iron(II) sulfate it formed a glycol, now known as ascaridole glycol, C10H18O3. The glycol is more stable than ascaridole and has a higher melting point of about 64 °C, boiling point of 272 °C, and density of 1.098 g/cm3. Nelson also predicted the chemical structure of ascaridole which was almost correct, but had the peroxide bridge not along the molecular axis, but between the other, off-axis carbon atoms. This structure was corrected by Otto Wallach in 1912.|$|E

Aggregates containing the -NH 2 functionality (1 and 3) interact strongly with NBu 4 PF 6 {{as demonstrated by}} the observation of intense nuclear Overhauser effects between the fluorine atoms of PF 6 - and the protons of [RuCl(AA) (<b>cymene)</b> ]. Unexpectedly, diffusion NMR measurements indicate that the average size of the aggregates increases when a small amount of NBu 4 PF 6 is added (C-salt/C-Ru < 0. 1) in CD 2 Cl 2. At higher concentration levels of NBu 4 PF 6 or in CDCl 3, NBu 4 PF 6 exerts a destructive effect that reduces the average size of the aggregates. [RuCl(AA) (<b>cymene)</b> ](n) aggregates with NR-H (4) and NR 2 (2) functionalities are little affected by the addition of NBu 4 PF 6. KPF 6 also interacts with [RuCl(AA) (<b>cymene)</b> ](n) aggregates {{as demonstrated by the}} fact that it becomes noticeably soluble in CDCl 3 and CD 2 Cl 2.

40|$|The natural {{antimicrobial}} compound carvacrol shows a high {{preference for}} hydrophobic phases. The partition coefficients of carvacrol in both octanol-water and liposome-buffer phases were determined (3. 64 and 3. 26, respectively).

Maximum expansion was observed after the addition of 0. 50 μmol of carvacrol/mg of l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine. <b>Cymene,</b> a biological precursor of carvacrol which lacks a hydroxyl group, was found to have a higher preference for liposomal membranes, thereby causing more expansion.

40|$|Abstract Background Outbreaks of food {{poisoning}} associated with drinking un-pasteurised apple juice contaminated with enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 are {{a cause of}} serious illness and occasionally death. Whilst a well-established heat process (pasteurisation) will readily eliminate the pathogen, some consumers are demanding more fresh-like foods {{that have not been}} subjected to processing methods that are perceived as severe and may lead to loss of flavour and vitamins. Therefore, alternative methods are being investigated to replace pasteurisation and improve the safety of minimally-processed juices. The addition of natural antimicrobial substances such as the phenolic substances carvacrol and p- <b>cymene</b> (derived from the essential oils of herbs and spices) provides a potential new route to assure safety and extend the shelf-life of raw fruit juices. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the addition of very low concentrations (0. 25 – 1. 25 mM) of carvacrol and p- <b>cymene</b> both individually and in combination as a novel means of controlling Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in un-pasteurised apple juice. Results When inoculated at a level of 4 log CFU/ml into un-pasteurised apple juice (pH 3. 20 ± 0. 06), Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 survived for up to 3 and 19 days at 25 ° and 4 °C, respectively. Treatment of the juice with 1. 25 mM carvacrol or p- <b>cymene</b> reduced the numbers of E. coli O 157 :H 7 to undetectable levels within 1 – 2 days at both storage temperatures. The effective concentrations of carvacrol could be reduced even further by combining it at 0. 5 mM with <b>cymene</b> at 0. 25 mM. The phenolic compounds were biocidal against both spoilage yeasts and E. coli O 157 :H 7 thereby increasing the shelf-life and improving the safety of un-pasteurised apple juice, particularly when stored at chill temperatures. Conclusion The results showed that the natural antimicrobial compounds carvacrol and p-cymene could potentially be used to extend the shelf life and improve the safety margins in un-pasteurised chilled fruit juices. </p...|$|E

No report in the literature {{has been found in}} which a case of aplastic anemia may have been caused by exposure to products of the sulfite pulp industry. The history revealed that symptoms of intoxication were present for some 17 months prior to seeking medical aid. The patient for some 20 years was manager of a pulp and paper company which makes paper pulp by the Mitscherlich or sulfite process, in which wood chips and calcium bisulfite enter large digesters or autoclaves and emerge finally as sulfite pulp. He was almost daily exposed to fumes at times of high concen-tration in closed areas and was constantly handling and frequently seen chewing pieces of sulfite pulp. Many industrial studies have been made of the toxicological effects of the more commonly used chemicals. Such studies will not of necessity apply di-rectly to the paper industry in which the contaminating chemical substances are not clearly identified and the actual amounts of toxic constituents may be so small as to be estimated with difficulty. Among the possible toxic materials in a sulfite pulp mill are the relief gases from the digester.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of <b>cymene</b> with dioxygen {{has been}} investigated in some detail with the view of establishing the feasibility of improving {{the efficiency of the}} oxidation process. Of particular interest were the rate of <b>cymene</b> oxidation and the selectivity of the oxidation process for the tertiary <b>cymene</b> hydroperoxide, especially at conversions above 15 %. In {{order to be able to}} evaluate the selectivity of oxidation processes, a reliable method for analysis of the individual hydroperoxides had to be established. Two methods were investigated, namely reduction of the hydroperoxides to alcohols using ferrous sulphate and reduction using triphenylphosphine, and analysing the reduction products by gas chromatography. Of these two methods, the triphenylphosphine method proved to be superior to the ferrous sulphate method and was used as the method of choice for this investigation. A number of oxidation systems were evaluated in an initial screening experiment for the oxidation of p-cymene. The results of this screening experiment showed that three-phase oxidation systems, i. e. systems containing an organic phase, an aqueous phase and gas, gave significantly lower activities than two-phase oxidation systems. In addition, the use of a base in the aqueous layer does not improve the overall selectivity of the oxidation process, but improves the selectivity towards the tertiary hydroperoxide to some extent due to the decomposition and extraction of primary hydroperoxide into the basic aqueous phase. Oxidation systems using a non-autoxidation catalyst, i. e. a catalyst that does not catalyse the conventional autoxidation of organic compounds, gave by far the most promising results. These systems gave both a high selectivity as well as high reaction rate. From the initial screening experiment, and using multi-factorial statistical techniques, two catalyst systems were selected for investigation, namely vanadium phosphate and boron phosphate. The results of these investigations showed that these two catalysts are remarkably active and selective for the oxidation of p-cymene, giving the <b>cymene</b> tertiary hydroperoxide in selectivities exceeding 85 % and at substrate conversions as high as 25 %.
