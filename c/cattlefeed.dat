50|$|The small, rounded corms have a crisp, {{white flesh}} {{and may be}} eaten raw, {{slightly}} boiled, or grilled, and often are pickled or tinned. They are a popular ingredient in Chinese dishes. In China, they are most often eaten raw, sometimes sweetened. They also may be ground into a flour form used for making water chestnut cake, which is common as part of dim sum cuisine. They are unusual among vegetables for remaining crisp even after being cooked or canned, because their cell walls are cross-linked and strengthened by certain phenolic compounds, such as oligomers of ferulic acid. This property is shared by other vegetables that remain crisp in this manner, including the tiger nut and lotus root. The corms contain the antibiotic agent puchiin, which is stable to high temperature. Apart from the edible corms, the leaves {{can be used for}} <b>cattlefeed,</b> mulch or compost.|$|E
5000|$|Agriculture is {{the main}} source of income. Coconut, Banana, Nut mug, pepper, ginger etc. are the main {{agricultural}} products. Previously there were many paddy fields in this area but presently those are converted to coconut farms due to cost increase and non availability of people to work in paddy fields.KERALA FEEDS, which manufactures <b>cattlefeed,</b> provide many skilled jobs directly and indirectly to residents as well as nearby villages [...]The Kallettumkara Service Cooperative Bank, which is Class 1 Super grade Bank, have been serving since decades and still serves the financial need of the public of Kallettumkara and nearby. The other banking institutions are Canara Bank and Federal bank [...] The remittance from NRI's from Middle East contributes mainly for the regional development. The place can boast of a vibrant entrepreneur culture.There is a Railway Station here where all the passenger and most of the Express trains stop.|$|E
40|$|Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) clearly {{originated in the}} UK, where there have now been more than 180 000 cases. However, through the exportation of cattle and <b>cattlefeed</b> additives from the UK, BSE also became established {{to a lesser extent}} in other European countries. There is current concern that BSE might have been distributed more widely {{as a result of the}} exportation of cattle or BSE-infected feed or foodstuff not only from the UK but also from other European countries that later became affected. It is now recognized that the transmissible agent that causes BSE also causes a new variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans, and the evidence for this is presented. This probably resulted from dietary exposure to the bovine agent, and the potential role of mechanically recovered meat is discussed. There is a brief discussion on the controversial issue of the nature of the causal agents of diseases like BSE and vCJD. Whether or not sheep or goats could have become infected with BSE, and whether they represent a human health hazard, is also debated. Finally, the question of the control of BSE, and consequently vCJD, is discussed with regard to the rigorous application of the relevant regulations...|$|E
40|$|Tritium is the {{radioactive}} isotope of hydrogen. It {{can be integrated}} into most biological molecules. Eventhough its radiotoxicity is weak, the effects of tritium can be increased following concentration in criticalcompartments of living organisms. For {{a better understanding of}} tritium circulation in the environmentand to highlight transfer constants between compartments, we studied the tritiation of different agriculturalmatrices chronically exposed to tritium. Milk {{is one of the most}} frequently monitored foodstuffs in the vicinity of points known for chronicrelease of radionuclides firstly because dairy products find their way into most homes but also because itintegrates deposition over large areas at a local scale. It is a food which contains all the main nutrients,especially proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. We thus studied the tritium levels of milk in chronicexposure conditions by comparing the tritiation of the main hydrogenated components of milk, first,component by component, then, sample by sample. Significant correlations were found between thespecific activities of drinking water and free water of milk as well as between the tritium levels of <b>cattlefeed</b> dry matter and of the main organic components of milk. Our findings stress the importance of themetabolism on the distribution of tritium in the different compartments. Overall, dilution of hydrogen in the environmental compartments was found to play an important roledimming possible isotopic effects even in a food chain chronically exposed to tritium...|$|E
