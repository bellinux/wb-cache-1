5000|$|It was {{realized}} that a large water Čerenkov detector could be an ideal neutrino detector, for several reasons. First, the enormous volume possible in a water Čerenkov detector can overcome {{the problem of the}} very small cross section of the 5-15 MeV solar neutrinos. Second, water Čerenkov detectors offer real time event detection. This meant that Individual neutrino-electron interaction candidate events could be studied on an event-by-event basis, starkly different from the month-to-month observation required in radiochemical experiments. Third, in the neutrino-electron scattering interaction the electron recoils in roughly the direction that the neutrino was travelling (similar to the motion of billiard balls), so the electrons [...] "point back" [...] to the sun. Fourth, neutrino-electron scattering is an elastic process, so the energy distribution of the neutrinos can be studied, further testing the solar model. Fifth, the characteristic [...] "ring" [...] produced by Čerenkov radiation allows discrimination of the signal against backgrounds. Finally, since a water Čerenkov experiment would use a different target, interaction process, detector technology, and location {{it would be a very}} <b>complementary</b> <b>test</b> of Davis's results.|$|E

40|$|Fluorometric {{quantitative}} tyrosine determination on dried-blood spots is {{the primary}} neonatal screening test used for tyrosinemia type I (HT) {{in the province of}} Quebec. Succinylacetone determination on these same spots is used as the <b>complementary</b> <b>test</b> when the tyrosine level is higher than a given threshold. This procedure has proved to be less discriminant {{over the past few years}} because of changes in newborn feeding and because of early discharge of newborns from the nursery. We have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the deficient enzyme in HT in dried-blood spots. Fumarylacetoacetase (FAH) (E. C. 3. 7. 1. 2) was measured retrospectively by an ELISA on 25 dried-blood samples from proven patients with HT and prospectively in 72, 000 specimens received in the neonatal screening program. In this pilot project, FAH was measured first, and, if necessary, succinylacetone was determined as the <b>complementary</b> <b>test.</b> All 25 samples from proven patients and specimens from four other patients detected in the pilot study have shown almost complete absence of FAH in dried-blood samples. At a cutoff level of 12. 5 % of normal adult blood spotted on the same type of paper, only 30 other cases disclosed FAH levels low enough to warrant succinylacetone measurement but had no detectable succinylacetone. The false-positive rate is thus 1 : 2, 400 with this primary ELISA.
