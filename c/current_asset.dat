2500|$|When {{dealing with}} one's own business, one must set up various {{accounts}} to record all transactions {{that may take}} place. When {{the owner of a}} business refers to their bank account, they are referring to the business's account, not to their personal account. In addition, all accounts referred to in bookkeeping belong to the business, not to other businesses, regardless of their title. For instance, if a business expects to receive money from another person or company and the account is labelled [...] "Receivable A", this does not imply that the account in question belongs to [...] "Receivable A". [...] It is merely a recording of a <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> (a receivable) of one's own business.

Fixed assets refers to assets that cannot be converted into cash easily, like plant, property, equipment etc. A <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> is an item on an entity's balance sheet that is either cash, a cash equivalent, or which can be converted into cash within one year. It is not easy for start ups to forecast the <b>current</b> <b>asset,</b> because there are changes in receivables and payables.|$|E

50|$|Working capital (abbreviated WC) is a {{financial}} metric which represents operating liquidity {{available to a}} business, organisation or other entity, including governmental entity. Along with fixed assets such as plant and equipment, working capital is considered a part of operating capital. Gross working capital is equal to <b>current</b> <b>assets.</b> Working capital is calculated as <b>current</b> <b>assets</b> minus <b>current</b> liabilities. If <b>current</b> <b>assets</b> are less than current liabilities, an entity has a working capital deficiency, also called a working capital deficit.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze {{financial}} performances of 40 selected Romanian companies for the 2009 - 2013 period.

Similarly, larger companies with lower <b>current</b> <b>assets,</b> average inventory and accounts receivable have lower assets turnover. Companies with lower average inventory have higher ROA and assets turnover.

50|$|The goal of {{rebalancing}} is to {{move the}} <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> allocation back in line to the originally planned asset allocation (i.e., their preferred level of risk exposure).

The other three strategies are 1) Buy-and-Hold, 2) Constant-Proportion and 3) Option-Based Portfolio Insurance.|$|E
50|$|When such {{volatility}} has a randomness of its own—often {{described by}} a different equation driven by a different W—the model above is called a stochastic volatility model.

The local volatility model is a useful simplification of the stochastic volatility model.|$|E

50|$|In accounting, a <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> is any asset {{which can}} {{reasonably}} {{be expected to}} be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year or operating cycle (whichever period is longer). Typical current assets include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments (marketable securities), accounts receivable, stock inventory, supplies, and the portion of prepaid liabilities, sometimes referred to as prepaid expenses, which will be paid within a year.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike a stock option, whose {{volatility}} {{exposure is}} contaminated by {{its stock price}} dependence, these swaps provide pure exposure to volatility alone. This is truly the case only for forward starting volatility swaps. However, once the swap has its asset fixings its mark-to-market value also depends on the <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> price. One can use these instruments to speculate on future volatility levels, to trade the spread between realized and implied volatility, or to hedge the volatility exposure of other positions or businesses.|$|E
5000|$|Intrinsic value: This {{is simply}} the {{difference}} between the exercise (strike) price and the underlying stock price. Warrants are also referred to as in-the-money or out-of-the-money, depending on where the <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> price is in relation to the warrant's exercise price. Thus, for instance, for call warrants, if the stock price is below the strike price, the warrant has no intrinsic value (only time value—to be explained shortly). If the stock price is above the strike, the warrant has intrinsic value and is said to be in-the-money.|$|E
