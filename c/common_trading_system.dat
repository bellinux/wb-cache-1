40|$|The 1974 Amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 {{set forth}} {{the goal of}} {{establishing}} a National Market System (NMS) in which all equity trades would be integrated into a common computerized trading system. The paper argues that such a system cannot {{serve the needs of}} all investors—large or small, informed or uninformed. The recently approved Regulation NMS is an attempt to impose such a <b>common</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> onto the equity market. Large institutions with their resources will find ways to evade it and are already fragmenting the market with “dark pools ” of liquidity. This Regulation will certainly result in unintended consequences, {{to the detriment of the}} US equity market. 2 The trading markets for equities and derivatives are in a state of transition. Both the NYSE and NASDAQ are now private corporations and are behaving as such, as both pursue mergers and alliances across the entire world. 2 Investors can increasingly trade the same security anywhere in the world.

40|$|Purpose - As {{part of a}} {{study that}} aimed at {{enhancing}} the future roles and functions of building services (BS) engineers in Hong Kong, a survey was carried out to obtain demographic information about BS practitioners {{as well as their}} views and opinions on a range of issues which affect professional practices of BS engineers and recognition of their contributions by others. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to give a portrait of BS engineers in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - A series of statistical analyses were conducted based on the responses given by the BS practitioners, which included their qualifications, experience, job field, annual income and the number of <b>trades</b> of BS <b>systems</b> that they are competent in and responsible for. Findings - The statistics show that: competence gap exists in that BS engineers are required to handle more <b>trades</b> of BS <b>systems</b> than those they are competent in; and the academic and professional qualifications, years of experience and job position are the key influential factors to the annual income of BS engineers but little differences exist in the average annual income of engineers in different job fields. Originality/value - The competence gap is a concern that needs to be addressed to ensure BS engineers are competent in handling the <b>common</b> <b>trades</b> of BS <b>systems,</b> which is increasingly important for them to perform effectively in integrated professional teams for turning out holistic solutions for sustainable building developments.

On the other hand, arguments based on the anonymity of electronic <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> suggest that adverse selection may be a more severe problem and that, therefore, bid-ask spreads may be higher. The present paper addresses the issue of transaction costs in floor and computerized <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> empirically.

The market share of the electronic <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> is negatively related to the total trading volume of the stock, is positively related to the difference between spreads on the floor and in the screen <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> and is at least partially negatively related to return volatility.
