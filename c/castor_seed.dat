50|$|The <b>castor</b> <b>seed</b> {{contains}} ricin, a toxic protein. Heating {{during the}} oil extraction process denatures and deactivates the protein. However, harvesting castor beans {{may not be}} without risk. Allergenic compounds found on the plant surface can cause permanent nerve damage, making the harvest of castor beans a human health risk. India, Brazil, and China are the major crop producers, and the workers suffer harmful side effects from working with these plants. These health issues, in addition to concerns about the toxic byproduct (ricin) from castor oil production, have encouraged the quest for alternative sources for hydroxy fatty acids. Alternatively, some researchers are trying to genetically modify the castor plant to prevent the synthesis of ricin.|$|E

This study was aimed to determine the effect of pyrolysis temperatures on the pyrolysis product yields and find the optimum temperature of maximum oil yield. Slow pyrolysis of <b>castor</b> <b>seeds</b> were carried out in a semi batch reactor made up of stainless steel at temperature range from 400 °C to 600 at 20 °C/min of heating rate.

40|$|This report {{describes}} biomass {{production and}} compositional changes of developing <b>castor</b> <b>seeds</b> {{in response to}} change in the nitrogen resource (glutamine) of the medium. During the early developmental period (24 - 36 days after pollination), oil was found to initially accumulate in the developing seeds. Carbohydrates and oil were inversely related after glutamine provision (35 mM, in the culture medium). [U- 14 C] sucrose labeling was used to investigate the effect of metabolic fluxes among different storage materials. Addition of glutamine led to a 7 % increase of labeling in lipids and an inverse decrease of labeling in carbohydrates. It was postulated that changes in the glutamine concentration in the medium are likely to influence the partitioning of resources between the various storage products, especially carbohydrates and oil.

The optimum temperature and pH were 300 C and 7. 0 respectively {{for all the}} fermented seeds above. Increasing NaCl concentration decreases the {{activity of}} Lipase indicating that NaCl is an inhibitor of lipase.

30|$|Castor oil is {{extracted}} colourless to very pale yellow viscous liquid {{with a distinct}} taste, mild odour and it boils at 586  K [10]. The hydroxyl group in ricinoleic acid (Fig.  4 a) account for the unique properties of castor oil. For instance, the oil has relatively high viscosity and specific gravity; it is soluble in alcohols in any proportion and has limited solubility in aliphatic petroleum solvents [11]. In addition, the polar hydroxyl group in castor oil makes it compatible with plasticizers {{of a wide variety}} of natural and synthetic resins, waxes, polymers and elastomers [12]. Notable changes on the properties of the castor oil can also be due to several factors such as the method of extraction, seed varieties, weather conditions and soil type. For instance, cold-pressed castor oils have low acid value, low iodine value and a slightly higher saponification value than solvent-extracted oil [1]. It has further been observed that <b>castor</b> <b>seeds</b> from different climatic conditions produce castor oils of different composition and physical–chemical properties [14, 15, 17]. Malaysian <b>castor</b> <b>seeds</b> for instance, contain total lipids (castor oil) reaching up to 43.3  % per dry weight and a saponification value of 182.96  mg KOH/g [14] while for the Nigerian <b>castor</b> <b>seeds,</b> the total lipids (castor oil) is 48  % per dry weight with a saponification value of 178.00  mg KOH/g [15].|$|R

40|$|<b>Castor</b> <b>seeds</b> are {{obtained}} from the castor plant (Ricinus communis L.) of the family Euphorbiaceae. The plant is important {{because of the high}} oil content (40 – 57 %) of the seeds. Basically, the oil is obtained by pressing or solvent extraction methods. Although castor oil is used for frying, it has almost unlimited industrial applications and enjoys tremendous world demand in the pharmaceutical, paint, cosmetics. textile, leather, lubricant, chemical, plastic, fiber, automobile and engineering industries. Also, it has the advantage over other oils because it is a renewable resource, biodegradable and eco-friendly. Many derivatives that have a similar chemical composition as petroleum-based oil can be produced from castor oil.

Ricinoleic acid comprises over 84 % while other fatty acids present were linoleic (7. 3 %), oleic (5. 5 %), palmitic (1. 3 %), stearic (1. 2 %) and linolenic (0. 5 %), respectively. Five types of <b>castor</b> bean <b>seed</b> oil triacylglycerols were identified as triricinolein, RRR (84. 1 %), diricinoleoylstearoylglycerol, RRS (8. 2 %), diricinoleoyloleoyl-glycerol, RRO (5. 6 %), diricinoleoyllinoleoylglycerol, RRL (1. 2 %) and diricinoleoylpalmitoyl-glycerol, RRP (0. 9 %), respectively...|$|R
