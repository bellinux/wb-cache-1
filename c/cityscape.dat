5|$|For Sarah's nuclear {{nightmare}} scene, Robert and Dennis Skotak of 4-Ward Production {{constructed a}} <b>cityscape</b> of Los Angeles using large-scale miniature buildings and realistic roads and vehicles. The pair, after having studied actual footages of nuclear tests, then simulated the nuclear blast by using air mortars to knock over the <b>cityscape,</b> including the intricately built buildings.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} shot on 16 December 2009, in London, England. The video begins with footage from The X Factor and then {{transitions}} to a close-up shot of McElderry {{in the main}} setting, a flooded <b>cityscape</b> — the scene was shot in a flooded set with a <b>cityscape</b> backdrop. McElderry is clothed by a grey vest and a grey shirt, as {{he stands in the}} setting and performs. Throughout the entire video, scenes alternate between the flooded <b>cityscape</b> setting and recycled footage from The X Factor, which are in black and white until it shows him in the live shows in colour. The video concludes with McElderry being informed he won the competition, hugging his peers.|$|E
50|$|Hendrik Frans Schaefels {{worked in}} many genres {{including}} history paintings, seascapes, genre paintings, landscapes with figures and <b>cityscapes.</b> His early work, which {{was influenced by}} Jan Michiel Ruyten, consisted mainly of <b>cityscapes</b> of Antwerp and genre scenes. He is now principally known for his seascapes often representing historical events such as sea battles and for his <b>cityscapes</b> of Antwerp.|$|R

50|$|Except for stage scenery, Van Hove painted mostly <b>cityscapes</b> {{and church}} {{interiors}} {{in a romantic}} style. His early works are characterized by a fine, detailed painting style, which strongly contrasts with the broad, colorful stage sets. His <b>cityscapes</b> and church interiors were often decorated with figures, sometimes done by his son Huib. His later <b>cityscapes</b> are looser and smoother in tone with a tailored gray coloration.|$|R

5|$|The {{scenes in}} Calgary were {{actually}} {{shot in the}} back of the Universal Studios lot in Los Angeles. In order to convert the Los Angeles <b>cityscape</b> into Calgary's, Mat Beck created a matte of the shot; the background buildings were then edited out. A separate shot of Calgary was superimposed in the background and the scenes were mixed.|$|E

5|$|Agharta {{was first}} {{released}} in Japan by CBS/Sony in August 1975 just before Davis temporarily retired due to increasingly poor health and exhaustion. At the record label's suggestion, it was titled after the legendary subterranean city. Davis enlisted Japanese artist Tadanori Yokoo to design its artwork, which depicted the <b>cityscape</b> of an advanced civilization with elements inspired by Eastern subterranean myths and Afrofuturism. An alternate cover was produced for its 1976 release in North America by Columbia Records.|$|E
5|$|From the promoter's viewpoint, Simon and Garfunkel were ideal choices. Not {{only were}} they likely {{to draw a}} large crowd to the concert, they also had roots in the city both had grown up and gone to school in Forest Hills, Queens. Music critic Stephen Holden pointed out that, unlike artists who had left in pursuit of lifestyles offered by other locales, the two {{had always been a}} part of New York City. Both gained {{inspiration}} from the <b>cityscape</b> and the cultural variety of New York, and spoke of these influences in their songs.|$|E

5|$|ILM {{digitally}} recreated {{the vast}} majority of the New York <b>cityscape</b> used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted 8 weeks. Disney and Sony Pictures agreed for OsCorp Tower from The Amazing Spider-Man to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.|$|E

They also replaced the Sydney <b>cityscape</b> on the horizon with views of Nagasaki. The walking bear featured in the Yukon scenes was created with computer graphics by Weta Digital, while Make-Up Effects Group built a 12 foot tall animatronic bear, that was used for shots of the creature dying after it {{had been hit by}} poisoned arrows fired by hunters.|$|E
5|$|Jolin was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for the architectural and aesthetic preservation of the capital, as is written in his draft for a pamphlet called Mot strömmen (Against the Tide). According to him, Stockholm had become an ugly town, by insensitive mixing of styles, densification, and centuries of eager renovation. Jolin wanted {{to bring out the}} beautiful and the genuine in the <b>cityscape,</b> as well as restore, what he considered to be distorted parts of the city, to their former glory. According to Palmgren, perhaps it was that dream Jolin expressed in his depictions of Stockholm. At the end of the 19th century, and during some decades into the 20th century, artists depicted Stockholm in a variety of ways, each according to his own mind and individualism. Traditionalists worked side by side with Modernists, old with young, seasoned pursuers of the established view of the city and young enthusiastic individuals, such as Jolin. By the middle of the 20th century, his focus shifted from the <b>cityscape</b> to other motifs such as chinoiserie settings, but in his youth, he and his friends from his years in Paris found inspiration in Stockholm and its surroundings.|$|E

50|$|Eversen was a {{contemporary}} of Cornelis Springer. Both painters were students of Hendrik Gerrit ten Cate {{at the same}} time, and usually painted contemporary regional (Oud-Hollandse) <b>cityscapes.</b> In his choice of subjects, Eversen allowed himself more freedom. He painted mostly imaginary <b>cityscapes,</b> consisting of existing and invented fragments, unlike the more faithful representations of Springer.|$|R

The camera then flies up inside a skyscraper made entirely of small images of a mouth singing the along with the track. As the song finishes the view again returns to the road. Small spaceships (similar to the one from the middle 8) gather at either side as the city is left behind and the road gradually disappears.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the men}} {{helps the}} girl up, she spreads her wings and gives them a {{grateful}} smile; he kisses her hand, and the other winks in farewell.

From a bird's-eye view, we see {{the shape of the}} car veering off the road and slowing to a stop in the grass.|$|E
5|$|Other {{prominent}} 20th-century structures {{include the}} Most Slovenského národného povstania (Bridge of the Slovak national uprising) across the Danube featuring a UFO-like tower restaurant, Slovak Radio's inverted-pyramid-shaped headquarters, and the uniquely designed Kamzík TV Tower with an observation deck and rotating restaurant. In the early 21st century, new edifices have transformed the traditional <b>cityscape.</b> At {{the beginning of}} the 21st Century, a construction boom has spawned new public structures, such as the Most Apollo and a new building of the Slovak National Theatre, as well as private real-estate development.|$|E

5|$|The {{front cover}} {{depicted}} an advanced civilization {{with a vast}} landscape of skyscrapers and red, sunburst-like flames {{rising out of the}} <b>cityscape</b> as representations of Agharta's power. Yokoo used a combination of collage, airbrushing, and painting techniques as he had with his previous work, along with postcards collected from his trips to Tahiti and New York City; the <b>cityscape</b> on the front cover was taken from one of his postcards. The back cover showed the city submerged in water, embedded in coral reefs, and hovered over by a diver, fish, and a squid ascending from the city. According to graphic designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell, Yokoo depicted groups of jellyfish, coral reefs, and brightly colored fish to suggest an association between Agharta and Atlantis. The foreground of the back cover's illustration featured a reptilian creature. Cultural studies researcher Dagmar Buchwald interpreted this image as an allusion to similar ideas about Lemuria; this mythological continent supposedly existed during Earth's prehistory and was inhabited by an advanced civilization, later forced under the Earth's surface after its homeland was destroyed by a great flood.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the <b>cityscape</b> comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double- and triple-decker housing (though row houses are rare, found so commonly in other Northeast cities), {{a small number of}} high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. Interstate 95 serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and the West End.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, a {{catalytic}} development, {{has been}} initiated {{headed by the}} Government of Serbia aimed at improving Belgrade's <b>cityscape</b> and economy by revitalizing the Sava amphitheater, a neglected stretch of land on the right bank of the Sava river, between the Belgrade Fair and Belgrade Main railway station. Around €3.5 billion will be invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and Belgrade Tower. The project is, however, considered by many as 'controversial', since {{there are a number}} of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, as well as chosen architectural solutions.|$|E
