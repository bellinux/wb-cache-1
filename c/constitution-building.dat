The Palais Hall here is {{the same}} stone Hall, where thou, five years ago, stoodest perorating, amid endless pathos of rebellious Parlement, in the grey of the morning; bound to march with d'Agoust to the Isles of Hieres. The stones are the same stones: but the rest, Men, Rebellion, Pathos, Peroration, see! it has all fled, like a gibbering troop of ghosts, like the phantasms of a dying brain! With d'Espremenil, in the same line of Tumbrils, goes the mournfullest medley. Chapelier goes, ci-devant popular President of the Constituent; whom the Menads and Maillard met in his carriage, on the Versailles Road. Thouret likewise, ci-devant President, father of Constitutional Law-acts; he whom we heard saying, long since, with a loud voice, [...] "The Constituent Assembly has {{fulfilled}} its mission!" [...] And the noble old Malesherbes, who defended Louis and could not speak, like a grey old rock dissolving into sudden water: he journeys here now, with his kindred, daughters, sons and grandsons, his Lamoignons, Chateaubriands; silent, towards Death.--One young Chateaubriand alone is wandering amid the Natchez, by the roar of Niagara Falls, the moan of endless forests: Welcome thou great Nature, savage, but not false, not unkind, unmotherly; no Formula thou, or rapid jangle of Hypothesis, Parliamentary Eloquence, <b>Constitution-building</b> and the Guillotine; speak thou to me, O Mother, and sing my sick heart thy mystic everlasting lullaby-song, and let all the rest be far!-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Numerous considerations, {{pointing}} towards deep, questionable, {{and indeed}} unfathomable regions, present themselves here: {{on the most}} of which we must resolutely for the present forbear to speak at all. As Burke said that perhaps fair Trial by Jury was the soul of Government, and that all legislation, administration, parliamentary debating, {{and the rest of}} it, went on, in [...] "order to bring twelve impartial men into a jury-box;"--so, by much stronger reason, may I say here, that the finding of your Ableman and getting him invested with the symbols of ability, with dignity, worship (worth-ship), royalty, kinghood, or whatever we call it, so that he may actually have room to guide according to his faculty of doing it,--is the business, well or ill accomplished, of all social procedure whatsoever in this world! Hustings-speeches, Parliamentary motions, Reform Bills, French Revolutions, all mean at heart this; or else nothing. Find in any country the Ablest Man that exists there; raise him to the supreme place, and loyally reverence him: you have a perfect government for that country; no ballot-box, parliamentary eloquence, voting, <b>constitution-building,</b> or other machinery whatsoever can improve it a whit. It is in the perfect state; an ideal country. The Ablest Man; he means also the truest-hearted, justest, the Noblest Man: what he tells us to do must be precisely the wisest, fittest, that we could anywhere or anyhow learn;--the thing which it will in all ways behoove US, with right loyal thankfulness and nothing doubting, to do! Our doing and life were then, so far as government could regulate it, well regulated; that were the ideal of constitutions.|$|E

50|$|The ethnic {{aspect of}} a new federal {{structure}} in Nepal {{has been a source}} of contention through the <b>constitution-building</b> process of recent years. Multiparty democracy was introduced in Nepal in 1990 after a popular uprising led by theCongress party and the United Left Front, a coalition of communist parties. Ethnic issues did not emerge prominently in the drafting of the new constitution. Campaigns for more recognition of ethnic issues were led by Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities (NEFIN) representing the ethnic groups of the hills, the regional Sadbhawana party of the Terai, and the UCPN (Maoists) under pressure from the Madhesi people of the south.|$|E

The work involves: Providing technical assistance to national actors engaged in processes of constitution building. Providing knowledge and capacity-building resources that individuals and groups can use to strengthen their participation, and its quality, in processes of constitution building. Facilitating access to lesson learning in comparative contexts so that national, regional and international actors have more options to consider in dealing with different constitutional issues. Servicing a global community of constitution building practitioners through physical and virtual spaces for dialogue.|$|E
40|$|<b>Constitution-building</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} salient aspects of {{transitional}} processes, from war to peace or from authoritarian rule, in terms of establishing and strengthening democracy. This paper is part of a research project that aims to identify the circumstances under which <b>constitution-building</b> can strengthen democracy after violent conflict and during transitions from authoritarian rule. Previous research has indicated that the actions and relations of political elites from opposing political parties when making the constitution has bearing on the state of democracy post promulgation, but that the careful sequencing of public participation in the process can be of relevance as well. This paper conducts a systematic analysis of seven empirical cases and focuses the investigation to the type of <b>constitution-building</b> body that has been employed and to during what stage of the process the general public have been invited to participate. It concludes that popularly elected <b>constitution-building</b> bodies tend to include a broad range of political parties and that they, additionally, tend to have rules of procedure that encourage compromise and negotiation, whereas appointed bodies are dominated by one single party or one single person and do not have rules of procedure that necessitate compromise. The paper also discusses the potential need for political elites to have negotiated a number of baseline constitutional principles prior to inviting the general public to get involved in the <b>constitution-building</b> process, and concludes that this is an area of research in need of further in-depth empirical case-studies. How can <b>constitution-building</b> processes in post-conflict states and in states transitioning from authoritarian rule contribute to enhancing democracy...|$|E
40|$|The paper starts by {{reconstructing the}} European {{constitutional}} project, {{which began with}} the famous speech of the former German Minister of external affairs Joschka Fischer and which is about {{to come to an}} end with the Lisbon Treaty. Against this background the paper poses the question why <b>constitution-building</b> in the European Union collapsed and it reflects upon the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty for the democratic quality of the European multi-level system. The hypothesis put forward claims that the reform treaty is the logical consequence of a <b>constitution-building</b> process based on a concept of institutions following a nation-state model from the very beginning. The paper sketches out the key assumptions of current constitutional theory and illustrates in how far this understanding of a constitution is inherent in the European <b>constitution-building</b> process using the examples of the constitutional convention, EU citizenship, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the European Parliament...|$|E
40|$|Participatory <b>constitution-building</b> is a {{trend that}} appears to be here to stay; {{particularly}} when new constitutions are drafted in the aftermath of war or during transitions from authoritarian to democratic rule. Anticipations as to what the involvement of the public will achieve are several, and scholars are only recently starting to systematically investigate whether or not these expectations find empirical support. Previous research has shown that public participation in the making of the constitution can have certain positive effects at an individual level of analysis, but that the actions of political elites during constitutional negotiations might affect outcomes at a macro level of analysis more than what has hitherto be acknowledged in this strand of research. Nepal {{is one of the most}} recent cases of participatory <b>constitution-building,</b> and the country carried out not only one, but two, such processes within a time period of only seven years. The first resulted in failure as a draft constitution was never finalized; the other in success with the adoption of a constitution in 2015. This article takes an interest in exploring and comparing these two separate processes as regards the extent of public participation vis-Ã -vis political elite negotiations and bargaining behind closed doors. The article finds that what primarily sets the two processes apart, is how broad based public participation and secluded elite negotiations were sequenced. In light of other empirical examples, the article also discusses if elite bargains ought to be struck before the general public are invited to participate.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relationship}} between âlaw â and âconstitution-building processes â is multi-faceted and complex. On the one hand, âlaw â can {{be construed as}} playing a âthick â role within {{the making of the}} constitution; a role delineated by its innate normative ability to âgive force â to the emerging constitution. On the other hand, <b>constitution-building</b> processes can be seen as primarily political moments with law playing a concomitantly âthin â constitutional role, acting as an object rather than catalyst of constitutional debate and change. The following paper argues that European law has been assigned a relatively subsidiary role within the European convention where forces of non-law (politics) play the major role in setting the constitutional agenda. This thin perception of European law within the convention belies the elemental role which law (national and European) has traditionally played in the constitutionalisation of Europe. More fundamentally, it might also be argued that the conventionâs inattention to âthick â law-lead <b>constitution-building</b> cannot but detract from its claim to be initiating informed constitutive debate within Europe. In common with its Philadelphian counterpart, the European convention has missed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Constitution-building</b> is a {{delicate}} and intricate process which requires ample reflection and careful choices. African constitution-builders and politicians have {{since the beginning of}} the 1990 s embarked on a process of constitutional reforms. A careful examination of the developments of the last two decades shows that the process has almost provoked never-ending contagion of making, unmaking and remaking of constitutions. This paper attempts to provide an over-view of the changes that have been taking place. Some of the issues relating to the durability of national constitutions and theoretical foundations for constitutional change are discussed. The paper also considers some of the possible implications of the endless processes of making, unmaking and remaking constitutions. The critical question it tries to grapple with is how this unending process of <b>constitution-building</b> in Africa can be controlled in a manner that will ensure peace, political stability and provide a legitimate foundation for entrenching a firm culture of constitutionalism. In advocating for an entrenched permanent constitutional review commission to check against frequent and arbitrary constitutional changes, the paper argues that this is the best way for constitutional legitimacy to be sustained throughout the life of a constitution.

40|$|This {{publication}} {{provides a}} set of guiding principles for constitutional reform {{on the basis of}} practical experiences of constitutional reform processes in selected countries: Bolivia, Ghana, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa. The focus is on the role of political parties in <b>constitution-building</b> processes. The publication shows that although country-specific reform processes may be unique in terms of objectives, context, popular involvement, and achievements, they go through similar phases: preparatory, consultative, drafting, and implementation. All cases illustrate the political nature of constitutional reform and the central role of political parties in the process. [ASC Leiden abstract...|$|E
40|$|This {{quantitative}} study examines the relative impact {{of domestic and}} international determinants {{on the success of}} EU <b>constitution-building</b> conferences and on the distribution of benefits to the negotiating governments. How do governmental organization and the distribution of within-cabinet preferences of EU member states translate into EU <b>constitution-building?</b> In a seminal article on the relation between domestic and international politics, Robert Putnam conjectured that the chance of a successful agreement of international negotiations is the higher, the larger the win sets of the participating negotiating actors, and the benefits as achieved by each of the negotiators are expected to be the higher, the smaller the respective governmental win sets. Using quantitative data for the complex multi-lateral, multi-level, multi-issue negotiation system resulting into the Amsterdam treaty, we take into account organizational structures as well as constitutional preferences of the involved members of the cabinets at that time. Contrary to Putnam's conjecture 1, statistical analyses indicate that 'joint international unanimity win set size' was neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for successful negotiations. It was the exercise of power and intranational conflicts that have been conducive to a transition of the international status quo. Contrary to Putnam's conjecture 2, small governmental win set size did not constitute a negotiation advantage at the international level. Rather, the collective decision to go beyond the status quo and the declared win set sizes combined to affect the utility income of the cabinet pivot...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper studies {{aspects of}} the process and {{substance}} of the deliberations of the Convention on the Future of the Union, {{against the backdrop of the}} longer term development of a Constitution for the European Union. It examines some of theissues which have arisen over the course of the longer term debate about European constitutionalism, including the normative basis of a putative Constitution for the EU. In the main part of the paper, the primary objective is to elaborate in more detail the ways in which the Convention's work was structured by the complex procedural and substantive heritage of the Union's constitutional acquis. It focuses on the Convention as an addition to an already complex and multi-facetted <b>constitution-building</b> process, and looks at some of the principles which it has proposed to bring into the constitutional architecture, such as the explicit articulation of the supremacy principle. It concludes that at times the fit between the 'old' and the 'new' in the constitutional process and substance developed by the Convention is far from satisfactory. ...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction. The {{results of}} Nice {{open the way}} for the {{beginning}} of EU Enlargement after the ratification of the Treaty of Nice, which means as early as 2003. This result proves that "deepening" and "widening" of the European Union remain intrinsically related, as has always been the case since the founding of the European Economic Community in 1957. The process of institution building in the European Union has certainly not come to a close. The leftovers of Nice are difficult enough. The Nice decisions have only shown the need for further and substantial institutional reforms in the European Union. In fact, the EU is forced to link a continuous commitment to its <b>constitution-building</b> with the rapidly approaching enlargement to Central and Eastern European countries â better: the anchoring of post-communist reform countries in the West. Further institutional adaptations and a definite enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe force the EU to find ways and means to efficiently work with 27 or even more Union States and to make the EU capable of playing its role {{in the world of the}} twenty-first century...|$|E
40|$|I wrote The Juridical Coup dâÃ©tat and the Problem of Authority for {{two main}} reasons: to solicit {{responses}} {{to a set of}} questions that I found intriguing, and to consider whether the topic was worth pursuing more systematically. Although the paper is organized otherwise, I proceeded {{in a way that is}} usually not recommended in comparative social science. I began by considering a set of findings â concerning the evolution of three legal systems â that are patterned in broadly congruent ways, and then began asking theoretical questions. In each system, a court had moved to confer upon itself new constitutional-jurisdictional authority, in the course of performing its delegated adjudicatory tasks; and these rulings gradually provoked systemic transformation. My interest was not so much in the cases, which I knew well, but how one might deal with them theoretically. Professors Walker, Sadurski, and Palombella have been generous with their time and comments on the paper, as they have since I presented it at the European University Institute, in spring 2007. I agree with much of what they have written, and I have sympathy with their criticisms, even when we disagree. In this response, I will try to clarify my views in light of their comments. In the first part, I will try to build an even stronger argument to the effect that the label â juridical coup dâÃ©tat â is theoretically appropriate. In the second part, I will focus on the process of transformation (<b>constitution-building)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Lawyers {{of global}} law firms {{have begun to}} take on complex pro bono {{representations}} for clients in peace and <b>constitution-building</b> settings. These lawyers, who often cooperate across different offices of a global law firm, are not acting based on an external mandate but pursuant to an attorney-client relationship. The client {{is the source of}} authority and the owner of the process; yet, global law firms that serve pro bono clients are also a form of profit-making transnational corporation. In their day-today business they represent the interests of paying clients. This article will discuss whether and how such constellations can lead to power, infrastructure, and knowledge asymmetries between law firms and their often weak pro bono clients in post-conflict settings. Accordingly, it raises and discusses the following questions: Are the legal profession 2 Ì 7 s domestic codes of conduct strong enough to guarantee good professional conduct by global law firms when providing pro bono services in post-conflict settings with weak or temporarily absent local legal profession institutions? Is it desirable to create a transnational code of conduct for lawyers, law firms, and other institutions for providing pro bono legal services in such fragile peace and constitution building settings? By addressing these questions, this article also approaches pro bono services of global law firms {{as an example of how}} interests of the private sphere of lawyer-client relations and the public sphere of peace and constitution building merge, and how the legal profession 2 Ì 7 s codes of conduct regulate global law firms and their legal professionals 2 Ì 7 conduct as global agents of 2 Ì 7 privatized 2 Ì 2 peace and constitution building efforts...|$|E
40|$|The {{political}} turmoil that Zimbabwe {{has gone through}} {{in the last two}} decades has affected most of its institutions, especially the judiciary. It is thus no surprise that it was one of the targets for reform during the last <b>constitution-building</b> process that recently culminated in the adoption of a new Constitution. This paper attempts to assess the role that the Judicial Service Commission will play under the new constitution to restore the battered credibility of the Zimbabwean judiciary. The mechanisms of judicial selection are an important element of an independent judiciary and a wide range of judicial selection systems are in use across the world. This in itself is a recognition of the fact that there is no perfect or ideal system of judicial selection. Zimbabwe's new Judicial Service Commission will be assessed against internationally recognised benchmarks. This paper will also examine the popular use of the judicial service commission model in the selection of judges across the civil and common law divide which are the leading legal traditions in the world. It starts by considering the emerging trends in the establishment of judicial service commissions generally before focusing on the key characteristics of judicial service commissions. The analysis of the new judicial appointments system is preceded by a brief overview of the pre- and post-independence judicial selection processes. In assessing the prospects for an efficient, competent and independent judiciary to emerge from the new judicial service commission, a number of issues such as its composition, the appointment of its members, the status of the commission and its operating procedures are examined. The paper concludes that if implemented fully, Zimbabwe's new judicial selection process offers better prospects for enhancing the independence of the Zimbabwean judiciary. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Defense Date: 10 / 06 / 2010 Examining Board: Constance GREWE (University of Strasbourg), Marie-Ange MOREAU (EUI), Jiri PRIBAN (University of Wales, Cardiff), Wojciech SADURSKI (Supervisor, former EUI and Univeristy of Sydney) This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with examining changes in the conceptual understandings of socio-economic rights in the constitutions of countries that have undergone processes of democratization. In particular, it focuses on the processes of <b>constitution-building,</b> but most importantly on questions such as justiciability {{of social and economic}} rights and their materialization in the effective socio-economic policies of democratic states. Through the examination of theories of constitutional interpretation of these rights in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the thesis further explores the argument of a constitutional intra-institutional dialogue. In this sense, the interpretation of socio-economic constitutional rights is not simply read off from the constitution and made into legislation. Instead, it is claimed, there is a dynamic exchange between state institutions where constitutionalization takes place and where parameters are being set for the ultimate aim of the constitutional formulation of these rights, that is, of ascribing to them the attributes of legal rights. The aim of this thesis is to examine the continuous process of the realization and enforcement of socio-economic rights, with respect to the cross-penetration of constitutions and ordinary legislations, judicial and non-judicial mechanisms, constitutional judiciary, other constitutional organs, and governmental and administrative institutions, all of which shape the general performance of the countries in the creation and exercise of social and economic policies. Consequently, the claim of Constitutional Courts' activism in socio-economic matters adjudication is juxtaposed with a broader concept of the constitutional dialogue theory. The interdependent relationship between the state and individual is the subject addressed in the thesis and is used as a theoretical basis for the definition of constitutional socio-economic rights. In particular, three rights are studied in depth: the right to health care, the right to social security and the right to education...|$|E
40|$|Despite coup after coup {{across a}} large number of diverse {{countries}} on the continent of Africa, each new leader resembles similar levels of what Martin Meredith describes as 2 Ì 2 corruption, mismanagement, tribalism, nepotism, and other assorted malpractices 2 Ì 2 as the leader before him. Africans either are not able to see this pattern because of the subjective uniqueness across their singular experiences, or they do see the pattern and are simply unable to break from the cycle. This paper reviews the contributions of Martin Meredith and Goran Hyden to ask why Big Man rule exists in Africa. Africa in this paper refers to the region south of the Sahara Desert, which is also called sub-Sarahan Africa. 2 Ì 2 Big Man 2 Ì 2 rule holds a significant place in the literature on how the region governs itself. It can be defined as a form of autocratic rule that is highly personalized and restrained little by modern institutions, which has the effect of making the âsupremacy of politicsâ in Africa extremely risky with high stakes for those who engage in the process and a great degree of uncertainty for the public in general. Each author contributes a different perspective to answer why Big Man rule is purely an African phenomenon. Hyden, in his book African Politics in Comparative Perspective, offers a theoretical perspective that outlines a typology of Big Man rule, provides three theoretical arguments worth exploring, and reviews the process of <b>constitution-building</b> in the region. Accompanying the theoretical will be Meredithâs historical perspective from his book The Fate of Africa, which will be compared and contrasted with Hydenâs arguments to derive a more grounded answer to this paperâs query. The paper is divided into three sections. First, I will use Hydenâs explanation for the origins of Big Man rule in Africa and argue that the historical legacy argument has little utility for providing a solution. Second, I will ask what Hydenâs typology reveals about Big Man rule. The types of rule are outlined as prophets, princes, autocrats, and tyrants. This particular ordering is necessary to understand the key causal variable underlying their differences: legitimacy. Comparing this typology with Meredithâs biography and description of the personality of leaders will create a more satisfying explanation. And third, I will explore the three theoretical concepts Hyden provides to explain why Big Man rule seems to be unique to Africa: free riding, coalition-building, and transaction costs. I will conclude with a short summary of the expected policy implications to this understanding of Big Man rule...|$|E
