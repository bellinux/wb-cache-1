500|$|By May 1809, the Austrians {{were pushed}} to within visual {{distance}} of Vienna, {{and in a}} <b>critical</b> <b>engagement</b> {{on the banks of}} the Danube river, the French and their allies grappled for control of the Marchfeld plain with the Austrians. [...] The French held Lobau island, a vital river crossing, and the Austrians held the heights further to the east. Between them lay several villages, two of which were central in the engagement and gave the battle its name: [...] They lay so close to Vienna that the battle could be seen and heard from the city ramparts and Aspern and Essling (also spelled in German as Eßling) are today part of the Donaustadt, a district of Austrian capital. At the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Klenau commanded a free-standing force of close to 6,000, including a battalion of the 1st Jäger, three battalions of the 3rd Infantry Regiment Archduke Charles, eight squadrons each of the Stipcisc Hussars and Schwarzenburg Uhlans, and a horse artillery battery of 64 guns. Typical confusion in the Austrian command structure meant he received his orders late, and Klenau's delay in deployment meant that his men approached the French III Corps at Essling in daylight and in close order; a two-gun French battery on the plain beyond the Essling, [...] "mowed furrows" [...] of enfilade fire in the Austrian ranks.|$|E

2500|$|... "When a poem rhymes," [...] Heaney wrote, [...] "when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes {{consciousness}} {{into new}} postures, {{it is already}} {{on the side of}} life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit."He continues: [...] "The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place". Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and <b>critical</b> <b>engagement</b> with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate Czesław Miłosz.|$|E
2500|$|Castoriadis has {{influenced}} European (especially continental) thought in important ways. His interventions in sociological and political theory {{have resulted in}} some of the most well-known writing to emerge from the continent (especially in the figure of Jürgen Habermas, who often can be seen to be writing against Castoriadis). Hans Joas published a number of articles in American journals in order to highlight the importance of Castoriadis' work to a North American sociological audience, and [...] has been of enduring importance both for his <b>critical</b> <b>engagement</b> with Castoriadis' thought and for his sustained efforts to introduce it to the English speaking public (especially during his editorship of the journal Thesis Eleven). In the last few years, there has been growing interest in Castoriadis's thought, including the publication of two monographs authored by Arnason's former students: Jeff Klooger's Castoriadis: Psyche, Society, Autonomy (Brill), and Suzi Adams's Castoriadis's Ontology: Being and Creation (Fordham University Press).|$|E
2500|$|Fredric Jameson {{set forth}} {{one of the}} first {{expansive}} theoretical treatments of postmodernism as a historical period, intellectual trend, and social phenomenon in a series of lectures at the Whitney Museum, later expanded as Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (1991). Eclectic in his methodology, Jameson has continued a sustained examination of the role that periodization continues to play as a grounding assumption of critical methodologies in humanities disciplines. He has contributed extensive effort to explicating the importance of concepts of Utopia and Utopianism as driving forces in the cultural and intellectual movements of modernity, and outlining the political and existential uncertainties that may result from the decline or suspension of this trend in the theorized state of postmodernity. Like Susan Sontag, Jameson served to introduce a wide audience of American readers to key figures of the 20th century continental European intellectual left, particularly those associated with the Frankfurt School, structuralism, and post-structuralism. Thus, his importance as a [...] "translator" [...] of their ideas to the common vocabularies of a variety of disciplines in the Anglo-American academic complex is equally as important as his own <b>critical</b> <b>engagement</b> with them.|$|E

2500|$|Sinn Féin {{has been}} {{considered}} to be Eurosceptic. The party campaigned for a [...] "No" [...] vote in the Irish referendum on joining the European Economic Community in 1972,. Sinn Fein was {{on the same side}} of the debate as the DUP and most of the UUP in that they wanted to pull out when UK had its referendum in 1975. [...] The party was critical of the supposed need for an EU constitution as proposed in 2002, and urged a [...] "No" [...] vote in the 2008 referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, although Mary Lou McDonald said that there [...] was [...] "no contradiction in being pro-Europe but anti-treaty." [...] In its manifesto for the 2015 UK general election, Sinn Féin pledged that the party would campaign for the UK to stay within the European Union (EU), Martin McGuinness saying that an exit [...] "would be absolutely economically disastrous". Gerry Adams said that, if there were to be a referendum on the question, there ought to be a separate and binding referendum for Northern Ireland. Its policy of a [...] "Europe of Equals", and its <b>critical</b> <b>engagement</b> after 2001, together with its engagement with the European Parliament, marks a change from the party's previous opposition to the EU.

2500|$|With the 1994 book Reinventing Politics, the Romanian author {{looked into}} the European {{revolutions}} of the previous decade, exploring the shades of repression, the differences in political culture, and how they related to {{the fall of communism}} in various countries. Calling it [...] "a significant contribution", New School sociologist Jeffrey C. Goldfarb argues: [...] "Tismăneanu is very good at ordering the often confusing details of what he calls 'the birth pangs of democracy.' [...] " [...] Goldfarb objects to the text being [...] "long on historical detail and short on social theory", arguing that: [...] "As a result, [...] attempts at generalization often miss the mark." [...] According to Goldfarb, although Reinventing Politics cautions that the former communist societies risked folding into nationalism, xenophobia and antisemitism, its author [...] "does not provide a clear sense of how [...] can be avoided." [...] Goldfarb contends that, while the book expresses support for embarking on the road to an [...] "open society", it fails to explain how the goal is supposed to be reached. In his review of a 2007 reprint, Romanian cultural historian Cristian Cercel comments on Vladimir Tismăneanu's belief in politics being [...] "reinvented", which implied that power in former communist countries could be shifted to [...] "the powerless" [...] by following the example of Czechoslovak writer and activist Václav Havel. Cercel, who sees this as proof of [...] "well-balanced idealism", writes: [...] "Instead of an absolute critical distance, Tismăneanu presents us with a <b>critical</b> <b>engagement</b> {{at the core of the}} problem." ...|$|E
60|$|The Sirdar was {{returning}} from Kassala when the rumours of an intended Dervish advance began to grow. Every scrap of information was assiduously {{collected by the}} Intelligence Department, {{but it was not}} until the 18th of December, just as he reached Wady Halfa, that the General received apparently certain news that the Khalifa, Mahmud, all the Emirs, and the whole army were about to march north. There can be no doubt that even this tardy movement of the enemy seriously threatened the success of the operations. If the Dervishes moved swiftly, it looked as if a very <b>critical</b> <b>engagement</b> would have to be fought to avoid a damaging retreat. Sir H. Kitchener's reply to the Khalifa's open intent was to order a general concentration of the available Egyptian army towards Berber, to telegraph to Lord Cromer asking for a British brigade, and to close the Suakin-Berber route.|$|E
