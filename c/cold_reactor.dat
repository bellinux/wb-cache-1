40|$|Nano-structures were {{investigated}} {{for the advancement}} of energy conversion technology because of their enhanced catalytic, thermal, and physiochemical interfacial properties and increased solar absorption. Hydrogen is a widely investigated and proven fuel and energy carrier for promising "green" technologies such as fuel cells. Difficulties involving storage, transport, and availability remain challenges that inhibit the widespread use of hydrogen fuel. For these reasons, in-situ hydrogen production has {{been at the forefront of}} research in the renewable and sustainable energy field. A common approach for hydrogen generation is the reforming of alcoholic and hydrocarbon fuels from fossil and renewable sources to a hydrogen-rich gas mixture. Unfortunately, an intrinsic byproduct of any fuel reforming reaction is toxic and highly reactive CO, which has to be removed before the hydrogen gas can be used in fuel cells or delicate chemical processes. In this work, Au/alpha-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst was synthesized using a modified co-precipitation method to generate an inverse catalyst model. The effects of introducing CO 2 and H 2 O during preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO {{were investigated}}. For realistic conditions of (bio-) fuel reforming, 24 % CO 2 and 10 % water the highest document conversion, 99. 85 % was achieved. The mechanism for PROX is not known definitively, however, current literature believes the gold particle size is the key. In contrast, we emphasize the tremendous role of the support particle size. A particle size study was performed to have in depth analysis of the catalysts morphology during synthesis. With this study we were also able to modify how the catalyst was made to further reduce the particle size of the support material leading to ~ 99. 9 % conversion. We also showed that the resulting PROX output gas could power a PEM fuel cell with only a 4 % drop in power without poisoning the membrane electrode assembly. 	The second major aim of this study is to develop an energy-efficient technology that fuses photothermal catalysis and plasmonic phenomena. Although current literature has claimed that the coupling of these technologies is impossible, here we demonstrate the fabrication of reaction cells for plasmon-induced photo-catalytic hydrogen production. The localized nature of the plasmon resonance allows the entire system to remain at ambient temperatures while a high-temperature methanol reformation reaction occurs at the plasmonic sites. Employing a nanostructured plasmonic substrate, we have successfully achieved sufficient thermal excitement (via localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)) to facilitate a heterogeneous chemical reaction.

40|$|As a {{promising}} candidate for future microwave power devices, GaN-based high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have attracted much research interest. However, group III-nitride growth related issues – predominantly the high defect densities due to lacking lattice matched substrates – limit {{the quality and}} life time of the HEMTs. In the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure the GaN buffer layer is particularly important for that matter. Several requirements need to be satisfied, such as high buffer resistivity, low dislocation densities and smooth and defect free interfaces. Poor reproducibility and uniformity of the heterostructure is an additional challenge. Research aim of this work {{is to develop a}} MOVPE based growth process that allows the reliable and efficient deposition of high quality material for HEMT devices based on AlGaN/GaN heterojunctions on sapphire substrates. Usage and development of adequate growth control and monitoring instruments is essential to meet these premises. Direct wafer surface temperature determination is a must during growth, though it is challenging for transparent substrates. A new calibration method is demonstrated that uses the in-situ measured, temperature dependent band-gap shift of SiC. This technique allows adjusting any MOVPE system to identical run-by-run wafer temperatures. Using this new temperature determination approach the cause of irreproducibility in an horizontal reactor is investigated. The two major origins of irreproducibility are parasitic deposits that form on the <b>cold</b> <b>reactor</b> walls which allow for insufficient temperature control. Thus, a new deposition approach is introduced that reduces the formation of parasitic depositions, by injecting the metalorganics near the substrate unlike the conventional process. Experiment and modelling verify the suitability of the new growth approach for enhanced reproducibility. The new approach leads to a fourfold reactor uptime. The structural, morphological and electrical characteristics of the grown layers are comparable for both processes. It has been found that inversion of the precursor supply has a drawback when considering the thickness uniformity. In order to achieve a homogeneous distribution of growth species over the substrate, flow mechanical aspects in our reactor system are investigated. The gas velocity and the gas "nature" are therefore important optimization parameters. For that purpose the influence of different carrier gases – nitrogen and hydrogen – on growth is examined. Using the inverted inlet configuration, uniformity can only be improved by changing the nature of the carrier gas, thus, modifying the diffusive transport and decomposition of growth species. This way, in N 2 atmosphere a standard deviation in thickness of less than 3 % is achieved. Nitrogen is crucial for improved thickness homogeneity, but apparently nitrogen not only deteriorates the surface morphology but it affects the growth mode {{in the early stages of}} deposition. It is found that nitrogen enhances untimely start of 2 D growth, which leads to GaN layers with a larger number of edge type dislocations. Dislocations, in turn, influence the strain in the layer, leading to more relaxed GaN layers when grown in nitrogen ambient. Dislocation scattering is the very probable source of the decline in electrical data when nitrogen is used as carrier gas. As a result a larger "coalescence thickness" is preferred, since it reduces the density of dislocations. Therefore a strategy was developed with which good quality material can be obtained despite the nitrogen ambient needed for uniform layers. Uniform layers with smooth surfaces and state of the art electrical and structural quality material were achieved by using only small amounts of hydrogen during the coalescence phase in otherwise nitrogen ambient. We managed to increase the Hall mobility at room temperature up to 671 cm^ 2 /Vs with a carrier concentration of 9 x 10 ^ 16 cm^- 3 and a FWHM for the (002) and (102) reflections of 238 and 349 arcsec respectively. The inverted inlet combines the reproducibility of the growth process with a good growth control for AlGaN. Due to the high incorporation efficiency a minimal amount of adduct formation occurred. Tight alloy composition and thickness control was achieved with less than one percent deviation over the wafer for device relevant aluminum contents in either hydrogen or nitrogen as carrier gas. AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on the GaN template. Despite state of the art sheet conductivity values the heterojunctions exhibit additional conductivity due to residual donors in the layer. A strategy for growing semi-insulating GaN was introduced using nitrogen as the carrier gas. Thus, acceptor like edge type dislocations are systematically generated that compensate the background carrier concentration. One key factor for varying the density of these dislocations is the morphology development in coalescence. Decreasing the coalescence time by using nitrogen in combination with shorter annealing times is beneficial for obtaining high resistive layers with smooth and specular surfaces. Electron mobilities at room temperature of 1490 cm^ 2 /Vs at a sheet carrier concentrations of 9. 88 < 10 ^ 12 cm^- 2 demonstrate the suitability of HEMT structures grown on "nitrogen GaN". The DC and RF characteristics of the produced HEMT structures are comparable to state of the art HEMT results as published in literature. These findings finally prove the functionality and feasibility of our MOVPE growth process. Thus, new holistic approaches to III-nitride monitoring and growth are presented. High reliability, reproducibility and minimum downtimes of the equipment is proven, optimized AlGaN/GaN film deposition shown and transferability of process temperatures to any reactor demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} are {{expected}} {{to play an important}} role in the worldwide electricity production in the coming decades, since they provide an economically attractive, reliable and low-carbon source of electricity with plenty of resources available for at least the coming hundreds of years. However, the design of nuclear reactors can be improved significantly in terms of safety, by designing reactors with fully passive safety systems, and sustainability, by making more efficient use of natural resources in so-called breeder reactors, and by reducing the radiotoxicity and storage time of the waste produced by the reactor. The application of a thorium breeder fuel cycle within a Pebble Bed High Temperature Reactor could provide such improvements. The core of a Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) consists of a helium cooled random stacking of graphite spheres, which contain many small coated fuel particles retaining radioactive fission products for temperatures below 1600 degrees Celsius. In case of a Depressurized Loss of Forced Cooling (DLOFC), the most serious accident that can occur in a PBR, decay heat can be removed from the core by passive means without the maximum fuel temperature exceeding 1600 degrees Celsius. This is due to its relatively small core radius and low power density. Thorium fuel cycles offer several interesting advantages. Thorium is three to four times more abundant in the earth's crust than uranium. In a closed breeder cycle, thorium can significantly reduce the radiotoxicity and storage time of nuclear waste, and all natural resources mined, i. e. Th- 232 or U- 235 and U- 238, can be used for electricity production instead of roughly 1 % of the natural uranium resources consumed by current light water reactors. Furthermore, the Th/U- 233 fuel cycle has favourable nuclear properties, i. e. the neutron reproduction factor of U- 233 and the relatively high thermal neutron capture cross section of Th- 232, for use in thermal breeder reactors, like a PBR. This thesis work investigates whether it is possible to achieve a thorium breeder fuel cycle in a pebble bed reactor within a practical operating regime and without compromising passive safety. Furthermore, the reactor should also achieve a net U- 233 production within a limited time frame. Neutronics studies of the fuel design show that the conversion of thorium into U- 233 can be maximized for thorium pebbles with a large heavy metal loading of 30 g, a conservative maximum from a fuel fabrication perspective, and a standard fuel kernel radius of 0. 025 cm, preferably irradiated at low specific power to improve k-inf. Reprocessing or adding moderator pebbles is required to raise the k-inf of these pebbles above unity. Cylindrical cores, consisting of a central driver zone surrounded by a breeder zone and reflector regions, were investigated during equilibrium core design studies. 30 g thorium pebbles are inserted in the breeder zone, while a higher carbon to heavy metal ratio is used in the driver zone. Results obtained by an equilibrium core calculation scheme show that the uranium content from both the discharged driver and uranium pebbles has to be reprocessed after their final passage to achieve breeding. As a next step, coupled neutronic and thermal-hydraulic design studies using a coupled DALTON/THERMIX code scheme were performed to investigate whether it is possible to combine passive safety and breeding, within a practical operating regime, inside a thorium PBR. Additionally, the equilibrium core calculation scheme was extended to include the spectral influence of surrounding zones (driver, breeder and reflector) into the fuel depletion calculations. High conversion ratios (CR > 0. 96) and passive safety can be combined in a thorium PBR within a practical operating regime. Increasing the U- 233 content of the fresh driver pebbles (18 w%), breeding (CR= 1. 0135) can already be achieved for a 220 cm core and 80 cm driver zone radius, but the temperature feedback is too weak to compensate the reactivity insertion due to decay of Xe- 135 during a DLOFC without scram. With a lower U- 233 content per driver pebble (10 w%), breeding (CR= 1. 0036) and passive safety can be combined for a 300 cm core and 100 cm driver zone radius operating at a power of 100 MWth, but this requires a doubling of the pebble handling speed and a high fuel pebble reprocessing rate, which may present a challenge from an engineering perspective. The maximum fuel temperature during a DLOFC without scram was 1481 degrees Celsius, still quite a bit below the TRISO failure temperature. The maximum reactivity insertion due to water ingress is also limited (+ 1497 pcm). For this 100 MWth passively safe thorium breeder PBR design, the total control rod worth is far insufficient in the radial reflector to achieve <b>cold</b> <b>reactor</b> shutdown, requiring a worth of over 15, 000 pcm. 3 D heterogeneous KENO calculations show that 20 control rods, positioned just outside the driver zone, can provide sufficient reactivity worth. Furthermore, the insertion of a neutron absorber gas, like BF 3, can be considered as an additional emergency shutdown system. Finally, the running-in phase of the passively safe thorium breeder PBR was analysed using a simplified core depletion model, which solves the depletion equations with an axial fuel movement term for the most relevant actinides and a lumped fission product pair. Enriched uranium (U- 235 /U- 238) is used during the first 1300 days of reactor operation and U- 233 /Th fuel is used afterwards. By clever adjustment of the enrichment or U- 233 weight fraction of the feed driver fuel over time, the thorium PBR can start to breed U- 233 within 7 years after starting reactor operation. Furthermore, a basic safety analysis for the various stages of the running-in phase indicates that passive safety is also ensured during any stage of the running-in phase. This thesis work demonstrates that it is possible to achieve breeding within a passively safe thorium pebble bed reactor after a limited time (< 7 years), though the margins in terms of breeding, passive safety and practical constraints are rather small. Therefore, the passively safe thorium breeder PBR design presented requires a doubling of the fuel pebble handling speed, compared to the HTR-PM, and a high fuel pebble reprocessing rate, while also some other technical difficulties still have to be addressed, such as the large pumping power requirement and the modelling of the conus region and defueling chutes. However, these issues are no fundamental limitation for the application of a thorium breeder cycle within a passively safe PBR, which could offer a huge improvement in terms of safety and sustainability of nuclear power for future generations.

40|$|Pour faire face au problème posé par les rejets aqueux chargés en phénol, deux procédés d'épuration par voie chimique sont proposés. Les deux méthodes font appel au peroxyde d'hydrogène. Celui-ci joue le rôle de promoteur de radicaux lors de l'oxydation de la charge organique par l'oxygène moléculaire dans le premier procédé qui s'inspire de la {{technique}} « Wet Air Oxidation » et constitue l'agent oxydant dans le second procédé intitulé « Wet Peroxide Oxidation ». L'introduction en continu de peroxyde d'hydrogène permet d'initier la réaction d'oxydation du phénol par l'oxygène moléculaire et de réduire considérable-ment les conditions de température et de pression de fonctionnement de la technique WAO classique. La réduction de la Demande Chimique en Oxygène de l'effluent dépasse 95 % à 160 °C en introduisant du peroxyde d'hydrogène à raison de 10 % de la quantité stoechiométrique nécessaire pour l'oxydation complète du phénol. Le second procédé consiste à utiliser l'oxydation par le peroxyde d'hydrogène en présence de fer ferreux (réactif de Fenton) dans des conditions de température (environ 120 °C) conduisant à un abattement important de la charge organique de l'effluent. A température élevée, la compétition entre la réaction de décomposition du peroxyde en oxygène moléculaire inactif et celle de décomposition en radicaux qui développent le processus d'oxydation engendre des conditions opératoires optimales pour lesquelles l'efficacité du procédé est maximale. Ces deux procédés apportent une solution technique satisfaisante pour traiter, avec un abattement important de {{la demande}} chimique en oxygène et du carbone organique, les effluents aqueux assez fortement chargés en composés phénolés. Despite {{of a growing}} concern {{about the problems of}} wastes elimination during the previous years, there is still a lack of processes in order to treat industrial aqueous wastes. Organic aqueous wastes and specially phenolic wastes, that can be either nonbiodegradable or toxic, give rise to one of the main problems. Landfilling disposal and related methods are a priori rejected as they appear to leaving the legacy of a problem we have net been able to solve rather than to considering our environment as being borrowed from the future mankind. Various oxidation techniques are suited for the elimination of this class of wastes. But, because of the environmental and economical drawbacks of incineration, it seems that liquid phase oxidation techniques should be preferred. The paper reviews : two liquid phase purification techniques using the chemical oxidation route; phenol being used as a test compound. The first technique is adapted from the wet air oxidation (WAO) process and uses molecular oxygen as the oxidizing agent. In the meantime, hydrogen peroxide is added at a low dosage and promotes the radicle reactions. Thus, the reaction temperature and pressure can be set at lower values (typically 160 °C, 25 bar) than usually. In this way, the conventional WAO process, which is very capital intensive because of temperature and pressure constraints is turned into a more affordable process. The second technique uses hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer. it is associated to a ferrous salt as in the Fenton's reagent but it is run out under temperature (about 120 °C) so that a very important total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency con be obtained. This technique was named wet peroxide oxidation (WPO) process. As opposed to WAO, WPO needs only limited capital but generates higher running colts. Yet, both techniques can be regarded as efficient and economically satisfying in order to treat organic aqueous wastes containing fair amounts of phenol or phenolic compounds. The test compound was selected considering the frequent occurrence of phenol within the wastewaters of refineries, steel works and chemical industries. Their biological treatment is still very difficult for high concentrations despite of an important research activity. Treatment times and efficiencies of physicochemical methods are not but seldom satisfactory. Then, liquid phase oxidation methods have their whole interest. As it was reported that phenolic compounds (methylphenols, chloro-phenols) oxidation proceeds in a similar way than for phenol, the last molecule was considered for assessing the efficiency of both oxidation methods. The first method (WAO) was tested using a completely mixed batch reactor (stirred autoclave) : The <b>cold</b> <b>reactor</b> was loaded with a phenol (2100 mg. 1 - 1) and ferrous sulfate (10 mg. l- 11) solution al the convenient pH value (3. 5). After heating at the rated temperature, the run was started by injecting instantaneously a large amount of oxygen (10 times the amount necessary). At the same time, a dosing pump was started and fed continuously hydrogen peroxide within the reactor all along the run (90 minutes). The total amount injected was usually 10 % of the amount necessary for a stoechiometric oxidation. The promoting effect of hydrogen peroxide on molecular oxygen is evidenced on figure 2 where the initiating period is shortened and on figure 3 where the oxidation efficiency actually obtained (curve 3) is greater than expected by adding the efficiencies of molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide oxidations if separated (curve 2). WAO promoted with hydrogen peroxide gave after 90 minutes better oxidation efficiencies at 160 °C than conventional WAO at 220 °C, then turning into a medium pressure process a high pressure one. The promoting effect of the peroxide is more marked at 160 °C than above 200 °C where a rapid decomposition occurs; dosages greater 15 % do not significantly increase the efficiency and dosages as small as 0, 2 % have already a significant affect (see figure 5). Various compounds have been identified and the oxidation sequence is as follows : phenol -> dihydroxy-benzenes -> maleic acid -> oxalic, formic, acetic acids. Most of the remaining chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the oxidized solutions is acetic acid. Only more drastic experimental conditions allow its total removal. The WPO runs (second oxidation method) were conducted into a similar reactor. It was batch loaded with the phenol (2300 mg. 1 - 1) and ferrous sulfate (30 mg. l- 1) solution at pH 3. 5. After heating at 120 °C, the run was started and hydrogen peroxide was continuously fed using a dosing pump. The total amount injected all along the run (60 minutes) was the amount necessary for a stoechiometric oxidation. A similar oxidation sequence than reported hereon was observed; pyrocatechol, bydroquinone and oxalic acid were evidenced (figure 9) but, in this case, only very limited amounts of formic and acetic acids were detected. For the two processes, tables 2 and 3 summarize the material balances of the various products {{as a function of the}} oxidation time. A 90 % COD removal efficiency and a 70 % total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency is reported on figure 10. This result has to be compared with the TOC removal efficiencies (< 25 %) reported for the usual Fenton’s reagent at room temperature. The changes of the pH value and of the COD/TOC ratio (figure 11) during the run are easily explained by considering that oxalic acid is quite the sole product remaining after oxidation contrarily to promoted WAO where acetic acid is the major remaining product. Besides the production of radicles that bring on the oxidation process, a side-reaction decomposes hydrogen peroxide into molecular oxygen which is net active at such a low temperature. The competition between the two reactions makes optimum operating conditions to exist and to lead to a maximum efficiency of the process. Both processes bring on new methods in order to treat fairly concentrated phenolic solutions with a typical 90 % COD removal efficiency. The products remaining after oxidation (mainly acetic acid or oxalic acid) should not be regarded as a drawback of these processes. In actual fact, such compounds can be easily treated by adding a biological post-treatment unit to the chemical oxidation...|$|E

The {{morphology}} of a single-crystalline 4 H-silicon carbide (SiC) substrate surface after etching by {{chlorine trifluoride}} (ClF 3) gas was studied over the {{wide temperature range}} of 673 - 1573 K at atmospheric pressure in a horizontal <b>cold</b> wall <b>reactor.</b> The Si-face and C-face showed pitted surfaces at low temperatures; the pits tended to become small and shallow with the increasing substrate temperature. The etching for 0. 5 min at the substrate temperature of 1573 K and at the ClF 3 gas concentration of 1 % could maintain a specular surface on both the Si-face and C-face 4 H-SiC, the root-mean-square roughness of which was {{comparable to that of}} the substrate before etching...|$|R

This has made it difficult to control the growth process and limits the applicability of the method. Using a set of photodetectors with different spectral responses, we show that one can identify characteristic regimes of laser assisted CNT growth. More specifically, key process steps like catalyst activation, growth of CNTs, and amorphous carbon deposition are identified. Furthermore, the method allows optimization of growth conditions with respect {{to the quality of the}} growth products...|$|R

Titanium carbonitride was {{obtained in the}} same experimental device by addition of ammonia in the gas phase. These materials were deposited at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range 450 - 800 °C with appreciable deposition rates. According to the temperature range of vaporization of the solid precursor, the deposition proceeded from the gaseous species coming either form the direct sublimation of the initial molecule or from a vaporization of by-products resulting from its decomposition in the vaporization crucible.

The gas phase compositions have been determined by coupling the reactor to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS), while the growth rates were measured versus temperature and phosphine to disilane molar ratio in order to determine the species responsible for the deposits. Disilane draws a decrease in the inhibition of the growth rate which is 4 times less than in the case of monosilane as starting product.

40|$|Nanostructured carbon was {{successfully}} produced by methane cracking {{in a relatively}} low-energy <b>cold</b> plasma <b>reactor</b> designed in-house. A followed thermal treatment was carried out to further enhance its porosity. The modified plasma carbon was then employed for CO 2 adsorption at 25 °C. The as-synthesized plasma carbon and the modified carbon were characterized by BET surface area/pore size analyzer, Raman spectra, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show thermal modification pronouncedly improves BET surface area and porosity of PC due to opening up of accessible micro-/mesopores in the graphitic structure and by the removal of amorphous carbons around the graphite surface. The modified PC displays a higher adsorption capacity at 25 °C {{than that of the}} commercial activated carbon reported. The low hydrogen storage capacity of the modified PC indicates that it can be considered for CO 2 removal in syngas...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{features of}} silicon carbide coatings, deposited on graphite from SiCl 4, C 3 H 8 and H 2 mixtures, were investigated. Based on preliminary thermodynamic calculations, the experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure in a <b>cold</b> wall <b>reactor</b> by varying the deposition temperature TD in the 1473 - 1673 K range and the deposition time between 10 and 120 min.

An Italian patent, which received a formal but not a technical examination, describes the apparatus as a [...] "process and equipment to obtain exothermal reactions, in particular from nickel and hydrogen". Rossi and Focardi said the device worked by infusing heated hydrogen into nickel powder, transmuting it into copper and producing excess heat. An international patent application received an unfavorable international preliminary report on patentability in 2011 because it was adjudged to [...] "offend against the generally accepted laws of physics and established theories".

40|$|ABSTRACT: VLS-grown {{semiconductor}} nanowires {{have emerged}} as a viable prospect for future solar-based energy applications. In this paper, we report highly efficient charge separation and collection across in situ doped Si p−n junction nanowires with a diameter < 100 nm grown in a <b>cold</b> wall CVD <b>reactor.</b> Our photoexcitation measurements indicate an internal quantum efficiency of ∼ 50 %, whereas scanning photocurrent microscopy measurements reveal effective minority carrier diffusion lengths of ∼ 1. 0 μm for electrons and 0. 66 μm for holes for as-grown Si nanowires (dNW ≈ 65 − 80 nm), which are {{an order of magnitude}} larger than those previously reported for nanowires of similar diameter. Further analysis reveals that the strong suppression of surface recombination is mainly responsible for these relatively long diffusion lengths, with surface recombination velocities (S) calculated to be 2 orders of magnitude lower than found previously for as-grown nanowires, all of which used hot wall reactors. The degree of surface passivation achieved in our as-grown nanowires is comparable to or better than that achieved for nanowires in prior studies at significantly larger diameters. We suggest that the dramatically improved surface recombination velocities may result from the reduced sidewall reactions and deposition in our <b>cold</b> wall CVD <b>reactor...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) inlet nozzles and {{downcomer}} wall in Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) {{may suffer}} serious thermal shock caused by <b>cold</b> water from <b>reactor</b> Safety Injection System (SIS) in some unexpected accident scenarios. It implies {{the formation of}} great temperature gradient on the inlet nozzles and RPV wall, leading to the localized stresses and propagation of possible flaws {{that appeared in the}} material. In this paper, the multiscale thermal hydraulic analysis was performed for Chashma Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) under the inadvertent SIS operation scenario. The primary loop and SIS were modeled using one-dimensional method, while the three-dimensional models of <b>reactor</b> <b>cold</b> leg, RPV inlet nozzles, and downcomer were established. Then, the inadvertent Safety Injection System operation scenario was simulated using RELAP 5 code, providing the boundary conditions for three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The fluid and solid coupling heat transfer simulation method was employed. Results show that the maximum temperature difference was about 80 [*]K in the most conservative condition and the RPV inlet nozzle region was the most critical region during the accident. This work could provide in-depth understanding on the effect of cold coolant injection along the main pipes and RPV wall during the accident scenario...|$|R
