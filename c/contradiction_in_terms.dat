40|$|In {{contemporary}} societies, a set {{of social}} and cultural transformations has made the use and distribution of time in the everyday life of women problematic. In Chile, studies of time have contributed to making visible the problems that women face in managing time in their daily lives, but have relegated the relevance of agency for temporal experience to a position of secondary importance. This article introduces the concept of temporal work to show empirically the strategies that Chilean women deploy in the configuration of their experience of time in everyday life. It concludes that, despite the relevance of agency for women’s experience of the temporal in Chile, it will continue to be widely determined by the inequalities and asymmetries of the social organization of time and its <b>contradictions</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of relationships, institutions and structures...|$|R

According to Service, Lenin developed an [...] "emotional attachment" [...] to his ideological heroes, such as Marx, Engels and Chernyshevsky; he owned portraits of them, and privately described himself as being [...] "in love" [...] with Marx and Engels. According to Lenin biographer James D. White, Lenin treated their writings as [...] "holy writ", a [...] "religious dogma", which should [...] "not be questioned but believed in". In Volkogonov's view, Lenin accepted Marxism as [...] "absolute truth", and accordingly acted like [...] "a religious fanatic". Similarly, Bertrand Russell felt that Lenin exhibited [...] "unwavering faith – religious faith in the Marxian gospel". Biographer Christopher Read suggested that Lenin was [...] "a secular equivalent of theocratic leaders who derive their legitimacy from the [...] truth of their doctrines, not popular mandates". Lenin was nevertheless an atheist and a critic of religion, believing that socialism was inherently atheistic; he thus considered Christian socialism a <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E

The figure of 60 guilders comes from a letter by a representative of the Dutch Estates General and {{member of the board of}} the Dutch West India Company, Pieter Janszoon Schagen, to the Estates General in November 1626. In 1846, New York historian John Romeyn Brodhead converted the figure of Fl 60 (or 60 guilders) to US$23.

Based on the price of silver, Straight Dope author Cecil Adams calculated an equivalent of $72 in 1992. Historians James and Michelle Nevius revisited the issue in 2014, suggesting that using the prices of beer and brandy as monetary equivalencies, the price Minuit paid would have the purchasing power of somewhere between $2,600 and $15,600 in current dollars. According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley, Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys, chief of the Canarsees, who were willing to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for the island that was actually mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks.|$|E

This study was based on theoretical and methodological assumptions of cultural-historical Psychology.

The results indicate difficulties undergone by the indigenous students resulting from previous teaching experiences by non-indigenous teachers, especially regarding the Portuguese language.

30|$|Western China’s Development Strategy was {{basically}} intended to reduce regional disparities. However, there were <b>contradictions</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> {{of the policies}} involved {{and the way they}} were implemented. A main contradiction is between the state-owned and privatised enterprises. On the one hand, much effort was put into improving state infrastructure. On the other hand, privatisation was also a central component. The state-owned enterprises in the Western region account for a larger share of the local economy, compared to the coastal region. Privatisation might be used as a complementary tactic to improve the efficiency of state enterprises. But privatisation may also bring about other changes in the labour market. For example, growth in the service sector is usually accompanied with an increase in low-income and unsecure jobs (Schucher and Hebel 2006). That {{may be one of the}} reasons why the average income is lower in prefectures with higher levels of privatisation.|$|R
40|$|Human {{resource}} development as an objective of education policy {{in developing countries}} is increasingly narrowed down to its human capital component. In Eritrea, the objective of a highly centralized human {{resource development}} strategy is to produce human capital {{for the advancement of}} the nation. This instrumentalist view ignores the fact that education is not only related to one's position in a given society, but equally to the development of personal identity and new forms of agency on an individual level—thus potentially encompassing contradictions between the individual and the common good. This paper—based on the personal histories of a sample of female students at Asmara University—discusses these <b>contradictions</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of these women's acceptance of and resistance to the government's plan for them. It further argues that an education system geared predominantly towards the creation of human capital is bound to do so at the expense of social solidarity...|$|R
40|$|Manures are an {{inevitable}} consequence of livestock in agriculture. They represent a valuable source of nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus and potassium. The industrial production of fertilisers containing these elements {{is associated with}} finite resources and this alone justifies a proper recycling of manures. The N fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) of manures is still insufficiently appreciated and exploited. Mineral fertiliser N supplementation is thus unnecessarily large, to the potential detriment of the environment. The present paper reviews methods to correctly assess the NFRV of manures and presents measures to increase the NFRV. When proper attention {{is given to the}} composition of manures and decisions on rates, timing and application methods are made accordingly, the relative NFRV of manures could rise from the present 20 - 50 percent to 80 percent. This could lead to a further reduction of mineral N fertiliser use, N surpluses and pollution.
