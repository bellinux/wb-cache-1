5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Bible for themselves.|$|E
5|$|In 1530 Vermigli was {{appointed}} vicar {{of the monastery}} at San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. There he learned Hebrew from a local Jewish doctor so he <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament scriptures in their original language. Even among those who sought deeper biblical study, it was uncommon for clergy to learn Hebrew, though not unheard of. In 1533 the chapter-general elected Vermigli abbot of the two Lateran monasteries in Spoleto. At this post he was also responsible for two convents. The discipline in the monastic houses in Vermigli's care had been lax before his arrival, and they had {{become a source of}} scandal in Spoleto. There was also a history of power struggle between the Bishop of Spoleto, Francesco Eroli, and the Spoletan abbacy, {{to the point that the}} bishop had excommunicated Vermigli's predecessor, only to be overturned by Rome. Vermigli brought order to his houses and mended the relationship with the bishop.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{tradition}} {{holds that}} either Hotu Matu‘a or Tu‘u ko Iho, the legendary founder(s) of Rapa Nui, brought 67tablets from their homeland. The same founder is also credited with bringing indigenous {{plants such as}} the toromiro. However, there is no homeland likely {{to have had a}} tradition of writing in Polynesia or even in South America. Thus rongorongo appears to have been an internal development. Given that few if any of the Rapanui people remaining on the island in the 1870s <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> glyphs, it is likely that only a small minority were ever literate. Indeed, early visitors were told that literacy was a privilege of the ruling families and priests who were all kidnapped in the Peruvian slaving raids or died soon afterwards in the resulting epidemics.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Rothstein {{also argued}} {{that only a few}} of the medieval {{commentators}} held that a woman <b>could</b> intrinsically <b>read</b> all <b>the</b> aliyot, that most held they <b>could</b> <b>read</b> only some and some major authorities held they <b>could</b> <b>read</b> only <b>the</b> last one.

5|$|Second class' {{passengers}} were leisure tourists, academics, {{members of the}} clergy and middle class English and American families. The ship's musicians travelled in second class accommodations; they were not counted {{as members of the}} crew but were employed by an agency under contract to the White Star Line. The average ticket price for an adult second class passenger was £13, the equivalent of £ today. and for many of these passengers, their travel experience on the Titanic was akin to travelling first class on smaller liners. Second class passengers had their own library and the men had access to a private smoking room. Second class children <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> children's books provided in the library or play deck quoits and shuffleboard on the second class promenade. Twelve-year-old Ruth Becker passed the time by pushing her two-year-old brother Richard around the enclosed promenade in a stroller provided by the White Star Line.|$|E
25|$|When Sitchin {{wrote his}} books, only specialists <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Sumerian {{language}}. However, {{sources such as}} the 2006 book Sumerian Lexicon have made the language more accessible to non-experts.|$|E

25|$|Sidis's parents {{believed}} in nurturing a precocious and fearless love of knowledge, {{for which they}} were criticized. Sidis <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>The</b> New York Times at 18 months. By age 8, he had reportedly taught himself 8 languages (Latin, Greek, French, Russian, German, Hebrew, Turkish, and Armenian) and invented another, which he called Vendergood.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{at the age}} of 16, Lindh {{formally}} {{converted to}} Islam. He began regularly attending mosques in Mill Valley and later in nearby San Francisco. In 1998, Lindh traveled to Yemen and stayed for about 10 months to learn Arabic so that he <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an in its original language. He returned to the United States in 1999, living with his family for about eight months.|$|E
25|$|Living at Mt Elgin {{station in}} the Wimmera, Dick-a-Dick first gained notability as a talented tracker, someone who <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> land well enough to find and follow the tracks of people or animals. On Friday, 12 August 1864, three white children, Isaac Cooper, Jane Cooper and Frank Duff, went missing in the Mallee scrub of the Wimmera near Natimuk {{on the edge of}} the Little Desert and {{although}} their tracks were found the following day, a thunderstorm erupted soon after and destroyed the tracks.|$|E

25|$|An {{advantage}} that the Triple Nickel pilots had over other US aircrews was that eight of their F-4D Phantoms had the top secret APX-80 electronic set installed, {{known by its}} code-name Combat Tree. Combat Tree <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> IFF signals of the transponders built into the MiGs so that North Vietnamese GCI radar could discriminate its aircraft {{from that of the}} Americans. Displayed on a scope in the WSO's cockpit, Combat Tree gave the Phantoms the ability to identify and locate MiGs when they were still beyond visual range.|$|E
25|$|Dumézil's {{father was}} a classicist and Georges became {{interested}} in ancient languages {{at a young age}} (it has been said that he <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Aeneid in Latin at the age of nine) and, {{by the end of his}} life, he is said to have spoken many languages fluently. During his time in secondary school, he was also influenced by Michel Bréal, a leading French philologist who was the grandfather of one of his classmates. By the time that he entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1916, he was already on the road to studying linguistics and the classics.|$|E
25|$|During HyperCard's peak {{popularity}} in the late 1980s, a whole ecosystem of vendors offered thousands of these externals for everything from HyperTalk compilers to graphing systems, database access, internet connectivity, and animation. Oracle offered an XCMD that allowed HyperCard to directly query Oracle databases on any platform. This was later superseded by Oracle's Oracle Card product. BeeHive Technologies offered a hardware interface that allowed the computer to control external devices. Connected via the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), this instrument <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> state of connected external switches or write digital outputs to a multitude of devices.|$|E

25|$|Ashurbanipal {{was proud}} of his scribal education. He asserts this in the statement: “I Assurbanipal within , took care of the wisdom of Nebo, the whole of the inscribed tablets, of all the clay tablets, the whole of their mysteries and difficulties, I solved.”. He {{was one of the few}} kings who <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> {{cuneiform}} script in Akkadian and Sumerian, and claimed that he even read texts from before the great flood. He was also able to solve mathematical problems. During his reign, he collected cuneiform texts from all over Mesopotamia, especially Babylonia, in the library of Nineveh.|$|E
25|$|Around {{and above}} the map were more tellers who {{controlled}} the communications, connecting incoming reports to the plotter on the floor nearest that location on the map or connecting incoming requests for information to another teller who <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> map. Tellers examined the track markers, whose larger print allowed them to see the information, although this sometimes required opera glasses. Sometimes information {{would have to be}} plotted that came from an external source, not normally part of the reporting chain; a fighter calling an SOS would report this through his radio on an emergency frequency, which would be picked up by the closest listening post. This information would also flow into the filter room but they were not connected to the plotters on the floor. Operators above the map could mark locations of interest using theatrical spotlights and filters allowed them to change the message being projected.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} patent, Ritty became {{overwhelmed}} with {{the responsibilities of}} running two businesses, so he sold all of his interests in the cash register business to Jacob H. Eckert of Cincinnati, a china and glassware salesman, who formed the National Manufacturing Company. In 1884 Eckert sold the company to John H. Patterson, who renamed the company the National Cash Register Company and improved the cash register by adding a paper roll to record sales transactions, thereby creating the journal for internal bookkeeping purposes, and the receipt for external bookkeeping purposes. The original purpose of the receipt was enhanced fraud protection. The business owner <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> receipts to ensure that cashiers charged customers the correct amount for each transaction and did not embezzle the cash drawer. It also prevents a customer from defrauding the business by falsely claiming receipt of a lesser amount of change or a transaction that never happened in the first place. The first evidence of an actual cash register was used in Coalton, Ohio, at the old mining company.|$|E

25|$|Capello {{was signed}} by Paolo Mazza, the President of SPAL, for the fee of two million lire despite {{interest}} from Milan. In his second season in the youth team, he helped the club win the Italian Youth Championship and made his first-team debut against Sampdoria on 29 March 1964. A talented and tactically intelligent holding midfielder, with a good positional sense, he <b>could</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> play well and was strong both {{in the air and}} in the tackle, in spite of his lack of notable height and unorthodox physique; he usually operated as a deep-lying playmaker in midfield, however, due to his outstanding technique and vision, which enabled him to orchestrate his team's attacking moves or create chances for teammates, and was an excellent passer of the ball with both feet. Going forward he was also equally effective, and possessed an eye for goal from midfield, due to his powerful and accurate shot, as well as his ability at penalty kicks, but he lacked pace, and was notorious for not being particularly hard-working. With SPAL, he made four appearances for a struggling side that was relegated from Serie A. After returning to the top division at the first attempt, Capello became a key player in the 1965–66 season, taking penalties and helping them avoid a swift return to Serie B. He was also called up to the Italian under-23 side alongside teammate Edoardo Reja despite still being a teenager. However, injury to his left knee restricted him to just 16 appearances the following season.|$|E
