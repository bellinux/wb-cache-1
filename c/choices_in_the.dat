5|$|After 56 {{games with}} the Avalanche during the 2000–01 season, where he had 13 points, Miller was traded {{for the second time}} in his career. On February 21, 2001 Miller was sent to the Los Angeles Kings by the Colorado Avalanche with Adam Deadmarsh, a player later to be named (Jared Aulin, who would be traded on March 22, 2001) and Colorado's 1st round <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2001 (Dave Steckel) and 2003 (Brian Boyle) Entry Drafts for Rob Blake and Steven Reinprecht. Miller was not {{originally}} meant to be traded, but the Kings insisted he be part of the deal.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{was given a}} {{customizable}} ship named the Nemesis, commanded by Sterling and his crew. The player's <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game would determine the crew they could hire, which in turn affected the ship's attributes. The vessel {{could be used to}} explore the Caribbean Sea and battle other crafts. During combat, the player could maneuver the ship, fire the cannons, or board the enemy vessel for hand-to-hand combat. If the enemy craft was boarded and the enemy crew was eliminated, the player received more loot than if it was destroyed. Loot salvaged in these battles could be sold in markets.|$|E

5|$|Although the 2012–13 team {{graduated}} five {{seniors and}} had two underclassmen (Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway, Jr.) who were first-round draft <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2013 NBA Draft from the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament national runner-up team, {{three of the five}} national runner-up team starters (Mitch McGary, Glenn Robinson III and Nik Stauskas) were returning. The entering class included a pair of state Boys Basketball Gatorade Players of the Year in Indiana Mr. Basketball Zak Irvin and Derrick Walton, runner-up Mr. Basketball of Michigan, three scholarship players and four walk-ons. The team was a top-10 preseason selection, according to the vast majority of preseason rankings, and many media outlets selected McGary as a preseason All-American. Plagued with back problems during the season, McGary played in eight of the team's first eleven games before opting for season-ending surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is {{a departure}} from previous instalments in the series, using a direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's movements with a keyboard or gamepad, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character at certain times. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectable objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player has action <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom right of the screen - there are four circles with anywhere from one to four actions available at any time; the player selects the desired action with the corresponding key. As in the first two Broken Sword games, in The Sleeping Dragon player character death is possible.|$|E
5|$|Unless {{the player}} imports a Mass Effect 2 saved game where Tali cannot appear in Mass Effect 3, Tali shows when the Commander moves to recruit the quarian fleet {{in the fight}} against the Reapers, {{powerful}} sapient cyborgs with intentions to destroy all life. Tali joins the squad, and her conversation options tell of the quarians' new attack on the now Reaper-allied geth, in a bid by the quarians to try and reclaim their homeworld. Depending on the player's <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second game, Tali may either be an Admiral or merely an advisor on how to defeat the geth. Eventually, the player must choose between saving the geth or the quarians, or, if certain conditions are fulfilled, negotiating a stand-down and saving both parties. If the player sides with the geth and lets the quarians die, Tali kills herself; otherwise, she fully joins the squad and can be found interacting with other Normandy crew members. Admiral Shala'Raan vas Tonbay fulfills Tali's role in saved games where Tali cannot appear in-game. Shala'Raan does not join Shepard's squad.|$|E

5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E

25|$|Designing the {{configuration}} of production systems involves both technological and organizational variables. Choices in production technology involve: dimensioning capacity, fractioning capacity, capacity location, outsourcing processes, process technology, automation of operations, trade-off between volume and variety (see Hayes-Wheelwright matrix). <b>Choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organizational area involve: defining worker skills and responsibilities, team coordination, worker incentives and information flow.|$|E
25|$|In a final {{address to}} the jury on August 14, Judge Conlin {{informed}} the panel they had two <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> verdict they could render: Guilty of first-degree murder, or not guilty.

25|$|An {{advantage}} of psychedelic drugs in exploring the unconscious {{is that a}} conscious sliver of the adult ego usually remains alert during the experience. Throughout the session, patients remain intellectually alert and remember their experiences vividly. In this highly introspective state, they also are actively cognizant of ego defenses such as projection, denial, and displacement as they react to themselves and their <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> act of creating them.|$|E

25|$|The games {{all take}} place in the same fictional universe. Chaos;Head and Chaos;Child focus on {{individuals}} with reality-altering powers, while the Steins;Gate games focus on time travel. The player can affect the course of the story by making certain choices: in Chaos;Head and Chaos;Child this is done by choosing what kind of delusions the player characters experience. The <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Steins;Gate games and Robotics;Notes are made via messages set by the player via cell phone or tablet computer.|$|E
25|$|At random times {{throughout}} the game, though commonly in colonizing new planets, the player is presented with ethical <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of events where a wide-ranging decision {{needs to be}} made. Typically the good choice will cost the player something (either directly or indirectly). Conversely, the evil choice can bring benefits, albeit {{at the expense of}} other civilizations or the player's own population. A neutral choice is also presented as a compromise. To keep the game's ethics uncontroversial, the choices are made very clear-cut.|$|E
25|$|At the {{commencement}} of the WorkChoices reforms every state and territory of Australia had a Labor government. The States lodged {{a challenge to the}} Constitutional validity of Work <b>Choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> High Court of Australia. Various union groups also lodged their own challenge in the High Court. The High Court heard arguments between 4 May 2006 and 11 May 2006. On 14 November 2006 the High Court, by a 5 to 2 majority, rejected the challenge, upholding the Government's use of the corporations power as a constitutionally valid basis for the Work Choices reforms.|$|E

25|$|Existential – Existential {{psychotherapy}} postulates {{that people}} are largely free to choose {{who we are and}} how we interpret and interact with the world.

The therapist emphasizes the client’s ability to be self-aware, freely make <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living.|$|E
25|$|Feminist history {{refers to}} the re-reading and re-interpretation of history from a feminist perspective.

It also differs from women's history, which focuses on the role of women in historical events. The goal of feminist history is to explore and illuminate the female viewpoint of history through rediscovery of female writers, artists, philosophers, etc., in order to recover and demonstrate the significance of women's voices and <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past.|$|E
