40|$|Objective: There are evidences that proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20 peptide (PAMP) and {{calcitonin}} may {{be involved}} in cardiovascular function. Therefore, we studied effects of rat PAMP and human PAMP as well as <b>rat</b> <b>calcitonin</b> and salmon calcitonin on coronary perfusion pressure, heart rate and contractile force. Methods: Isolated rat hearts were perfused under constant flow condition and rat PAMP (1. 10 and 100 nM), human PAMP (1, 10 and 100 nM), <b>rat</b> <b>calcitonin</b> (10. 100 and 1000 nM) or salmon calcitonin (10. 100 and 1000 nM) were infused to the hearts. Coronary perfusion pressure, heart rate, left ventricular developed pressure and +dP/dtmax were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni posthoc tests. Results: Rat PAMP (1. 10 and 100 nM) did not alter perfusion pressure. However, it increased heart rate from 257. 83 ± 23. 89 to 282 ± 24. 98 beats/min (p< 0. 001), from 259. 83 ± 25. 05 to 289. 8 ± 19. 5 beats/min (p< 0. 001) and from 249. 66 ± 19. 19 to 280. 50 ± 25. 26 beats/min (p< 0. 001) for 1. 10 and 100 nM, respectively. Rat PAMP decreased left ventricular developed pressure from 90. 5 ± 18. 5 to 79 ± 15. 3 mmHg (p< 0. 05), from 88. 00 ± 10. 12 to 73. 00 ± 12. 38 mmHg (p< 0. 05) and from 79. 83 ± 8. 98 to 64. 83 ± 10. 12 mmHg (p< 0. 05) for 1. 10 and 100 nM, respectively. The peptide also decreased+dP/dtmax from 3710. 5 ± 370. 6 to 3223. 8 ± 261. 1 mmHg s- 1 (p< 0. 001), from 3683. 16 ± 327. 27 to 3040. 6 ± 423. 8 mmHg s- 1 (p< 0. 01) and from 3746. 16 ± 315. 76 to 3009. 83 ± 204. 64 mmHg s- 1 (p< 0. 001) for 1. 10 and 100 nM, respectively. <b>Rat</b> <b>calcitonin</b> (10. 100 and 1000 nM) did not change perfusion pressure but it decreased heart rate from 269. 16 ± 22. 6 to 253. 6 ± 22. 84 beats/min (p< 0. 05), from 263. 8 ± 27. 3 to 247. 00 ± 36. 63 beats/min (p< 0. 05) and from 285. 0 ± 32. 4 to 264. 00 ± 39. 83 beats/min (p< 0. 01) for 10. 100 and 1000 nM, respectively. <b>Rat</b> <b>calcitonin</b> did not significantly affect left ventricular developed pressure. Human PAMP or salmon calcitonin did not change perfusion pressure, heart rate and left ventricular developed pressure. Conclusion: We conclude that rat PAMP may induce positive chronotropic and negative inotropic effect while <b>rat</b> <b>calcitonin</b> may produce a negative chronotropic effect.

40|$|Although {{continuous}} {{progress has}} been accomplished {{in the field of}} osteoporosis study, the incidence of juvenile osteoporosis and its correlation with postmenopausal osteoporosis remains more or less unknown. PURPOSEThe {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the effect of salmon calcitonin on the geometry and bone density of normal, growing rats during the late pubescent period of life, the role of the duration and dose of the treatment, and the effect of discontinuation of the administration of calcitonin on these parameters. MATERIAL-METHODSSixty rats aged 8 weeks at the beginning of the experiment were allocated into 6 groups with 10 animals in each group. All treated animals received 5 IU of salmon calcitonin subcutaneously every day, a high daily dose of <b>calcitonin</b> in the <b>rat</b> model for three different periods (6 weeks - 20 weeks- 20 weeks and the animals remained untreated until the completion of 26 weeks) whether untreated rats received normal solution for relevant periods. The bone density was evaluated by means of pQCT, the dimensions of the bones were measured using a Vernier calliper whether the mechanical strength and stiffness were measured by means of the Karl-Frank mechanism. RESULTSIn contrast with short period treatment,following an administration of a high daily dose of calcitonin for a longer period, the mean volumetric bone density and the mean weight of <b>calcitonin</b> treated <b>rats</b> were statistically significant higher than placebo treated animals although these changes did not remained after discontinuation of therapy The mean diameter of long term <b>calcitonin</b> treated <b>rats</b> was greater than this of placebo treated animals at a level of statistical significance even following the discontinuation of calcitonin injections The mean wide and narrow external and internal diameter of the femur, the mean length of the femur and the mean thickness of femur cortex did not reveal significant changes between both groups throughout the experiment. The thickness of the epiphyseal plate remained significantly larger throughout the experiment and after discontinuation of the therapy compared with the placebo group. In contrast the mean width of the upper tibial epiphyseal plate and the mean height of the perichondrial ring of calcitonin treated animals was not statistical significant different with this of the control group throughout the experiment. CONCLUSIONOur study suggested that the long-term daily administration of salmon <b>calcitonin</b> in growing <b>rats</b> has a beneficial effect on the volumetric bone density, the outer diameter of femur, the mean thickness of femur cortex, the width of the epiphyseal plate and also on the longitudinal growth of long bones of growing animals. These benefits of subcutaneous calcitonin therapy on growing rat need to be confirmed in other experimental models of growing skeletons and also in humans especially in the field of preventive therapy of postmenopausal osteoporosis. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the effect of calcitonin gene related peptide on gastric acid secretion in the <b>rat.</b> <b>Calcitonin</b> gene related peptide (1 pmol- 1 nmol/rat) injected intravenously inhibited basal gastric acid secretion in awake, freely moving <b>rats.</b> <b>Calcitonin</b> gene related peptide decreased gastric secretion stimulated by histamine, pentagastrin, or bethanecol in anaesthetised rats. The inhibitory effect was immediate and most pronounced in the first hour and diminished during the second hour. The N- and C-terminal fragments of calcitonin gene related peptide, CGRP 1 - 14 and [Tyr 23]CGRP 23 - 37, did not affect gastric acid secretion. [acetamidomethyl-cys 2, 7]CGRP, the linear cysteine-protected molecule devoid of the disulphide bridge, was not biologically active. After truncal vagotomy or atropine sulphate, calcitonin gene related peptide did not inhibit gastric secretion. These studies indicate that calcitonin gene related peptide administered peripherally inhibits basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion in the rat. Both C- and N-terminal residues as well as the disulphide bridge are necessary for the inhibitory effect on gastric secretion.

CGRP concentration dependently (EC 50, 1 nM) also inhibited contraction of mesangial cells by angiotensin II (10 nivi). Angiotensin II (10 nM) caused a transient increase of the intracellular calcium concentration from 140 nM to 480 nM in the mesangial cells, but these calcium transients were not altered by CGRP.

In conclusion, CGRP causes relaxation of renal mesangial cells and decreases renal vascular resistance. As a result CGRP raises glomerular filtration and the filtration fraction.

40|$|Recent {{immunohistochemical}} {{demonstration of}} <b>calcitonin</b> in <b>rat</b> pituitary {{has suggested that}} calcitonin, in addition to ACTH, endorphins, lipotropins, and melanocyte-stimulating hormones might be derived from a 31, 000 -dalton glycoprotein percursor molecule. This immunoperoxidase study demonstrates a similar distribution for beta-endorphin and ACTH immunoreactivity in human pituitary; however, the two peptides are not necessarily present in the same cells at all times. Calcitonin could not be demonstrated in human pituitary under conditions suitable for demonstration of the peptide in thyroid C cells. Weakly positive immunostaining could be obtained only with much increase in antiserum concentration and length of incubation, and higher concentrations of calcitonin were needed to abolish staining in preabsorption studies. It thus appears that the immunoreactive calcitonin in human pituitary differs from that in thyroid C cells. Likewise, we could not demonstrate immunoreactive endorphin in any developmental stage of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Our study suggests that caution should be applied in considering a physiologic role for calcitonin in the pituitary and in postulating a common peptide origin for endorphin and calcitonin in humans...|$|R

Infusion of calcium into pregnant rats for 1 h after 21 =. days of gestation induced a sixfold increase in the level of calcitonin in the plasma after 30 min, and a threefold increase after 1 h. The level of calcitonin in the plasma of fed and unfed newborn rats was measured 2, 6, 12 and 16 h after birth. At each stage, the concentration of calcitonin was higher in fed than in unfed animals. Stomach gavage of fat (triglycerides) in fasted rats born 2 h earlier stimu-lated secretion of calcitonin; administration of pentagastrin or glucagon had no effect on the level of calcitonin in the plasma. Subcutaneous injection of a calcium load to fasted newborn rats (2 hours old) increased the level of calcitonin in the plasma after 30 min. These results demonstrate that during gestation calcitonin has a comparable role in rats to that already found in ruminants.

The contraction induced by the calcium ionophore A 23187 (10 (- 6) M) was also markedly reduced by epithelium removal.

Studies using antisera raised against CGRP and calcitonin, demonstrate elevated circulating levels of plasma CGRP in medullary thyroid carcinoma which do not parallel calcitonin levels, and the presence of CGRP in secretions from lung tumour cell-lines.

The receptors known as RDC 1 and L 1 have {{also been shown to}} bind CGRP and adrenomedullin respectively. In this study it is shown that rat CRLR cDNA specifies a CGRP receptor when co-transfected with RAMP- 1 cDNA and an adrenomedullin receptor when co-transfected with either RAMP- 2 or RAMP- 3 cDNA in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. CRLR, RAMP, RCD 1 and L 1 mRNA levels and CGRP and adrenomedullin receptor densities have been measured and correlated with each other in eight rat tissues selected for their distinctive patterns of CGRP and adrenomedullin binding. The data are consistent with the predictions of the CRLR/RAMP model. CGRP binding correlates well with RAMP- 1 mRNA levels (R= 1. 0, P= 0. 007), adrenomedullin binding shows a tendency to vary with RAMP- 2 mRNA levels (R= 0. 85, P= 0. 14) and total binding is correlated with CRLR mRNA levels (R= 0. 94, P= 0. 03).

40|$|Abstract: The {{presence}} {{and distribution of}} Griffonia Simplicifolia I-B 4 (GSA I-B 4) and Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) were studied in the nodose ganglion (NG) (inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve), sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) and superior cervical ganglion (SCG) of the rat. GSA I-B 4 labeling was found in all ganglia tested. Neither SPG nor SCG cell bodies stained with CGRP were undetectable. The pattern {{of the distribution of}} GSA I-B 4 and CGRP labeled cells were quite similar in the nodose ganglion. They were found in the poles of the ganglion with some marginal labeling. Large numbers of GSA I-B 4 and CGRP labeled cells were found and the number of labeled cells did not vary considerably between the two markers in this ganglion. GSA I-B 4 labeled neurons of the SPG and SCG were fewer in numbers compared with NG. These data demonstrate the presence of a “non-peptide ” population of unmyelinated primary afferents in sensory and autonomic ganglia with the lack of CGRP immunoreactivity in the autonomic ganglia. This suggests that the “non-peptide ” group of primary afferents are involved in different functional mechanisms than peptidergic afferents.

We aimed to determine whether gut immune cells are targets for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which has potent immune regulatory properties. Methods: Us-ing density gradient centrifugation, rat lamina propria mononuclear cells (LP-MNCs) and intra-epithelial lym-phocytes (IELs) were isolated. RT-PCR was employed for the detection of mRNA of <b>rat</b> <b>calcitonin</b> receptor-like receptor (CRLR), which is considered to represent the pharmacologically defined CGRP receptor- 1 subtype, as well as mRNA of the receptor activity-modifying pro-teins, which are essential for CRLR function and deter-mine ligand specificity.

Incubation of isolated LP-MNCs with radiolabelled ·CGRP revealed the existence of specific binding sites for CGRP. Conclusion: These novel data indicate that mucosal immune cells of the rat gut are a target for CGRP and provide significant evi-dence that CGRP functions as an immune regulator in the gut mucosa.

40|$|The {{effect of}} human adrenomedullin, human amylin {{fragment}} 8 - 37 and <b>rat</b> <b>calcitonin</b> gene-related pepted (CGRP) on contractile force, {{heart rate and}} coronary perfusion pressure has been investigated in the isolated perfused rat hearts. Adrenomedulllin (2 x 10 - 10, 2 x 10 - 9 and 2 - 10 - 8 M) produced {{a significant decrease in}} contractile force and perfusion pressure, but only the peptide caused a decline in heart rate at the highest dose. Amylin (10 - 9, 10 - 8 and 10 - 7 M) significantly increased and then decreased contractile force. Two doses of amylin (10 - 8 and 10 - 7 M) induced a significant increase in heart rate, however amylin did not change perfusion pressure in all the doses used. Rat aplha CGRP (10 - 8, 10 - 7 and 10 - 6 M) evoked a slight decline in contractile force following a significant increasing in contractile force induced by the peptide. CGRP in all the doses raised heart rate and lowered perfusion pressure. Our results suggest that adrenomedullin has negative inotropic, negative chronotropic and coronary vasodilator actions.

40|$|Abstract—Slow {{dissociation}} of endothelin 1 {{from its}} endothelin A receptors {{is responsible for}} the long-lasting vasoconstrictor effects of the peptide. We showed recently that calcitonin gene-related peptide selectively terminates long-lasting contractile responses to endothelin 1 in isolated rat mesenteric arteries. Here we assessed whether the antiendothelinergic effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide is vascular bed specific and may terminate long-lasting pressor responses to exogenous and locally produced endothelin 1 in vivo. Regional heterogeneity of the calcitonin gene-related peptide/endothelin A receptor cross-talk was explored in arteries isolated from various rat organs. Endothelin A receptor-mediated arterial contractions were terminated by calcitonin gene-related peptide in rat mesenteric, renal, and spermatic arteries but not in basilar, coronary, epigastric, gastric, splenic, and saphenous arteries. Endothelin A receptor antagonism only ended endothelin 1 –induced contractions in spermatic arteries. In anesthetized rats, instrumented with Doppler flow probes to record regional blood flows, long-lasting pressor and vasoconstrictor responses to an intravenous bolus injection of endothelin 1 or big endothelin 1 were transiently reduced by sodium nitroprusside (NO donor) but terminated by intravenously administered calcitonin gene-related peptide. In conscious <b>rats,</b> <b>calcitonin</b> gene-related peptide but not sodium nitroprusside terminated prolonged (60 -minute) pressor responses to endothelin 1 but not those to intravenous infusion of phenylephrine.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{function of}} amylin is investigated in L 6 myocytes, a rat skeletal muscle cell line. Both rat amylin and human amylin-amide acutely cause a dose-dependent increase in cyclic AMP formation in L 6 myocytes. 100 nM rat amylin stimulates intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations 12 -fold, whereas human amylin-amide at this concentration causes only a 2 -fold increase. Up to 10 mM human amylin {{has no effect}} on cyclic AMP levels. <b>Rat</b> <b>calcitonin</b> gene-related peptide (CGRP) is more potent than amylin, causing a 60 -fold increase over basal at 1 nM, with an EC 50 value of 0. 2 nM. The CGRP receptor antagonist, human CGRP 8 - 37 (hCGRP 8 - 37), completely blocks the stimulatory effect of both rat amylin and human amylin-amide on cyclic AMP production. [125 I]CGRP binds specifically to a membrane fraction prepared from L 6 myocytes with a Kd = 2. 1 nM and Bmax = 144 fmol/mg protein. The antagonist peptide displaces [125 I]CGRP with a Ki of 0. 9 nM, while rat amylin also displaces [125 I]CGRP with a Ki of 91 nM. Specific binding of [125 I]CGRP to plasma membranes of rat liver and brain is also displaced by rat amylin with Ki values of 35 nM and 37 nM, respectively. In contrast, specific binding of [125 I]amylin to numerous cells and tissues, under similar conditions, can not be demonstrated. These results suggest that the cellular effects and physiological actions of amylin may be mediated through receptors for CGRP...|$|R

MÉTODOS: Quarenta e oito ratos Wistar, machos e adultos foram distribuídos aleatoriamente em dois grupo com 24 animais. Defeitos femorais bilaterais, com 2 mm de diâmetro, foram produzidos na diáfise femoral e preenchidos com matriz óssea bovina desvitalizada. O grupo experimento recebeu 0, 05 mL de calcitonina, intramuscular, no pós-operatório imediato; o grupo controle recebeu 0, 05 mL de cloreto de sódio 0, 9 %. Os animais foram sacrificados com 7, 14 e 21 dias e os fêmures submetidos a avaliação clínica, microscópica e histométrica. Foram utilizados os testes "t" de Student, Kruskal-Wallis e Mann-Whitney para a análise estatística dos resultados. RESULTADOS: Os resultados clínicos não mostraram diferença entre os grupos controle e experimento. Microscopicamente, os defeitos mostraram reação inflamatória e formação óssea ativa nas proximidades da matriz óssea bovina. A análise quantitativa mostrou maior formação óssea nas fases iniciais da osteogênese reparadora no grupo experimento (Z= 4, 82 e Z= 4, 43), sem diferenças em relação à reação inflamatória em ambos grupos. CONCLUSÃO: O uso de calcitonina em defeitos preenchidos com matriz óssea bovina desvitalizada estimula a neoformação óssea com 7 e 14 dias de pós-operatório, mas não diminui a reação inflamatória.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{polypeptide}} hormone calcitonin is clinically {{well known for}} its ability to relieve neuropathic pain such as spinal canal stenosis, diabetic neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome. Mechanisms for its analgesic effect, however, remain unclear. Here we investigated the mechanism of anti-hyperalgesic action of calcitonin in a neuropathic pain model in rats. Results Subcutaneous injection of elcatonin, a synthetic derivative of eel calcitonin, relieved hyperalgesia induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI). Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the CCI provoked the upregulation of tetrodotoxin (TTX) -sensitive Nav. 1. 3 mRNA and downregulation of TTX-resistant Nav 1. 8 and Nav 1. 9 mRNA on the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which would consequently increase the excitability of peripheral nerves. These changes were reversed by elcatonin. In addition, the gene expression of the calcitonin receptor and binding site of 125 I-calcitonin was increased at the constricted peripheral nerve tissue but not at the DRG. The anti-hyperalgesic effect and normalization of sodium channel mRNA by elcatonin was parallel to the change of the calcitonin receptor expression. Elcatonin, however, did not affect the sensitivity of nociception or gene expression of sodium channel, while it suppressed calcitonin receptor mRNA under normal conditions. Conclusions These results suggest that the anti-hyperalgesic action of <b>calcitonin</b> on CCI <b>rats</b> could be attributable to the normalization of the sodium channel expression, which might be exerted by an unknown signal produced at the peripheral nerve tissue but not by DRG neurons through the activation of the calcitonin receptor. Calcitonin signals were silent in the normal condition and nerve injury may be one of triggers for conversion of a silent to an active signal. </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveCalcitonin was {{recently}} reported to counter progression of cartilage degradation in an experimental model of osteoarthritis, {{and the effects}} were primarily suggested to be mediated by inhibition of subchondral bone resorption. We investigated direct effects of calcitonin on chondrocytes by assessing expression of the receptor and pharmacological effects on collagen type II degradation under ex vivo and in vivo conditions. MethodsLocalization of the calcitonin receptor on articular chondrocytes was investigated by immunohistochemistry, and the expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In bovine articular cartilage explants, cartilage degradation was investigated by release of C-terminal telopeptides of collagen type II (CTX-II), induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [20 ng/ml] and oncostatin M (OSM) [10 ng/ml], with salmon calcitonin [0. 0001 – 1 μM]. In vivo, cartilage degradation was investigated in ovariectomized (OVX) rats administered with oral calcitonin [2 mg/kg calcitonin] for 9 weeks. ResultsThe calcitonin receptor was identified in articular chondrocytes by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Calcitonin concentration-dependently increased cAMP levels in isolated chondrocytes. Explants cultured with TNF-α and OSM showed a 100 -fold increase in CTX-II release compared to vehicle-treated controls (P< 0. 001). The degradation of type II collagen in these explants was concentration-dependently inhibited by calcitonin, 65 % protection at 10 nM calcitonin (P< 0. 01). TNF-α and OSM induced a pronounced increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, which was strongly inhibited by calcitonin. In vivo, administration of salmon <b>calcitonin</b> to OVX <b>rats</b> resulted in significant (P< 0. 001) decrease in CTX-II levels. ConclusionThese results are the first evidence of calcitonin receptor expression on articular chondrocytes and that the chondroprotective effects of calcitonin might involve the inhibition of MMP expression...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} study was the in vivo {{evaluation}} of thiomer-coated liposomes for an oral application of peptides. For this purpose, salmon calcitonin was chosen as a model drug and encapsulated within liposomes. Subsequently, the drug loaded liposomes were coated with either chitosan–thioglycolic acid (CS–TGA) or an S-protected version of the same polymer (CS–TGA–MNA), leading to an increase in the particle size of about 500 nm and an increase in the zeta potential from approximately − 40 mV to a maximum value of about + 44 mV, depending on the polymer. Coated liposomes were demonstrated to effectively penetrate the intestinal mucus layer where they came in close contact with the underlying epithelium. To investigate the permeation enhancing properties of the coated liposomes ex vivo, we monitored the transport of fluoresceinisothiocyanate-labeled salmon <b>calcitonin</b> (FITC-sCT) through <b>rat</b> small intestine. Liposomes coated with CS–TGA–MNA showed the highest effect, leading to a 3. 8 -fold increase in the uptake of FITC-sCT versus the buffer control. In vivo evaluation of the different formulations was carried out by the oral application of 40 μg of sCT per rat, either encapsulated within uncoated liposomes, CS–TGA-coated liposomes or CS–TGA–MNA-coated liposomes, or given as a solution serving as negative control. The blood calcium level was monitored over a time period of 24 h. The highest reduction in the blood calcium level, to a minimum of 65 % of the initial value after 6 h, was achieved for CS–TGA–MNA-coated liposomes. Comparing the areas above curves (AAC) of the blood calcium levels, CS–TGA–MNA-coated liposomes led to an 8. 2 -fold increase compared to the free sCT solution if applied orally in the same concentration. According to these results, liposomes coated with S-protected thiomers have demonstrated to be highly valuable carriers for enhancing the oral bioavailability of salmon calcitonin...|$|R

Furthermore, in the rat, the calcémie response to parathyroid hormone (PTH) is decreased by calcitonin stimulation. However, in renal failure, {{it is not}} known if an increase in the serum calcium concentration within the physiologic range of serum calcium stimulates calcitonin and whether the increased calcitonin decreases the calcémie response to PTH. In the present study, four groups of pair-fed rats were evaluated: normals (N); parathyroidectomy (PTX); and two groups with renal failure (RF) —basal serum calcium 8. 5 mg/dl (RFb). Hypocalcemia was induced by parathyroidectomy or in the RFa group, by a high phosphate diet. Increases in the serum calcium were produced by a 48 hour infusion of rat 1 - 34 PTH. In the RFa and PTX groups, stimulation of calcitonin was observed as the serum calcium increased from hypocalcemia to normal levels of calcium (P< 0. 01). In all four groups, increasing the serum calcium from normal levels to hypercalcemia increased the serum calcitonin level (P < 0. 05). The {{relationship between}} serum calcitonin and calcium was best expressed as a sigmoidal curve. In the two groups with basal hypocalcemia, PTX and RFa, the calcitonin-calcium curve was shifted {{to the left of the}} N and RFb groups. In conclusion, 1) the presence of a calcitonin-calcium curve suggests the possibility of a regulatory function for calcitonin during acute increases in the serum calcium; 2) the basal serum calcium concentration may determine the calcium level at which calcitonin is stimulated; and 3) the stimulation of calcitonin in the physiologic range of serum calcium suggests that endogenous calcitonin production may decrease the calcémie response to PTH in renal failure...|$|R

An analgesic effect of calcitonin has been observed and reported in clinical situations. Ovariectomaized (OVX) rats exhibit the same hormonal changes as observed in humans with osteoporosis and are an animal model of postmenopousal osteoporosis. The aim of this study to investigate antinociceptive effect of <b>calcitonin</b> in OVX <b>rats</b> using the immunohistochemical study. Methods We assessed the antinociceptive effects of calcitonin in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model, which exhibit osteoporosis and hyperalgesia, using the immunohistochemical method. Fifteen rats were ovariectomized bilaterally, and ten rats were received the same surgery expected for ovariectomy as a sham model. We used five groups: the OVX-CT (n = 5), the sham-CT (n = 5), and the OVX-CT-pcpa (n = 5) groups recieved calcitonin (CT: 4 U/kg/day), while OVX-vehi (n = 5) and the sham-vehi (n = 5) groups received vehicle subcutaneously 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The OVX-CT-pcpa-group was given traperitoneal injection of p-chlorophenylalanine (pcpa; an inhibitor of serotonin biosynthesis) (100 mg/kg/day) in the last 3 days of calcitonon injection. Two hours after 5 % formalin (0. 05 ml) subcutaneously into the hind paw, the L 5 spinal cord were removed and the number of Fos-immunoreactive (ir) neurons were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney-U test. Results The numbers of Fos-ir neurons in the OVX-CT and sham-CT groups were significantly less than in the OVX-vehi and sham-vehi groups, respectively (p = 0. 0090, p = 0. 0090). The number of Fos-ir neurons in the OVX-CT-pcpa-group was significantly more than that of the OVX-CT-group (p = 0. 0283), which means pcpa inhibits calcitonin induced reduction of c-Fos production. Conclusion The results in this study demonstrated that 1) the increase of c-Fos might be related to hyperalgesia in OVX-rats. 2) Calcitonin has an antinociceptive effect in both OVX and sham rats. 3) The central serotonergic system is involved in the antinociceptive properties of calcitonin. </p...|$|R
