5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the <b>currency</b> <b>snake.</b> The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E
50|$|On {{the basis}} of various {{previous}} proposals, an expert group chaired by Luxembourgâ€™s Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Pierre Werner, presented in October 1970 the first commonly agreed blueprint to create an economic and monetary union in three stages (Werner plan). The project experienced serious setbacks from the crises arising from the non-convertibility of the US dollar into gold in August 1971 (i.e., {{the collapse of the}} Bretton Woods System) and from rising oil prices in 1972. An attempt to limit the fluctations of European <b>currencies,</b> using a <b>snake</b> in the tunnel, failed.|$|R
5000|$|A {{first attempt}} to create an {{economic}} and monetary union between {{the members of the}} European Economic Community goes back to an initiative by the European Commission in 1969, which set out the need for [...] "greater co-ordination of economic policies and monetary cooperation." [...] This was followed up {{at a meeting of the}} European Council at The Hague in December 1969. The European Council tasked Pierre Werner, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, with finding a way to reduce currency exchange rate volatility. His report was published in October 1970 and recommended centralisation of the national macroeconomic policies entailing [...] "the total and irreversible fixing of parity rates and the complete liberation of movements of capital." [...] But he did not propose a single currency or central bank. An attempt to limit the fluctuations of European <b>currencies,</b> using a <b>snake</b> in the tunnel, failed.|$|R
