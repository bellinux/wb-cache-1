40|$|Commission staff {{documented}} {{the results of}} its comprehensive technical assessment of penetration seals. Subsequently, the staff assessed new information for new insights. The results of the updated assessment are documented in this report. Nuclear power plants use the “defense in depth” concept of echelons of fire protection to achieve {{a high degree of}} fire safety. Fire barrier penetration seals, which are one element of the fire protection defense-in-depth concept, are designed to <b>confine</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> to the area in which it started or to protect plant systems and components within an area from a fire outside the area. For the reasons given in this report, it is the staff’s judgment that, generically, typical penetration seal deficiencies do not equate t...|$|E

The effect stems from an induced hotspot that melts and emits ionized copper vapors as <b>a</b> <b>confined</b> <b>fire</b> column. Nanoparticles of ~ 20 - 120 nm size were {{revealed in the}} ejected column by in situ small-angle x-ray scattering. Optical spectroscopy confirmed the dominance of copper particles in the plasma column originating {{directly from}} the copper substrate. Nano- and macroparticles of copper were verified also by ex situ scanning electron microscopy. The direct conversion of solid metals to nanoparticles is demonstrated and various applications are proposed...|$|R
60|$|The chief {{point of}} attack {{was now the}} centre. Here a column of grenadiers, {{supported}} by a heavy line of infantry, advanced to the assault, but the Guards stoutly maintained themselves until General Coote, with his brigade, came up, and the French were then driven back. All this time the French guns kept up an incessant cannonade on the British position. The attack on the British left, which had been but a feint, was never seriously pursued, but was <b>confined</b> to <b>a</b> scattered <b>fire</b> of musketry and a distant cannonade. General Hutchinson, who commanded here, kept his force in hand; for, had he moved to the assistance of the centre and right, a serious attack might have been made on him, and the flank being thus turned, the position would have been taken in rear.|$|R

40|$|The general {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} recognition of universal patterns in wall-bounded adverse pressure gradient turbulent flows. For this purpose, the experimental work has been carried out towards further understanding of this class of flows, especially when the pressure gradient is increasingly adverse. Adverse pressure gradient turbulent flows and subsequent flow separation from a plane or curved wall are encountered frequently in engineering applications in both internal and external flows. Common examples of such internal flows can be seen in diffuser flows in turbomachinery applications, in the flow passages of vehicles and appliances, and in the flow passages inside <b>a</b> <b>confining</b> structure during <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b> Some examples of adverse pressure gradient external flows are, the flow over an aerofoil, a fuselage or a passenger car. In both internal and external cases, separation causes momentum and energy losses, and due to the complexity of the resulting flow physics, flow prediction becomes difficult for design purposes or performance optimisation. In most cases, turbulent separation reduces performance efficiency. There is a definite lack of turbulence data in the literature for adverse pressure gradient flows with and without separation. Hence, thorough experimental investigation is valuable in developing a fundamental understanding of such complex turbulent flows leading to practical turbulence modelling. ...|$|R
