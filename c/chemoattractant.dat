5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} testing a specific integrin, alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in neuroblast migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice. By using antibodies to bind to α6β1 integrin subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 integrin functions and determined it was via the <b>chemoattractant</b> laminin. This was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration”. The researchers concluded with the idea that this research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially be drawn to locations of injury or disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{molecular}} cues involved in the correct targeting of the migrating precursors remains a question. The secretion of a <b>chemoattractant</b> factor by the OB appears as a possibility. Chemoattractants and repellants act on the migrating neurons by inducing changes in the growth cone to direct them. Nevertheless, tissue derived from this structure had no directive influence on the migration. On the other hand, a septum-derived secreted factor showed a repulsive effect on the SVZ cells. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that the secreted molecule SLIT shows such a repelling effect on SVZ-derived precursors. Furthermore, integrins have been demonstrated to have a regulatory influence on precursor cell chain-migration and regulation of their divisions.|$|E

40|$|Neutrophils {{constitute}} the largest class of {{white blood cells}} and are the first responders in the innate immune response. They are able to sense and migrate up concentration gradients of <b>chemoattractants</b> in search of primary sites of infection and inflammation through {{a process known as}} chemotaxis. These <b>chemoattractants</b> include formylated peptides and various chemokines. While much is known about chemotaxis to individual <b>chemoattractants,</b> far less is known about chemotaxis towards many. Previous studies have shown that in opposing gradients of intermediate <b>chemoattractants</b> (interleukin- 8 and leukotriene B 4), neutrophils preferentially migrate toward the more distant source. In this work, we investigated neutrophil chemotaxis in opposing gradients of <b>chemoattractants</b> using a microfluidic platform. We found that primary neutrophils exhibit oscillatory motion in opposing gradients of intermediate <b>chemoattractants.</b> To understand this behavior, we constructed a mathematical model of neutrophil chemotaxis. Our results suggest that sensory adaptation alone cannot explain the observed oscillatory motion. Rather, our model suggests that neutrophils employ a winner-take-all mechanism that enables them to transiently lock onto sensed targets and continuously switch between the intermediate attractant sources as they are encountered. These findings uncover a previously unseen behavior of neutrophils in opposing gradients of <b>chemoattractants</b> that will further aid in our understanding of neutrophil chemotaxis and the innate immune response. In addition, we propose a winner-take-all mechanism allows the cells to avoid stagnation near local chemica...|$|R

However, ergot alkaloids also have repellent and immobilizing effects on P. scribneri, and an endophyte of perennial ryegrass lacking lolines, and genetically engineered to produce no ergot alkaloids, exhibits resistance to this nematode. Therefore, the relative importance of the loline and ergot alkaloids to nematode resistance remains unclear.|$|E

Other gliadin peptides, {{one in a}} {{glutamine}} rich region and another peptide, [...] "QVLQQSTYQLLQELCCQHLW", [...] bind a <b>chemoattractant</b> receptor, CXCR3. Gliadin binds to, blocks and displaces a factor, I-TAC, that binds this receptor. In the process it recruits more CXCR3 receptor, increases MyD88 and Zonulin expression. The factor it displaces, I-TAC, is a T-cell attractant. This peptide may also be involved in increased risk for type 1 diabetes as zonulin production is also a factor. This triggering of zonulin ultimately results in the degradation of tight junctions allowing large solutes, such as proteolytic resistant gliadin fragments to enter behind the brush border membrane cells.|$|E
50|$|Mammalian spermatozoa, like {{sea-urchin}} spermatozoa, {{appear to}} sense the <b>chemoattractant</b> gradient temporally (comparing receptor occupancy over time) rather than spatially (comparing receptor occupancy over space). This is because {{the establishment of a}} temporal gradient in the absence of spatial gradient, achieved by mixing human spermatozoa with a <b>chemoattractant</b> or by photorelease of a <b>chemoattractant</b> from its caged compound, results in delayed transient changes in swimming behavior that involve increased frequency of turns and hyperactivation events. On the basis of these observations and the finding that the level of hyperactivation events is reduced when chemotactically responsive spermatozoa swim in a spatial <b>chemoattractant</b> gradient it was proposed that turns and hyperactivation events are suppressed when capacitated spermatozoa swim up a <b>chemoattractant</b> gradient, and vice versa when they swim down a gradient.|$|E

First, rifampin inhibited chemotaxis induced with FMLP but reversed the immobilization of PMLs that occurred at high FMLP concentrations. Second, rifampin competed with radiolabeled FMLP for binding sites on PMLs and displaced already-bound radiolabeled FMLP. Third, rifampin blocked and reversed the bipolar shape changes induced in PMLs by FMLP. These effects occurred at concentrations attained during rifampin therapy and were not due to rifampin toxicity. In contrast, no effect of rifampin was observed on serum-derived <b>chemoattractants</b> (C 5 a) in any of the three systems. The evidence suggests, therefore, that rifampin is a ligand for FMLP-type receptors on PMLs...|$|R
40|$|Endotoxemia in rats is {{associated}} with the accumulation of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) within the airspaces of the lung. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte influx appears to be regulated by the intrapulmonary accumulation of chemotactic activity. Since alveolar macrophages (AMS) are prevalent cells in the airspace and are known to release a variety of chemotactic factors, we investigated the effect of endotoxin exposure on AM production of chemotactic activity. We tested the hypothesis that endotoxin-exposed AMs have an augmented ability to produce <b>chemoattractants.</b> We recovered AMs by bronchoalveolar lavage from control rats and from rats treated in vivo with a "low dose" (2. 5 mg/kg) or a "high dose" (5. 0 mg/kg) of Escherichia coli endotoxin. These AMs were then cultured in vitro for 15 h in the absence or the presence of endotoxin (15 and 30 micrograms/ml) to stimulate the cells to produce <b>chemoattractants.</b> We found that in vitro endotoxin stimulated normal AMs to secrete <b>chemoattractants</b> in a dose-dependent fashion. AMs from rats treated with endotoxin in vivo spontaneously secreted more <b>chemoattractants</b> than AMs from control rats. Exposure to in vivo endotoxin followed by in vitro stimulation with endotoxin resulted in an even greater production of <b>chemoattractants</b> by AMs. We found a significant association between the percent polymorphonuclear leukocytes recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage from the airspaces and the production of <b>chemoattractants</b> by AMs from the same specimen. The level of chemotactic activity spontaneously produced by AMs predicted the degree of stimulated production of chemotactic activity. Partial purification indicated that this chemotactic activity has two molecular weight peaks, one near 1, 000 and the other near 50, 000. The activity was stable at 100 degrees C for at least 30 min and was degradable by trypsinization. We conclude that endotoxin can induce AM production of <b>chemoattractants</b> and that prior exposure to endotoxin in vivo affects the response of AM to in vitro endotoxin exposure. By inference, it is possible that this endotoxin-macrophage interaction may serve as a biologic amplifier of the effects of endotoxin and may have a role in the pathogenesis of septic lung injury in humans...|$|R

50|$|Here, too, {{there is}} no single rule. In some species (for example, in hydroids like Campanularia or {{tunicate}} like Ciona), the swimming direction of the spermatozoa changes abruptly towards the <b>chemoattractant</b> source. In others (for example, in sea urchin, hydromedusa, fern, or fish such as Japanese bitterlings), the approach to the <b>chemoattractant</b> source is indirect and the movement is by repetitive loops of small radii. In some species (for example, herring or the ascidian Ciona) activation of motility precedes chemotaxis. In chemotaxis, cells may either sense a temporal gradient of the <b>chemoattractant,</b> comparing the occupancy of its receptors at different time points (as do bacteria), or they may detect a spatial gradient, comparing the occupancy of receptors at different locations along the cell (as do leukocytes). In the best-studied species, sea urchin, the spermatozoa sense a temporal gradient and respond to it with a transient increase in flagellar asymmetry. The outcome is a turn in the swimming path, followed by a period of straight swimming, leading to the observed epicycloid-like movements directed towards the <b>chemoattractant</b> source.|$|E

40|$|Previously, our {{laboratory}} {{showed that}} bovine and caprine mammary secretions are chemotactic and that <b>chemoattractants</b> found in these secretions are qualitatively different according to infection status and/or lactation stage. However, the cellular {{source of the}} <b>chemoattractants</b> has not been defined. In this study we used a modified Boyden chamber assay to examine the ability of previously established caprine mammary epithelial cell (CMEC) and myoepithelial cell (CMMyoEC) lines to produce <b>chemoattractants</b> for neutrophils. We found that CMEC culture supernatants, but not those of CMMyoEC cultures, induced in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis. Further characterization showed that chemotactic activity was produced when the cells underwent contact-induced differentiation. Neutrophil migration was chemotactic, not chemokinetic, and was augmented when the epithelial and myoepithelial cells were cocultured. Additionally, chemotactic activity was inducible by Staphylococcus aureus plus alpha-toxin, Escherichia coli, and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) in CMEC cultures. However, CMMyoEC cultures could not be induced to produce chemotactic activity. Anti-IL- 8 antibody was able to block some constitutively produced chemotactic activity and chemotactic activity induced by IL- 1 β and S. aureus plus alpha-toxin.

40|$|Twelve {{phenolic}} compounds with related structures were analyzed {{for their ability}} to act as <b>chemoattractants</b> for Agrobacterium tumefaciens C 58 C 1 and as inducers of the Ti plasmid virulence operons.

A strong correlation between vir-inducing ability and Ti plasmid requirement for chemotaxis is thus established. In addition, chemical structure rules for vir induction and chemotaxis are outlined. Positive chemotaxis toward root and shoot homogenates from monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants was observed. At low extract concentrations, chemotaxis was enhanced by the presence of Ti plasmid. The <b>chemoattractants</b> do not derive from intact cell walls.

40|$|Mast cells (MCs) are {{forceful}} multifunctional {{effector cells}} of the immune system. MCs are normally distributed throughout connective and mucosal tissues, but in several pathological conditions accumulation of MCs occur. This accumulation is probable due to directed migration of MCs and they are subjects for migration at least two different occations: 1) when they are recruited as progenitor cells from the blood into the tissue; and 2) when they as mature MCs are recruited to sites of inflammation. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate MC migration to <b>chemoattractants</b> released in vivo or in vitro (body fluids collected from patients with asthma or rheumatoid arthritis and TH 1 - and TH 2 -cytokines) and to recombinant cytokines (transforming growth factor -β (TGF-β) and CCL 5 /RANTES). This thesis shows that bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from asthmatic patients and synovial fluid from patients with rheumatiod arthritis contain MC <b>chemoattractants,</b> and that part of the chemotactic activity can be related to the presence of stem cell factor (SCF) and TGF-β. We also show that MC chemotactic activity during pollen season is significantly increased compared to before pollen season. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TGF-β isoforms, CCL 5, TNF-α and IL- 4 act as MC <b>chemoattractants</b> in a bellshaped dose- dependent manner. TGF-β proved to be an extremely potent attractant giving an optimal migratory response at 40 fM and TGF-β 3 being the most effective isoform. The chemokine CCL 5 induced migration through interaction with the receptors CCR 1 and CCR 4 expressed on MC. Furthermore, we also found that TNF-α produced by TH 1 -lymphocytes and IL- 4 produced by TH 2 -lymphocytes are MC <b>chemoattractants.</b> In conclusion, with this thesis we have identified six new human mast cell <b>chemoattractants</b> and provide evidence that BAL fluid and synovial fluid from patients with asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, respectivly, contain MC <b>chemoattractants.</b> This information provides important clues in understanding the mechanisms behind MC recruitment to sites of inflammation...|$|R

Arginine-containing peptides gave the best responses. Reduced responses to larger peptides suggest that porin penetration is required. No extracellular peptidase activity was detected.

Chemotactic peptides did not affect the metabolism of the phospholipids in which [methyl- 14 C]choline was incorporated. The disappearance of the [3 H]methyl group was associated with the release of [1 - 14 C]arachidonic acid from phospholipids prelabeled with these compounds. These findings suggested the activation by <b>chemoattractants</b> of phospholipase A 2, an enzyme that removes an unsaturated fatty acid from phospholipids. The order of potency of <b>chemoattractants</b> for the stimulated degradation of phospholipids was in good agreement with that for chemotaxis.

40|$|A {{platelet}} aggregometer {{was adapted}} for the simultaneous measurement of perpendicular light scattering {{in addition to}} light transmission. The addition of <b>chemoattractants</b> to polymorphonuclear leukocyte suspensions evoked a single wave of increased light transmission, whereas the perpendicular scattering measurement demonstrated a previously unrecognized biphasic response. The first perpendicular scattering response had no detectable latency and peaked at 10 +/- 1 s, then decayed rapidly. The second response peaked at 40 +/- 5 s, and decayed over several minutes. The dose-response curve of <b>chemoattractants</b> for inducing the rapid (10 +/- 1 s) perpendicular scattering peak corresponded to that which initiated chemotaxis. Initiation of the slow (40 +/- 5 s) peak required 10 -fold higher amounts of <b>chemoattractants,</b> and the dose-response curve correlated with the induction of lysosomal enzyme secretion and superoxide anion production. Low doses of aliphatic alcohols, which {{have been shown to}} enhance chemotaxis but to inhibit secretion and superoxide anion production, abolished the slow perpendicular light-scattering response but left the fast response intact. Stimulants of secretion induced only slow and prolonged responses that were best observed in transmission measurements. In an attempt to resolve the origin of the light-scattering responses, the morphological changes of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were examined microscopically. Neither aggregation nor morphological whole cell polarization could be correlated with changes in light transmission or perpendicular scattering, which suggested that the source of scattering is of subcellular dimensions. The rapid perpendicular light-scattering response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to <b>chemoattractants</b> appears to record an initial event in the stimulus-response coupling, and its measurement should provide a useful new tool for the study of leukocyte function. The biphasic nature of the light-scattering responses to <b>chemoattractants,</b> moreover, correlates with the dual regulation of the chemotactic and secretory responses of leukocytes...|$|R
40|$|Migration of {{mast cells}} is {{essential}} for their recruitment within target tissues where they {{play an important role}} in innate and adaptive immune responses. These processes rely on the ability of mast cells to recognize appropriate chemotactic stimuli and react to them by a chemotactic response. Another level of intercellular communication is attained by production of <b>chemoattractants</b> by activated mast cells, which results in accumulation of mast cells and other hematopoietic cells at the sites of inflammation. Mast cells express numerous surface receptors for various ligands with properties of potent <b>chemoattractants.</b> They include the stem cell factor (SCF) recognized by c-Kit, antigen, which binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE) anchored to the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI), highly cytokinergic (HC) IgE recognized by FcεRI, lipid mediator sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P), which binds to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Other large groups of <b>chemoattractants</b> are eicosanoids [prostaglandin E 2 and D 2, leukotriene (LT) B 4, LTD 4, and LTC 4, and others] and chemokines (CC, CXC, C, and CX 3 C), which also bind to various GPCRs.
