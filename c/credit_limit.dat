5|$|The Desert Inn opened {{formally}} on April 24, 1950, at {{a two-day}} gala which was heavily publicized nationally. Journalists {{from all of}} the major newspapers and magazines were invited, and the hotel paid $5,700 to cover air tickets. 150 invitations were sent out by Clark to VIPs with a <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> of $10,000. About half the attendees at the opening were from California and Nevada. At the opening show in the Painted Desert Room were performers such as Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Vivian Blaine, Pat Patrick, The Donn Arden Dancers, Van Heflin, Abbott and Costello and the Desert Inn Orchestra, led by Ray Noble. In attendance were a number of mafiosi, including Black Bill Tocco, Joe Massei, Sam Maceo, Peter Licavoli and Frank Malone in a gala which Barbara Greenspun believed marked the beginning of heavy involvement of the mafia in the development of Las Vegas. Sidney Korshak was one of its early investors.|$|E

25|$|Consumers {{who keep}} their account in good order by always staying within their <b>credit</b> <b>limit,</b> and always making {{at least the}} minimum monthly payment will see {{interest}} as the biggest expense from their card provider. Those who are not so careful and regularly surpass their <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> or are late in making payments are exposed to multiple charges that were typically as high as £25–35 until a ruling from the Office of Fair Trading that they would presume charges over £12 to be unfair which led the majority of card providers to reduce their fees to £12.|$|E
25|$|A {{credit card}} {{register}} is a transaction register used {{to ensure the}} increasing balance owed from using a credit card is enough below the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> to deal with authorization holds and payments not yet received by the bank and to easily look up past transactions for reconciliation and budgeting.|$|E
25|$|A {{secured credit}} card {{is a type}} of credit card secured by a deposit account owned by the {{cardholder}}. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500–1,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required <b>credit</b> <b>limit,</b> and can be as low as 10% of the desired <b>credit</b> <b>limit.</b> This deposit is held in a special savings account. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.|$|E

25|$|Another {{controversial}} area is {{the universal}} default feature of many North American credit card contracts. When a cardholder is late paying a particular credit card issuer, that card's interest rate can be raised, often considerably. With universal default, a customer's other credit cards, for which the customer may be current on payments, may also have their rates and <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> changed. The universal default feature allows creditors to periodically check cardholders' credit portfolios to view trade, allowing these other institutions to decrease the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> or increase rates on cardholders who may be late with another credit card issuer. Being late on one credit card will potentially affect all the cardholder's credit cards. Citibank voluntarily stopped this practice in March 2007 and Chase stopped the practice in November 2007.|$|E
25|$|Getting {{a higher}} <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> {{can help a}} credit score. The higher the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> on the credit card, the lower the {{utilization}} ratio average for all of a borrower's credit card accounts. The utilization ratio is the amount owed divided by the amount extended by the creditor and the lower it is the better a FICO rating, in general. So if a person has one credit card with a used balance of $500 and a limit of $1,000 as well as another with a used balance of $700 and $2,000 limit, the average ratio is 40 percent ($1,200 total used divided by $3,000 total limits). If the first credit card company raises the limit to $2,000, the ratio lowers to 30 percent, which could boost the FICO rating.|$|E
25|$|Authorization: The {{cardholder}} {{presents the}} card as payment to the merchant and the merchant submits the transaction to the acquirer (acquiring bank). The acquirer verifies {{the credit card}} number, the transaction type and the amount with the issuer (card-issuing bank) and reserves that amount of the cardholder's <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> for the merchant. An authorization will generate an approval code, which the merchant stores with the transaction.|$|E

25|$|The President and {{his family}} were opposed to the reforms, with Bambang Trihatmodjo {{beginning}} legal action against the government to keep his bank, particularly as directors of the insolvent banks were, if culpable, to be added to a Disgraced Persons List, ineligible to work in the banking sector. Although the bank had violated its BMPK (<b>credit</b> <b>limit),</b> Bambang was given permission by Bank of Indonesia to buy Bank Alfa, another bank, seen by many as a reward for withdrawing his lawsuit. In effect, the failed bank was reopened under a different name.|$|E
25|$|Many banks {{now also}} offer {{the option of}} {{electronic}} statements, either in lieu of or in addition to physical statements, which can be viewed at any time by the cardholder via the issuer's online banking website. Notification {{of the availability of}} a new statement is generally sent to the cardholder's email address. If the card issuer has chosen to allow it, the cardholder may have other options for payment besides a physical check, such as an electronic transfer of funds from a checking account. Depending on the issuer, the cardholder may also be able to make multiple payments during a single statement period, possibly enabling him or her to utilize the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> on the card several times.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the deposit}} {{is in the}} hands of the credit card issuer as {{security}} in the event of default by the consumer, the deposit will not be debited simply for missing one or two payments. Usually the deposit is only used as an offset when the account is closed, either at the request of the customer or due to severe delinquency (150 to 180 days). This means that an account which is less than 150 days delinquent will continue to accrue interest and fees, and could result in a balance which is much higher than the actual <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> on the card. In these cases the total debt may far exceed the original deposit and the cardholder not only forfeits their deposit but is left with an additional debt.|$|E

25|$|The Credit CARD Act of 2009 {{requires}} that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into overlimit fees, presenting {{this as a}} benefit as it may avoid {{the possibility of a}} future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging overlimit fees. Whether a customer opts into the overlimit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an overlimit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills {{how long it would take}} them to pay off the balance.|$|E
25|$|The {{credit card}} may simply {{serve as a}} form of {{revolving}} credit, or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella <b>credit</b> <b>limit,</b> or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage balance transfers from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. Interest rates can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card or any other credit instrument, or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.|$|E
25|$|Many {{credit cards}} {{can also be}} used in an ATM to {{withdraw}} money against the <b>credit</b> <b>limit</b> extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer cashback on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a cash advance.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{theoretical}} study into how credit constraints interact with aggregate economic activity over the business cycle. We construct {{a model of}} a dynamic economy in which lenders cannot force borrowers to repay their debts unless the debts are secured. In such an economy, durable assets such as land, buildings and machinery play a dual role: they are not only factors of production, but they also serve as collateral for loans. Borrowers' <b>credit</b> <b>limits</b> are affected by the prices of the collateralized assets. And at the same time, these prices are affected {{by the size of the}} <b>credit</b> <b>limits.</b> The dynamic interaction between <b>credit</b> <b>limits</b> and asset prices turns out to be a powerful transmission mechanism by which the effects of shocks persist, amplify, and spill over to other sectors. We show that small, temporary shocks to technology or income distribution can generate large, persistent fluctuations in output and asset prices. ...|$|R
