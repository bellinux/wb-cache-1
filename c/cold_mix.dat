Warm mix asphalt is applied at temperatures of 200–250°F (95–120°C), resulting in reduced energy usage and emissions of volatile organic compounds. <b>Cold</b> <b>mix</b> asphalt is often used on lower-volume rural roads, where hot mix asphalt would cool {{too much on the}} long trip from the asphalt plant to the construction site.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{investigation on}} {{the performances of}} <b>cold</b> asphalt emulsion <b>mixes</b> (CAEMs). The type of emulsion used was a cationic asphalt emulsion. The investigation was carried out at Leeds University, United Kingdom (UK). The objective of the experiments was to evaluate and to improve the performances of <b>cold</b> <b>mixes</b> and compared with hot mixes. For optimising the performances of the <b>cold</b> <b>mixes,</b> a target porosity of five to ten percent and indirect tensile stiffness modulus (ITSM) value of 2000 MPa was selected, suitable for low to medium trafficked roads. A simplified mix design procedure was used for producing the <b>cold</b> <b>mixes.</b> It was found that when properly designed, at full curing conditions, the stiffness (ITSM) of CAEMs {{were found to be}} very comparable to those of hot mixes. Test results also show that the addition of cement in the amount of one to two percent by mass of aggregates significantly improved the mechanical performance of <b>cold</b> asphalt <b>mixes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Carbon fibers {{reinforced}} {{epoxy resins}} {{are used in}} a wide range of applications, such as automotive and aerospace industry. Because of their thermosetting nature, recycling at the end of the life cycle is a difficult issue. However, lack of recyclability poses environmental concerns to the use of these composite materials. In this article, a sustainable, cost-effective technological approach aiming at recycling postconsumer carbon fibers reinforced thermosets (CFRT) is proposed. Composites containing 50 and 70 wt% of CFRT particles were prepared by incorporating the filler fraction into a fluidified postconsumer expanded polystyrene matrix. A <b>cold</b> <b>mixing</b> approach consisting in the use of a low boiling solvent as a binder to guarantee the dispersion homogeneity on micro- and macroscopic level was set up. For comparison, analog composites were also prepared through melt mixing process. Morphological, mechanical, and thermal analyses allowed to prove the effectiveness of the <b>cold</b> <b>mixing</b> approach and to evaluate the influence of particle size on the performance of new recycled composites. Thermogravimetric analysis and thermal conductivity tests of samples highlighted further peculiarities of the <b>cold</b> <b>mixing</b> process. The approach proposed is an effective recycling technology for CFRT and could be extended to other postconsumer materials...|$|R

This study aims {{to investigate the}} early-age strength and long-term performance of the asphalt emulsion <b>cold</b> recycled <b>mixes</b> with various cement contents, {{as well as the}} correlation between the early-strength and long-term performance. To achieve this objective, three research tasks were conducted, including: 1) quantifying the early-age strength of four types of asphalt emulsion <b>cold</b> recycled <b>mixes</b> by measuring their cohesive forces and raveling loss rates through the Hveem cohesion test and raveling test, respectively; 2) characterizing their long-term performance properties, including moisture stability, high-temperature stability, and low-temperature cracking resistance; and 3) developing the correlation models between the early-age strength and long-term performance of asphalt emulsion <b>cold</b> recycled <b>mixes</b> through regression analysis.
