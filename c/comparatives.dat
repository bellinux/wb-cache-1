5|$|Some {{adjectives}} are inflected for {{degree of}} comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, {{the boy is}} smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have <b>comparatives</b> formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy. There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common {{at the expense of}} the inflected form.|$|E
25|$|This {{order is}} {{referred}} to as the accessibility hierarchy. If a language can relativize positions lower in the accessibility hierarchy, it can always relativize positions higher up, but not vice versa. For example, Malagasy can relativize only subject and Chukchi only absolutive arguments, whilst Basque can relativize absolutives, ergatives and indirect objects, but not obliques or genitives or objects of <b>comparatives.</b> Similar hierarchies have been proposed in other circumstances, e.g. for pronominal reflexes.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, the {{influence}} of Francis Bacon was profound. Bacon, and indeed Hobbes, held the conviction that mathematics and the senses must {{be the basis of}} all rational sciences. This passion for accuracy led Petty to famously declare that his form of science would only use measurable phenomena and would seek quantitative precision, rather than rely on <b>comparatives</b> or superlatives, yielding a new subject that he named political arithmetic. Petty thus carved a niche for himself as the first dedicated economic scientist, amidst the merchant-pamphleteers, such as Thomas Mun or Josiah Child, and philosopher-scientists occasionally discussing economics, such as John Locke.|$|E

25|$|On tests between November 1971 and May 1972 Curtiss {{determined}} that Genie viewed non-specific adjectives describing size, such {{as little as}} absolute rather than relative values without superlative or comparative markers. Between January and May 1972 her comprehension of noun-modifier sentences significantly increased and starting in May 1972, after Curtiss replaced the word little with tiny, Genie showed clear comprehension of them. Genie clearly understood both the word more and the suffix -er as <b>comparatives</b> by January 1972, but never used them in her own speech. Prior to 1972 Genie responded to the conjunctions and and or as if they both meant and, but even after recognizing {{there was a difference}} never fully grasped the meaning of or. On tests she showed perfect comprehension of and while correctly responding to the word or fewer than 10% of the time, but she always understood disjunction marked by the word or in everyday conversation. She never attempted to use any other conjunctions, and with one possible highly ungrammatical exception never tried to connect two sentences.|$|E

2500|$|The Danish {{adjectives}} and adverbs are inflected {{according to}} the three degrees of comparison. The comparative has the ending -ere (sometimes -re) and the superlative has the ending -st (sometimes -est): e.g. hurtig, hurtigere, hurtigst, [...] "quick, -er, -est"; fræk, frækkere, frækkest, [...] "impertinent/audacious/kinky, -er, -est"; lang, længere, længst (with umlaut), [...] "long, -er, -est".

2500|$|Adjectives {{function}} as a subclass of intransitive verbs, though grammatical functions set them apart. For example, the superlative -ie is reserved for adjectives, as in lingan, [...] "beautiful," [...] and lingahnie, [...] "most beautiful." [...] Likewise reserved for adjectives is the suffix -ki, which indicates instrumentality in transitive verbs, means [...] "to consider [...] " [...] when suffixed to an adjective. Superlatives may also appear using the ordinal numeral keieu [...] "first." [...] <b>Comparatives</b> are made through word order and the suffix -sang: Pwihke laudsang pwihko means [...] "This pig is bigger than that pig." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{strength}} of the Viking influence on Old English appears {{from the fact that}} the indispensable elements of the language - pronouns, modals, <b>comparatives,</b> pronominal adverbs (like [...] "hence" [...] and [...] "together"), conjunctions and prepositions - show the most marked Danish influence; the best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in the extensive word borrowings for, as Jespersen indicates, no texts exist in either Scandinavia or in Northern England from this time to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax. The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character. Like close cousins, Old Norse and Old English resembled each other, and with some words in common, they roughly understood each other; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged. It is most [...] "important to recognise that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost." [...] This blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in [...] "simplifying English grammar." ...|$|E
