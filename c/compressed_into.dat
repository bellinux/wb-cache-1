5|$|Bandai Visual {{released}} the episodes in nine volumes in DVD, Blu-ray, and Universal Media Disc media format. The nine volumes were <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> two volumes and released as DVD Magazines. The Black Rebellion {{is a special}} edition which concentrates the series into one disc. Eventually, the nine volumes were released as a box collection in DVD and Blu-ray format.|$|E
5|$|The ten {{distinct}} {{chapters on}} which the team started work were gradually <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> three principal movements: the violent transition from 'Green and Pleasant Land' to the 'Pandemonium' of industrial revolution, a salute to the NHS and children's literature, and a celebration of pop culture, technology and the digital revolution.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} caused them to commit murder; real life events are <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> the game's {{timeframe}} for narrative purposes. Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E

5|$|Disney {{initially}} envisioned Toy Story 2 as a direct-to-video sequel. The film began {{production in}} a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, {{as most of the}} main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> nine months.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} break through to Berlin, Wenck's XII Army made a {{fighting}} retreat back towards the Elbe and American lines after providing the IX Army survivors with surplus transport. By 6 May many German Army units and individuals had crossed the Elbe and surrendered to the US Ninth Army. Meanwhile, the XII Army's bridgehead, with its headquarters in the park of Schönhausen, came under heavy Soviet artillery bombardment and was <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> an area eight by two kilometres (five by one and a quarter miles).|$|E
5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{partially}} cast with stock actors that Corman had used in previous films. Writer Charles B. Griffith portrays several small roles. Griffith's father {{appears as a}} dental patient, and his grandmother, Myrtle Vail, appears as Seymour's hypochondriac mother. Dick Miller, who had starred as the protagonist of A Bucket of Blood was offered the role of Seymour, but turned it down, instead taking the smaller role of Burson Fouch. Production at the Bucket of Blood sets was <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> three days of cast rehearsals, immediately followed by two days and one night of principal photography.|$|E
5|$|Using global geometry, some spacetimes can {{be shown}} to contain {{boundaries}} called horizons, which demarcate one region {{from the rest of}} spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's horizon, is not a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{addresses}} hominization from {{an ironic}} point of view. Mankind's evolution from the ape-like Australopithecus afarenses to modern society with history, technology and cultural expression is <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> only seven days. The strong allusion to faith is contrasted by numerous references to scientific insights. With {{the evolution of}} mankind starting in Central Africa, Lucy is the name given to the first skeleton of an Australopitecus afarensis found. The characters mention that Homo erectus would be the hominid species to tame fire. Orrorin and Toumaï represent two of the oldest-known hominin ancestors, while Aegyptopithecus zeuxis {{is one of the}} earliest primates. Through scientific references and a distinct ironic tone, Ingrid Reichel makes it clear in her review that the book cannot be taken in by any religion or fundamentalism.|$|E

5|$|The {{recovered}} beef {{material is}} extruded through long tubes that are thinner than a pencil, {{during which time}} at the Beef Products, Inc. (BPI) processing plant, the meat is exposed to gaseous ammonia. At Cargill Meat Solutions, citric acid is used to kill bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Gaseous ammonia {{in contact with the}} water in the meat produces ammonium hydroxide. The ammonia sharply increases the pH and damages microscopic organisms, the freezing causes ice crystals to form and puncture the organisms' weakened cell walls, and the mechanical stress destroys the organisms altogether. The product is finely ground, <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> pellets or blocks, flash frozen and then shipped for use as an additive.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5|$|Operating an {{air-breathing}} {{jet engine}} at velocities {{of up to}} Mach5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines proposed by other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims {{to be a good}} jet engine within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket engine outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach5.5 has been that the air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues has typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit.|$|E

5|$|The Quantock Hills {{are largely}} formed by rocks of the Devonian Period, which consist of sediments {{originally}} laid down under a shallow sea and slowly <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> solid rock. In the higher north western areas older Early Devonian rocks, known as Hangman Grits, predominate, {{and can be}} seen in the exposed rock at West Quantoxhead quarry, which were worked for road building. Further south there are newer Middle and Late Devonian rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include sandstone and limestone, which have been quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, there is a limestone cave, which is the only one in the Devonian limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger rocks of the Triassic period, these are known as New Red Sandstone rocks which represent the deposits of large river systems that crossed a desert plain, and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was worked on the foreshore at Watchet. The scarp is to the west with a dip slope to the east. The west side is cut by combes with broad valleys on the east. The hill tops are open heathland with woods on the slopes.|$|E
5|$|The film clips are a motif used {{to enhance}} {{the theme of the}} desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are {{released}} over the internet and gain a cult following, {{in the same way that}} the lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a single frame is like the world <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{music in}} Final Fantasy Tactics Advance was {{primarily}} composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with additional music contributed by Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso; Nobuo Uematsu provided the main theme. The Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Original Soundtrack album {{was released by}} DigiCube on February 19, 2003. It spans 74 tracks and has a duration of 2:05:27. The first disk includes every song from the game, as it sounds through the Game Boy Advance hardware. The second disk contains fully orchestrated versions of 32 of the same 42 tracks. A new age arrangement album entitled White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, a selection of musical tracks from the game arranged by Yo Yamazaki, Akira Sasaki, and Satoshi Henmi, was released by SME Visual Works on February 26, 2003. White spans 11 tracks and has a duration of 46:10. Within the game, the classical-themed soundtrack is <b>compressed</b> <b>into</b> MIDI file format. Simple sound effects are used during battles, {{and there are no}} voices or speech within the game.|$|E
