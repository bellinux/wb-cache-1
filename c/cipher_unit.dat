50|$|Owners {{included}} the Batcheler family (18th century), the Suffields, who rebuilt the house, and latterly the Birkbecks. Sir Edward Birkbeck entertained Prime Minister Lord Salisbury there in 1887. During World War II {{the house was}} requisitioned by the War Office and used by a <b>cipher</b> <b>unit,</b> who put up numerous huts in the grounds, some of which survive. The hall's Italianate watertower, which stood among outbuildings, now derelict, is visible from the roads around the park. A chapel also survives, equally derelict.|$|E
5000|$|Hans Oschmann (* 24 December 1894, Schöneberg, † 14th November 1944, at Faimbe) was German Army general ( [...] Generalleutnant) and signals officer, who was {{involved}} in the early command of the German signal intelligence organization (Reichswehrministerium Chiffrierabteilung) (German Defense Ministry) and would later become director of the <b>cipher</b> <b>unit</b> at the Reichswehrministerium Chiffrierabteilung, later the (General der Nachrichtenaufklärung) between 1932 and 1934. He was the son of general (Generalmajor) Albert Oschmann, who was considered an expert of motor transportation and field transportation within the operational theater.|$|E
50|$|Cowen {{was born}} in Melbourne in 1919 to a Jewish family named Cohen. The name was {{formally}} changed to Cowen {{when he was a}} young boy. He was educated at St Kilda Park State School, Scotch College and the University of Melbourne. He served in the Royal Australian Navy during the Second World War, and was in Darwin during the bombing raid of 1942, before being transferred to Brisbane to work in the <b>cipher</b> <b>unit</b> of General MacArthur's office. He married Anna Wittner in 1945. Cowen then went as a Rhodes Scholar to New College, Oxford, where he completed a Bachelor of Civil Law degree and jointly won the Vinerian Scholarship. From 1947 to 1950 he was a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and was also a consultant on legal matters to the British Military Government in Allied-occupied Germany.|$|E
50|$|Substitution ciphers can be {{compared}} with transposition ciphers. In a transposition <b>cipher,</b> the <b>units</b> of the plaintext are rearranged in a different and usually quite complex order, but the units themselves are left unchanged. By contrast, in a substitution <b>cipher,</b> the <b>units</b> of the plaintext are retained in the same sequence in the ciphertext, but the units themselves are altered.|$|R
50|$|Both the OKW/Chi and B-Dienst {{believed}} that the Finish cipher bureau, which was formed in 1924, did good work Wilhelm Fenner of the OKW/Chi visited the Finnish <b>cipher</b> bureau <b>unit</b> on a fact finding visit in 1927. B-Diesnt had substantial links with the Finns, and started training them in 1935. The Finns has purchased a Soviet Union Code from the Japanese which {{was used in the}} Baltic to read Russian Naval traffic in 1937. B-Diesnt also became involved with the Latvians and later Estonians who passed raw Russian intercepts to B-Diesnt, in near real time using a special code, disguised to read as domestic traffic.|$|R
50|$|With the Lohmann Affair {{bringing}} intelligence activities {{into the}} public, the Abwehr undertook {{an effort to}} combine Army and Navy under its control. Naval D/F sets would gather signals intelligence for the Ministry of the Reichswehr cipher bureau (German:Reichswehrministerium Chiffrierstelle) making the B Control Centre (German:B-Leitstelle) cipher centre redundant and removing an intelligence asset from the Navy. This was met with resistance and ultimately failed but resulted in the increased size of the Abwehr. In the Autumn, the Abwehr tried again, {{after a period of}} tension between Poland and Lithuania. Wanting access to the Neumünster intercept station and a naval station in southern Germany, it was ultimately rebuffed, but an offer to ensure increased links between <b>cipher</b> bureau <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|Born in Bucharest into an upper-class family, {{his father}} Ion, a {{university}} professor, was {{a follower of}} Titu Maiorescu, while his mother Elena headed the Central School for Girls prior to 1939. His brother was also a distinguished diplomat, while his sister Anina (1902-1994) {{was active in the}} Romanian émigré community in Paris during the communist era. He obtained university degrees in Law, Philosophy and Sociology before entering the Foreign Ministry in 1934 in spite of advanced paralysis in his lower body. He was assigned to the press and information office. During World War II, while a ministry employee, he took part alongside Camil Demetrescu and Grigore Niculescu-Buzești in organizing secret negotiations with the Allies. Their objective was the exit of Axis Romania from the war, alongside a conspiracy against dictator Ion Antonescu that culminated in the King Michael Coup of August 1944. Moreover, as director of the ministerial cabinet and <b>cipher</b> <b>unit,</b> he played an important role both during the war and its aftermath in keeping the country's decision-makers informed. He also passed along information to Western embassies in Bucharest, alerting them to the impending danger of a communist takeover, and sent documents abroad that demonstrated the economic domination and despoilment being practiced by the country's Soviet occupiers. He was dismissed from the ministry in 1946.|$|E

The encryption function which provides the basic con dentiality security service is studied from two cryptographic design perspectives based on the ability ofanetwork <b>cipher</b> <b>unit</b> to dynamically re-parameterize itself while processing a high speed data stream. The designs studied in this paper were chosen based on their suitability for high speed network operation and their exibility in satisfying dynamic security requirements. We develop analytical techniques to model the performance of each scheme...|$|E

While grateful that her typing prowess kept her in work, she was irritated by employers who ignored her other skills. For example, she regularly completed difficult crosswords like Ximenes and Azed, but when she applied to join the Bletchley Park team working on the German Enigma <b>cipher,</b> her military <b>unit</b> would not release her.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the National Security Agency {{can be traced back}} to April 28, 1917, three weeks after the U.S. Congress {{declared}} war on Germany in World War I. A code and <b>cipher</b> decryption <b>unit</b> was established as the Cable and Telegraph Section which was also known as the Cipher Bureau. It was headquartered in Washington, D.C. and was part of the war effort under the executive branch without direct Congressional authorization. During the course of the war it was relocated in the army's organizational chart several times. On July 5, 1917, Herbert O. Yardley was assigned to head the unit. At that point, the unit consisted of Yardley and two civilian clerks. It absorbed the navy's cryptoanalysis functions in July 1918. World War I ended on November 11, 1918, and the army cryptographic section of Military Intelligence (MI-8) moved to New York City on May 20, 1919, where it continued intelligence activities as the Code Compilation Company under the direction of Yardley.|$|R
2500|$|At Calais (26–7 February), {{after the}} railway experts {{had been sent}} away, at Lloyd George's request Nivelle {{produced}} rules governing {{the relations between the}} British and French armies, to be binding also on their successors. Nivelle was to exercise, through British staff at GQG, operational command (including control of logistics and food) of British forces, with Haig left in control only of discipline (which could not legally be placed in foreign hands) and forbidden to make direct contact with London. Haig “had become a <b>cipher,</b> and (his) <b>units</b> were to be dispersed at the will of the French command, like the Senegalese Regiments, like the Moroccans, like the Foreign Legion, until (his) massed thousands had become mere khaki pawns scattered amongst the sky-blue pawns” ...|$|R
50|$|A block <b>cipher</b> {{works on}} <b>units</b> of a fixed size (known as a block size), but {{messages}} {{come in a}} variety of lengths. So some modes (namely ECB and CBC) require that the final block be padded before encryption. Several padding schemes exist. The simplest is to add null bytes to the plaintext to bring its length up to a multiple of the block size, but care must be taken that the original length of the plaintext can be recovered; this is trivial, for example, if the plaintext is a C style string which contains no null bytes except at the end. Slightly more complex is the original DES method, which is to add a single one bit, followed by enough zero bits to fill out the block; if the message ends on a block boundary, a whole padding block will be added. Most sophisticated are CBC-specific schemes such as ciphertext stealing or residual block termination, which do not cause any extra ciphertext, at the expense of some additional complexity. Schneier and Ferguson suggest two possibilities, both simple: append a byte with value 128 (hex 80), followed by as many zero bytes as needed to fill the last block, or pad the last block with n bytes all with value n.|$|R
