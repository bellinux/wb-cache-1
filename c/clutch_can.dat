5|$|Their lofty {{locations}} makes {{monitoring of}} Australian raven nests difficult. A <b>clutch</b> <b>can</b> comprise {{up to six}} eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with five being the most common number. Measuring , eggs are pale green or bluish-green and splotched with darker olive, brown and blackish markings. Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified. Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female over roughly 20days. Incubation is intermittent initially, becoming constant {{by the time the}} third or fourth egg is laid. Only one brood is raised per year, though a second clutch may be laid if the first clutch is lost early in the season. Late clutches have poor survival rates, possibly due to chicks getting dehydrated on hot days as the year progresses or being eaten by wedge-tailed eagles. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. They have pink skin until 5days of age, when feathers under the skin turn it grey. They lose their egg tooth at the same time. Their eyes begin opening at 5 to 6 days of age and are fully open by 11 to 12 days, by which time their feathers begin emerging. At 14 days, their primary feathers begin emerging, and they are fully feathered by 35–36 days old. They leave the nest at 40–45days of age, and stay with the parents for three to four months after that. They follow their parents and beg for food for the first month outside the nest but are feeding themselves by the third month. Young birds are often attacked when they enter neighbouring territories, and melees ensue as their parents try to defend them and herd them back.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue jay}} mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as acorns, soft fruits, arthropods, and {{occasionally}} small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, though it sometimes hawks insects from the air. Like squirrels, blue jays {{are known to}} hide nuts for later consumption. It builds an open cup nest in {{the branches of a}} tree, which both sexes participate in constructing. The <b>clutch</b> <b>can</b> contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.|$|E

50|$|Introduction - Multiple disk {{clutches}} {{are used}} to deliver extremely high torque in a relatively small space. These <b>clutches</b> <b>can</b> be used dry or wet (oil bath). Running the clutches in an oil bath also greatly increases the heat dissipation capability, which makes them ideally suited for multiple speed gear boxes and machine tool applications.|$|R
5000|$|The {{synchronizer}} has {{to overcome}} {{the momentum of the}} entire input shaft and clutch disk when it is changing shaft rpm to match the new gear ratio. It can be abused by exposure to the momentum and power of the engine, which is what happens when attempts are made to select a gear without fully disengaging the clutch. This causes extra wear on the rings and sleeves, reducing their service life. When an experimenting driver tries to [...] "match the revs" [...] on a synchronized transmission and force it into gear without using the clutch, the synchronizer will make up for any discrepancy in RPM. The success in engaging the gear without <b>clutching</b> <b>can</b> deceive the driver into thinking that the RPM of the layshaft and transmission were actually exactly matched. Nevertheless, approximate rev. matching with <b>clutching</b> <b>can</b> decrease the difference in rotational speed between the layshaft and transmission gear shaft, therefore decreasing synchro wear.|$|R
50|$|Once the car {{reaches a}} {{suitable}} speed, the <b>clutch</b> <b>can</b> be fully engaged and speed {{can then be}} controlled either by varying the engine speed or by partially disengaging the clutch again if necessary.|$|E

Elastic rate control eliminates <b>clutching</b> completely, but <b>can</b> make precise selection difficult. We show that hybrid position rate control can outperform position control by 20 % when there is significant clutching, even when using pointer acceleration. Unlike previous work, our RubberEdge technique eliminates trajectory and velocity discontinuities. We derive predictive models for position control with clutching and hybrid control, and present a prototype RubberEdge position-rate control device including initial user feedback...|$|R
50|$|Clutch delay valves {{operate as}} one-way {{restrictor}} valves that limit {{the volume of}} fluid that can move through the lines in a given time. This ensures a steady quick and firm engagement without being too fast for the drive train to handle since <b>clutches</b> <b>can</b> quickly disengage but re-engagement is damped. The clutch delay valve slows clutch engagement and was intended to reduce drivetrain shock {{in the event that}} an inexperienced driver quickly engaged the clutch at higher revs.|$|R
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in small agglomerations {{attached}} to submerged twigs or other natural support at the pond's edge. <b>Clutches</b> <b>can</b> contain between 5 and 60 eggs, averaging about 30. The {{age at which}} they first breed, and {{the frequency with which}} they breed, are unknown; females are estimated to first breed at 22 months, and males at 34 months. Eggs develop rapidly, and may hatch within 15 days. Larvae stay in the pond from two to four months, during which time they grow to between 3 and 8 times their hatching size.|$|R

50|$|In summer, 2 to 8 {{eggs are}} {{typically}} laid, hatching anywhere from July to November. However, more than 1 <b>clutch</b> <b>can</b> be laid during a season. Eggs are laid, presumably, in friable, sandy soil. Being a prey species for many animals, including birds, other lizards, and mammals, {{they have a}} fairly high reproductive rate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clutches</b> <b>can</b> be laid {{in quick}} {{succession}} with each clutch containing 1 to 3 tough, leathery eggs, although a clutch size of 2 eggs {{is by far the}} most common. Nesting can be communal and up to 20 eggs have been found in a nest. Another characteristic that has been discovered is the ability of females of this species to either store sperm for reproduction at a later time or to reproduce through parthenogenesis which does not require mating to be successful. Hatchlings are approximately 13 centimetres long.|$|R
50|$|Introduction - Of all the {{electromagnetic}} clutches, the tooth clutches provide {{the greatest amount}} of torque in the smallest overall size. Because torque is transmitted without any slippage, clutches are ideal for multi stage machines where timing is critical such as multi-stage printing presses. Sometimes, exact timing needs to be kept, so tooth <b>clutches</b> <b>can</b> be made with a single position option which means that they will only engage at a specific degree mark. They can be used in dry or wet (oil bath) applications, so they are very well suited for gear box type drives.|$|R

50|$|A <b>clutch</b> <b>can</b> {{comprise}} {{up to six}} eggs, though usually four or {{five are}} laid, with four being the commonest number. Eggs are quite variable and cannot be reliably identified as to which Australian corvid laid them, however the colouration of the two crow species eggs is different to the three ravens. Ravens' eggs are a light turquoise with brown blotches, but crows' eggs are a dirty white with brown speckles.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} found alone, in pairs or small family groups. Males sing {{continuously}} at daybreak in the breeding season, which is normally between {{the months of}} July and August. Breeding occurs on the ground, with cup-shaped nests being built in depressions and lined with strips of bark, fine grass or sticks. The nest is usually located amongst rocky areas, against fallen branches or under low bushes or sparse tufts of grass. The <b>clutch</b> <b>can</b> contain two or three eggs.|$|E

2500|$|A female Glanville {{fritillary}} {{will lay}} {{as many as}} 10 clutches of eggs in her lifetime. These <b>clutches</b> <b>can</b> {{range in size from}} 50 up to 300 eggs and are laid {{on the underside of the}} larval food plant of either Plantago lanceolata (ribwort plantain) or Veronica spicata (spiked speedwell).. After hatching, the caterpillars feed on their host plants until the end of the summer where they spin a [...] "winter nest" [...] to diapause. When winter is over they emerge from their nest to feed again before pupating around the beginning of May. A month later, the adult fritillaries emerge and go about their adult lives of feeding, mating, and laying eggs.|$|R
5000|$|This type of clutch is {{designed}} to partially disengage or [...] "slip" [...] when the rear wheel tries to drive the engine faster than it would run under its own power. The engine braking forces in conventional clutches will normally be transmitted back along the drive chain causing the rear wheel to hop, chatter or lose traction. This is especially noted on larger displacement four-stroke engines, which have greater engine braking than their two-stroke or smaller displacement counterparts. Slipper clutches eliminate this extra loading on the rear suspension giving riders a more predictable ride and {{minimize the risk of}} over-revving the engine during downshifts. Slipper <b>clutches</b> <b>can</b> also prevent a catastrophic rear wheel lockup in case of engine seizure. Generally, the amount of force needed to disengage the clutch is adjustable to suit the application.|$|R
50|$|A {{wet clutch}} is {{immersed}} in a cooling lubricating fluid that also keeps surfaces clean and provides smoother performance and longer life. Wet clutches, however, tend to lose some energy to the liquid. Since the surfaces of a wet <b>clutch</b> <b>can</b> be slippery (as with a motorcycle clutch bathed in engine oil), stacking multiple clutch discs can compensate for the lower coefficient of friction and so eliminate slippage under power when fully engaged.The Hele-Shaw clutch was a wet clutch that relied entirely on viscous effects, rather than on friction.|$|E
50|$|A {{fan clutch}} is as {{reliable}} {{as any other}} component on a vehicle, yet sometimes they fail. A common symptom of fan clutch failure is overheating at idle or in heavy traffic. Bad fan clutches can also cause poor performance of the car's air conditioning system because the fan also cools the air conditioner's condenser, which is {{directly in front of}} the radiator. A fan <b>clutch</b> <b>can</b> also fail in a stuck on position where engine power is lost even when the fan is not necessary. This type of failure can also decrease fuel economy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second factor}} in {{figuring}} out response {{time of a}} coupling is actually {{much more important than}} the magnet wire or the air gap. It involves calculating the amount of inertia that the coupling needs to accelerate. This is referred to as [...] "time to speed". In reality, this is what the end-user is most concerned with. Once it is known how much inertia is present for the clutch to start or for the brake to stop, then the torque can be calculated and the appropriate size of <b>clutch</b> <b>can</b> be chosen.|$|E

40|$|Wet {{clutches}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} different machinery. Wet clutches and brakes are frequently used to distribute torque in vehicle drive-trains. The <b>clutches</b> <b>can</b> be located in e. g. automatic transmissions or limited slip differentials. Their frictional behavior is of great importance for the overall vehicle behavior and has to be thoroughly investigated when designing new wet clutch applications. Frictional behavior is normally investigated in test rigs where complete friction discs are tested under similar working conditions as for the clutches in the drive-train. However, it is today possible to simulate the clutch behavior and not limited ourselves to only use testings as a help {{in the design of the}} wet clutches. This is an advantage because it is possible to simulate behavior that is not possible to measure in test rigs. Another advantage is the faster and more cost efficient design process than when all tests are carried out in a laboratory. The torque transferred by the <b>clutch</b> during engagement <b>can</b> be roughly divided into full film torque and boundary lubrication torque. Full film torque originates from the part of the engagement where the friction discs are completely separated by a lubricant film and the friction surfaces are not in contact, whereas boundary lubrication torque occurs when the lubricant film is so thin that the surfaces of the friction discs are in direct contact. The distribution between these two types of torque is different for different types of wet clutches and engagements. When the clutch works in full film regime, it is possible to simulate the friction quite well, whereas the friction in the boundary regime is much more difficult to model and simulate, since it is very additive dependent. The most common use of wet clutches is in automatic transmissions for vehicles. Hence, most research in wet clutch testing and simulations are performed on wet clutches suitable for these applications. Here, the wet clutch is often used to brake a rotating shaft to standstill and the total engagement will have a duration of fractions of a second. During most of the engagement the clutch will be working in full film lubrication. In this investigation, the focus is on wet clutches working under limited slip conditions, i. e. the clutches will have a limited slip during a long duration without any lock-up. During this kind of engagement the clutch will work mainly in boundary lubrication and generate much heat. Such <b>clutches</b> <b>can</b> be found in, e. g. limited slip differentials. The optimum when designing a new wet clutch would be to simulate the clutch during the whole engagement without having to do any measurements in the laboratory. This, however, is not yet possible but an efficient way to design <b>clutches</b> <b>can</b> be obtained by combining fast friction measurements with efficient computer simulations. In this work, a simple friction measurement technique for wet clutches working in boundary lubrication is developed, based on pin on disc measurements. These friction measurements are combined with a temperature simulation of a wet clutch, where the lubricant cooling flow, dependent of the surface groove pattern, is simulated. This method makes it possible to allow a wet clutch working in boundary lubrication to be optimized for given working conditions regarding lubricant, friction material and surface groove pattern. The simulations are validated by measured data from a test rig in which whole friction discs are investigated with the same working conditions. Godkänd; 2006; 20061204 (parmar...|$|R
50|$|Clutch size differs greatly between species, {{sometimes}} {{even within the}} same genus. It may also differ within the same species due to many factors including habitat, health, nutrition, predation pressures, and time of year. <b>Clutch</b> size variation <b>can</b> also reflect variation in optimal reproduction effort. In birds, <b>clutch</b> size <b>can</b> vary within a species due to various features (age and health of laying female, ability of male to supply food, and abundance of prey), while some species are determinant layers, laying a species-specific number of eggs. Long-lived species tend to have smaller clutch sizes than short-lived species (see also r/K selection theory). The evolution of optimal clutch size is also driven by other factors, such as parent-offspring conflict.|$|R

Compared to other parrot species they are {{relatively}} easy to breed and the costs for equipment are also quite low. A <b>clutch</b> <b>can</b> consist of four to seven eggs, each approximately the size of one's thumbnail. Eggs are laid once every two days and incubated for 18-22 days. Hatchlings fledge when between 4 and 5 weeks old and wean between 8 and 10 weeks old. Babies may often be gently handled while in the nest or removed for hand-feeding at 2 or 3 weeks old to help them become more tame and trusting. Puberty (adolescence) is reached around 9 months of age while adulthood is reached around 21 months in males and 15-18 months in females.|$|E
