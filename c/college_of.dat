5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Engineering, the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Computing, the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Sciences, and the Ivan Allen <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style. The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and the proposed changes passed with very slim margins. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E
