The relative abundance of the hepta-carboxylic and uroporphyrins in a sample also differentiated porphyria cutanea tarda from acute intermittent or congenital porphyria.

40|$|The fluorometric {{procedure}} of determining <b>coproporphyrin</b> has been adapted to determine <b>coproporphyrin</b> on random urine specimens. This adaptation depends on determining both <b>coproporphyrin</b> and creatinine. A mathematical relationship is {{established for the}} amount of <b>coproporphyrin</b> excreted when 1200 mg. of creatinine is excreted. An important advantage of the random procedure is the elimination of the waiting period of 24 hr. for the urine collection. This is particularly important in porphyric urines since much of the porphyrin is reduced to forms that are sensitive to light, with the result that pathologic levels of <b>coproporphyrin</b> may thus be overlooked. THIS PAPER presents a procedure for determining <b>coproporphyrin</b> on casual urine specimens.

40|$|Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a {{pesticide}} {{that was}} once widely used for wood preservation. Commercial PCP contained impurities including higher chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs). We investigated the effects of occupational exposure to PCP and its CDD and CDF contaminants on the skin, liver, porphyrin metabolism, and central and peripheral nervous systems. In 1986 we conducted a medical survey of 366 workers who had been engaged {{in the production of}} PCP at a single plant between 1938 and 1978. The referent group consisted of 303 workers from the same plant who were not exposed to these or related compounds. Exposure was determined from computerized personnel records. The medical survey included an administered questionnaire, medical record review, physical examination by dermatologists, internists, and neurologists, and analysis of 24 -hr urine for quantitative porphyrins among other tests. In this paper we present the results of analyses of the general health, chloracne, and porphyrin metabolism end points. The general health status of PCP workers was similar to unexposed workers, but 17. 8 % of PCP workers had evidence of current or past chloracne. PCP workers with chloracne had significantly higher mean urinary excretion of <b>coproporphyrins</b> (117. 0 vs. 90. 6 microg/ 24 hr) than unexposed workers after controlling for potential confounders.

40|$|Background: Measurement of fecal porphyrins is {{important}} in the diagnosis of porphyria, but conventional methods to measure them have drawbacks. We explored the use of derivative matrix isopotential synchronous fluorescence (MISF) spectrometry for the measurement of <b>coproporphyrin</b> and protoporphyrin. Methods: The MISF scanning route was selected based on information from the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum, which was a combination of the contour line of protoporphyrin via a detection point of <b>coproporphyrin</b> and that of <b>coproporphyrin</b> via a detection point of protoporphyrin. Derivative technique eliminated the constant interfering signals. MISF was used to measure porphyrins in stools from 2 pregnant women and 20 healthy volunteers. Results: The <b>coproporphyrin</b> and protoporphyrin spectra were resolved with almost no mutual interference. The amplitudes of the derivative peaks were linearly related to the concentrations of <b>coproporphyrin</b> up to 310 nmol/L and protoporphyrin up to 590 nmol/L. The detection limits for <b>coproporphyrin</b> and protoporphyrin were 1. 2 and 1. 7 nmol/L, respectively. The within-run imprecision (CV; n = 6) was 2. 2 % at 175 nmol/L for <b>coproporphyrin</b> and 2. 3 % at 500 nmol/L for protoporphyrin. Bland-Altman analysis indicated {{no significant differences between the}} proposed MISF method and conventional spectrophotometry or fluorimetry. Mean (SD) recoveries of porphyrins added to fecal samples were of 98 (7) % for <b>coproporphyrin</b> and 102 (4) % for protoporphyrin. Conclusions: This technique provides spectral resolution of <b>coproporphyrin</b> and protoporphyrin, obviating the need for chromatographic separation, and measurements can be made in a single scanning. The method also appears suitable for routine testing of large numbers of samples. (C) 2004 American Association for Clinical Chemistry...|$|E

Binding affinities are paralleled by the tendencies of the porphyrins to aggregate, increasing in the order: uroporphyrins I and III less than <b>coproporphyrins</b> I and III approximately haematoporphyrin less than protoporphyrin IX.
