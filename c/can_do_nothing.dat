5|$|One {{bereaved}} parent, Billy Ansel, distrusts Stephens {{and pressures}} Sam {{to drop the}} case; Nicole overhears their argument. In the pretrial deposition, Nicole unexpectedly accuses the bus driver Dolores of speeding, halting the lawsuit given Dolores' lack of deep pockets. Stephens and Nicole's father know she is lying but <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing.</b> Two years later, Stephens sees Driscoll working as a bus driver in a city.|$|E
5|$|Christine {{admits she}} {{is afraid of}} the Phantom and tells Raoul he will never stop trying to {{recapture}} her. Raoul realizes {{that they can use}} the Phantom's opera to capture him, as he will surely attend. Don Juan Triumphant is performed, and the Phantom makes his entrance (having secretly replaced the lead) with Christine. Raoul <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> but watch from his box as Christine falls for the Phantom yet again. However, she once again removes his mask, revealing his deformities to the entire audience, who scream in fear. He escapes with her by dropping the chandelier and setting the opera house on fire.|$|E
5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> against the State experts.|$|E

As the Club {{runs out of}} funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists {{that she would have}} to be fired.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{returning}} west, Alric leads The Legion north, {{moving towards}} Balor's fortress in Rhi'anon, {{capital city of}} the Trow, an ancient race of giants thought extinct until they joined {{the war against the}} Light. Believing they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to save any of the remaining free cities from The Deceiver, Alric hopes to achieve a more important victory; during his captivity in The Barrier, he learned that to ensure the obedience of the Fallen Lords, Balor bound them to his will, and is channeling his power to them. Thus, if he were destroyed, they would lose their power, ending the war. Leaving a garrison of men behind to delay the pursuing Soulblighter, Alric plans to attack The Watcher using arrows tipped with bone from his arm. The plan works; The Watcher is killed, scattering his army and clearing the way ahead, whilst Soulblighter breaks off his pursuit.|$|E

In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history that we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for help by a physician, Dr Charles Oldfield, who has a {{practice}} in Market Loughborough, a small village in Berkshire. His wife died {{just over a year}} ago and the malicious talk in the village is that he poisoned her. People are avoiding him and several poison pen letters have been sent to him but he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to stem this tide of ill-intentioned gossip – like the heads of the Lernaean Hydra, when one source of the gossip is cut off, another grows in its place. So, his ultimate aim was to cut the main source of the gossip, just like the hydra had been slain by cutting its vulnerable head. Mrs Oldfield was a difficult invalid whose death was put down to a gastric ulcer, whose symptoms are similar to that of arsenic poisoning. She left her husband a not-inconsiderable sum of money and, under pressure, Oldfield admits {{that a lot of the}} talk revolves around Jean Moncrieffe, his young dispenser, who he wants to marry but dare not because of the talk. Poirot travels to Market Loughborough and meets Jean. She is frank about her relationship with Oldfield and her dislike of his wife but opposes Poirot's idea of an exhumation and autopsy on the body. Poirot makes the rounds of the village, insinuating that he is connected with the Home Office and thereby generating much hypocritical murmurs of sympathy for the doctor and, more importantly, names of who said what and when. From this he learns of the present whereabouts of two servants of the Oldfields who left their employ after Mrs Oldfield died; Nurse Harrison, who tended to the patient, and Beatrice, the family maid. Nurse Harrison tells a story of overhearing Jean and the Doctor talking about the imminent death of his wife in which it was clear that this was an event that both of them were impatiently waiting for. The nurse is certain that Beatrice must have overheard the talk as well. Poirot tells her of the supposed plans of exhumation and the nurse considers this news and then tells him she agrees that such a thing should be done. While being interviewed, Beatrice slyly denies overhearing any conversation but tells him of several suspicious stories of Jean making medicines or pots of tea for Mrs Oldfield which the nurse poured away or changed before the patient could take them.|$|E
