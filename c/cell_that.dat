5|$|A {{more recent}} proposal, the exomembrane hypothesis, {{suggests}} that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.|$|E
5|$|Cellular {{automaton}} {{models of}} this system divide the square lattice into two alternating subsets, and perform updates {{on one of the}} two subsets at a time. In each update, every <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> can flip does so. This defines a reversible cellular automaton which can be used to investigate the Ising model.|$|E
50|$|Cytonemes are thin, {{cellular}} projections {{that are}} specialized for exchange of signaling proteins between cells. Cytonemes emanate from <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> make signaling proteins, extending directly to <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> receive signaling proteins. Cytonemes also extend directly from <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> receive signaling proteins to <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> make them.|$|R

5|$|If a cell {{containing}} {{the key is}} found, the search returns the value from that cell. Otherwise, if an empty cell is found, the key cannot be in the table, {{because it would have}} been placed in that cell in preference to any later <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> has not yet been searched. In this case, the search returns as its result that the key is not present in the dictionary.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Akira Iritani, at the Kyoto University in Japan, {{plans to}} fully clone a mammoth by somatic cell nuclear transfer. He intends {{to take a}} cell nucleus from {{the remains of a}} mammoth found in Yakutia, Russia, and insert it into an African {{elephant}}'s egg <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> have had their DNA removed, to create an embryo and then implant the embryo into a female African elephant for surrogate mother. However, nobody has yet found a viable mammoth cell with intact DNA, and most scientists doubt that any living cell could have survived freezing in the tundra.|$|E
5|$|On March 2, she {{was told}} that her request for removal of POI status—which entailed among other things {{sleeping}} wearing only boxer shorts—had been denied. Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that, {{if she wanted to}} harm herself, she could do so with her underwear or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.|$|E
40|$|The human colon {{contains}} about 15 million crypts, {{each of which}} {{contains about}} 2, 000 cells. Some of these are stem <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> maintain their population size when they divide, and some are transit amplifying (TA) <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> divide and differentiate to become the <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> repopulate the colon.

50|$|The {{transcription}} factor En1 {{is expressed in}} the MHB. In <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> express both Otx2 and Irx1, En1 is activated by Fgf8 signaling. En1 expression in <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> express both Pax2 and Otx2 leads to a midbrain identity/fate.|$|R
5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> allows for the integration of ER and mitochondrial physiology. Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular physiology and homeostasis. The MAM thus offers a perspective on mitochondria that diverges from the traditional view of this organelle as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface emphasizes {{the integration of the}} mitochondria, the product of an endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{mercury battery}} is a non-rechargeable {{electrochemical}} battery, a primary <b>cell,</b> <b>that</b> was {{common in the}} middle of the 20th century. It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes, particularly button sizes. Its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids. The mercury cell was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, {{was held in}} place by a special <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> compensated for the different temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature had no effect on the location or separation of the lenses. Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through a small window. The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E

25|$|Cytotoxic T cells (also {{known as}} TC, killer T cell, or {{cytotoxic}} T-lymphocyte (CTL)) are a sub-group of T <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> induce {{the death of}} <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> are infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional.|$|R
25|$|In angiosperms, during flower {{development}} the anther {{is composed}} of a mass of <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> appear undifferentiated, except for a partially differentiated dermis. As the flower develops, four groups of sporogenous cells form within the anther. The fertile sporogenous cells are surrounded by layers of sterile <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> grow into {{the wall of the}} pollen sac. Some of the cells grow into nutritive <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> supply nutrition for the microspores that form by meiotic division from the sporogenous cells.|$|R
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought {{to play a role in}} this progression.|$|E
5|$|Civilians in Masan posed an {{unexpectedly}} dangerous {{problem for the}} UN forces. The town had a large community of Communist sympathizers and agents. At {{the peak of the}} North Korean offensive, Han Gum Jo, manager of the Masan branch of the Korean Press Association, confessed that he was chief of the South Korean Labor Party in Masan and that he had been funneling information to the North Koreans through a Pusan headquarters. Additionally, the chief of the Masan prison guards was found to be the head of a Communist <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> included seven of his subordinates. This, and other counterintelligence information, came to light {{at a time when the}} most intense fighting was in progress only a few miles away. Kean considered the situation so dangerous that he ordered Masan evacuated of all people except police, public officials, railroad and utility workers, and necessary laborers and their families. Evacuation was to be completed in five days. On September 10 and 11 alone the 25th Division evacuated more than 12,000 people by Landing Ship Tank (LST) from Masan.|$|E
50|$|T helper cells, {{central to}} the immune system, {{interact}} with other leukocytes by releasing signals known as cytokines which activate and stimulate the proliferation of B cells and killer T cells.T helper cells also directly interact with macrophages, <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> engulf foreign matter and display antigens on its surface. T-helper <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> possess the appropriate receptors can bind to these antigens and proliferate resulting in T-helper <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> {{have the ability to}} identify the same antigens.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cells</b> <b>that</b> lie on {{surfaces}} {{exposed to}} the outside world or gastrointestinal tract (epithelia) or internal cavities (endothelium) come in numerous shapes and forms - from single layers of flat cells, to cells with small beating hair-like cilia in the lungs, to column-like <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> line the stomach. Endothelial <b>cells</b> are <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> line internal cavities including blood vessels and glands. Lining cells regulate what can and can't pass through them, protect internal structures, and function as sensory surfaces.|$|R
5|$|Activated B cells {{differentiate}} {{into either}} antibody-producing cells called plasma <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> secrete soluble antibody or memory <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> {{survive in the}} body for years afterward {{in order to allow}} the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.|$|R
5|$|Many of the tornadoes {{embedded}} in this initial squall line were weak, though several were strong and caused considerable damage. An EF3 caused major damage to homes in Coaling, Alabama, an EF2 and an EF3 caused major damage and a fatality near Eupora, Mississippi, and an EF3 caused heavy damage in downtown Cordova, Alabama, which {{was struck by}} a deadly EF4 tornado later that afternoon. One embedded <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> began in Cullman County, Alabama produced a long-tracked EF2 that struck the town of Hanceville, killing one person. That cell would go on to produce over ten tornadoes (mostly EF1s) to the northeast in Marshall County and another EF1 in Dade County, Georgia. The initial storms caused widespread power and telephone line outages across Alabama and Tennessee. This line of storms also caused some NOAA weather radio transmitter sites to stop functioning {{for the remainder of the}} outbreak. As a result, many people had no warning of approaching tornadoes later in the day.|$|E
5|$|Many viruses can be {{synthesised}} de novo ("from scratch") and {{the first}} synthetic virus was created in 2002. Although somewhat of a misconception, {{it is not the}} actual virus that is synthesised, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a DNA virus), or a cDNA copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a <b>cell.</b> <b>That</b> is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesise viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. , the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
5|$|The {{duplication}} {{and transmission}} of genetic material {{from one generation}} of cells to the next {{is the basis for}} molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells. In asexually reproducing organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism. In sexually reproducing organisms, a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or germ cells that are haploid, or contain only one copy of each gene. The gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova, and those produced by males are called sperm. Two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg, a single <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> has two sets of genes, with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father.|$|E

5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the <b>cell</b> <b>that</b> do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue.Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes. Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation. Magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments, present in magnetotactic bacteria, that contain magnetic crystals.|$|E

40|$|Many {{tumorigenic}} stimuli {{trigger a}} protective cellular response known as cellular senescence, a stable cell cycle arrest {{characterized by an}} active metabolism, secretion of immunomodulatory factors and activation of tumor suppressor pathways. The senescence state depends on the continuous and aberrant activation of signalling pathways. Senescent cells will remain non-dividing {{as long as this}} aberrant signalling is maintained. However, if these signals are attenuated, senescent cells can escape form their dormant condition and dangerously progress into tumor formation. Here we compare the transcriptome of oncogenic Ras–induced senescent <b>cells</b> with <b>that</b> of <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> escaped from senescence after attenuation of the ERK/MAP kinase signaling pathway. We found <b>that</b> <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> escaped from senescence express genes associated to genetic instability and display a highly aberrant karyotype. These cells also express genes commonly altered in the cancer transcriptome of different tissues supporting the idea of a common gene expression program <b>that</b> governs cancer <b>cells.</b> Bioinformatic analyses identified the transcription factors most likely regulating the gene expression programs of senescent <b>cells</b> and <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> escape from senescence. We propose a model of carcinogenesis where <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> escape from senescence provide a heterogeneous population of genetically unstable <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> can progress into malignant tumors...|$|R
