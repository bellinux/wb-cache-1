40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to test whether consumers’ {{personal}} colour pre- ferences (in an abstract sense rather than for a particular product) affect their intended product purchase decisions if they are given various colour choices. This work employs two experiments with visual components to investigate which colour a participant would choose if asked to select a product to purchase when there is a range of colours available. Two experiments were also designed to elicit a response about which colour each participant prefers (in an abstract sense). The study finds that personal colour preferences affect intended product-colour purchase decisions but that the extent of this varies from one product category to the next. Further analysis reveals that personal colour preferences are secondary to factors such as <b>colour</b> <b>functionality</b> and colour performance. This work presents new experimental data about the role of colour in product and product packaging on intended consumer purchase decisions. A conceptual framework, supported by the experimental findings, are understanding the relationship between individual colour preferences and product-choice colours, and more functional aspects of colour itself (such as the effect of colour on product’s performance or functionality) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractArchitectural {{acceptance}} of façade integrated solar-thermal arrays requires novel {{solutions for the}} flat plate solar thermal collectors, in terms of shape, size, <b>colour</b> and <b>functionality.</b> The paper presents a novel concept of solar-thermal arrays with variable geometry, based on non-rectangular collectors; different shapes and sizes are analysed and their adaptability in developing arrays with various geometries is discussed. Two “unit” shapes are proposed (equilateral triangle and isosceles trapeze), based on which various geometries can be developed; the size range of the collectors is discussed, along with the tubes’ design for the inner circulation of the water based working fluid. Several examples of façade and roof integrated arrays are presented, outlining the versatility of the proposed solution...|$|R
40|$|Colour image {{adjustments}} usually change colours globally. If e. g. the gamma, {{colour balance}} or contrast is changed, most {{if not all}} image colours are affected. Sometimes, however, constrained local colour changes are needed. For example, there may be a need to make the sky a little bit bluer or to change the tint of skin tones etc. without affecting other <b>colours.</b> The <b>functionality</b> of the local colour adjustment algorithm depends e. g. on how the localisation level is defined and what kind of predefined target colours are used. However, the design of the user interface is of utmost importance too. All the examples of different user interface schemes, described in this article, are based on the same principle. The user points the image area he/she wants to change and clicks the mouse button and the software takes care of the rest (i. e. adjusts colours locally) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{observed}} stellar velocity dispersions of galactic discs {{show that}} the maximum rotation of a disc is on average 63 % of the observed maximum rotation. This criterion can, however, not be applied to small or low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies because such systems show, in general, a continuously rising rotation curve until the outermost measured radial position. That is why a general relation has been derived, giving the maximum rotation for a disc depending on the luminosity, surface brightness, and colour of the disc. As a physical basis of this relation serves an adopted fixed mass-to-light ratio {{as a function of}} <b>colour.</b> That <b>functionality</b> is consistent with results from population synthesis models and its absolute value is determined from the observed stellar velocity dispersions. The derived maximum disc rotation is compared with a number of observed maximum rotations, clearly demonstrating the need for appreciable amounts of dark matter in the disc region and even more so for LSB galaxies. Matters have been illustrated for two examples; the galaxy NGC 6503 and LSB galaxy NG...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid organic/nitride {{optoelectronic}} devices {{will take}} full advantage of the optical and electronic properties of both organic and nitride materials. The significant benefits of integrating organic optoelectronic materials such as light-emitting polymers (LEPs) with nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been identified recently. However, due to their high chemical sensitivity, fabricating polymer microstructures and integrating them with nitride LEDs present a considerable technical challenge. In this work, several approaches for fabricating organic functional polymer microstructures on AlInGaNbased micro-structured LEDs have been developed, including self-aligned direct writing, ultraviolet laser writing and lithographic patterning. It is shown that the fabricated organic/nitride micro-structured LED devices have well defined microstructures and exhibit novel <b>functionalities.</b> <b>Colour</b> downconverted visible emission from these hybrid electroluminescent microstructured LEDs has been achieved. These hybrid LEDs offer a promising route to development of a range of low-cost and highly efficient micro-light sources...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Developments in technology have meant that computercontrolled imaging devices are becoming more powerful and more affordable. Despite their increasing prevalence, computer-aided design and desktop publishing software has failed to keep pace, leading to disappointing colour reproduction across different devices. Although {{there has been a}} recent drive to incorporate <b>colour</b> management <b>functionality</b> into modern computer systems, in general this is limited in scope and fails to properly consider the way in which colours are perceived. Furthermore, differences in viewing conditions or representation severely impede the communication of colour between groups of users. The approach proposed here is to provide WYSIWYG colour across a range of imaging devices through a combination of existing device characterisation and colour appearance modeling techniques. In addition, to further facilitate colour communication, various common colour notation systems are defined by a series of mathematical mappings. This enables both the implementation of computer-based colour atlases (which have a number of practical advantages over physical specifiers) and also the interrelation of colour represented in hitherto incompatible notations. Together with the proposed solution, details are given of a computer system which has been implemented. The system was used by textile designers for a real task. Prior to undertaking this work, designers were interviewed in order to ascertain where colour {{played an important role in}} their work and where it was found to be a problem. A summary of the findings of these interviews together with a survey of existing approaches to the problems of colour fidelity and communication in colour computer systems are also given. As background to this work, the topics of colour science and colour imaging are introduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{zebrafish}} {{has become}} a commonly used vertebrate model for toxicity assessment, of particular relevance {{to the study of}} toxic effects on the visual system because of the structural similarities shared by zebrafish and human retinae. In this article we present a colour preference-based technique that, by assessing the functionality of photoreceptors, can be used to evaluate the effects of toxicity on behaviour. A digital camera was used to record the locomotor behaviour of individual zebrafish swimming in a water tank consisting of two compartments separated by an opaque perforated wall through which the fish could pass. The colour of the lighting in each compartment could be altered independently (producing distinct but connected environments of white, red or blue) to allow association of the zebrafish's swimming behaviour with its <b>colour</b> preference. The <b>functionality</b> of the photoreceptors was evaluated based on the ability of the zebrafish to sense the different colours and to swim between the compartments. The zebrafish tracking was carried out using our algorithm developed with MATLAB. We found that zebrafish preferred blue illumination to white, and white illumination to red. Acute treatment with acrylamide (2 mM for 36 h) resulted in a marked reduction in locomotion and a concomitant loss of colour-preferential swimming behaviour. Histopathological examination of acrylamide-treated zebrafish eyes showed that acrylamide exposure had caused retinal damage. The colour preference tracking technique has applications in the assessment of neurodegenerative disorders, as a method for preclinical appraisal of drug efficacy and for behavioural evaluation of toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Dashing Tweeds is a {{woven textile}} and {{menswear}} brand {{set up in}} 2006; its philosophy based on the reinvention of tweeds, suitings and traditional luxury woollen fabrics for fashion. Fabrics are sold by the metre or bespoke designed. The company takes inspiration from the functional and aesthetic heritage of traditional British wool whilst embracing innovation in luxury textiles. Early Burberry and McIntosh are inspirational in their adoption of fabric innovation in conjunction with classic British design. The company {{is dedicated to the}} evolution of traditional aesthetics and production methods. It embraces the links between heritage and contemporary design innovation in the form of hardwearing, functional, luxury products. This paper will focus on international client case studies that have chosen to work with Dashing Tweeds, exploring the market demand and desire for UK produced heritage inspired, innovative products in luxury menswear. Tweed is a traditional British woollen fabric woven in variations of a twill structure from rough spun blended wool, traditionally used for outdoor activities such as fishing and hunting due to its moisture resistance and durability. Harris Tweed has been hand woven in the Western Isles for many years and is synonymous with British textiles. This method of hand production, high quality materials and durability seals its status as a luxury fabric {{in the context of the}} current fast moving fashion cycle. It is imbued with the emotive notion of the landscape and culture which inspires it. It evokes a response in menswear that appeals to memory and nostalgia of less ephemeral and disposable fashion. Much of its appeal is bound up in its association with home spun production, ‘authenticity’, melange of <b>colour</b> and <b>functionality.</b> Dashing tweeds combines the heritage of tweed and the use of technical yarn to produce fabrics which have a sense of tradition with an innovative function. Fine reflective filaments are woven into woollen suiting using a variety of new and traditional structures that allude to the tweed aesthetic. A current project is exploring the use of carbon nanotube/polymer composites imbedded in wool textiles with a view to creating fabrics that are recognisable as tweed but possesses hidden function. Designs are based around traditional checks, twills and herringbones. Colour inspiration comes from the surrounding changing environment, much in the same way as traditional tweeds were inspired by the landscape of rural Scotland and Ireland. Dashing Tweeds colour comes from the urban environment of double yellow lines, wet pavements and the parks and architecture of London. Dashing Tweeds appeals to a menswear market that doesn’t want an obviously innovative looking aesthetic but enjoys the technical aspect through hidden innovation in a heritage inspired textile. Through analysing the relationship between Dashing Tweeds and their client base, the paper will address market demand and relevance of such a company and discuss the importance of heritage inspired cloth, innovation in materials and sustainable production to the brand strategy and future of Dashing Tweeds and their clients.

In addition, Allpa provides technical help, product development advice, skills training, tools and appropriate equipment to artisans. Artisans can access short-term and mid-term loans to improve infrastructure and their workshops. Allpa works with families located in Cusco, Ayacucho, Chulucanas, Cajamarca and Huancavelica {{as well as}} Shipibo {{people living in the}} Amazon rainforest area of Pucalepa. For most of these people, craft production is a sole source of income. In 1982, a group of economists, anthropologists and sociologists of the Universidad Católica of Lima created Allpa to improve living standards of handicrafts producers. Allpa began active work as an alternative trading organization in 1986. In September 2010 R Winter undertook a short trip (7 days) to Lima R Winter and Allpa used this trip to research and establish where design and technical consultation would be of most benefit. Although very short, this trip was invaluable and gave Robert Winter an insight into the capabilities of the potteries concerned. R Winter concluded that the potteries are well equipped with all suitable materials and equipment for hand and cast made pottery. However it was foreseen that other techniques and alternative production methods which may be introduced may need additional equipment and perhaps support from Allpa, Traidcraft and The University of Sunderland 2011 Workshop/Trip The workshop covered three distinct areas of interest: 	A design and making workshop was delivered at the Chullucanas pottery and a shorter design and making workshop at the Lima pottery. 	A design and technical workshop took place to establish the capability of the Lima pottery to produce a range of specific products for the European Market These workshops were led by Robert Winter and Maria del Carmen director of Allpa assisted by three phd students fromn the University of Sunderland Design Workshops Chullucanas Prject (North Peru) New designs for Smoke Fired Ware The emphasis was on methods of production and design. The goal of the visit was to implement the development and design of a range of new pieces which will improve the products’ place in the modern ceramics market. Students arrived with designs ready for production and oversaw this with RW and Maria del Carmen. The designs were for a new range of highly decorative thrown vessel forms and two new designs for nativity sets.
