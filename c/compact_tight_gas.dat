The main controlling factors of composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir accumulation can thus be classified into two subsidiary sets. One set {{is associated with the}} accumulation of conventional <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs, mainly cap rocks (C), gas reservoirs (D), low fluid potential areas (P), and source kitchens (S). The other is associated with deep <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs, mainly universal reservoir densification (L), stable tectonic settings (W), widely distributed reservoirs (D), and source rocks in a close contact with reservoirs (S). Therefore, we infer that the development of composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs is driven by the following six main factors S, D, C, W, P, and L, with the accumulation process depending on the spatiotemporal combination of these functional elements, and with the development model shown by “T-CDPS + T-LWDS” (Pang et al. 2014). The genetic mechanisms of composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs are thus a recombination of conventional tight and deep <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir accumulations, resulting in the complex gas–water relationships and full gas-bearing properties.|$|R

The three categories of <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> are: (1) “pre-existing ” basin-centered gas reservoir, in which the reservoir sands experienced early-stage tightening processes, occurring before peak gas generation, expulsion from source rock, and charging of reservoir; (2) “pre-existing subsequent-improved ” <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir, in which the reservoir sands were also tightened before gas charging and then underwent reservoirs improvement mainly caused by the tectonic activities; and (3) “subsequent-conventional ” <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir where reserved sands were tightened after the peak of gas generation, expulsion from source rock, and charging of reservoir. This type of <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> initially formed conventional gas accumulation during gas charging of reservoir, and subsequently modified to <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir. All the three categories of <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> have different geological conditions of gas accumulation and gas accumulation patterns, which can be used as characteristics to classify these <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> systems, and thus have distinctive control on regional gas distribution.

Along with the low productivity, <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> sands are faced with other additional challenges if compared to conventional reservoirs, such as near wellbore damage due to water blocking, mechanical damage, fluid invasion and wellbore breakouts. In addition, inaccuracy of conventional build-up and draw-down well test results is common.

Based on this research, drilling long horizontal deviated wells using non-aqueous fluids in underbalanced conditions may be more efficient than hydraulic fracturing. As the optimum strategy to further improve the well productivity, drilling the well with a high deviation to intersect multiple sand lenses; orienting the wellbore direction perpendicular to the maximum horizontal stress to intersect higher permeability conduits and control wellbore instability issues; completing the well as open-hole to have the advantage of enlarged wellbore caused by large wellbore breakouts; running slotted liner to control wellbore collapse; open-hole perforation in the direction of maximum horizontal stress to reach a deeper formation penetration; and unloading the wellbore from drilling and fracturing fluids can help achieve commercial gas production rates from <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs...|$|R

It should be considered in priority in the exploration and exploi-tation of unconventional gas. There are there key factors to develop tight gas: reliable data resources, mature technology, and overlapping with conventional natural gas. Making national development strategy, accelerating the progress of technology, deepening the reform of natural gas price and innovating regulatory system would speed development of <b>tight</b> <b>gas.</b> In future, <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> will become the main growth of natural gas production.

40|$|<b>Tight</b> <b>gas</b> {{reservoirs}} {{normally have}} production problems due to very low matrix permeability and significant damage during well drilling, completion, stimulation and production. Therefore {{they might not}} flow gas to surface at optimum rates without advanced production improvement techniques. After well stimulation and fracturing operations, invaded liquids such as filtrate will flow from the reservoir into the wellbore, as gas is produced during well cleanup. In addition, there might be production of condensate with gas. The produced liquids when loaded and re-circulated downhole in wellbores, can significantly reduce the gas pro-duction rate and well productivity in <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> formations. This paper presents assessments of <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir productivity issues related to liquid loading in wellbores using numerical simulation of multiphase flow in deviated and horizontal wells. A field example of production logging in a horizontal well is used to verify reliability of the numerical simulation model outputs. Well production performance modelling is also performed to quantitatively evaluate water loading in a typical <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> well, and test the water unloading techniques that can improve the well productivity. The results indicate the effect of downhole liquid loading on well productivity in <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs. It also shows how well cleanup is sped up with the improved well productivity when downhole circulating liquids are lifted using the proposed methods...|$|R
