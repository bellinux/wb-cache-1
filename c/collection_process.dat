5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. Until 1983, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a two-week break each Christmas. The BMRB used motorcycle couriers to collect the sales figures taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. This data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Music Week. On 4 January 1983, the chart was taken over by Gallup who expanded the chart from the Top 75 to the Top 100 and began the introduction of computerised tills which automated the data <b>collection</b> <b>process.</b> The chart was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets and announced on Tuesday until October 1987, when the Top 40 was revealed each Sunday, due to the new automated process.|$|E

40|$|Internet of Things (IoT) systems {{comprise}} massive {{volumes of}} smart devices. Through exchanges of information, smart objects {{are capable of}} reasoning and generate higher level of intelligence. The effectiveness of data <b>collection</b> <b>processes</b> is a key factor {{to the success of}} IoT systems as it can seriously affect the freshness of the captured data. Efficient data <b>collection</b> <b>processes</b> have been well studied on sensory systems with static topologies and single data extraction point. Smart devices in IoT systems are often shared by different parties; therefore, concurrent data <b>collection</b> <b>processes</b> are always expected. Such a unique characteristic of IoT systems has imposed new challenges to the designs of efficient data <b>collection</b> <b>processes.</b> In this paper, concurrent data collection trees specifically designed for IoT applications are proposed. It is shown that, comparing with an existing single-user data collection structure, systems with the proposed tree structures can significantly shorten their concurrent data <b>collection</b> <b>processes.</b> Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|R

25|$|Data {{collected}} from interviews with physicians distinguishes between first impressions and intuition {{and contributes to}} understanding the occurrence of gut feelings in the medical field. Gut feelings go beyond first impressions: Physicians expressed feeling doubtful about their initial impressions as they gathered more data from their patients. More experienced physicians reported more instances of gut feelings than those less experienced, but {{the quality of the}} intuition was related to the quality of feedback received during the data <b>collection</b> <b>process</b> in general. Emotional engagement enhanced learning just as it does in first impressions.|$|E
25|$|A 31-year-old woman {{went to her}} {{physician}} {{because of}} decreased vision in her left eye. The left eye showed fibrinous exudates, posterior synechiae and vitritis. After a vitreous sample {{was sent to the}} lab for identification, the yeast was identified as Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. The recommended treatment was voriconazole 200mg, twice a day for two months. Improvement in the left eye was seen within a week. Exposure to mould and yeast within a military hospital in Finland lead to an outbreak of asthma, alveolitis and rhinitis. The building was known to have severe water and mould damage. After performing inhalation provocation tests, four cases of asthma caused by Sporobolomyces salmonicolor were reported. An additional seven workers were diagnosed with rhinitis. All seven individuals with rhinitis acted positively in nasal S.salmonicolor provocation tests. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor was recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid of three patients in a hospital, one of whom was a kidney transplant recipient. Heavy growth of S.salmonicolor was recovered from utility rooms on the floors of each patient, and from the hospital rooms of two patients. It was suggested that this particular case was most likely caused by contamination. During the <b>collection</b> <b>process,</b> S.salmonicolor was most likely introduced into the CSF as a contaminant.|$|E
25|$|Foragers first go {{in search}} of water, which they collect in {{multiple}} trips. This water is then regurgitated {{on the surface of}} the nest material (typically plant fibers). The water serves as a type of glue, adhering the fibers of the nest material, beginning the formation of a ball. The water also serves to moisten and soften the fibers of the pulp so it is easier to manipulate for the formation of the nest. Using their mandibles, the foraging wasps remove the plant fibers (pulp) from its surface. This forms a ball of pulp, and the wasp will move around the immediate area in order to collect enough pulp (a ball that is about the size of its head, 2–4mm). This <b>collection</b> <b>process</b> only takes a few minutes. At this point, the forager returns to the nest, carrying the pulp mass. Either the forager or the queen wasp will take the pulp and apply it to the growing nest. The forager repeats this process multiple times in a day, usually for many hours. Interestingly, there is evidence that foragers collect the same foraging material on each trip. In nests that are made out of materials with distinct colors, researchers found that each forager collected only one of the colors in the nest, creating a colorful nest.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{highlight}} {{the importance of}} sampling and data <b>collection</b> <b>processes</b> in qualitative interview studies, and to discuss the contribution of these processes to determining {{the strength of the}} evidence generated and thereby to decisions for public health practice and policy. Approach: This discussion is informed by a hierarchy-of-evidence-for-practice model. The paper provides succinct guidelines for key sampling and data collection considerations in qualitative research involving interview studies. The importance of allowing time for immersion in a given community to become familiar with the context and population is discussed, as well as the practical constraints that sometimes operate against this stage. The role of theory in guiding sample selection is discussed both in terms of identifying likely sources of rich data and in understanding the issues emerging from the data. It is noted that sampling further assists in confirming the developing evidence and also illuminates data that does not seem to fit. The importance of reporting sampling and data <b>collection</b> <b>processes</b> is highlighted clearly to enable others to assess both the strength of the evidence and the broader applications of the findings. Conclusion: Sampling and data <b>collection</b> <b>processes</b> are critical to determining the quality of a study and the generalisability of the findings. We argue that these processes should operate within the parameters of the research goal, be guided by emerging theoretical considerations, cover a range of relevant participant perspectives, and be clearly outlined in research reports with an explanation of any research limitations.
