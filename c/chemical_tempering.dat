The surface {{composition of the}} glasses was analyzed by energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), the mechanical properties and wear resistance were characterized by nanoindentation/nanoscratch tests. The {{results indicate that the}} ion- exchange method can {{be a good way to}} increase the strength and improve wear resistance of Na-Ca-Si glass.

This work examines the strengthening {{effect of the}} ion exchange method of <b>chemical</b> <b>tempering</b> on two specific types of macroflaws, a thermally blunted crack and a sawcut, in soda-lime glass. The use of these macroflaws permitted a quantitative fracture mechanics analysis {{of the amount of}} strengthening produced, and a greater access for ion exchange at the flaw tip than could be afforded by a sharp crack. The specimens were treated for various lengths of time in a potassium nitrate bath at 365 °C. A double cantilever cleavage technique of measuring fracture surface energy was used to find G, the strain energy release rate. The average increase in G was found to be roughly linear reaching a maximum level of approximately 200 % at twelve hours of treatment for the blunted crack specimen type, while a similar maximum of approximately 200 % was reached at six hours of treatment for the sawcut specimen type.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn recent years much research {{has gone into}} determining the behavior of glass which makes it adaptable for structural use in submersible vehicles and for oceanographic instrumentation packages. This work examines the strengthening effect of the ion exchange method of <b>chemical</b> <b>tempering</b> on a macroflaw in glass. Use of a macroflaw allows a quantitative fracture mechanics analysis {{of the amount of}} strengthening. Precracked soda-lime glass specimens were treated for various lengths of time in a potassium nitrate salt bath held at 365 °C. The behavior of the macroflaw while being treated and at fracture was closely observed. The strain energy release rale, G(c), and the fracture toughness, K(c), were found by using the double cantilever cleavage technique of measuring fracture surface energies. The average strengthening which occurred at this temperature was found to be almost linear with time with a maximum increase of G(c) of approximately 300 per cent at twenty-four hours. The diffusion of ions was determined to be inward from the sides of the flaw rather than across the entire flaw tip. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} risk factors and injury {{patterns}} have been identified to predict the occurrence of VTE [7, 8]. From the endothelial damage [9], to the activation of the coagulation system enhanced by the inflammatory state in association with hypotension, immobilization, stasis [10 – 12], and procoagulant therapies [13, 14], the whole system is unbalanced towards a predominant prohaemostatic state that remains for several days. As a consequence, VTE prophylaxis has to be started early and should combine mechanical and chemical prophylaxis [15]. Some guidelines are available to help the clinicians, but the level of evidence remains fairly low [5, 8]. Recent literature nevertheless tends to push forward early <b>chemical</b> thromboprophylaxis, <b>tempering</b> the fears of haemorrhagic complications, especially {{in the setting of}} solid organ and brain injuries [16].|$|R
40|$|National audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a new experimental “similarity” vent sizing tool for non <b>tempered</b> <b>chemical</b> system combining the advantages of both DIERS method (laboratory scale) and UN similarity method (less overconservative). This tool is an extension of the VSP 2 (Vent Sizing Package II) adiabatic calorimeter. The objective of this new vent sizing tool is twofold. The first is to provide the required A/V ratio necessary to assure a safe relief. The second is to provide measurement of mass vented during blow-down. This paper gives a description of this tool and exposes the first promising results obtained. Its main limits are also given...|$|R
5000|$|Cryogenic {{processing}} is not {{a substitute}} for heat treatment, but rather an extension of the heating - quenching - tempering cycle. Normally, when an item is quenched, the final temperature is ambient. The only {{reason for this is that}} most heat treaters do not have cooling equipment. There is nothing metallurgically significant about ambient temperature. The cryogenic process continues this action from ambient temperature down to [...]In most instances the cryogenic cycle is followed by a heat tempering procedure. As all alloys do not have the same <b>chemical</b> constituents, the <b>tempering</b> procedure varies according to the material's chemical composition, thermal history and/or a tool's particular service application.|$|R
40|$|Thin slumped glass foils are {{considered}} good {{candidates for the}} realization of future X-ray telescopes with large effective area and high spatial resolution. However, the hot slumping process affects the glass strength, and this can be an issue during {{the launch of the}} satellite because of the high kinematical and static loads occurring during that phase. In the present work we have investigated the possible use of Gorilla glass (produced by Corning), a chemical tempered glass that, thanks to its strength characteristics, would be ideal. The un-tempered glass foils were curved by means of an innovative hot slumping technique and subsequently chemically tempered. In this paper we show that the <b>chemical</b> <b>tempering</b> process applied to Gorilla glass foils does not affect the surface micro-roughness of the mirrors. On the other end, the stress introduced by the tempering process causes a reduction in the amplitude of the longitudinal profile errors with a lateral size close to the mirror length. The effect of the overall shape changes in the final resolution performance of the glass mirrors was studied by simulating the glass foils integration with our innovative approach based on glass reinforcing ribs. The preliminary tests performed so far suggest that this approach {{has the potential to be}} applied to the X-ray telescopes of the next generation.

40|$|A simple {{continuum}} mechanics model relating the quality index,* Q, to {{parameters of the}} deformation curve of alloys A 356 / 357 is presented. The model incorporates the limiting effect of particle cracking on the ductility on a phenomenological base and {{it is used to}} predict the behaviour of the quality index as the material is strengthened by either ageing or increased content of Mg. The analysis shows that for every temper there is a matrix strength that maximises the Q-value. For strong alloys the model suggests that peak ageing can reduce Q. This effect is stronger when the ductility of the material is low. The possibility of using the quality index to optimise the combination of the alloy <b>chemical</b> composition and <b>temper</b> is discussed...|$|R
30|$|High {{temperature}} thermal {{and mechanical}} property measurements {{have been reported}} in the literature for different aluminum alloys. Maljaars, et al. (2005), Mazzolani (1995), and Eurocode 9 (BSI 2007) provide an overview of published thermal and mechanical property data for aluminum. Creep data for some aluminum alloys is presented in (Maljaars et al. 2008; Maljaars et al. 2005; Maljaars et al. 2009 a; Maljaars et al. 2009 b), (Faggiano et al. 2004), and (Mazzolani 1995). Limited elevated temperature mechanical property data was provided by Amdahl, et al. (2001) for aluminum 5083 -H 116 and (Langhelle 1996) for 6082 with T 4 and T 6 heat treatments including some stress-strain curves detailing plastic deformation and the fracture strain. Aluminum alloys contain a wide range of <b>chemical</b> compositions and <b>tempers,</b> even within the same alloy family (e.g., 5 xxx-series wrought aluminum alloys). Thus, the elevated temperature mechanical properties required to analyze and model the structural response must be measured for the specific aluminum alloy of interest. Note, careful consideration of alloy microstructures may allow for extrapolation of existing mechanical properties to other similar aluminum alloys.|$|R
40|$|The {{correlation}} between K + -Na+ diffusion coefficient and mechanical properties of chemically tempered and hybrid tempered (chemically tempered subsequent to thermally tempered) aluminosilicate glass are investigated. Firstly, the potassium ion concentration profiles are experimentally measured and the diffusion coefficient is calculated {{according to the}} Boltzmann-Matano approach. Secondly, the flexure strength and Weibull modulus are determined using a combined experimental (coaxial double ring) and finite element analysis method. The {{results indicate that the}} flexural strength decreases with the diffusion coefficient of the air side for both types of glass samples while there is no significant relationship between diffusion coefficient and Weibull modulus. Diffusion coefficient on air side shows a higher value than that of the tin side. With the same diffusion coefficient, the flexural strength of chemically tempered glasses are found to be higher than that for hybrid tempered glasses. The effect of diffusion coefficient on modulus of rupture (MOR) for hybrid tempered glass is more remarkable. These results would be useful in designing the strength of glass and guiding the strengthening process by <b>chemical</b> or hybrid <b>tempering...</b>|$|R
50|$|The WGS {{also took}} {{initiatives}} in high precision mechanical and <b>chemical</b> components —how <b>tempers</b> would {{be developed to}} produce the efficiency and high precision data - physics calculations - what would its appropriate time reaction when the explosives makes contact with nuclear material, high explosives—what kind of chemical material would be used, and triggering mechanisms —how the weapon would be detonated. The Pinstech had lack of facility to carry out these experiments in its laboratories, therefore on 25 March 1974, Abdus Salam, along with Munir Ahmad Khan and Riazuddin, visited Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF) where Salam held talks with Lieutenant-General Qamar Ali Mirza where military engineers first built the Metallurgical Laboratory (ML) in Wah Cantt in 1976. At ML, the WGS developed the complex optical lenses and chemical high-explosive materials and triggering mechanism which the task was completed in 1979. Concerns were raised with {{the absence of the}} CNC facility which was acquired in 1978. In 1979, Qureshi worked with Munir Khan for the construction of third nuclear pile-PARR-III- near at Nilore. The reactor's designing process was led by Munir Ahmad Khan and Qureshi and Corps of Engineers led the construction of this plutonium separation reactor. In 1980, the reactor west critical under Ishfaq Ahmad and attained its full power in 1981. The reactor was reprocessed at 50% efficiency, and produces the first batch of weapon-grade plutonium in 1982.|$|R
40|$|The pronotal and elytral {{defensive}} secretions of 10 Oreina {{species were}} analyzed. Species feeding on Apiaceae, i. e., O. frigida and O. viridis, or on Cardueae (Asteraceae), i. e., O. bidentata, O. coerulea, and O. virgulata, produce species-specific complex mixtures of autogenous cardenolides. O. melanocephala, which feeds on Doronicum clusii (Senecioneae, Asteraceae), devoid of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in its leaves, secretes, at best, traces of cardenolides. Sequestration of host-plant PAs {{was observed in}} all the other species when feeding on Senecioneae containing these alkaloids in their leaves. O. cacaliae is the only species that secretes host-derived PA N-oxides and no autogenous cardenolides. Differences were observed in the secretions of specimens collected in various localities, because of local differences in the vegetation. The other species, such as O. elongata, O. intricata, and O. speciosissima, have a mixed defensive strategy and are able both to synthesize de novo cardenolides and to sequester plant PA N-oxides. This allows a great flexibility in defense, especially in O. elongata and O. speciosissima, which feed on both PA and non-PA plants. Populations of these species were found exclusively producing cardenolides, or exclusively sequestering PA N-oxides, or still doing both, depending on the local availability of food-plants. Differences were observed between species {{in their ability to}} sequester different plant PA N-oxides and to transform them. Therefore sympatric species demonstrate differences in the composition of their host-derived secretions, also resulting from differences in host-plant preference. Finally, within-population individual differences were observed because of local plant heterogeneity in PAs. To some extent these intrapopulation variations in <b>chemical</b> defense are <b>tempered</b> by mixing diet and by the long-term storage of PA N-oxides in the insect body that are used to refill the defensive glands...|$|R
