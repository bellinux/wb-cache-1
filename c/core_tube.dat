The coil slips over the core tube; a retaining clip engages the depression near the closed end of the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> and holds the coil on the <b>core</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> {{contains}} {{and guides}} the core. It also retains the plugnut and may seal the fluid. To optimize {{the movement of}} the core, the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> needs to be nonmagnetic. If the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> were magnetic, then it would offer a shunt path for the field lines. In some designs, the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> is an enclosed metal shell produced by deep drawing. Such a design simplifies the sealing problems because the fluid cannot escape from the enclosure, but the design also increases the magnetic path resistance because the magnetic path must traverse the thickness of the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> twice: once near the plugnut and once near the core. In some other designs, the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> is not closed but rather an open tube that slips over one end of the plugnut. To retain the plugnut, the tube might be crimped to the plugnut. An O-ring seal between the tube and the plugnut will prevent the fluid from escaping.|$|E

Two samples were natural, cohesive sediments retrieved from different sites in the Boston Harbor identified as Open Cell and Mid Channel. The other two sediments were medium and coarse grain, non-cohesive quartz sediments. For each sediment type, erosion tests were performed with both rectangular and circular <b>core</b> <b>tubes.</b> For all <b>cores,</b> bulk density was determined {{as a function of}} depth and consolidation time.

50|$|The {{solenoid coil}} {{consists}} of many turns of copper wire {{that surround the}} <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> and induce {{the movement of the}} core. The coil is often encapsulated in epoxy. The coil also has an iron frame that provides a low magnetic path resistance.|$|E
50|$|To {{simplify the}} sealing issues, the plugnut, core, springs, shading ring, and other {{components}} are often {{exposed to the}} fluid, so they must be compatible as well. The requirements present some special problems. The <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> needs to be non-magnetic to pass the solenoid's field through to the plugnut and the core. The plugnut and core need a material with good magnetic properties such as iron, but iron is prone to corrosion. Stainless steels can be used because they come in both magnetic and non-magnetic varieties. For example, a solenoid valve might use 304 stainless steel for the body, 305 stainless steel for the <b>core</b> <b>tube,</b> 302 stainless steel for the springs, and 430 F stainless steel (a magnetic stainless steel) for the core and plugnut.|$|E
5000|$|Diamond {{drilling}} is {{much slower}} than reverse circulation (RC) drilling {{due to the}} hardness of the ground being drilled. Drilling of 1200 to 1800 metres is common and at these depths, ground is mainly hard rock. Techniques vary among drill operators and what the rig they are using is capable of, some diamond rigs need to drill slowly to lengthen the life of drill bits and rods, which are very expensive and time consuming to replace at extremely deep depths. As a diamond drill rig cores deeper and deeper the time consuming {{part of the process}} is not cutting 5 to 10 more feet of rock core but the retrieval of the core with the wire line & overshot tool.Core samples are retrieved via the use of a <b>core</b> <b>tube,</b> a hollow tube placed inside the rod string and pumped with water until it locks into the core barrel. As the core is drilled, the core barrel slides over the core as it is cut.

The winch is retracted, pulling the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> to the surface. The core does not drop out of the inside of the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> when lifted because either a split ring core lifter or basket retainer allow the core to move into, but not back out of the tube.|$|E

40|$|Experiments on the {{entrainment}} {{of surface}} sediments around polychaete tubes at natural and manipulated densities {{were conducted in}} a recirculating seawater flume. Intact cores with either 0 or 8 Diopatra cuprea tubes per 0. 01 m * plus associated assemblages were collected in the field. Sediments which contained D. cuprea tubes had natural macrofaunal densities> 5 x those of sediments without tubes. To distinguish between organism-induced sediment effects and the hydrodynamic effects of tubes on the critical entrainment velocities of these sediments I used <b>cores</b> with eight <b>tubes</b> per 0. 0 1 m * (tubes and high macrofaunal density), similar <b>cores</b> with <b>tubes</b> removed (no tubes and high macrofaunal density), <b>cores</b> with eight <b>tubes</b> added (tubes and low macrofaunal density), and <b>cores</b> without <b>tubes</b> (no tubes and low macrofaunal density). Critical entrainment velocities for natural cohesive sediments in these treatments were 46 % lower in the cores with high densities of macrofauna than in those with low densities. The implication is that biotically mediated sedimentological changes around D. cuprea tubes, rather than alterations of near-bed flow by the tubes, are responsible for lowering erosion thresholds in this system.

40|$|The {{core sample}} is heated {{from the outside}} at a known rate and the rise in {{temperature}} at {{the surface of the}} <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> is measured. Because the temperature at the surface, increasing with time, {{is a function of the}} thermal properties of both the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> and the sample, the thermal properties of the sample can be estimated by comparing the measured temperature with the theory, provided that the thermal properties of the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> are known. Thus it is not necessary to extract the sample from the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> to make the measurements. Neither is it necessary to insert a heater, or temperature sensor, into the sample within the <b>core</b> <b>tube,</b> as would be required if another method were applied. The sample remains intact after the measurements. The temperature change in the sample can be kept to a minimum as long as the thermal conductivity determination is possible with a reasonable precision.

The first heat exchanger, HX 1, has the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> made of S 316 stainless steel with the tube {{external and internal}} diameters measure 32. 0 mm and 28. 3 mm, respectively. The foam layer of HX 1 is bonded to its <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> using highly conductive thermal glue. The second heat exchanger, HX 2, has the <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> made of AA 6061, the same material as the foam layer covering it, and the two parts are bonded together by a brazing technique. The <b>core</b> <b>tube</b> of HX 2 has nearly identical dimension to that of HX 1 with a small variation in its thickness. The tests are carried out on each heat exchanger, installed horizontally in a cross-flow arrangement inside a wind tunnel, {{one at a time}} with air velocity varying between 1. 5 to 5 m/s. Heat transfer from 75 C hot liquid, circulating through the <b>core</b> <b>tube,</b> to external air is evaluated using the concept of total thermal resistance where the effects of tube material and the two bonding methods are quantified as a series of smaller resistant components. The results show that, within the range of designated air velocity, thermal contact resistance (TCR) of HX 1 is 0. 015 Â± 0. 001 K/W larger than that of HX 2; essentially constant with the air flow rate. This TCR however contributes between 10 % to 19 % of HX 1 total thermal resistance from lowest to highest air velocity, respectively.
