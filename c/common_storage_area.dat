A full rack contains 30 server nodes, a half rack, 16, a quarter rack, 8, and an eighth rack, 4. Each server node has installed 96 GB of RAM, four 10 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, and a double InfiniBand port. The storage area network for all configurations is similar, with 40 TB of raw space. The vendor's specifications and advertising content usually indicate the total parameters (360 processor kernels and 2.9 TB RAM for full rack).An X3-2 model was announced in 2012 with newer processors and more memory. Since late 2013 an X4-2 model is commercially available, it has yet more processor cores and four times as large capacity of solid-state drives.|$|E
40|$|Background: Home {{and garden}} {{pesticide}} use {{has been linked}} to cancer and other health outcomes in numerous epidemiological studies. Exposure has generally been self-reported, so the assessment is potentially limited by recall bias and lack of information on specific chemicals. Objectives: As part of an integrated assessment of residential pesticide exposure, we identified active ingredients and described patterns of storage and use. Methods: During a home interview of 500 residentially stable households enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study during 2001 – 2006, trained interviewers inventoried residential pesticide products and queried participants about their storage and use. U. S. Environmental Protection Agency registration numbers, recorded from pesticide product labels, and pesticide chemical codes were matched to public databases to obtain information on active ingredients and chemical class. Poisson regression was used to identify independent predictors of pesticide storage. Analyses were restricted to 259 participating control households. Results: Ninety-five percent (246 of 259) of the control households stored at least one pesticide product (median, 4). Indicators of higher sociodemographic status predicted more products in storage. We identified the most <b>common</b> characteristics: <b>storage</b> <b>areas</b> (garage, 40 %; kitchen, 20 %), pests treated (ants, 33 %; weeds, 20 %), pesticide types (insecticides, 46 %; herbicides, 24 %), chemical classes (pyrethroids, 77 %; botanicals, 50 %), active ingredients (pyrethrins, 43 %) and synergists (piperonyl butoxide, 42 %). Products could contain multiple active ingredients. Conclusions: Our data on specific active ingredients and patterns of storage and use will inform future etiologic analyses of residential pesticide exposures from self-reported data, particularly among households with young children...|$|R

The collaborative computing applications found in smart phones helps in performing group work with colleagues even {{out of the office}} as all the normal computer functions are possible with the smart phones. Such applications support the interaction between people and information sharing among the participants by storing the data in <b>common</b> <b>storage</b> <b>area.</b> But there is high potential risk for user’s security and privacy in this environment. In order to sustain privacy and security in digital collaborative environments, strong authorization and authentication framework is required and so a novel Trusted Third Party called Shielding Server is introduced which will provide strong authentication and access control mechanisms to make data sharing in collaborative computing environment more secure. Combining the finger print authentication along with conventional password authentication method will provide strong authentication. For providing good access control mechanism, the Shielding Server will classify the data into multiple levels like public, sharable and sensitive data, according to their sensitivity and impose strong access constraints for each level of data. Public data is stored as plain text and any registered user can be access it. Sharable and sensitive data are stored in an encrypted format so that only legitimate users who have the access right can decrypt the data. A novel access control mechanism based on biometric checksum block is introduced for providing privacy to the sharable data and the encryption key generated from the secret information supplied by the user will protect the sensitive data from unauthorized access...|$|E

The building is based on foundations made of plain concrete. Supporting, peripheral and partition walls are designed from ceramic blocks POROTHERM. Ceiling construction is designed to be assembled of ceramic ceiling fittings MIAKO stored on POT beams. External walls of all floors are insulated using an external ETICS with thermal insulation made of mineral wool, which is replaced by XPS polystyrene used for plinth. Part of the facade is designed as ventilated, consisting of trusses of wood and sheathed by cladding panels CEMBRIT METRO. This architecturally divide the building into separate units. The building includes parts of the administrative, residential parts and parts for business purposes.

Ellos Group is in the current situation Scandinavia’s largest ecommerce company and since 1997 owned by the French holding company Keering. This meant that Ellos became a part of Redcats Nordic along with brands such as La Redoute, Verbaudet, Daxon and others. 2010 started a project with the aim to develop a logistic model for these products. The result was the department Redmap on Ellos that would serve as both a hub and distribution channel for Northern Europe. The goal of Redmap was to increase the availability of goods for brands it the Redcats Group and minimize the lead time. Since startup, the department has shown poor productivity. Ellos Group has therefore requested a study aimed to identify problems in the department and find out suggestions for improvement that will increase productivity. The work has taken place at Ellos in Viared outside Borås. A status report has been developed and has, together with theory, been analyzed. Based on this strategy, several problems and deficiencies have been identified. For the purpose of improving the productivity two concrete suggestions was developed. The first improvement proposal suggests that the current KPIs need to be revised. In addition to this revision, the KPIs need to be used in a clever way along with their work monitoring and control. Improvement Proposal number 2 is about changing the picking methodology for two kinds of articles. These two should be treated as the same item type and should have a <b>common</b> <b>storage</b> <b>area.</b> It will also provide a structural change. For further support of this improvement proposal, a pilot project was implemented. In addition to the proposals, the authors provided Ellos Group with recommendations for further studies.

SAN are extended to a WAN infrastructure to offer easier sharing over multiple locations. This created a need for bandwidth which can be provided by the underlying optical transport network. In this paper, we propose a policybased lightpath signaling approach based on the OpenGrid architecture allowing SAN applications to dynamically establish and provision lightpaths over an optical network. 1 SAN Management Architecture The storage industry is undergoing a revolution. The emerging technologies such as the SAN promise both a single source of data and improved performance and availability. A SAN is a means to allow multiple servers to have direct access to <b>common</b> <b>storage</b> devices or storage pool. Today, SAN are deployed over a LAN infrastructure. The increasing need to share information across organizations led companies to extend the SAN over WAN. IETF and other organizations proposed different solution...|$|R
