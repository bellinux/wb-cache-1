25|$|For the {{endurance}} events, Brad Jones and Rickard Rydell (who {{was driving a}} Volvo 850 for TWR in the British Touring Car Championship) were earmarked to drive the second car. However, with Rydell’s wife due to give birth, he was replaced by Craig Lowndes for the Sandown 500. After finishing fifth and setting the fastest lap of the four drivers, HRT elected to retain Lowndes for the Bathurst 1000. Despite Lowndes crashing in the warm up and spinning mid race, a stellar double stint from Jones saw the <b>car</b> <b>finish</b> second. The lead car crashed late in the race.|$|E

5000|$|George Fonder (June 22, 1917 Elmhurst, Pennsylvania [...] - [...] June 14, 1958 Hatfield, Pennsylvania) was an American racecar driver. He made four Championship Car starts, {{including}} {{two in the}} Indianapolis 500 and drove as a relief driver in the 1954 Indianapolis 500 for two different teams after failing to qualify his own car. His best Champ <b>Car</b> <b>finish</b> was in the October 1949 race at Langhorne Speedway. He {{was killed in a}} midget-car racing accident.|$|E

50|$|As part {{of their}} deal with Chrysler, Dallara promised to provide three SP1s {{for use in the}} 2001 24 Hours of Le Mans. However, in {{preparation}} for their Le Mans debut, Chrysler used the new European Le Mans Series for an opportunity to test their new car in competition. Appearing at Donington Park, the Chrysler LMP managed to qualify in fourth place behind three Audi R8s. Mechanical problems, however, saw the <b>car</b> <b>finish</b> well down the order, nearly 40 laps behind the winning R8s.|$|E
50|$|Dalziel {{returned}} to the Champ Car World Series in 2007 as driver {{of one of the}} two Pacific Coast Motorsports cars. He was dropped by the team and replaced by Mario Domínguez in September 2007, with two races of the season remaining. His best Champ <b>Car</b> <b>finish</b> was 7th place in the Toronto Grand Prix, at the only track he raced a Champ Car at more than once. In 2008 he piloted SAMAX Motorsport's Riley-BMW Daytona Prototype alongside teammate Henri Zogaib. He also competed in the inaugural season of Superleague Formula.|$|E

50|$|Pastorelli {{made his}} debut at Grand Prix of Houston {{in the second}} race of the season, in Rocketsports' only entry. He {{qualified}} 16th of the 17 cars, and retired after 29 laps with a mechanical failure. His first finish, in 15th, came in the next race at Grand Prix of Monterrey, and in his first and only oval start at the Milwaukee Mile he finished 10th. His best Champ <b>Car</b> <b>finish</b> came in his final race in the series at the Grand Prix of Montreal. He was replaced for the final three races of the season by veteran Mario Domínguez.|$|E
50|$|The {{second car}} for the team {{was finally able to}} compete at Portland, and in a {{dominant}} performance the two cars swept the top spots. Although the next round would see one <b>car</b> <b>finish</b> in eighth, the other team car would manage to yet again take the race win. Only at the street race in San Antonio would the GTP ZX-Turbo's eight race win streak come to an end, with the lone entered car suffering electrical problems. The cars would return to winning form at Columbus, before the final round saw Nissan being defeated once again, with Derek Daly managing to bring one of the team cars home with a beast of only fourth.|$|E
50|$|The {{second half}} of the season would see Euro Racing keeping with their usual trend of having one <b>car</b> <b>finish,</b> while the second car would not. Donington Park would see a fire in the cockpit take out one of the T92/10s, while at Suzuka Circuit a Judd engine would fail. At the end of the season at Magny-Cours, Euro Racing's T92/10s would fail {{technical}} scrutineering and would not be allowed to participate. This would leave Euro Racing a distant fifth in the teams championship when the season came to a close. The World Sportscar Championship was dissolved at the end of 1992, and Euro Racing went bankrupt. The team's T92/10s were sold off to private hands for storage in collections.|$|E

50|$|Lap 56 saw Vettel make {{a slight}} mistake in Turn 1, and allowed Kubica {{to make a}} run down the outside, towards Turn 3. Vettel braked early and Kubica was ahead turning in. However, Vettel turned in and his front wing locked onto the sidepod of Kubica's BMW. Due to this collision, both cars lost their front wings, but they carried on towards Turns 4 and 5. Kubica was ahead, but without {{downforce}} he understeered off the circuit into the wall and out of the race. Meanwhile, Vettel also made an error on the way into the corner, sliding and hitting the wall, causing his left front tyre to bend back on itself. He carried on, as he was still in the points at this time. He could only continue on for just over a lap, as he ground to a halt between Turns 10 and 11. As the debris was not cleared up in time, this led to only the second safety <b>car</b> <b>finish</b> in Formula One.|$|E
5000|$|Shuman won the Turkey Night Grand Prix, a {{major event}} in the midget cars series, on eight {{different}} occasions from 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1987, 1992 and 1993. He won the Knoxville Nationals in 1979. He tried his hand at Championship Car racing in 1980 and finished in 11th place in his first race at Ontario Motor Speedway in April of that year. However, a month later he failed {{to qualify for the}} 1980 Indianapolis 500. In 1981, Shuman sided with USAC in their split with CART and Shuman entered in two dirt track races on USAC's [...] "Gold Crown" [...] Champ Car calendar, failing to qualify for one and finishing 15th in the other. The following season in 1982 Shuman notched his best Champ <b>Car</b> <b>finish</b> at the Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack with a 5th place and competed in two other dirt track Gold Crown races. He made another appearance in 1983 before the series ended. Shuman continued to race sprint cars during his foray into Champ Car and still makes occasional appearances in major sprint car events to this day.|$|E
5000|$|An {{accomplished}} Modified {{stock car}} racer, Gibson made his USAC Championship Car debut on in 1969 at the Milwaukee Mile. He competed in one other race {{that year and}} failed to qualify for two more. He was away from Championship Cars until 1976 {{when he returned to}} compete in 8 races, mostly on the large speedways and finished 23rd in the national championship. In 1977 Gibson attempted to qualify for 10 races and qualified for 7, the Indianapolis 500 being one of the races where he failed to make the field. Gibson registered his best Champ <b>Car</b> <b>finish</b> that year with a 4th-place finish at Mosport, his only road course start, backed up by 6th-place finishes at Texas and Trenton. [...] He finished a career-best 18th in the 1977 USAC Championship. In 1978 he made four starts on intermediate ovals with little success in his own Eagle-Offy. Gibson sided with USAC in the USAC-CART split of 1979 and competed in the first two races of the season at Ontario and Texas, but crashed in practice for the Indy 500, after which he retired from Champ Car competition.|$|E

50|$|Vettel {{continued}} to lead comfortably, two seconds ahead of Alonso and a further three ahead of Massa. However, {{he began to}} notieceably slow down during {{the latter part of}} the race due to a problem that was later identified within the team as a problem with a spark plug, and was quickly passed by the two Ferraris and Hamilton, and spent the rest of the race trying to hold Rosberg at bay. Alonso went on to win the race, joining Juan Manuel Fangio, Giancarlo Baghetti, Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell and Kimi Räikkönen as the only men to win for Ferrari on their debut. Massa finished second on his return to full-time racing after his injury at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. Hamilton completed the podium, while Vettel successfully fended Rosberg off long enough to salvage fourth. Schumacher followed his teammate home for sixth, with Button seventh, Webber eighth, Vitantonio Liuzzi placing ninth and Barrichello claiming the final point on offer. Kubica recovered from his first-corner spin to claim eleventh while Sébastien Buemi and Jarno Trulli also retired; Buemi's Toro Rosso was struck by electrical issues, while Trulli added his name to the growing list of drivers taken down by hydraulics issues. As they each retired having completed 46 laps, they were classified as finishers as they completed ninety percent of the winner's race distance. Heikki Kovalainen finished fifteenth in the second Lotus, meaning that Lotus became the only entrant of the new teams to have a <b>car</b> <b>finish</b> the race.|$|E
40|$|The {{horizontally}} polarizing surface {{parts of}} shiny black cars (the reflection-polarization characteristics {{of which are}} similar to those of water surfaces) attract water-leaving polarotactic insects. Thus, shiny black cars are typical sources of polarized light pollution endangering water-leaving insects. A new fashion fad is to make car-bodies matt black or grey. Since rough (matt) surfaces depolarize the reflected light, one of the ways of reducing polarized light pollution is to make matt the concerned surface. Consequently, matt black/grey cars may not induce polarized light pollution, which would be an advantageous feature for environmental protection. To test this idea, we performed field experiments with horizontal shiny and matt black car-body surfaces laid on the ground. Using imaging polarimetry, in multiple-choice field experiments we investigated the attractiveness of these test surfaces to various water-leaving polarotactic insects and obtained the following results: (i) The attractiveness of black car-bodies to polarotactic insects depends in complex manner on the surface roughness (shiny, matt) and species (mayflies, dolichopodids, tabanids). (ii) Non-expectedly, the matt dark grey <b>car</b> <b>finish</b> is much more attractive to mayflies (being endangered and protected in many countries) than matt black finish. (iii) The polarized light pollution of shiny black cars usually cannot be reduced with the use of matt painting. On the basis of these, our two novel findings are that (a) matt car-paints are highly polarization reflecting, and (b) these matt paints are not suitable to repel polarotactic insects. Hence, the recent technology used to make matt the car-bodies cannot eliminate or even can enhance the attractiveness of black/grey cars to water-leaving insects. Thus, changing shiny black car painting to matt one is a disadvantageous fashion fad concerning the reduction of polarized light pollution of black vehicles...|$|E
