500|$|Reviewers focus most {{frequently}} on the dynamic between Norrell and Strange, {{arguing that the}} novel is about their relationship. In her review for the Times Literary Supplement, Roz Kaveney writes that the two illustrate Harold Bloom's notion of the [...] "anxiety of influence" [...] in addition to romantic friendship. The two are a [...] "study in contrasts", with Norrell [...] "exceptionally learned but shy and fussy" [...] while Strange is [...] "charming, young, fashionable and romantic". As one reviewer remarks, [...] "Clarke <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> the book Sense and Sensibility if the title weren't already taken." ...|$|E
500|$|Team manager Gibbs {{reported}} {{that at the}} end of the first day's play the Australian dressing room was stunned into silence. Egar asked Benaud for permission to enter, and after the Australian captain allowed him in, the umpire sat quietly for a period before speaking to some other players and then to Meckiff. The pair were close friends, and shook hands before putting their arms around one another's shoulders. The condemned bowler did not take Egar's judgment personally and did not have hard feelings about the incident. Egar claimed to be [...] "the second most upset person in the world", and later added that he thought Meckiff's first ball was suspect. He said that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> more deliveries, but was worried whether the over would ever end.|$|E
500|$|On-court fights {{had been}} all too common in the 1970s, often {{including}} bench-clearing brawls. In the season opener, when Abdul-Jabbar punched Benson, no suspension had been levied. However, Washington's punch resulted in the league enacting strict penalties for on-court fights. Former NBA commissioner David Stern, then the NBA's chief counsel, later said that the incident made NBA officials realize that [...] "you couldn't allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other." [...] Currently, any player who throws a punch at another player—even if he misses—is automatically ejected from the game, and suspended for at least his team's next game. The league added a third referee to its game crew after the season; this referee would have trailed the play and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> a foul when Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts, thereby potentially stopping the play and preventing the melee that succeeded it.|$|E

500|$|At {{some point}} Constable West spoke to Bamber {{again on the}} telephone; Bamber {{apparently}} complained {{about the time the}} police were taking, saying: [...] "When my father rang he sounded terrified." [...] He was told to go to the farm and wait for the police. Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the night that he had not thought it would make a difference to how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. He acknowledged that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> one of the farm workers, but had not considered it. In his early witness statements, Bamber said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father's call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. He said he was confused about the sequence of events.|$|E
500|$|After Marker saw Manson's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes, {{the band}} {{invited her to}} Vig and Marker's Smart Studios to sing {{on a couple of}} songs, but after a [...] "dreadful" [...] first audition, she {{returned}} to Angelfish. Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second time, where she began to work on the then-skeletal [...] "Queer", [...] "Vow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Girl". Working on the lyrics, [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] became an [...] "anthem for a girl who won't settle for less than what she wants". Later she added, [...] " [...] really about squandering potential, [...] our version of Madonna's 'Express Yourself', but a little more subversive". Manson aimed the song as a rebuke towards a friend's foolish behaviour: [...] "A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society. It's just that women have a different set of problems from men... make the most of your potential." [...] Manson added that [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] was [...] "a song of reproach {{to a lot of people}} we know", both male and female, and that [...] "we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> it 'Stupid Guy,' but we thought another song about a strident female dissing a guy would be tedious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the bout Green {{labelled}} Briggs [...] "very unprofessional" [...] and [...] "disrespectful" [...] {{after he}} weighed-in [...] over the agreed-to [...] fight limit (Green weighed-in at [...] ). The cruiserweight weight limit is , however boxers {{are permitted to}} agree (as happened for the Green-Briggs bout) to meet a weight limit under the cruiserweight maximum. Based on the weight transgression, Green <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> the fight off, however he chose {{to continue with the}} bout. Briggs replied to the issue with [...] "I haven't done anything wrong today. I've trained hard, I've come here, I've made weight. Easy as that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 2009, Weiss {{created the}} title MaHaRaT for Sara Hurwitz. He wished he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> her a rabbi, stating [...] "She can do 95 {{percent of what}} other rabbis do". She was later titled [...] "Rabba", a {{feminine}} version of the word [...] "rabbi", despite female rabbis in other movements being called [...] "rabbi". This led to complaints from the RCA, which led to Weiss stating he would not name future graduates as [...] "rabba". Weiss subsequently resigned from the RCA. However, in 2015 Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by the Yeshivat Maharat, which Weiss founded. Also in 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained as Rabbi by that same organization, making her their first graduate to take the title Rabbi.|$|E

60|$|Now nobody <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> Polly bewitching. Her age {{must really}} have been quite thirty-five. I dislike {{dwelling}} on this topic, but she was short, dumpy, wore blue spectacles, a green umbrella, a red and black shawl, worsted mittens and uncompromising boots. She had also the ringlets and other attractions with which French Art adorns its ideal Englishwoman.|$|E
