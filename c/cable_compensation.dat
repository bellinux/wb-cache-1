5000|$|Mu-metal was {{developed}} by British scientists Willoughby S. Smith and Henry J. Garnett and patented in 1923 for inductive loading of submarine telegraph cables by The Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Co. Ltd. (now Telcon Metals Ltd.), a British firm that built the Atlantic undersea telegraph cables. The conductive seawater surrounding an undersea cable added a significant capacitance to the cable, causing distortion of the signal, which limited the bandwidth and slowed signaling speed to 10-12 words per minute. The bandwidth could be increased by adding inductance to compensate. This was first done by wrapping the conductors with a helical wrapping of metal tape or wire of high magnetic permeability, which confined the magnetic field. Telcon invented mu-metal to compete with permalloy, the first high-permeability alloy used for <b>cable</b> <b>compensation,</b> whose patent rights were held by competitor Western Electric. Mu-metal {{was developed}} by adding copper to permalloy to improve ductility. 50 miles of fine mu-metal wire were needed for each mile of cable, creating a great demand for the alloy. The first year of production Telcon was making 30 tons per week. In the 1930s this use for mu-metal declined, but by World War II many other uses {{were found in the}} electronics industry (particularly shielding for transformers and cathode ray tubes), as well as the fuzes inside magnetic mines. Telcon Metals Ltd. abandoned the trademark [...] "MUMETAL" [...] in 1985. The last listed owner of the mark [...] "MUMETAL" [...] is Magnetic Shield Corporation, Illinois.|$|E

Newly developed dispersion compensating fibres {{to be used}} for the <b>cabled</b> <b>compensation</b> of standard single mode fibres in a 1 : 3 to 1 : 1 length ratio are described. Dispersion managed systems based on the novel dispersion compensating fibres are optimised numerically for single channel as well as WDM transmission. Long distance transmission of 1. 8 and 4. 8 ps RZ 10 Gbit/s signals over a dispersion managed link made of standard single mode and inverse dispersion fibres is demonstrated experimentally together with the feasibility of 40 Gbit/s transmission over 600 km of the same dispersion map...|$|R

Nowadays the problem of fault location on distribution systems is receiving special attention {{mainly because of the}} power quality regulations.

In order to achieve a measurement accuracy of 2 % in radiation temperature absolute calibration of the individual channels was necessary and signal distortion through long transmission lines had to be compensated for as well. For fast signals the signal attenuation due to the long (50 m) cables amounted to {approx} 20 % {at} 100 MHz, which was corrected by a <b>cable</b> <b>compensation</b> in the frequency domain. The varying effects of cable distortion {{for a variety of}} signals between 1 ns and 9 ns in length were evaluated and corrections were applied.

40|$|Physical {{properties}} of materials and their constituents are interrelated. Though the basic structural unit involved also {{plays a role in}} deciding the properties, this can be manipulated to a certain extent, by carefully selecting the basic ingredients or by varying the composition. In order to tailor the {{properties of}} the materials according to the need, the relationship between the properties and the structure has to be established. Glasses, due to their inherent disorder, don’t have the privilege of using symmetry as enjoyed by their crystalline counterparts. Given their components and composition there is no immediate and easy way of predicting all the observed properties of glasses. This is not considering computer simulations and DFT calculations. Hence we go back to play with nature, i. e., do experiments. Technological applications like LASERs, optic fibers, photosensitive semiconducting thin films, solid state batteries for energy storage etc. have greatly increased the interest in the fundamental properties of disordered materials. Large coefficient of linear expansion of germanate glasses is made use in glass-to-metal seals for ultra high vacuum. More over, many germanate based glasses with specially tailored dispersion properties have been developed. GeO 2 based glasses are in fibre optics in the IR region of 1. 5 to 1. 8 microns. Borate glasses are resistant to thermal and chemical attack. They lower the melting temperature of glasses thus facilitating large scale production. Both borates and germanates have been worked upon extensively. Alkali boro germanate systems are interesting inherently. Borates and Germanates both are glass formers by themselves. The continuous random network formed by this base glass is modified by the presence of alkali ions. It is interesting to see to what extent the alkali ions can maintain the local charge neutrality in their neighborhood by creating non bridging oxygen atoms and how the presence of two formers is stabilizing the glass matrix. Present Work This thesis work is an attempt to understand the structure of alkali borogermanate glasses 25 R 2 O- 25 GeO 2 -(50 -x) B 2 O 3 -xNd 2 O 3 :(R=Li, Na, K and Rb; x= 0, 0. 5). A variety of experimental techniques are available to give a good insight of the structure of glass systems. In this thesis, we have carried out  Optical studies at room temperature to probe the environment of RE ion  AC conductivity at high temperature to probe the alkali ion dynamics  11 B MASS NMR of doped systems at room temperature to probe the Boron sites  Raman and Mid-IR experiments at room temperature to probe the various structural groups to get a comprehensive understanding of the structure of these glasses. To facilitate the analysis of the data and discussion of the results from these experiments, the thesis is divided in to four chapters excluding the introduction as categorized above and is presented accordingly. The second chapter begins with the preparation of the glass samples and their characterization. We have used Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), powder XRD and elemental analysis using ICP-OES for characterizing the sample. We have also measured the density and refractive index of the glasses under study. After this section, we describe the results from Optical Absorption and Photoluminescence studies. A brief description of Judd-Ofelt (JO) theory used for the analysis of the results is given. We have calculated the optical parameters and JO parameters and the energy levels of Nd ions in the glass matrix based on absorption studies using program written in Matlab. The procedure to calculate these parameters and their relevance in estimating the important quantities like radiative transfers, branching ratios are discussed. The effect of variation of the alkali ions on these properties is also discussed. In the third chapter, we have investigated AC conductivity in these glasses. These experiments are carried out both as a function of frequency (40 Hz - 15 MHz) and temperature (220 C – 500 C) using a home made portable furnace with a temperature controller. The <b>cable</b> <b>compensation</b> using open and short standards were done at the high temperature end. The data has been analyzed in Electric modulus (M*) formalism using Kohlrausch William Watts (KWW) function. The other basic models used in the literature like Debye, Cole-Cole, Cole Davidson and Havriliak Negami are briefly discussed. The frequency dependence of conductivity in these systems has been ascribed to the hopping motion of the alkali ions. Non-symmetric nature of the imaginary part of M* shows an evidence of non-exponential relaxation. Activation energies were estimated from the temperature variation of the KWW and DC. The fit parameters KWW and KWW shows interesting behavior. KWW in LGBNd and NGBNd show an initial increase with increasing temperature reaching a value of 1, while a contrasting behavior is observed in KGBNd and RGBNd. Barton-Nakajima-Namikawa (BNN) plot of the present study gives a value of 0. 67 and 0. 7 for the slope parameter p for doped and un-doped samples respectively. BNN plot is used to correlate the ac and dc conductivities in the sample. The deviation of the slope parameter from unity may be an indication of different charge carriers for ac and dc transport. Fourth Chapter describes the room temperature 11 B MASS NMR studies in Nd doped glass system. The relevant theory of Zeeman, Dipolar, Quadrupolar and Chemical shift interactions are discussed briefly before the results. The principle used in obtaining high resolution NMR in solids by means Sample spinning is also described. NMR line shape for the central transition (1 / 2  - 1 / 2) of I= 3 / 2 nuclei (11 B) was simulated in Mathematica and fitting was tried in Matlab. Using this background we have analyzed the line shape. In the next part, the results of 11 B MASS NMR experiments of doped glasses carried out using Bruker DSX 300 at 96. 3 MHz are presented. The fraction of contribution from four and three co-ordinated 11 B to NMR line-shape were identified and calculated. The results show unambiguously the presence of two 3 coordinated 11 B sites which were differentiated {{on the basis of the}} quadrupolar parameters. In the last chapter we discuss the results of Raman and Mid-IR investigations carried out in these glasses at room temperature. These two important techniques are well established in identifying the structural groups in glass systems. Raman bands observed in the range 200 cm- 1 to 1600 cm- 1 in these glasses are deconvoluted using gaussian peaks and they have been assigned to various modes of possible structural groups. Two broad MIR absorption bands were observed between 600 cm- 1 - 1600 cm- 1 in both doped and undoped glasses. Each band was resolved into gaussian peaks. The band shifts and the changes in the intensities are ascribed to the effects of variation of alkali, as the presence of GeO 2 (up to 25 mol%) is known not to affect the borate bands as it is a former by itself...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} of dynamics of elevator systems {{is important in}} addressing challenges {{in the design of}} elevators. This dissertation is dedicated to the methodologies and applications of the numerical {{simulation of}} the dynamics of elevator cable-car systems, pulley-cable systems, and traveling and <b>compensation</b> <b>cables.</b> A new spatial discretization and substructure method is developed to calculate the dynamic responses of one-dimensional systems, which consist of length-variant distributed-parameter components such as strings, rods, and beams, and lumped-parameter components such as point masses and rigid bodies. This methodology is used to study the longitudinal, transverse, and their coupled dynamics of moving elevator cable-car systems. There are complicated matching conditions between the cable and the car, which cannot be satisfied in traditional methods, but can be satisfied in the current method. Hence not only the displacements, but also the internal forces/moment, such as the axial force, the bending moment, and the shear force, which are related to the spatial derivatives of the longitudinal or transverse displacement, are accurately calculated. The longitudinal-transverse coupled vibrations of a moving cable-car system are also studied using this method, and the results are compared with those from the linear models. While the result from the linear model for the transverse vibration agrees well with that from the nonlinear coupled model, the axial force calculated from the linear model can significantly differ from that from the nonlinear model when the car approaches the top of the hoist way. It is found that a large slope in the transverse vibration can significantly increase the vibratory tension in the cable, and attenuate the safety of the system. These results can be explained by theoretical analysis and verified by the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. The methodology is also used in conjunction with a simple belt creep model to study the dynamics of pulley-cable systems. A nonlinear, planar model of a slack cable with bending stiffness and arbitrarily moving ends is developed, using the slope angle of the centroid line of the cable to describe the motion of the cable, and is applied to elevator traveling and <b>compensation</b> <b>cables.</b> It is found that a vertical motion of the car can introduce a horizontal vibration of a traveling or <b>compensation</b> <b>cable.</b> This model is more efficient than the finite element models as it uses a much smaller number of elements to reach the same accuracy. Moreover, based on the asymptotic analysis of this model, a computationally efficient, linear model is developed for calculating the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and dynamic responses of stationary elevator traveling and <b>compensation</b> <b>cables.</b> The linear cable model consists of two vertical cable segments connected by a half circular loop at the bottom. There is a good agreement between the predictions from the linear and nonlinear models and between the measured natural frequencies from a full-scale experiment and the corresponding calculated ones...|$|R

Attention is focused on "siphon" mixed lines (MLs) including long <b>cable</b> stretches. Shunt <b>compensation</b> requirements of such lines, based on steady-state operational constraints such as voltage jump at the supply node, open-end overvoltages and capacitive rating of line circuit breakers, are evaluated. Alternative locations of shunt reactors (SRs) at the cable stretch terminals or at the ML terminals are discussed and simple calculation procedures are proposed for both configurations. Numerical examples, based on planned or prospective long 400 kV- 50 Hz cable applications in Italy, are presented...|$|R

The hand brake operates separate shoes in the rear drums and may be adjusted {{from the top of}} the lever.

50|$|Elevators {{with more}} than 30 m of travel have a system called compensation. This is a {{separate}} set of cables or a chain attached {{to the bottom of}} the counterweight and the bottom of the elevator cab. This makes it easier to control the elevator, as it compensates for the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab. If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist-way, there is a short length of hoist cable above the car and a long length of compensating cable below the car and vice versa for the counterweight. If the <b>compensation</b> system uses <b>cables,</b> there will be an additional sheave in the pit below the elevator, to guide the <b>cables.</b> If the <b>compensation</b> system uses chains, the chain is guided by a bar mounted between the counterweight railway lines.|$|R
40|$|We {{critically}} {{analyze the}} results and claims in [P. -L. Liu, Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 901]. We show that the strong security leak appeared in the simulations is only an artifact and not caused by "multiple reflections". Since no wave modes exist at cable length of 5 % of the shortest wavelength of the signal, no wave is present to reflect it. In the high wave impedance limit, the conditions used in the simulations are heavily unphysical (requiring cable diameters up to 28000 {{times greater than the}} measured size of the known universe) and the results are modeling artifacts due to the unphysical values. At the low cable impedance limit. the observed artifacts are due to violating the recommended (and tested) conditions by neglecting the cable capacitance restrictions and using about 100 times longer cable than recommended without <b>cable</b> capacitance <b>compensation</b> arrangement. We implement and analyze the general circuitry of Liu's circulator [P. -L. Liu. Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 901] and confirm that they are conceptually secure against passive attacks. We introduce an asymmetric, more robust version without feedback loop. Then we crack all these systems by an active attack: a circulator-based man-in-the middle attack. Finally, we analyze the proposed method to increase security by dropping only high-risk bits. We point out the differences between different types of high-risk bits and show the shortage of this strategy for some simple key exchange protocols...|$|R
40|$|An active {{wide-band}} {{fiber optic}} frequency distribution system employing a thermally controlled phase compensator to stabilize phase variations induced by environmental temperature changes is described. The distribution system utilizes bidirectional dual wavelength transmission to provide optical feedback of induced phase variations of 100 MHz signals propagating along the distribution <b>cable.</b> The phase <b>compensation</b> considered differs from earlier narrow-band phase compensation designs {{in that it}} uses a thermally controlled fiber delay coil rather than a VCO or phase modulation to compensate for induced phase variations. Two advantages of the wide-band system over earlier designs are (1) that it provides phase compensation for all transmitted frequencies, and (2) the compensation is applied after the optical interface rather than electronically ahead of it as in earlier schemes. Experimental results on the first prototype shows that the thermal stabilizer reduces phase variations and Allan deviation {{by a factor of}} forty over an equivalent uncompensated fiber optic distribution system...|$|R
40|$|Signal Latency is the {{elapsed time}} between sending and {{receiving}} {{a message in}} an actionable form. Low latency is important whenever action on the message is time sensitive. Low latency becomes a critical design element for any network carrying such a message. Designers have several tools available to reduce latency. Optimizing the optical path is a key stratagem for designing a network for low latency. Network routing along as straight a path as possible minimizes the amount of latency caused by the optical path. Proper selection of passive optical components, such as optical <b>cable</b> and dispersion <b>compensation</b> technique, can further reduce network latency. Optical fiber with lower group index provides an advantage in low latency applications. One technique to lower group index is to design the fiber with a low group index silica core, without the germania that is commonly used in conventional optical fibers in service today. A fiber with lower group index will have lower latency that will be valuable in terrestrial and submarine low latency networks...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} future all-optical {{networks}} {{relies on the}} knowledge of the physical layer transport properties. In this thesis, we focus on two types of system impairments: those induced by the non-ideal transfer functions of optical filters to be found in network elements such as optical add-drop multiplexers (OADM) and optical cross-connects (OXC), as well as those due to the interaction of group-velocity dispersion, optical fibre non-linearities and accumulation of amplifier noise in the transmission path. The dispersion of fibre optics components is shown to limit their cascadability. Dispersion measurement techniques are first reviewed, and the limitations of the commonly used phase-shift technique is discussed. Additionally, an alternative method which enables the direct determination of small dispersion values in the pass-band of optical filters is proposed. Available optical filter technologies are compared with respect to their dispersive properties. The cascadability of fibre gratings is investigated numerically and experimentally. The conventional Gaussian apodisation profile is shown to result in unwanted dispersion in the pass-band, which will limit its cascadability to less than five devices when a channel spacing of 50 GHz is used at 10 Gbit/s. The use of narrow bandwidth modulation formats such as optical duobinary is suggested in order to improve the detuning tolerance of Gaussian apodised gratings. Alternatively, novel asymmetric apodisation profiles with multiple phase-shifts can be designed to provide reduced dispersion in the pass-band. Large detuning tolerances are demonstrated experimentally for a variety of modulation formats. A numerical optimisation of pass-band flattened phased-array (PHASAR) multiplexers is performed for use in high spectral efficiency metropolitan area networks at 40 Gbit/s. Even if conventional PHASARs are theoretically dispersion-less devices, the pass-band flattening process is shown to induce unwanted dispersion, which will ultimately limit the device cascadability. A PHASAR based on a parabolic horn input coupler is found to be the most promising design in order to maximise the spectral efficiency in a four add-drop node ring network. The concept of ``normalised transmission sections'' is introduced in order to ease the dimensioning of transparent domains in future all-optical networks. Normalised sections based on standard single-mode fibre (SMF) and dispersion compensating fibre (DCF) are optimised numerically with respect to the positioning of the DCF, the degree of compensation and the input powers to the two fibre types. Experimental validations are performed for 10 Gbit/s non return-to-zero (NRZ) and chirped return-to-zero (CRZ) modulation over 80 km pre-compensated spans. Passive pre-distortion at the transmitter is shown to significantly improve the reach of the systems. Based on the experimental results, transparent domains with a diameter of the order of 1000 km can be realised, thus demonstrating the applicability of the optimisation method to the design of large area networks. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems not only require compensation of the dispersion of the transmission fibre, but also of its dispersion slope. The effectiveness of early slope compensating DCFs for broadband compensation of SMF is demonstrated experimentally for 10 Gbit/s NRZ modulation. In particular, transmission in the L-band is achieved over more than 1000 km using a dispersion map optimised for the C-band, removing the need for separate band compensation. Novel DCFs enabling for the <b>cabled</b> <b>compensation</b> of the dispersion and dispersion slope of SMF (the so-called inverse dispersion fibres, IDF�n, where n is the SMF to DCF length ratio), are compared numerically. For NRZ modulation at 10 Gbit/s, IDF�l is found to maximise the transmission distance over 50 km spans for single channel, while being prone to cross-phase modulation in WDM systems where IDF� 2 or 3 should be preferred. The benefit of using short return-to-zero (RZ) pulses over conventional ??NRZ modulation in a SMF+IDF�l link is highlighted. Short pulses disperse faster in the transmission fibre, which is in turn beneficial in terms of optical signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in a twofold increase in transmission distance over NRZ for a 3 dB power penalty criterion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{deals with}} the {{computation}} of switching overvoltages in a 400 -kV XLPE cable system {{that has been in}} service for several years. A joint failure in that cable system and recorded voltage and current wave-forms by the protective equipment that showed significant temporary overvoltages in another cable route have been the reason to analyze the switching surges in this EHV <b>cable</b> with shunt <b>compensation.</b> The <b>cable</b> model set up has been verified by comparison of field measurements and the digital simulations at first step.

The overvoltages in the cable have been determined statis-tically by changing circuit-breaker pole closing times according to a distribution function in a statistical manner. It has been shown that in the latter case, 3), critical low-frequency overvoltages may occur, if the already energized cable will be switched off immediately by the malfunction of the protective equipment. Those overvoltages are re-lated closely to the inrush current of the shunt reactor at the moment of current interruption...|$|R
