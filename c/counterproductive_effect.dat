40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the multi-faceted role of {{language}} and language-sensitive recruitment processes in knowledge transfer in multinational corporations (MNCs). In particular, we develop a framework that helps to better understand how language-sensitive recruitment is related to competence, networks, identity and power. We started by conducting a qualitative interview-based study of 101 MNC subsidiaries. This analysis elucidates the productive and <b>counterproductive</b> <b>effects</b> of language-sensitive recruitment on knowledge transfer related to communication competence, networks, identity, and power. To further understanding of the productive and <b>counterproductive</b> <b>effects,</b> we conducted a quantitative study in 285 MNC subsidiaries. We found an inverted U-shaped relationship between language-sensitive recruitment and knowledge transfer. Together, these two studies provide {{a better understanding of}} the multifaceted and at times counterintuitive implications of language-sensitive recruitment on knowledge transfer in MNCs. By elucidating these effects, this paper contributes to the stream of research examining the role of language in MNCs and international business more generally. It also adds to research on MNC knowledge transfer that to date has focused little attention on language. By elaborating on the potential unintended consequences of language-sensitive recruitment, this paper also has implications on international human resource management research...|$|R
50|$|He goes on {{with this}} theory in a study {{published}} in La revue de droit fiscal: “ Everything is happening as if the tax rises had resulted in precautionary behaviour, a slowdown in consumption and a phenomenon of substituting consumption for basic necessities with lower VAT rates. Given the stuttering business activity, reduced overtime, the deteriorating and anxiety-filled environment, the assumption that we had identified in {{a study published in}} the Revue de Droit Fiscal in November 2012 seems to be borne out by tax revenue in 2013. In these circumstances, taxes on households, just like the 0.15% rise in employee pension contributions from 1 January 2014, or the rise in VAT to 20% will only hamper consumption and reduce public revenue a little more.”Despite a relative control over expenditure in 2013, the persistence of a very high public deficit (4.3%) was mainly due to an unprecedented and unexpected drop in tax revenue which confirms the existence of a tax tolerance threshold, specific to each country, and which may have been reached in France. Above this threshold, any tax increase has a <b>counterproductive</b> <b>effect</b> as compulsory taxes stifle activity by further weakening the economy’s growth potential.|$|E

The drafting history and the possible implications are analyzed. Questions covered include: Was the introduction of the distinction necessary in terms of clarification or was it primarily a lever to strengthen support for more powers to the European Parliament and the Commission? Could the distinction nurture false expectations of what the EU is, or could it undermine efforts at improving transparency and enforcement of subsidiarity? The paper concludes that the distinction probably has little real significance and no serious <b>counterproductive</b> <b>effects.</b> The drafting history and analysis illustrate the pitfalls of analogies to national constitutional orders and the complexity of simplification. ...|$|R

40|$|We analyze in {{this paper}} how various forms of State {{intervention}} can impact the microcredit market in developed countries. Using a simple model where entrepreneurs borrow without collateral, we study the effect of different policies on microfinance institutions' lending behavior. We first introduce state intervention through the loan guarantee and show that, not surprisingly, it increases the number of entrepreneurs receiving a loan. However, after modeling business development services provided by the microfinance institution, we show that the government loan guarantee can have a <b>counterproductive</b> <b>effect</b> by {{reducing the number of}} entrepreneurs benefiting from such services. We therefore analyze an alternative policy: the subsidization of business development services by the State.

Using a simple model where entrepreneurs receive individual uncollateralized loans, we show that, not surprisingly, state intervention through the loan guarantee increases the number of entrepreneurs receiving a loan.
