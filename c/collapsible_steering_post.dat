50|$|The <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column {{has been}} {{designed}} to protect the driver from injuries caused by striking the steering system in a crash. Consisting of two interlocking shafts, the <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column absorbs energy by collapsing inwards or breaking upon impact.|$|R
50|$|<b>Collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> columns {{were invented}} by Bela Barenyi and were {{introduced}} in the 1959 Mercedes-Benz W111 Fintail, along with crumple zones. This safety feature first appeared on cars built by General Motors after an extensive and very public lobbying campaign enacted by Ralph Nader. Ford started to install <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> columns in 1968.|$|R
50|$|The W221 also {{contains}} many other safety features, including {{front and rear}} crumple zones, eight dual-stage air bags, anti-lock brakes (ABS), <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column, and traction control.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reworked}} ZF {{recirculating ball}} steering was installed {{along with a}} redesigned [...] "safety" [...] steering wheel fixed {{to the end of}} a now <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column.|$|R
50|$|The {{steering}} wheels were rigid and mounted on non-collapsible steering columns. This arrangement increased {{the risk of}} impaling the driver {{in case of a}} severe crash. The first <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column was invented in 1934 but was never successfully marketed. By 1956, Ford came out with a safety steering wheel that was set high above the post with spokes that would flex, but the column was still rigid. In 1968, United States regulations (FMVSS Standard No. 204) were implemented concerning the acceptable rearward movement of the steering wheel in case of crash. <b>Collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> columns were required to meet that standard.|$|R
25|$|New {{this year}} was a dual master-cylinder braking system and {{optional}} front disc brakes along with Rally II wheels. Also new for 1967 was an energy-absorbing <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column. Plus, Pontiac added an 8-track Stereo tape player.|$|R
50|$|The {{globally}} certified {{safety features}} of this vehicle include crash protecting crumple zones, child lock, <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> and side intrusion beams. Also, the tubeless tires, voice assist system and remote locking / unlocking of the vehicle are the additional safety features.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965 Pontiac Parisienne {{differs from}} US Bonneville mainly by front grille, which {{was taken from}} US 1965 Pontiac Grand Prix.1967 brought new styling {{including}} new grills. [...] There were also new safety features, such as a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column and dual braking system.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{its more}} {{expensive}} brethren, the Kapitän was reworked in late 1967 and received rub strips, a new ZF <b>steering</b> and a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column. At the same time, a new HL (Hochleistung = high-performance) {{version of the}} 2.8 l-six became available that put out [...]|$|R
50|$|S-Max's {{also have}} an {{advanced}} neck protection system, three point seat belts, optimised pre-tensioners, load limiters, anti-submarining seat subframes, a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> system and safety pedals. For handling it has an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) along with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) and standard Electronic Stability Program (ESP) system.|$|R
50|$|Current REVAi and REVA L-ion models {{include several}} new safety {{features}} such as front disc brakes, a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column, and a much revised and reinforced chassis that has been successfully crash tested in India by ARAI. A 40 km/h frontal crash test video of the new model is available online.|$|R
50|$|Passive safety {{features}} include: crumple zones in 1957 (vehicle body structure absorbs {{the force of}} impact); <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column (prevents the steering column from protruding into the cabin during accidents), strengthened occupant cell enhanced occupant protection during severe impacts (rollovers); pre-accident seatbelt tensioning (tightens seatbelts prior to impact), and sandwich platforms (allows the engine to slide under the occupants in a head-on collision).|$|R
50|$|At its {{launch in}} 1972, the Square-body C/K-Series {{introduced}} two firsts in safety advancements concerning full-size pickups, and would later lead a third safety advancement in 1975. The {{first was the}} standard passenger-side sideview mirror, and the second was the energy-absorbing <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column. Patented by GM and already in use in its cars since 1967, the new energy-absorbing steering column was standard on all C-Series and K-Series models.|$|R
50|$|For the 1965 model year, the {{full-size}} Ford platform {{was given}} a redesign. To improve ride and handling, the rear leaf springs (a design unchanged since the 1949 Ford) were replaced by a three-link coil-spring design. To comply with federal safety mandates, in 1967 the full-size Fords were updated with a padded dashboard, recessed controls, <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column with padded steering wheel, and 3-point seatbelts; 1968 models gained side marker lights.|$|R
50|$|Tolerance {{rings are}} used {{in a number of}} {{mechanisms}} throughout the automotive powertrain and steering systems, as well as the car interior and exterior. Their torque limiting and overload capabilities allow them to be used as simple clutch devices in several applications, such as the automatic tailgate motor and the <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column. They are also used by automotive manufacturers to mount bearings in hinges and gears in the power train.|$|R
50|$|Tata Aria is a {{blending}} of an MPV, Sedan and an SUV. It comes with seating arrangement of three rows and {{features such as}} 3D surround sound, dimming roof lamps, in-dash built in GPS, infotainment system, multifunctional steering wheel, dual air conditioning with automatic climate control and cruise control whereas safety features include 6 airbags, ABS and ESP, the chassis frame comprising advanced hydro formed members, a stiffened body cage, and dual zone <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
50|$|In late 1967 (1968 model year), US-spec cars {{received}} several safety additions: a padded fascia (dashboard) with smaller main gauges, <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column, scissor-type hood hinges, a third windshield wiper, additional side marker lights, and anti-burst door latches. The rear axle gear ratio was increased from 4.22:1 to 3.9:1, giving 16.5 mph for every 1000 rpm. This increased {{final drive ratio}} gave the 1275 model slightly better fuel economy than the 1098 model.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle {{had many}} car safety-related {{features}}, novel at the time, some now routine. These features included seatbelts, a roll cage, a padded instrument panel, side-impact bars, and a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column. The {{placement of the}} spare tire under the front end served to absorb impacts. The most innovative safety feature, {{which has not been}} incorporated into other cars, was the ability to swivel the seats to face rearwards should a collision seem imminent.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 Dart, {{along with}} all other 1967 Chrysler products, got a new dual-circuit brake {{hydraulic}} system to ensure loss of pressure in the front brakes would not prevent the rear brakes from working, and vice versa. The system also incorporated a brake system fault telltale on the dashboard. Other changes to comply with new federal safety laws included <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> columns, additional padding on the dashboard and sunvisors. Shoulder belt anchors were also provided for front outboard occupants.|$|R
5000|$|Steering and {{suspension}} lay-outs {{were based}} on those from the Rekord C. The front suspension employed double wishbones of unequal length with an anti-roll bar, springs and shock-absorbers. The steering used a recirculating ball system and was controlled via a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column. At the back there was a live axle tamed with four trailing connector arms, a Panhard rod like system and an anti-roll bar, the wheels being sprung, as at the front, using [...] "progressive rate" [...] coil springs and shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|KUV {{standard}} {{features include}} dual front airbags {{for the safety}} of driver and co-driver, Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-Force Distribution (EBD) and front seat belt pretensioners which ensure the safety of all its occupants. The other safety features are <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column, child safety locks on rear doors, speed sensing automatic door locks, automatic hazard warning lamps on panic braking or bonnet opening, automatic hazard warning lamps on crash, anti-theft security alarm, anti-slip clips for driver side floor mat, ISOFIX child seat mount on rear seat.|$|R
50|$|The Brazilian car {{magazine}} Quatro Rodas {{tested the}} VW Brasília and the GM Chevette in March 1980, with the Chevette taking 19,7 seconds from 0 to 100 km/h and the Brasília taking 23 seconds. Chevette's maximum speed was 138 km/h while the Brasília could reach 129 km/h. Chevrolet achieved 15,4 km/L and the Volkswagen achieved 13,4 km/L on a mileage comparison. The Brasília {{was equipped with}} disc brakes on the front wheels, drum brakes on the rear wheels. Beginning with model year 1977, the Brasília featured dual circuit brakes and a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> wheel modified for collision safety.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, the {{precursor}} agency to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's first Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards took effect. These required shoulder belts for {{left and right}} front-seat vehicle occupants, side marker lights, <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> columns, and other safety features. 1969 saw the addition of head restraints for front outboard passengers, addressing the problem of whiplash in rear-end collisions. These safety requirements {{did not apply to}} vehicles classified as [...] "commercial," [...] such as light-duty pickup trucks. Thus manufacturers did not always include such hardware in these vehicles, even though many did passenger-car duty.|$|R
5000|$|It has a [...] "boost" [...] {{switch that}} gives 40% extra torque for {{improved}} acceleration and hill climbing {{and increases the}} top speed to 80 km/h. It weighs 665 kg, including 270 kg batteries. The nominal range is 80 km, but driving fast or using the heater or air conditioner reduces the range. To address the previous safety concerns, and in conjunction with Lotus Engineering, several new safety features have been added, such as front disc brakes, a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column, and a much revised and reinforced chassis that has been successfully crash tested at 40 km/h by ARAI in India.|$|R
25|$|One {{important}} {{research objective}} {{which could not}} be achieved with either cadavers or live humans was a means of reducing the injuries caused by impalement on the steering column. By 1964, over a million fatalities resulting from steering wheel impact had been recorded, a significant percentage of all fatalities; the introduction by General Motors in the early 1960s of the <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column cut the risk of steering-wheel death by fifty percent. The most commonly used animal subjects in cabin-collision studies were pigs, primarily because their internal structure is similar to a human's. Pigs can also be placed in a vehicle in a good approximation of a seated human.|$|R
40|$|The {{steering}} wheel {{is the important}} cause of fatal injury for drivers in frontal collision. When frontal collision occurs, due to the kinetic energy of driver or occupant body, it moves forward against {{steering wheel}} and wind shield. Actually in a frontal collision forces will be first transmitted through driver’s feet which act as fulcrum so the body will rotate about it. For the taller driver steering works as fulcrum. Driver head & chest hit the steering or windshield which may cause severe injury or death. Considering the injury potential of steering wheel we are presenting a new idea Pneumatic <b>Collapsible</b> <b>Steering</b> Column (PCS) ...|$|R

50|$|Passive safety - {{protection}} of the driver and passengers {{in the event of}} a collision - was being pushed up the agenda in Germany at this time by Mercedes, while internationally some of the same themes were being pursued with evangelical effect by a future candidate for the US presidency called Ralph Nader. Other German and American auto-makers were responding as safety came to the fore as a selling feature. In place of the painted dashboard of the Rekord B, the Rekord C confronted the driver with a padded dashboard and a telescopically <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column. Furthermore, customers prepared to pay extra could now specify seats belts and head restraints.|$|R
40|$|<b>Collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column {{designs are}} {{credited}} with saving tens-of-thousands of lives since their introduction {{in the late}} 1960 `s. The <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column is a safety feature designed to absorb energy and protect-the driver in a head-on collision. One {{of the most frequently}} used design concepts employs two telescoping metal tubes that slide over one another as the occupant impacts the steering wheel. Hardened steel ball bearings are embedded in a plastic sleeve located between the two tubes. There are two primary mechanisms for energy absorption during steering column collapse. One is the friction between the bearing and tube surfaces. Another is the gouging of the tubes` surfaces by the bearings. Current analytical models are unable to adequately capture the physics behind this process. In this paper we will present an overview of a parallel finite element code, currently under development, {{that can be used to}} simulate the highly nonlinear response of this energy absorbing mechanism. Our parallel algorithms are constructed on a message-passing foundation. The actual message-passing implementation used was the Argonne-developed p 4 package. However, other message-passing libraries can easily be accommodated as they are largely identical in function and differ only in syntax. Once the algorithm is restructured as a set of processes communicating through messages, the program can run on systems as diverse as a uniprocessor workstation, multiprocessors with and without shared memory, a group of workstations that communicate over a local network, or any combination of the above. Benchmarks of the parallel code performance on networks of workstations and the IBM SP 1 parallel supercomputer will be discussed...|$|R
25|$|The {{bodies are}} {{built around a}} control chassis, {{featuring}} a full roll cage, originally designed by PACE Innovations but which can be made, or partially made, by other accredited builders, including certain race teams. Many safety features are utilised to protect the driver {{in the event of}} a crash. The fuel tank is positioned in front of the rear axle to prevent it from being damaged or ruptured in a rear end impact. The driver is seated towards the centre of the car and extra reinforcement is used on the roll cage on the driver's side to lessen the risk of injury in a side-on collision. The cars also feature a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column and a fire extinguisher system.|$|R
50|$|For safety reasons {{all modern}} cars feature a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column (energy {{absorbing}} steering column) which will {{collapse in the}} event of a heavy frontal impact to avoid excessive injuries to the driver. Airbags are also generally fitted as standard. Non-collapsible steering columns fitted to older vehicles very often impaled drivers in frontal crashes, particularly when the steering box or rack was mounted in front of the front axle line, at the front of the crumple zone. This was particularly a problem on vehicles that had a rigid separate chassis frame, with no crumple zone. Most modern vehicle steering boxes/racks are mounted behind the front axle on the front bulkhead, at the rear of the front crumple zone.|$|R
50|$|A common {{device to}} enhance car safety is the <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column. This is {{designed}} to collapse {{in the event of}} a collision to protect the driver from harm. The column can collapse after impact with a tolerance ring inserted between the inner shaft of the steering column and the external housing. The wavelike protrusions on the circumference of the tolerance ring act as a spring to hold the two parts in place in normal driving conditions. At a specific level of force, for example {{in the event of a}} collision, the tolerance ring allows the inner shaft to slip inside the housing, so the column can collapse, absorbing energy from the impact.|$|R

50|$|In 1970, the Australian {{version of}} the Hunter was face-lifted again, with the {{introduction}} of the HE series. Marketing of the car, plus its rear badges, referred to it as the Hunter, rather than a Hillman. The facelift involved a change to the radiator grille, with new and smaller rectangular headlights. Also, the appearance of the rear of the car was changed with a flush trim panel under the boot lid and new twin-lens tail lights. Depending on the model, this panel was painted in the body colour, matte grey or matte black (Hustler Model); this facelift was unique to Australia. Inside, the HE models received a new <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column, with the Valiant's steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|The most {{conventional}} steering {{arrangement is}} to turn the front wheels using a hand-operated steering wheel which is positioned {{in front of the}} driver, via the steering column, which may contain universal joints (which may also be part of the <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column design), to allow it to deviate somewhat from a straight line. Other arrangements are sometimes found on different types of vehicles, for example, a tiller or rear-wheel steering. Tracked vehicles such as bulldozers and tanks usually employ differential steering — that is, the tracks are made to move at different speeds or even in opposite directions, using clutches and brakes, to bring about a change of course or direction.|$|R
5000|$|From {{chassis number}} 04.10 474, on 6 May 1969, the new Type 353-1 engine with [...] was introduced. In 1970 round {{instruments}} replaced the earlier [...] "bathroom scale" [...] type, and in 1972 bucket seats replaced the earlier types. Also in 1972, an optional floor shifter was introduced, {{but it did}} not function very well and saw limited sales. and Since 3 March 3 1975 (from chassis number 10.06 948) the vehicle became the Wartburg 353 W. First shown in 1974, the 353 W received front disc brakes (of Czech manufacture) and many other safety changes such as rollbelts, a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> column, and dual circuit hydraulic brakes. The body remained unchanged.|$|R
