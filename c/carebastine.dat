40|$|Ebastine is an H 1 -receptor {{antagonist}} with {{a relative}} lack of sedating properties. It is almost completely converted to <b>carebastine,</b> {{and it is this}} metabolite which is responsible for the antihistaminic effect. Twelve healthy subjects received a single 20 mg dose of ebastine on day 2 of a multiple oral dosing regimen of either cimetidine (400 mg three times daily and 800 mg in the evening on the day preceding ebastine administration and 400 mg four times daily on the 2 following days) or placebo in a randomised cross-over design. Significant plasma concentrations of ebastine were not detected after either treatment. The AUC of <b>carebastine</b> was not affected by cimetidine coadministration (4049 +/- 985 ng ml- 1 h after cimetidine vs 3795 +/- 959 ng ml- 1 h after placebo; 95 % confidence interval of the difference: - 412 to 919). Cimetidine coadministration did not induce any effect of ebastine on blood pressure and heart rate or cause sedation...|$|E
40|$|Background: CC chemokines {{have been}} shown to play an {{important}} role in inducing selective recruitment of inflammatory cells into local allergic inflammatory sites. CC chemokines are also known as histamine releasing factors. We previously showed that histamine enhances transcription of CC chemokines from nasal mucosa which leads to further induction of histamine release. This cyclic cascade may cause prolonged allergic inflam-mation. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between histamine and CC chemokine production by using human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) and to examine the potential of H 1 receptor (H 1 R) antagonists in new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of nasal allergy. Methods: HNECs were isolated from the nasal turbinates of patients diagnosed with nasal allergy. HNEC monolayers were cultured for 48 hours with or without histamine (10 − 3 to 10 − 5 molL). Furthermore, an H 1 R an-tagonist, either <b>carebastine</b> or olopatadine, was added to the supernatant (10 − 3 to 10 − 7 molL) 30 minutes be-fore incubation with histamine. The expression of Regulated on Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Se-creted (RANTES) and monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) in the culture media were measured by ELISA. Results: The release of RANTES and MCP- 1 was significantly upregulated by histamine compared with the control group. Both <b>carebastine</b> and olopatadine inhibited the release of CC chemokine production to the con-trol level in both groups. Conclusions: This study suggests that the interaction between histamine and CC chemokines may prolong allergic inflammation in human nasal mucosa. We also demonstrate the potential use of H 1 R antagonists in new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of nasal allergy through inhibiting this histamine-CC chemokine interaction.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ebastine}} and terfenadine, long-acting nonsedating histamine H 1 receptor antagonists, were studied on hKv 1. 5 channels using the whole-cell voltage-clamp {{configuration of the}} patch-clamp technique in Ltk- cells transfected with the gene encoding the hKv 1. 5 channel. Upon depolarization to + 60 mV, terfenadine, 1 μM and 3 μM, inhibited the hKv 1. 5 current by 42. 4 ± 6. 4 % and 69. 3 ± 4. 2 % (P < 0. 01). In contrast, at the same range of concentrations, ebastine-induced inhibition of this K+ current averaged 6. 5 ± 2. 0 % and 13. 0 ± 2. 0 (P < 0. 05). At the highest concentration tested (3 μM) neither terfenadine carboxylate nor <b>carebastine</b> significantly modified hKv 1. 5 current. All {{these results suggest that}} ebastine could represent a safer alternative to terfenadine in the clinical practice. This work was supported by FIS 95 / 0318 to C.
