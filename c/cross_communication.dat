50|$|To {{ensure the}} {{determinism}} required, most real-time Ethernet standards enforce a master-to-slave-only method of communications. This can {{conflict with the}} need for a node in the system to exchange data efficiently with a node other than the network master. The conventional method to achieve this in a master-slave network is to pass data from one slave node to the master, where it is reissued to one or more different slaves. For example, if several servo drives on a network are to be synchronized to a signal from another drive on the network, the master must fetch the signal from this drive and reissue it to all other drives on the network. Disadvantages to this method are that delays are induced due to the multiple cycles required, and the master’s processing load is increased as it must actively participate in the function, although it contributes nothing. Since no data is destroyed in a Sercos III telegram, data to and from any slave can be accessed by another node on the network without any additional cycle delay or master intervention. Additionally, as telegrams pass each node twice in a cycle (for both topology types), a node can even have the opportunity to access data supplied by a subsequent node. Two peer communication methods are defined in the Sercos III specification: Controller to Controller (C2C) for multiple masters to communicate with one another, and <b>Cross</b> <b>Communication</b> (CC) for multiple slaves.|$|E

In the same period, she began to be an activist in the Italian Socialist Party. From 1977 to 1997 she was director of the local FIOM Milan, with some interruptions due to working with other union categories. She then moved to the regional FIOM in Lombardy, and finally to the national secretariat of the same metalworkers' union CGIL, with expertise in the automotive sector and steel production. She went on to assume the regional secretariat of FLAI, the agro-industry sector union CGIL and in 2001 was elected general secretary of the CGIL in Lombardy. In 2008, Camusso entered the national Confederal Secretary of the CGIL, with responsibility for very different industries: policies of the productive sectors, cooperation, trade and agriculture.

This research uses a descriptive qualitative research design. The data sources of the research are the script and original VCDs of Crash. It is applied three triangulation methods to check and establish validity in the research i. e. data triangulation, theory triangulation, and investigator triangulation. The findings of this research show that there are 68 data from 175 <b>cross</b> cultural <b>communication</b> style choice phenomena uttered by the characters in Crash. For the style it is divided into nine forms from four types (Direct-Indirect Type, Elaborate-Exacting-Succinct Type, Personal-Contextual Type and Instrumental- Affective Type) i. e. Direct Style, Indirect Style, Elaborate Style, Exacting Style, Succinct Style, Personal Style, Contextual Style, Instrumental Style and Affective Style. For the strategy it is divided into 18 points, i. e. overt expression and assert self face needs, Saving face and implicit/ambiguous, flashy and embellished language, not less or more than it is needed, concise statement, understatement and silence, first personal pronoun and informal, personal pronoun and formal, sender based and goal outcome based and receiver oriented and process oriented. The data shows that the White people tend to use Direct, Elaborate, Personal, and Instrumental Style. The Black people use Indirect, Elaborate, Personal and Affective Style. Hispanic people tend to use an Indirect, Elaborate, Personal and Affective Style. Asian people use Indirect, Elaborate, Contextual and Instrumental Style. While Arabian use Direct, Exacting, Personal and Instrumental Style. For the most often occurs strategy are overt expression, implicit/ambiguous, flashy and embellished language, not less or more than it is needed, concise statement, first person pronoun, personal pronoun, influence/persuade, and receiver oriented strategy.

40|$|We {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} colloidal crystal arrangements of monodisperse droplets or shells of planar-aligned cholesteric liquid crystal exhibit intricate patterns of circularly polarized reflection spots of different colors. The spots {{appear as a}} result of photonic <b>cross</b> <b>communication</b> between droplets, hence the patterns reflect the macroscopic arrangement of droplets or shells. Apart from being an interesting optical phenomenon, it offers attractive application opportunities in photonics and beyond, due to the unique characteristics of the patterns. It turns out that the optical quality of shells is much enhanced compared to that of droplets, hence we focus our attention primarily on shells, of varying thickness. Here we analyze and explain the intriguing textures arising when studying planar-aligned short-pitch cholesteric shells in transmission polarizing optical microscopy. In this case, the texture reflects the properties of each individual shell, without any sign of <b>cross</b> <b>communication,</b> yet also this pattern holds some fascinating mysteries. These can only be elucidated by considering all the peculiar optical properties of cholesterics together, as well as the unusual situation given by the spherical shell geometry...|$|E

40|$|Ataxia telangiestasia {{mutated protein}} (ATM) {{is the major}} kinase that initiates the DNA damage signal {{transduction}} response following exposure to ionising radiation (IR) in mammalian cells. DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) {{is the most significant}} double strand break (DSB) repair pathway in mammalian cells. ATM-defective cell lines display cell cycle checkpoint defects and show pronounced radiosensitivity. ATM signalling was previously thought to be dispensable for NHEJ. This review discusses recent findings that ATM activates an end-processing mechanism dependent upon Artemis, a nuclease that also functions to cleave the hairpin intermediate generated during V(D) J recombination. ATM/Artemis-dependent end-processing is required for the repair of a sub-fraction (approximately 10 %) of DSBs induced by IR and makes a significant contribution to survival following exposure to ionising radiation. This result represents a new role for ATM and demonstrates a novel <b>cross</b> <b>communication</b> between the DNA repair and signal transduction machinery...|$|E
