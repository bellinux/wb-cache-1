25|$|HVAC {{use of a}} <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> pairs the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> with a {{water-cooled}} chiller or water-cooled condenser. A ton of air-conditioning {{is defined}} as the removal of 12,000 BTU/hour (3500 W). The equivalent ton on the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> side actually rejects about 15,000 BTU/hour (4400 W) due to the additional waste heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller's compressor. This equivalent ton {{is defined as the}} heat rejection in cooling 3 US gallons/minute (1,500 pound/hour) of water 10°F (6°C), which amounts to 15,000 BTU/hour, assuming a chiller coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.0. This COP is equivalent to an energy efficiency ratio (EER) of 14.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>towers</b> are {{structures}} for cooling water or other heat transfer media to near-ambient wet-bulb temperature. Wet <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> {{operate on the}} evaporative cooling principle, but are optimized to cool the water rather than the air. <b>Cooling</b> <b>towers</b> can often be found on large buildings or on industrial sites. They transfer heat to the environment from chillers, industrial processes, or the Rankine power cycle, for example.|$|R
2500|$|Hyperboloid (sometimes {{incorrectly}} {{known as}} hyperbolic) <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> {{have become the}} design standard for all natural-draft <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> because of their structural strength and minimum usage of material. The hyperboloid shape also aids in accelerating the upward convective air flow, improving cooling efficiency. [...] These designs are popularly associated with nuclear power plants. [...] However, this association is misleading, as {{the same kind of}} <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> are often used at large coal-fired power plants as well. Conversely, not all nuclear power plants have <b>cooling</b> <b>towers,</b> [...] and some instead cool their heat exchangers with lake, river or ocean water.|$|R
2500|$|Being {{very large}} structures, <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> are {{susceptible}} to wind damage, and several spectacular failures {{have occurred in the}} past. At Ferrybridge power station on 1 November 1965, the station was the site of a major structural failure, when three of the <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> collapsed owing to vibrations in [...] winds. Although the structures had been built to withstand higher wind speeds, the shape of the <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> caused westerly winds to be funnelled into the towers themselves, creating a vortex. Three out of the original eight <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> were destroyed, and the remaining five were severely damaged. The towers were later rebuilt and all eight <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> were strengthened to tolerate adverse weather conditions. Building codes were changed to include improved structural support, and wind tunnel tests were introduced to check tower structures and configuration.|$|R
25|$|A {{typical field}} erected <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> has a {{pultruded}} fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) structure, FRP cladding, a mechanical unit for air draft, drift eliminator, and fill.|$|E
25|$|The {{condenser}} generally uses either circulating {{cooling water}} from a <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> to reject waste heat to the atmosphere, or once-through {{water from a}} river, lake or ocean.|$|E
25|$|Quantitatively, the {{material}} balance around a wet, evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> system {{is governed by}} the operational variables of make-up volumetric flow rate, evaporation and windage losses, draw-off rate, and the concentration cycles.|$|E
25|$|When wet <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> with {{seawater}} make-up {{are installed}} in various industries located {{in or near}} coastal areas, the drift of fine droplets emitted from the <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> contain nearly 6% sodium chloride which deposits on the nearby land areas. This deposition of sodium salts on the nearby agriculture/vegetative lands can convert them into sodic saline or sodic alkaline soils depending {{on the nature of}} the soil and enhance the sodicity of ground and surface water. The salt deposition problem from such <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> aggravates where national pollution control standards are not imposed or not implemented to minimize the drift emissions from wet <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> using seawater make-up.|$|R
50|$|Work {{began at}} the site in 1962 and was {{completed}} by 1968. On 1 November 1965, three of the <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> collapsed due to vibrations in 85 mph winds. Although the structures had been built to withstand higher wind speeds, the design only considered average wind speeds over one minute and neglected shorter gusts. Furthermore, the grouped shape of the <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> meant that westerly winds were funnelled into the towers themselves, creating a vortex. Three out of the original eight <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> were destroyed and the remaining five were severely damaged. The towers were rebuilt and all eight <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> were strengthened to tolerate adverse weather conditions.|$|R
25|$|Zero bleed for <b>cooling</b> <b>towers,</b> {{also called}} zero {{blow-down}} for <b>cooling</b> <b>towers,</b> {{is a process}} for significantly reducing the need for bleeding water with residual solids from the system by enabling the water to hold more solids in solution.|$|R
25|$|Since higher {{cycles of}} {{concentration}} represent less make-up water, water conservation efforts may focus on increasing cycles of concentration. Highly treated recycled water {{may be an}} effective means of reducing <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> consumption of potable water, in regions where potable water is scarce.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{governmental}} agencies, <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> manufacturers, {{and industrial}} trade organizations have developed design and maintenance guidelines for preventing or controlling {{the growth of}} Legionella in cooling towers. However, in the US, there are no regulations requiring testing or maintaining any specified levels in these facilities.|$|E
25|$|In a wet <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> (or {{open circuit}} <b>cooling</b> <b>tower),</b> {{the warm water}} can be cooled to a {{temperature}} lower than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature, if the air is relatively dry (see dew point and psychrometrics). As ambient air is drawn past a flow of water, {{a small portion of}} the water evaporates, and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water, thus reducing its temperature. Approximately 970 BTU of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water (2 MJ/kg). Evaporation results in saturated air conditions, lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to wet-bulb temperature, which is lower than the ambient dry-bulb temperature, the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for computing the noise {{levels in the}} vicinity of natural- draft <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> is presented. The noise levels are computed in overall and octave band levels with A-weighting and with no weighting. Attenuation of the noise by wave spreading, atmospheric absorption, barrier screening, vegetation, and wind and temperature gradients are included. The procedure is applied to a nuclear power plant served by four <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> and to a nuclear energy center with forty <b>cooling</b> <b>towers.</b> (auth...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{source of}} man made sodium salts {{addition}} to the agriculture fields / land mass is {{in the vicinity of}} the wet <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> using sea water to dissipate waste heat generated in various industries located near the sea coast. Huge capacity <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> are installed in oil refineries, petrochemical complexes, fertilizer plants, chemical plants, nuclear & thermal power stations, centralized HVAC systems, etc. The drift / fine droplets emitted from the <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> contain nearly 6% sodium chloride which would deposit on the vicinity areas. This problem aggravates where the national pollution control norms are not imposed or not implemented to minimize the drift emissions to the best industrial norm for the sea water based wet <b>cooling</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|R
500|$|The station {{would have}} {{featured}} six [...] high <b>cooling</b> <b>towers.</b> It {{was said that}} there would be provision to prevent excessive amounts of steam leaving the <b>cooling</b> <b>towers,</b> with no haze coming from the towers on 95% of days of the year.|$|R
25|$|Blow-out — Water {{droplets}} {{blown out}} of the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> by wind, generally at the air inlet openings. Water may also be lost, {{in the absence of}} wind, through splashing or misting. Devices such as wind screens, louvers, splash deflectors and water diverters are used to limit these losses.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{treating}} the circulating cooling water in large industrial <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> systems to minimize scaling and fouling, the water should be filtered to remove particulates, and also be dosed with biocides and algaecides to prevent growths that could {{interfere with the}} continuous flow of the water. Under certain conditions, a biofilm of micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water, and can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower.</b> Biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using chlorine or other chemicals. A normal industrial practice is to use two biocides, such as oxidizing and non-oxidizing types to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack. In most cases, a continual low level oxidizing biocide is used, then alternating to a periodic shock dose of non-oxidizing biocides.|$|E
25|$|Noise — Sound energy {{emitted by}} a <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> and heard (recorded) {{at a given}} {{distance}} and direction. The sound is generated by the impact of falling water, by the movement of air by fans, the fan blades moving in the structure, vibration of the structure, and the motors, gearboxes or drive belts.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{seawater}} in <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> {{for industrial}} applications has much merit in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries {{due to the}} scarcity and availability of fresh water. Seawater make-up in <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> is deemed the most feasible because of its unlimited supply in coastal areas. Such latent-heat removal with seawater in <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> is several folds more efficient than sensible heat extraction via heat exchangers. Operational challenges such as scaling, corrosion, and biofouling are a major challenge in conventional <b>cooling</b> <b>towers,</b> where the latter is also {{a major issue in}} seawater <b>cooling</b> <b>towers.</b> Biofouling can significantly hamper the efficiency of <b>cooling</b> <b>towers.</b> The most popular methods used in cooling treatment to control biofouling are disinfection by chlorination. However, the disadvantages of chlorination are formation of harmful disinfection byproducts in the presence of high organic loading and safety concerns in the storage of chlorine gas. In this study, the research focuses on biofouling control in seawater <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> by investigating two different approaches. The first strategy addresses the use of alternative oxidants (i. e. ozone micro-bubbles and chlorine dioxide) in treatment of <b>cooling</b> <b>towers.</b> The second strategy investigates removing nutrients in seawater using granular activated carbon filter column and ultrafiltration to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Laboratory bench-scale tests in terms of temperature, cycle of concentration, dosage, etc. indicated that, at lower oxidant dosages (total residual oxidant (TRO) equivalent = 0. 1 mg/l Cl 2), chlorine dioxide had a better disinfection effect than chlorine and ozone. The performance of oxidizing biocides at pilot scale, operating at assorted conditions, showed that for the disinfectants tested, ozone could remove 95...|$|R

25|$|The {{cooling water}} used to {{condense}} the steam in the condenser returns to its source without having been changed other than having been warmed. If the water returns {{to a local}} water body (rather than a circulating <b>cooling</b> <b>tower),</b> it is often tempered with cool 'raw' water to prevent thermal shock when discharged into that body of water.|$|E
