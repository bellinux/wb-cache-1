40|$|A winch system {{provides}} {{a method for}} launch and recovery capabilities for kites and tethered blimps or balloons. Low power consumption is a key objective, as well as low weight for portability. This is accomplished by decoupling the tether-line storage and wind ing/ unwinding functions, and providing tailored and efficient mechanisms for each. The components of this system include rotational power input devices such as electric motors or other apparatus, line winding/unwinding reel(s), line storage reel(s), and independent drive trains. Power {{is applied to the}} wind/unwind reels to transport the tether line. Power is also applied to a line storage reel, from either the wind/unwind power source, the wind/unwind reel itself, or separate power source. The speeds of the two reels are synchronized, but not dependent on each other. This is accomplished via <b>clutch</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> variable transmissions, or independent motor controls.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Touch-and-Go (TAG) concept for {{enabling}} a spacecraft {{to take a}} sample {{from the surface of}} a small primitive body, such as an asteroid or comet. The idea behind the TAG concept is to let the spacecraft descend to the surface, make contact with the surface for several seconds, and then ascend to a safe location. Sampling would be accomplished by an end-effector that is active during the few seconds of surface contact. The TAG event {{is one of the most}} critical events in a primitive body sample-return mission. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a representative spacecraft during the TAG event, i. e., immediately prior, during, and after surface contact of the sampler. The study evaluates the sample-collection performance of the proposed sampling end-effector, in this case a brushwheel sampler, while acquiring material from the surface during the contact. A main result of the study is a guidance and control (G&C) validation of the overall TAG concept, in addition to specific contributions to demonstrating the effectiveness of using nonlinear <b>clutch</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the sampling arm joints, and increasing the length of the sampling arms to improve robustness...|$|R
5000|$|Founded in 1902, the Bat Motor Manufacturing Co. Ltd {{was named}} after founder Samuel Robert Batson. Based in Penge, the first Bat {{motorcycle}} used a small [...] de Dion engine but poor sales led to Batson selling the company to Theodore Tessier in 1904. [...] Nicknamed 'Best After Tests,' two Bat motorcycles were entered in the 1907 Isle of Man TT races. The company produced the first sprung frame in 1906 and in 1908 developed {{one of the first}} sidecar outfits, with two powered wheels on a removable sidecar. [...] Tessier was also an innovator and keen to develop motorcycling technology. Significant innovations included one of the first practical <b>clutch</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and he also patented one of the first motorcycle full suspension systems, with a leading link front fork and a subframe suspended on springs from the main frame. To raise awareness of the motorcycles, Tessier began serious competitive racing and achieved over 200 wins, setting numerous speed records. Bat also developed twin-cylinder motorcycles in 1912 and managed seventh place in the 1913 Senior TT. Production ended with the outbreak of the First World War but restarted in 1919. They took over Martinsyde Motorcycles in 1923 but financial difficulties led to the closure of the Bat-Martinsyde company in 1926.|$|R

40|$|This report {{covers the}} {{development}} of a new joint mechanism and a robotic simulator. These are intended to be used in the further development of a climbing robot that has been previously worked on. The climbing robot is briefly described in this report. It is a robot with four arms that each has 6 joints with 1 degree of freedom each. At the end of each arm is a gripper that will serve as the robots main tool of interaction with its immediate environment, for instance a ladder the robot is climbing in. The weight of this robot is estimated and used to find torque requirements on the new joint mechanism. A lightweight joint mechanism is of interest not only for a climbing robot, but for many if not all other kinds of robots as well. Such a joint will not need to be as strong as its heavier counterparts, as less power is required to support the joint itself. The new joint mechanism is an attempt of creating a joint that is lighter than traditional joints. The main idea is to have a single powerful actuator driving several joints. The joints are mechanically powered by a rotating shaft that runs through all of them. Each joint uses a <b>clutching</b> <b>mechanism</b> to connect to the shaft and thus transfer torque. the <b>clutching</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been explored in detail, and a suitable clutch has been selected. This clutch is then used in four design proposals. The last of these proposals is assembled into a prototype, and the prototype is qualitatively tested. The tests demonstrate the concept, but it is not yet shown that this joint mechanism will be lighter that a traditional joint mechanism. The simulator is developed to be a design tool for further development of the climbing robot. A list of specifications for the simulator is presented, however the simulator is not able to meet all these requirements at the current stage of development. The remaining work on the simulator is discussed, as well as an evaluation of the software as it is at the time of writing. The report describes the kinematic modeling that is used to represent the translational and rotational relationship between the different elements of the robot. The kinematic relationships is then put into a mathematical representation of the robot which represents the robots as a chain of elements. Each element has several properties, among which are its relationship to other elements and a graphical representation of the element. The elements, and thus the robot, is represented graphically in a virtual reality environment. The simulator allows the user to specify several parameters of the robot, such as number and dimensions of the joints and the dimensions of the body. The user is also able to control the velocity of each joint. Both the simulator and the joint has been developed to be general enough for use on other kinds of robots, with small modifications in the case of the simulator. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{research}} was to design, manufacture, and test a new linear actuation system. Research was conducted on several types of actuation methods applied to hydraulic valves. A literature review showed that most existing actuator systems have the actuator and control mass coupled together. There {{is a need for}} high speed actuation. The proposed idea is to have the actuation mass always moving while accelerating and decelerating the control mass. The decoupling of these two will allow for the actuation and control mechanism to be independent and only move the control mechanism when needed. Initial modeling, as well as a matrix of design configurations, was done to compare the strengths of magneto-rheological fluid, piezoelectric and magnetics as a <b>clutching</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This led to the initial selection of a magneto-rheological fluid actuator. ^ A prototype of the energy coupling actuator was designed and manufactured. Building of the energy coupling actuator had many design iterations. These iterations built upon each previous design. A custom test stand was built to test the energy coupling actuator, and validate the design. The static power required to spin the kinetic energy source was measured to validate the design. Dynamic testing was performed on three prototypes and on the electrical current profile. The dynamic response of the final energy coupling actuator had a stroke of 1. 5 mm in 3 ms and was also able to reach a stroke of 7 mm in 7 ms. The testing of the energy coupling actuator concluded that the product was capable of high-performance actuation. ...|$|R
