Given a training set of binary sequences, each with a binary class label, the system should generate a predictor that classifies unlabelled sequences in a given test set. The training and test sets consisted of random binary sequences, labelled by a randomly constructed Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). Each system was allowed to run for 10 minutes. Although the training and test sets were generated by fairly small DFA (10 to 50 states), the training set had {{a high level of}} noise (10 %) : this noise was introduced by mutating each label in the training set with a probability of 0. 1.

40|$|Proximal Support Vector machine {{based on}} Least Mean Square Algorithm classi-fiers (LMS-SVM) are tools for {{classification}} of binary data. Proximal Support Vector based on Least Mean Square Algorithm classifiers is completely {{based on the}} theory of Proximal Support Vector Machine classifiers (PSVM). PSVM <b>classifies</b> <b>binary</b> pat- terns by assigning them to the closest of two parallel planes that are pushed apart as far as possible. The training time for the classifier {{is found to be}} faster compared to their previous versions of Support Vector Machines. But due to the presence of slack variable or error vector the classification accuracy of the Proximal Support Vector Machine is less. So we have come with an idea to update the adjustable weight vectors at the training phase such that all the data points fall out-side the region of separation and falls on the correct side of the hyperplane and to enlarge the width of the separable region. To implement this idea, Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is used to modify the adjustable weight vectors. Here, the error is represented by the minimum distance of data points from the margin of the region of separation of the data points that falls inside the region of separation or makes a misclassification and distance of data points from the separating hyperplane for the data points that falls {{on the wrong side of}} the hyperplane. This error is minimized using a modification of adjustable weight vectors. Therefore, as the number of iterations of the LMS algorithm increases, weight vector performs a random walk (Brownian motion) about the solution of optimal hy-perplane having a maximal margin that minimizes the error. Experimental results show that the proposed method <b>classifies</b> the <b>binary</b> pattern more accurately than classical Proximal Support Vector Machine classifiers...|$|R

Hybrid GP technique based on genetic algorithm-program (GA-P) for function learning tasks with variables and constants is investigated.

However despite the asymptotic optimality {{little is known about}} the quality of the construction as a function of the string length. We show that these sets are also responsible for the (near) solution of several combinatorial problems on a certain hypergraph. Furthermore our results are valid for any string length. We show that the sets collectively solve strong vertex coloring and edge coloring on the hypergraph exactly. For any string length n we show that the largest of these sets is within n+ 1 /n- 1 of optimal matching on the hypergraph, which also corresponds to the largest single-deletion-correcting code. Moreover, we show for any n the smallest of these sets is within n(2) -n/n(2) - 3 n+ 4 - 4 / 2 (n) of the smallest cover of this hypergraph and that each of these sets is a perfect matching. We then obtain similar results on the dual of this hypergraph. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Amongst the network models that our approach includes in its analysis are two data preconditioning models that we have developed {{as a part of}} the Tapas project, an investigation into new approaches for accurately modeling and analyzing the behavior of various time-varying network path characteristics. Traditional modeling approaches, such as Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC) are limited in their ability to model time-varying characteristics.

In forests grazed by cattle, resources are utilized where they exist, an important consideration for sustainable land use. Since animal behaviour can indicate state of health and nutrient uptake, monitoring grazing activity and classifying cattle behaviour based on collar recordings might contribute to provide sufficient welfare management. Several statistical methods have previously been trialled to classify behaviours using data from activity sensors, however, no method is standardised. This study mainly aims to use classification tree models to <b>classify</b> <b>binary</b> activity and grazing behaviour. 17 cattle on pasture in the forest of Stange and Romedal common land were equipped with dual-axis activity sensor collars and behaviour was observed during summer months of 2015, resulting in 1105 sequences of observed behaviour. Data from observations were used for testing accuracy of activity sensors to classify behaviour. Classification of binary activity (low vs. high) was 89. 3 %. When adding grazing as a category, classification was 80. 8 %. This suggests classification to be more difficult when adding more behaviour categories to the model and some behaviours are correlated to the same activity level. In addition to activity data from the collars, distance of movement between sequences was chosen by the model as an important variable to classify behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The density {{classification}} {{problem is}} one of the simplest yet non-trivial computing tasks which seem to be ideally suitable for cellular automata (CA). Unfortunately, there exists no one-dimensional two-state CA which <b>classifies</b> <b>binary</b> strings according to their densities. If, however, in place of simple cells one uses agents which change their behaviour from one rule to another after a fixed number of iterations, the classification can be performed by the traffic rule 184 and the majority rule 232. This two-rule solution cannot be easily generalized to two (or higher) dimensions, because it critically depends on a kinetic phase transition occurring in the rule 184. No rule exhibiting analogous transition is known in two dimensions, most likely because no such rule exists. We propose, therefore, to approach this problem form a slightly different angle, namely by introducing a stochastic component into each of the two rules. If one precedes each iteration of rule 184 by the stochastic "lane changing rule," and each iteration of rule 232 by the stochastic "crowd avoidance" rule, in the limit of infinitely many iterations the classification can be performed correctly with probability 1. This solution can be described either in the language of CA, or using the paradigm of agents which move and proliferate on the 2 D lattice, following probabilistic rules.
