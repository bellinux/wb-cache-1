25|$|RBS' <b>contractual</b> <b>commitment</b> {{to retain}} the 4.26% Bank of China (BoC) stake ended on 31 December 2008, and the shares were sold on 14 January 2009. Exchange rate {{fluctuations}} meant that RBS made no profit on the deal. The Scottish press suggested two reasons for the move: {{the need for a}} bank mainly owned by HM Treasury to focus scarce capital on British markets, and the growth possibility of RBS's own China operations.|$|E
40|$|NoIn the past, {{transaction}} cost economics (TCE) literature has largely stressed {{the benefits of}} <b>contractual</b> <b>commitments</b> in relationships. TCE traditionally recommends safeguarding specific assets against holdup, thus reducing behavioral uncertainty. In contrast, the reverse {{side of the coin}} has been disregarded for a long time. Firms may lose some of their flexibility and thus the opportunity to benefit from future emerging business activities due to prior <b>contractual</b> <b>commitments.</b> Flexibility becomes especially important in dynamic environments where there is rapid technological change. To manage the emergent trade-off between <b>contractual</b> <b>commitments</b> and flexibility in dynamic markets, the authors propose a real options approach. The value of a firm's flexibility to switch to a new trading partner is represented by a real switching option. It can be shown how <b>contractual</b> <b>commitments</b> directly affect the value of the switching option. To clarify, the authors numerically analyze the respective trade-off and derive implications for an optimal choice of <b>contractual</b> <b>commitments...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1955, {{following}} a contractual dispute with his publisher Dupuis, Franquin {{went for a}} short stint at rival Tintin magazine. This {{led to the creation}} of Modeste et Pompon, a gag series which included contributions from René Goscinny (of Astérix fame) and Peyo. Franquin later returned to Spirou, but his <b>contractual</b> <b>commitment</b> to Tintin meant that he had to contribute to both magazines, an unusual arrangement in the comic industry. The series was later passed on to authors such as Dino Attanasio and Mittéï (Jean Mariette).|$|E
500|$|Sinatra grew discontented at Capitol, {{and fell}} into a feud with Alan Livingston, which lasted over six months. His first attempt at owning his own label was with his pursuit of buying declining jazz label, Verve Records, which ended once an initial {{agreement}} with Verve founder, Norman Granz, [...] "failed to materialize." [...] He decided to form his own label, Reprise Records and, {{in an effort to}} assert his new direction, temporarily parted with Riddle, May and Jenkins, working with other arrangers such as Neil Hefti, Don Costa, and Quincy Jones. [...] Sinatra built the appeal of Reprise Records as one in which artists were promised creative control over their music, as well as a guarantee that they would eventually gain [...] "complete ownership of their work, including publishing rights." [...] Under Sinatra the company developed into a music industry [...] "powerhouse", and he later sold it for an estimated $80 million. His first album on the label, Ring-a-Ding-Ding! (1961), was a major success, peaking at No.4 on Billboard. The album was released in February 1961, the same month that Reprise Records released Ben Webster's The Warm Moods, Sammy Davis, Jr.'s The Wham of Sam, Mavis River's Mavis and Joe E. Lewis's It is Now Post Time. During the initial years of Reprise, Sinatra was still under contract to record for Capitol, completing his <b>contractual</b> <b>commitment</b> with the release of Point of No Return, recorded over a two day period on September 11 and 12, 1961. In an effort to maintain his commercial viability in the 1960s, Sinatra recorded Elvis Presley's hit [...] "Love Me Tender", and later recorded works by Paul Simon such as [...] "Mrs. Robinson", the Beatles ("Something", [...] "Yesterday"), and Joni Mitchell ("Both Sides, Now").|$|E

2500|$|On December 15, it was {{announced}} that A Day to Remember planned to pressing charges against their label, Victory, due to breach of contract. Legal action had reportedly been initiated on May 31 of that year, with the band claiming Victory owed them over $75,000 in royalties. Victory has said that the lawsuit is actually about the band's refusal to fulfill their five- album <b>contractual</b> <b>commitment,</b> and their desire to move to a major label. A Day to Remember gave Altpress.com this statement: [...] "A Day To Remember would like {{to make it clear that}} they did not announce nor seek any attention regarding their ongoing suit with Victory Records. This information has been public record since May of 2011 and they have no intention of speaking publicly or disparagingly regarding their disagreement with Victory.

2500|$|Originally, Spielberg {{suggested}} Harrison Ford; Lucas {{resisted the}} idea, {{since he had}} already cast the actor in American Graffiti, Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, {{and did not want}} Ford to become known as his [...] "Bobby De Niro" [...] (in reference to the fact that fellow director Martin Scorsese regularly casts Robert De Niro in his films). During an intensive casting process, Lucas and Spielberg auditioned many actors, and finally cast actor Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones. Shortly afterward pre-production began in earnest on Raiders of the Lost Ark. However, CBS refused to release Selleck from his <b>contractual</b> <b>commitment</b> to Magnum, P.I. (which was gradually gaining momentum in the ratings), forcing him to turn down the role. One of CBS's concerns was that shooting for Magnum P.I. conflicted with shooting for Raiders, both of which were to begin about the same time. However, Selleck was to say later in an interview that shooting for Magnum P.I. was delayed and did not actually begin until shooting for Raiders had concluded.|$|E
