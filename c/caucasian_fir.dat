5000|$|Von Hartwiss {{collected}} {{plants in}} Georgia and the Crimea. Some species were named by him, some named after him. [...] "Three long expeditions {{made to the}} Caucasus in search of new ornamental plants for the Crimea … <b>Caucasian</b> <b>fir,</b> spruce, … Caucasian basswood, rhododendrons, azaleas and other flowering shrubs." ...|$|E
50|$|The forests on the {{mountain}} slopes in the park consist of both deciduous and evergreen tree species. These include sessile oak, sweet chestnut, oriental hornbeam, common hornbeam, black alder, oriental beech, oriental spruce, <b>Caucasian</b> <b>fir</b> and Scots pine. On the higher slopes, the common aspen is added to these as well as rhododendron, juniper, Vaccinium, willow, birch and European raspberry.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate is}} good for agriculture. Grain, sugar beets, potatoes, corn, and {{grassland}} for horses and cows {{are the most common}} sight. Apple and pear trees are also cultivated. The city contains all sorts of broad-leafed and coniferous species, which do well in the cool climate. Near the abbey complex there a couple of beautiful red beeches. Some large conifers {{can be found in the}} city centre as well (Norway spruce, Taxus and Dawn Redwood). Spruces in particular tend to get too big for gardens and are cut down after a few years. At Ter Hooge, a castle to the west of the city, there is a small beech forest with some oak and some specimen trees of Norway and Serbian spruce, iSequoia Sepmpervirens/i (redwood), <b>Caucasian</b> <b>fir,</b> and larch trees.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDark {{coniferous}} forests with dominating <b>Caucasian</b> <b>fir</b> {{are basically}} distributed in West Georgia. They occupy 153. 920  ha with the wood substance stock of 61191, 5 thousand m 3, respectively making 91, 3 and 91, 0 % of fir woods in Georgia. Forests with dominating oriental spruce are distributed comparatively evenly in Georgia; 55, 3 % (55354  ha) of spruce stands come to West Georgia. Coniferous forests in Svaneti were {{chosen as the}} object of the research. Forests with dominating <b>Caucasian</b> <b>fir</b> occupying 60100  ha in Svaneti have absorbed up to 7, 85 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere and annually it sequesters up to 189, 3 thousand tons of carbon dioxide. In the forest biomass with dominating <b>Caucasian</b> <b>fir</b> occupying 14345  ha has accumulated up to 1, 13 million tons of carbon. Spruce stand annually sequesters up to 35, 9 thousand tons of CO 2. The Article describes distribution of biomass and carbon stock in dark conferous forests according to the stand age groups and single fractions. High indicators of carbon dioxide annually sequestered by dark coniferous forests of Svaneti Region once again emphasize the special role of forests in the process of air exchange on the Earth...|$|E

Crossing of A. procera with the Mediterranean species A. nordmanniana failed completely, producing only empty seeds...|$|E

Thesis also evaluate quality of main tree species which are grown at the RYKR's company. Part of this work is basic economical analyse of production and sales of Christmas trees. Thesis also contains market research among chosen salesmen in years 2011 - 2014. In thesis there is description of various tree species which are convenient for Christmas trees. There is described soil conditions needed and other individual deficiencies which must be done in Christmas trees production. The thesis includes description, evaluation and were identified deficiencies of individual plantations which are operated by RYKR company.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of somatic embryo {{cultures of the}} <b>Caucasian</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies nordmanniana LK) was investigated through the mineral composition of culture media {{and the development of}} a simple cryopreservation method. In our culture media, a high level of NO 3 - (21 mM) in the absence of NH 4 + appeared to favour embryo growth. The K+/Ca++ ratio seemed less significant. Moreover, the micronutrient composition of the media tested was suitable for embryo growth, provided that an optimum manganese level was maintained. The embryo cryopreservation method used involved dehydration by freezing, also known as slow cryopreservation. The technique used was a simple one, requiring no sophisticated or expensive equipment. The main criterion was to observe the crystallization point precisely by brief, rapid cooling of the embryo suspension in liquid nitrogen. The cold-treated embryos of the reference lines were able to regenerate after this treatment. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Most European firs occur {{predominantly}} {{in small}} to medium-sized {{populations in the}} Mediterranean region, sometimes with fragmented and limited distributions, except for silver fir (Abies alba). They all are genetically closely related and can easily hybridise, perhaps {{as a consequence of}} late speciation during the late Quaternary. Circum-Mediterranean firs occur principally in mountain areas with medium to high precipitations rates which are mostly concentrated during the winter period. The species are able to tolerate long droughts in summer and tend to form pure stands when in optimal habitats. In the past firs have been extensively logged for construction and fire wood and their stands were replaced by other more disturbance adapted species or converted into rural areas. Nowadays with the exception of silver fir and <b>Caucasian</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies nordmanniana), circum-Mediterranean firs do not have a wide commercial interest. In Turkey they are still exploited for timber wood, while other firs have an ornamental use in gardening. Great importance is given to their preservation, especially to those populations which have very limited areas and specimens, with the creation of protected reserves and conservation programmes. Wild fires, livestock grazing and genetic drift represent actually their main threats...|$|E
40|$|Complex {{permittivity}} spatial {{distributions of}} two conifers, a 5. 0 -m high <b>Caucasian</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies Normanniana) and a 1. 9 -m high spruce (Picea Omorika), have been {{measured in the}} frequency range 1 - 10 GHz. Unlike earlier studies, particular {{attention was paid to}} the anisotropy of the dielectric properties. The measurements were performed in the frame of polarimetric scattering, and imaging experiments conducted on both trees in the European Microwave Signature Laboratory (EMLS), Space Applications Institute, Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy. They will be used, together with carefully established architectural models of the trees, to validate forest remote-sensing algorithms. The measurement method was based on an open-ended coaxial probe reflection technique with a rational function approximation model for the probe tip aperture admittance. With this model, no calibration on reference liquids is requiredand sufficiently accurate results for the dieletric constant and loss factor can be obtained. Results are presented for branches, parts of the trunks, and needles from different tree heights. Values obtained with the probe oriented along different stem directions of the trunk coafirm the anisotropic nature of wood. The longitudinal complex permittivity is roughly 1. 5 -three times higher than the transverse component. Inside the trunk, early and late wood layers and small heterogeneities give rise to fluctuations; the pholem layer and the new needled have the highest complex permittivity. representative average values for trunks, branches, and needles for modeling purposes are also given.
