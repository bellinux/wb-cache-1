2500|$|Ascariasis of STH {{is caused}} by the large {{roundworm}} A. lumbricoides. [...] It is estimated to be the most widespread STH, affecting approximately 1 billion people. The victims constitute about half of the populations in tropical and subtropical areas. Most conditions are mild and often show little or no symptoms. Heavy infections however are debilitating, causing severe intestinal blockage and impair growth in children. Children, compounded with malnutrition, are most infected, with the most common age group being 3 to 8 year olds, with an annual death of about 20,000. Children are more susceptible due to their frequent exposure to <b>contaminated</b> <b>environment</b> such as during playing, eating raw vegetables and fruits, and drinking wastewater.|$|E

2500|$|Dry {{suits for}} {{commercial}} and military diving {{tend to be}} heavier and more durable than recreational diving dry suits because they will endure a harsh and abrasive environment, especially if being used for heavy labor such as underwater welding. A boiler suit may be worn over the dry suit for additional protection of the suit. Some commercial dry suits are rated for <b>contaminated</b> <b>environment</b> diving, and when combined with a suitably rated diving helmet can completely isolate and protect the diver from hazardous environments such as sewage pits and chemical storage tanks. These [...] "hazmat suits" [...] are most often made of vulcanized rubber laminated to a cloth liner, which is easier to decontaminate because of its slick surface, than other dry suit materials.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{revised the}} Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) {{concentration}} for benzene to 500 ppm. The current NIOSH definition for an IDLH condition, as {{given in the}} NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, is one that poses a threat of exposure to airborne contaminants when that exposure is likely to cause death or immediate or delayed permanent adverse health effects or prevent escape from such an environment [...] The purpose of establishing an IDLH value is (1) {{to ensure that the}} worker can escape from a given <b>contaminated</b> <b>environment</b> in the event of failure of the respiratory protection equipment and (2) is considered a maximum level above which only a highly reliable breathing apparatus providing maximum worker protection is permitted [...] In September 1995, NIOSH issued a new policy for developing recommended exposure limits (RELs) for substances, including carcinogens. As benzene can cause cancer, NIOSH recommends that all workers wear special breathing equipment when {{they are likely to be}} exposed to benzene at levels exceeding the REL (10-hour) of 0.1 ppm. The NIOSH short-term exposure limit (STEL – 15 min) is 1 ppm.|$|E
2500|$|Bioaccumulation is {{the process}} by which an {{organism}} takes in chemicals through ingestion, exposure, and inhalation. Bioaccumulation is broken down into bioconcentration (uptake of chemicals from just water) and biomagnification (uptake of chemicals from a food source). Certain species of aquatic organisms are affected differently from the chemicals released from creosote preservatives. One of the more studied organisms is a mollusk. Mollusks attach to the wooden, marine pilings and are in direct contact with the creosote preservatives. Many studies have been conducted using Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are low molecular hydrocarbons found in some creosote-based preservatives. In a study conducted from Pensacola, Florida, a group of native mollusks were kept in a controlled environment, and a different group of native mollusks were kept in an environment contaminated with creosote preservatives. The mollusks in the <b>contaminated</b> <b>environment</b> were shown to have a bioaccumulation of up to ten times the concentration of PAH than the control species. The intake of organisms is dependent on whether the compound is in an ionized or an un-ionized form. To determine whether the compound is ionized or un-ionized, the pH of the surrounding environment must be compared to the pKa or acidity constant of the compound. If the pH of the environment is lower than the pKa, then the compound is un-ionized which means that the compound will behave as if it is non-polar. Bioaccumulation for un-ionized compounds comes from partitioning equilibrium between the aqueous phase and the lipids in the organism. If the pH is higher than the pKa, then the compound is considered to be in the ionized form. The un-ionized form is favored because the bioaccumulation is easier for the organism to intake through partitioning equilibrium. The table below shows a list of pKas from compounds found in creosote preservatives and compares them to the average pH of seawater (reported to be 8.1).|$|E
40|$|Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) {{has spread}} widely in {{mainland}} China increasing in prevalence in most years with serious consequences for child health. The HFMD virus can survive {{for a long}} period outside the host in suitable conditions, and hence <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments</b> may play important roles in HFMD infection. A new mathematical model was proposed and used to investigate the roles that asymptomatic individuals and <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments</b> played in HFMD dynamics. The model includes both direct transmission between susceptible and infected individuals and indirect transmission via free-living infectious unites in the environment. Theoretical analysis shows that the disease goes to extinction if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, whilst otherwise the disease persists. By fitting the proposed model to surveillance data we estimated the basic reproduction number as 1. 509. Numerical simulations show that increasing the rate of virus clearance and decreasing transmission rates can delay epidemic outbreaks and weaken the severity of HFMD. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the basic reproduction number is sensitive to the transmission rate induced by asymptomatic infectious individuals and parameters associated with <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments</b> such as the indirect transmission rate, the rate of clearance and the virus shedding rates. This implies that asymptomatic infectious individuals and <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments</b> contribute substantially to new HFMD infections, and so would be targets for effective control measures...|$|R
30|$|The {{importance}} of Pseudomonads in nutrient cycling {{and their ability}} to quickly adapt to the <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments</b> make them preferential choice for eco-friendly studies. The first concept was supported by reports of the key role of Pseudomonads in the heterotrophic mineralization of organic carbon and in denitrification (Bollag and Barabasz 1979). Then latter was supported by the tendency of this genus to develop novel enzymatic pathways which may contribute to its adaptability to harsh environments (Clarke and Ornston 1975). Therefore, Pseudomonads are abundant in a variety of <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments</b> including Cd- and Hg-polluted water and sediments (Houba and Remacle 1980).|$|R

40|$|Major {{challenges}} remain when {{attempting to}} quantify and evaluate the impacts of <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments</b> and heterogeneity in the cohorting of health care workers (HCWs) on hospital infections. Data on the detection rate of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) in a Chinese intensive care unit (ICU) were obtained to accurately evaluate the level of environmental contamination and also to simplify existing models. Data-driven mathematical models, including mean-field and pair approximation models, were proposed to examine the comprehensive effect of integrated measures including cohorting, increasing nurse-patient ratios and improvement of environmental sanitation on MRAB infection. Our results indicate that for clean environments and with strict cohorting, increasing the nurse-patient ratio results in an initial increase and then a decline in MRAB colonization. In contrast, in <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments,</b> increasing the nurse-patient ratio may lead to either a consistent increase or an initial increase followed by a decline of MRAB colonization, depending {{on the level of}} environmental contamination and the cohorting rate. For developing more effective control strategies, the findings suggest that increasing the cohorting rate and nurse-patient ratio are effective interventions for relatively clean environments, while cleaning the environment more frequently and increasing hand washing rate are suitable measures in <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

50|$|People may {{be exposed}} to PCP in {{occupational}} settings through the inhalation of contaminated workplace air and dermal contact with wood products treated with PCP. Also, general population exposure may occur through contact with <b>contaminated</b> <b>environment</b> media, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} wood treatment facilities and hazardous wastes sites. In addition, some other important routes of exposure seem to be the inhalation of contaminated air, ingestion of contaminated ground water used as a source of drinking water, ingestion of contaminated food, and dermal contact with soils or products treated with the chemical.|$|E
50|$|Divers {{working in}} a dangerously <b>contaminated</b> <b>environment</b> wear a full drysuit with {{integral}} boots. Cut-resistant dry-gloves and helmet will seal directly to the drysuit, leaving no skin exposed to the environment. The diver will generally use a free flow diving helmet which continually supplies more air than the diver needs to breathe {{so that there is}} a constant outflow through the exhaust valve, as the internal pressure must be slightly higher than ambient to maintain the flow. A free flow helmet has a significantly lower risk of leakage back through the exhaust valve compared to a standard demand helmet where the exhaust valve must maintain a watertight seal against a slightly higher external pressure during inhalation. The risk of leakage through the exhaust valve of a demand system can be reduced in three ways. A series system of valves can be used - the exhaust gases must pass through two sets of exhaust valves before reaching the <b>contaminated</b> <b>environment,</b> and therefore contaminated water would have to leak back through both sets of valves to get to the diver. Positive pressure systems maintain a slightly higher pressure inside the mask or helmet than the ambient pressure on the outside, ensuring that any leaks flow from inside to outside, and reclaim type systems duct the exhaled breathing gas back to the control panel on the surface, but do not necessarily reclaim the exhaust gas. Combinations of these methods are possible depending on the assessed risk.|$|E

40|$|When {{working in}} the radiologically <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments</b> that present ideal natural {{laboratories}} for studying radiation effects on wildlife, such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima exclusion zones, {{it is necessary to}} monitor dose rates in the areas where observations are undertaken. A priori assumptions coupled with an awareness of the dose rates in the area being observed may lead to unconscious observer bias. Laboratory analyses are often ‘blind’ to avoid the potential for unconscious bias, but, when working in radioactively <b>contaminated</b> <b>environments,</b> a ‘blind’ approach is not feasible. To overcome this problem, we have developed novel methods for studying faunal biodiversity within radioactively contaminated ecosystems. Data are captured in a manner that significantly reduces ‘observer bias’ and are independently verifiable. In this presentation we introduce the novel radioecological study approaches that we have developed, report on their application in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) and discuss our findings...|$|R
