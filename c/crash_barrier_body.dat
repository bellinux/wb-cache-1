40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} on the application of TRIZ tools of Situation Analysis and Method of the Ideal Result by a small team of engineers {{that led to a}} design of a novel mobile <b>crash</b> <b>barrier.</b> It compares the design outcomes achieved by engineers using a traditional way of product development, to the product created during the TRIZ-assisted design process. This case study originates from the engineering division of Singapore Technologies Kinetics, a company that has been traditionally involved in automotive systems&# 039; and vehicular design. A <b>crash</b> <b>barrier,</b> intended to stop a certain class of vehicles within a designated distance, has never before been designed and built by the company. Company management decided to participate in a tender for a <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> trying to gain new business during an economic downturn. Eventually, the novel mobile <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> passed the patent examination effortlessly and the design team has also secured a contract after winning a tender. This paper uses the mobile <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> example to discuss the influence of the detrimental effect of expertise on creativity of engineering solutions and importance of systematic problem solving methodologies in engineering design. It suggests that exposure to designs of others prior to idea generation can result in design fixation. It also suggests that design fixation can be removed by application of the appropriate TRIZ tools...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of the highway network in Malaysia is growing rapidly along with the toll plazas facilities and safety constructions such as toll plaza barriers. However, the issue of accidents involving <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> at toll plazas turns into horrific nightmare for road users. It have been investigated that accidents at the toll plaza gates due to impacts of the vehicles with concrete <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> with results in damage and fatalities. Therefore, the following study is to conduct a simulation test for <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> Tensile Wire Fracture toughness (TWFT) system. TWFT system that used hot rolled galvanized steel materials with small displacement rate of 4. 0 x 10 - 4 m which was considered suitable {{as a replacement for}} the existing concrete <b>crash</b> <b>barrier.</b> The data analysis were generated by the software Elfen. The graph of displacement, direct shear and effective stress were generated as for the hot-galvanizes steel material model. Elastic energy, kinetic energy and inelastic dissipated energy were compared between these two materials. The results shows that the hot-rolled galvanized steel have the energy to return the material to its original form and the level of damage shows that the concrete material failure are greater than the hot rolled galvanized steel materials. In conclusion, the material for a new alternative <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> is likely to reduce the rate of death due to accident and damage with regards to road furnitures and vehicle...|$|R
50|$|Traffic <b>barriers</b> (sometimes called <b>crash</b> <b>barriers,</b> or Armco barriers, {{also known}} in North America as {{guardrails}} or guard rails and in Britain as <b>crash</b> <b>barriers)</b> keep vehicles within their roadway and prevent vehicles from colliding with dangerous obstacles such as boulders, sign supports, trees, bridge abutments, buildings, walls, and large storm drains. Traffic barriers are also {{installed at the}} roadside to prevent errant vehicles from traversing steep (non-recoverable) slopes or entering deep water. Traffic barriers are installed within medians of divided highways to prevent errant vehicles from entering the opposing carriageway of traffic and help to reduce head-on collisions. Some of these barriers, designed to be struck from either side, are called median <b>barriers.</b> <b>Crash</b> <b>barriers</b> {{can also be used}} to protect vulnerable areas like school yards, pedestrian zones, and fuel tanks from errant vehicles.|$|R

50|$|During World War II, {{aircraft}} {{would land}} on the flight deck parallel to the long axis of the ship's hull. Aircraft which had already landed would be parked on the deck at the bow end of the flight deck. A <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> was raised behind them to stop any landing aircraft which overshot the landing area because its landing hook missed the arrestor cables. If this happened, it would often cause serious damage or injury and even, if the <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> was not strong enough, destruction of parked aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The pre-cast <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> {{lining the}} edge of the deck would also be {{manufactured}} nearby using purpose made steel moulds. They would be bonded into place by having re-bar-steel loops protruding from both {{the edge of}} the road deck and also from the bottom of the barrier section. These loops would mate together when the barrier was placed and be affixed there by injecting concrete into the space between the deck and the barrier, permanently bonding the protruding loops together. Subsequently a concrete guard rail would be cast on top of the <b>crash</b> <b>barrier.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} work analyses {{the methodology}} and {{approach of the}} legislation. It presents in the press presented results of numerical modelling {{of the impact of}} vehicles <b>crashed</b> into <b>barriers</b> that are being solved in the Czech Republic and worldwide. It presents a recommendation of a methodology for assessing <b>crash</b> <b>barriers.</b> The methodology follows the basic principles used in the TP 101 and EN 1991 - 1 - 1. The kinetic energy of the vehicle at the moment of impact is replaced with substitute static force, whose effects are comparable with those of a vehicle collision. The supporting structure of <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> is implemented in compliance with means of statics. The calculation includes the vehicle deformation, which represents the real distribution of the energy absorbed by the deformation of the vehicle and the energy that <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> need to absorb. The proposed methods allow to take into account non-linear behaviour of the structure both in terms of geometry and in terms of material nonlinearity. The work also deals with the interpretation of various types of support structures in the computational model. A specific case is used for a demonstration of a way of modelling the elastic supporting column of <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> in the soil, or modelling the friction of a loose concrete block over the surface. To ensure the proper position of interconnected loose blocks corresponding to the reality, a method of modelling the place of a possible contact of the breakthrough is drafted. A significant contribution to the more accurate calculation is achieved by sequential increase of the load on the construction by using load increment and measurement of energy increases absorbed by the deformation in each step. The presented methodology is an effective tool to assess <b>crash</b> <b>barriers.</b> For the application of this tool, using common resources and facilities available to almost every designer dealing with statics of structures is sufficient. In conclusion, the knowledge obtained f...|$|R
