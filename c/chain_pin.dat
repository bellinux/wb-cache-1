5000|$|Some chain {{tools are}} better at {{removing}} pins than they are at inserting them. Once completely removed, <b>chain</b> <b>pins</b> are often very difficult to insert with a tool unless it has been specifically designed to do so. Users may overcome this limitation of some tools by never completely removing a pin that they intend to replace. They push the pin so that the chain can be broken, to shorten it for example, but {{so that it is}} firmly retained in the farthest plate. This way, even simple chain tools can press the pin back into place.|$|R

25|$|Each shoulder-clasp {{consists}} of two matching curved halves, hinged upon a long removable <b>chained</b> <b>pin.</b> The surfaces display panels of interlocking stepped garnets and chequer millefiori insets, surrounded by interlaced ornament of Germanic Style II ribbon animals. The half-round clasp ends contain garnet-work of interlocking wild boars with filigree surrounds. On {{the underside of the}} mounts are lugs for attachment to a stiff leather cuirass. The function of the clasps is to hold together the two halves of such armour so that it can fit the torso closely in the Roman manner. The cuirass itself, possibly worn in the grave, did not survive. No other Anglo-Saxon cuirass clasps are known.|$|R

5000|$|In practice, the {{arrangement}} {{had a number}} of disadvantages. Cracks developed in the oil bath casing due to incorrect welding procedure. Condensation caused corrosion, and oil leaked out through inadequate seals, causing wheelslip and fire hazards. Valve timing was highly unpredictable; this has been attributed to chain stretch, although Bulleid claimed that it was allowed for. The chains were replaced as part of a valve and piston examination at around 30,000 to 36,000 mi, by which time they were considerably worn. This wear, in the <b>chain</b> <b>pins</b> and sprockets, could result in an elongation of the chains by as much as 6 in. Bulleid asserted that a slack of 3 in would be absorbed by the chain coming under load, with the remaining valve irregularity corrected by adjusting the cut-off.|$|R
40|$|A polymer <b>chain</b> <b>pinned</b> {{in space}} exerts a {{fluctuating}} {{force on the}} pin point in thermal equilibrium. The average of such fluctuating force is well understood from statistical mechanics as an entropic force, but {{little is known about}} the underlying force distribution. Here, we introduce two phase space sampling methods that can produce the equilibrium distribution of instantaneous forces exerted by a terminally pinned polymer. In these methods, both the positions and momenta of mass points representing a freely jointed chain are perturbed in accordance with the spatial constraints and the Boltzmann distribution of total energy. The constraint force for each conformation and momentum is calculated using Lagrangian dynamics. Using terminally <b>pinned</b> <b>chains</b> in space and on a surface, we show that the force distribution is highly asymmetric with both tensile and compressive forces. Most importantly, the mean of the distribution, which is equal to the entropic force, is not the most probable force even for long chains. Our work provides insights into the mechanistic origin of entropic forces, and an efficient computational tool for unbiased sampling of the phase space of a constrained system.

5000|$|Prior to the UV curing and coating system, Coors used a {{conventional}} production method. The production line is similar, but a four-color offset printer is used and a blanket lays the image onto the can as it spins on a mandrel. The cans are {{pulled into a}} gas convention oven by <b>pin</b> <b>chains</b> to cure the inks and varnishes, which take [...] "12 seconds at 400 °F". Afterwards, an internal coating {{is applied to the}} cans and it is sent to another gas oven to be cured. Some of the problems using this thermal process of coating and curing includes: Speed of printing limited by length and speed of <b>pin</b> <b>chain</b> conveyors, high energy costs for gas ovens, and also the can coatings becoming non-functional, when they are overheated in the oven due to slow speed or stoppages. Also, the use of lubricants on the <b>pin</b> <b>chains</b> is kept to a minimum to prevent it from getting into the can. Because of this, <b>pin</b> <b>chains</b> [...] "wear excessively and break frequently". Before it can even be repaired, 20 minutes need to be spent to wait for the oven to cool down enough.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} evidence showed {{a strong correlation}} between the behavior of polymers under confinement and the presence of a layer irreversibly adsorbed onto the supporting substrate, hinting at the possibility to tailor the properties of ultrathin films by controlling the adsorption kinetics. At the state of the art, however, the study of physisorption of polymer melts is mainly limited to theory and simulations. To overcome this gap, we present the results of an extensive investigation of the kinetics of irreversible adsorption of entangled melts of polystyrene onto silicon oxide. We show that the process of <b>chain</b> <b>pinning</b> proceeds via a first order reaction mechanism, which slows down at large surface coverage, and the adsorbed amount scales with the predictions of reflected random walk. We propose an analytical form of the time evolution of the thickness of the adsorbed layer with two well-defined regimes: linear at short times and logarithmic at longer times, separated by a temperature independent crossover thickness and a molecular weight independent crossover time, in line with simulations and theory. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

The mechanism is developed graphically to trace each point representing co-ordinates of roller which always keeps tray horizontal. Modeling of the guide-way and supporting frame is done on CATIA V 5 software. It is then imported in ADAMS VIEW software and simulated. Joints between links and pins, rollers and <b>pins,</b> <b>chain</b> links and <b>pins</b> are revolute joints. Suitable angular velocity to perform simulation is considered.

40|$|The {{techniques}} of electrophoresis have undergone rapid development in recent years. The problem of predicting and explaining results of electrophoretic experiments requires a well designed dynamical model that reproduces the proper dynamics under well-understood conditions. The {{challenge is to}} design a model which can predict complex dynamics {{in a variety of}} situations of interest and yet, be efficient enough to run on common workstations. We believe that we have been successful in achieving these goals. Our Brownian Dynamics model is sufficiently general for the investigation {{of a wide variety of}} problems (as we will demonstrate), moreover, it implements a simulation innovation, a dynamically self-regulating time increment which varies in accordance with the stresses in the system. This permits for reasonably long simulation times with good averaging statistics. After benchmarking the model with the well understood Rouse regime in isotropic and confined media, the model was applied to two case studies of particular interest: (i) electrophoretic collisions and stacking (<b>chain</b> <b>pinning),</b> and (ii), the onset of the entropic trapping regimes for low fields. We have found that, as far as simple isolated collisions are concerned, our model predicts a widening of electrophoretic molecular bands with an accompanying loss in spatial resolution. The onset of entropic regimes for low fields is demonstratedly counter-productive due to the wide variance of trapping times. Both these results are in accord with recent experimental observations. A more complete study is planned for a supercomputer to elaborate on these findings as well as to investigate kink-formations in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) ...|$|R

40|$|A density {{functional}} {{study of the}} structure of a layer formed by <b>chain</b> molecules <b>pinned</b> to a solid surface is presented. The chains are modeled as freely joined spheres. Segments and all components interact via Lennard-Jones (12 - 6) potential. The interactions of fluid molecules with the wall are described by the Lennard-Jones (9 - 3) potential. We analyze how different parameters of the model affect the dependence of the brush height upon the mixture composition. We consider the effect of grafting density and the parameters characterizing the interactions of fluid molecules with the substrate and with the chains as well as interactions within the mixture. The changes in the brush height correlate with the adsorption of particular components. Comment: 12 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
50|$|A two-pinned lewis {{consists}} of two 13 mm diameter steel pins, linked by a short <b>chain.</b> The <b>pins</b> are inserted into opposing holes that are drilled {{into the top of}} the stone at about 15° from vertical, and at least 75 mm deep. It operates by gripping the stone (like two fingers lifting a tenpin bowling ball) as the weight of the stone is taken up by a crane or winch. The advantage of using this type of lewis is that it is simple to prepare—two angled drill holes are all that is necessary. Like other types of lewis, it is susceptible to pulling out as the stone is lifted. It should always be tested before hoisting, and used in conjunction with safety slings.|$|R

In {{this paper}} we prove {{that if a}} mapping µ from incline R into [0, 1] is a fuzzy {{homomorphism}} then the incline order relation is preserved and the crisp sets that is, complement of strong α-cuts are ideals of R.

In addition, determination of the three-dimensional crystal structure of Ra-KLP at 1. 6 A resolution using sulphur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion reveals {{that much of the}} loop structure of classical Kunitz domains, including the protruding protease-binding loop, has been replaced by beta-strands. Even more unusually, the N-terminal portion of the polypeptide <b>chain</b> is <b>pinned</b> to the "Kunitz head" by two disulphide bridges not found in classical Kunitz/BPTI proteins. The disulphide bond pattern has been further altered by the loss of the bridge that normally stabilizes the protease-binding loop.

DNSSEC is another form of PGP/GPG WOT but for name-servers; it creates a trusted-chain for name-servers first (instead of people/person), and then people/person's PGP/GPG Keys and fingerprints can also be added into a server's DNSSEC DNS records. So any users who want to communicate securely (or any software users), can effectively get/receive their data/key/code/webpage etc. verified (aka, authenticated) via two (aka, dual/double) trusted PKI TTPAs/Channels at the same time: ICANN (DNSSEC) and CA (SSL/TLS Certificate). So PGP/GPG key/signed-code data (or file) can be trusted, when such solutions and techniques are used: HKPS, HKPS+DNSSEC+DANE, HTTPS, HTTPS+HPKP or HTTPS+HPKP+DNSSEC+DANE.|$|R
