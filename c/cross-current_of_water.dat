The relation of local development to national affairs has been investigated, although attempts to define exactly how the former influenced the latter, and vice versa, would involve one in the proverbial chicken-and-egg syndrome. Let it suffice to say that an understanding of events in the microcosm, or locality, lends clarity to the <b>cross-current</b> <b>of</b> affairs at the national level. It begins at the point where Grahamstown's commercial importance in the Eastern Cape declines after a flourish of hopes in the prospects of the Port Alfred harbour as a means of bringing trade back to Grahamstown.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the Humanities Special Issue on “Deep Mapping”.

Sketching a <b>cross-current</b> <b>of</b> ideas that have begun to coalesce around the concept of “deep mapping”, the paper argues that rather than attempting to outline a set of defining characteristics and “deep” cartographic features, a more instructive approach is to pay closer attention to the multivalent ways deep mapping is performatively put to work. Casting a critical and reflexive gaze over the developing discourse of deep mapping, it is argued that what deep mapping “is” cannot be reduced to the otherwise a-spatial and a-temporal fixity of the “deep map”. In this respect, as an undisciplined survey of this increasing expansive field of study and practice, the paper explores the ways in which deep mapping can engage broader discussion around questions of spatial anthropology...|$|R

40|$|Dimethyl sulfoxide's (DMSO) concentration-dependent {{influences}} {{on its own}} permeation rate through hairless mouse skin and on the concurrent permeation rates <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and the antiviral drug vidarabine (ara-A) have been studied at 37 °C using in vitro diffusion cells. Solubilities of ara-A in DMSO-water mixtures were also determined {{in order to assess}} ara-A's relative thermodynamic activity in the binary solvent media used in the mass transfer studies. Solubilities increased exponentially with increasing percentages of DMSO. Activity coefficients decreased accordingly. When the same DMSO medium was placed in each side of diffusion cell (balanced solvent configuration) permeability coefficients for ara-A decreased exactly as ara-A's solubility increased up to a 50 % DMSO concentration, indicating the observed decreases in the mass transfer coefficients have thermodynamic origins. When DMSO media were placed in either the donor or receiver side of the cell up to the same 50 % concentration point and opposed by a normal saline medium on the other side (asymmetric solvent con- figurations), the permeability of ara-A did not decrease and at some DMSO levels was substantially increased, behavior in marked departure from thermodynamic control. The behavior disparity between the 2 configurations of the cell suggests that <b>cross-currents</b> <b>of</b> solvents play a role in permeability enhancement. Regardless of solvent configuration, permeability coefficients for ara-A at 90 and 100 % DMSO strengths were exaggeratedly large, consistent with severe impairment of the stratum corneum. Similar overall permeability behavior was observed for the 2 solvents, water and DMSO. Possible underlying mechanisnis for these effects and the relative importance of the various mechanisms of DMSO enhancement as a function of DMSO's concentration and configuration are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Although Uri Caine {{first made}} his mark as a {{relatively}} straight-ahead jazz pianist – ‘roots’ to which he returns regularly – he has, arguably, become most famous with his often controversial versions of works from the ‘classical music’ canon. These recompositions, which often involve {{a host of other}} styles from Latin to dub, are usually regarded as examples of postmodern eclecticism. While this view is certainly valid, it needs to be complemented by more detailed analysis of both Caine’s artistic methods and their aesthetic and ideological implications. Among his work on classical composers, Caine’s engagement with Gustav Mahler is the most sustained. The result of this engagement is not an exercise in ‘crossover’ or ‘jazzed-up’ Mahler, but a radical reinterpretation of Mahler’s music that situates it as a Jewish voice within the cultural <b>cross-currents</b> <b>of</b> fin-de-siècle Central Europe. Through this reference to Mahler, Caine constructs a Jewish tradition within jazz that complements but does not compete with jazz’s overwhelmingly African-American heritage.

To the south across Fourth Street, a Skywalk connected Pogue's second floor with that of competitor McAlpin's. To the north across Fifth Street, a Skywalk led to Mabley & Carew department store, the Terrace Hilton Hotel, the Skywalk Twin Cinemas, and a variety of restaurants.

While the English tradition can, in one sense, be said to begin with Beowulf, the Anglo-Saxon epic left almost no mark upon the subsequent history of the genre. The heroic impulse in the English tradition is instead much more powerfully influenced and complicated by the antithetical models of Homer, Ovid, and, later, by that of Dante.

Critical readings will engage issues of influence, interpretation, revision, reinvention, Working through the concepts of context and intertextuality, we will {{pay particular attention to}} the backwaters and <b>cross-currents</b> <b>of</b> the tradition in English, and to the tendency of epic energy to move in unexpected directions: into theology with Milton, toward satire or impossibility in the Romantic period, into various cinematic and pop-culture modes in the 21 st century.

But when European diversity has declined toward ethnic or national conflict, Germany has drawn away from Europe and into itself, seeking inner unity and distinctness to protect it against possible combinations of enemies.

40|$|Uncle Dave Macon {{provided}} an essential link between nineteenth-century, urban popular stage music (especially the minstrel show and vaudeville) and commercialized country {{music of the}} 1920 s. He preserved through his recordings {{a large body of}} songs and banjo techniques that had their origins in urban-based, nineteenth-century vaudeville and minstrelsy. Like the minstrel and vaudeville performers of the nineteenth century, Macon told jokes and stories, employed attention-grabbing stage gimmicks, marketed himself with boastful or outrageous slogans, and dressed with individual flair. At the same time, Macon incorporated many features from the rural-based folk music of Middle Tennessee. Overall, Macon’s repertoire, musical style, and stage persona (which included elements of the rube, country gentleman, and old man) demonstrated his deep absorption, and subsequent reinterpretation, of nineteenth-century musical traditions. Macon’s career offers a case study in how nineteenth-century performance styles, repertoire, and stage practices became a part of country music in the 1920 s. As an artist steeped in two separate, but overlapping, types of nineteenth-century music—stage and folk—Macon was well-positioned to influence the development of the new commercial genre. He brought together several strains of nineteenth-century music to form a modern, twentieth-century musical product ideally suited to the new mass media of records, radio, and film. By tracing Macon’s career and studying his music, we can observe how the <b>cross-currents</b> <b>of</b> rural and popular entertainment during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth centuries}} interacted to form the commercial genre we now know as country music...|$|R

Our findings are that African literature and culture in English both still encapsulates relics of African languages that have not only sensitized the English speaking world of the existence and potency of these languages but also placed African linguistics image at the highest altar of literary coliseum. The seeming renaissance in linguistic research, scholarship and development of African languages and especially in the late twentieth and twenty first centuries, could hardly be extricated from this relationship.
