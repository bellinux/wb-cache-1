5|$|He {{graduated}} from Hall High School with a National Merit Scholarship. He helped take their swim {{team to the}} state championship, filling in for a sick teammate by swimming two legs of a relay. <b>Clark</b> <b>has</b> often repeated the anecdote that he {{decided he wanted to}} go to West Point after meeting a cadet with glasses who told Clark (who wore glasses as well) that one did not need perfect vision to attend West Point as Clark had thought. Clark applied, and he was accepted on April 24, 1962.|$|E
5|$|Kaleski's {{standard}} {{was adopted by}} breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into {{the early history of}} the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen <b>Clark</b> <b>has</b> noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.|$|E

25|$|Cello {{manufacturer}} Luis & Clark constructs cellos from carbon fibre. Carbon fibre {{instruments are}} particularly {{suitable for outdoor}} playing because {{of the strength of}} the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis & <b>Clark</b> <b>has</b> produced over 1000 cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma and Josephine van Lier. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins).|$|E
25|$|However, the US real GDP growth rate, {{the real}} retail sales growth rate, and the {{inflation}} rate have all returned to roughly what they were before the Great Recession. Todd <b>Clark</b> <b>has</b> presented an empirical analysis which claims that volatility, in general, {{has returned to the}} same level as before the Great Recession. He concluded that while severe, the 2007 recession will in future be viewed as a temporary period {{with a high level of}} volatility in a longer period where low volatility is the norm, and not as a definitive end to the Great Moderation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clark</b> <b>had</b> led Labour {{for nearly}} three years since her own {{leadership}} challenge in 1993 against Mike Moore.

25|$|<b>Clark</b> <b>has</b> {{suggested}} that homochirality {{may have started}} in outer space, as the studies of the amino acids on the Murchison meteorite showed that L-alanine {{is more than twice}} as frequent as its D form, and L-glutamic acid was more than three times prevalent than its D counterpart. Various chiral crystal surfaces can also act as sites for possible concentration and assembly of chiral monomer units into macromolecules. Compounds found on meteorites suggest that the chirality of life derives from abiogenic synthesis, since amino acids from meteorites show a left-handed bias, whereas sugars show a predominantly right-handed bias, the same as found in living organisms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clark</b> <b>has</b> worked {{actively}} in the New Zealand Labour Party {{for most of}} her life. In 1971 she assisted Labour candidates to the Auckland City Council.

She instead stood for , a National safe seat. Clark studied abroad on a University Grants Committee post-graduate scholarship in 1976, and then lectured in political studies at Auckland again while undertaking her PhD (which she never completed) from 1977 until her election to Parliament in 1981 (her father supported National that election).|$|E
25|$|In 2005 drummer Ty Smith left Guttermouth and was {{replaced}} by Ryan Farrell. Bass player Kevin Clark departed the following year and founding member Clint Weinrich returned to the group. This lineup recorded the band's tenth album Shave the Planet, released in 2006 by Volcom Entertainment. The album found the band once again using their brand of humorous punk rock to poke fun at a number of subjects. Although Weinrich remains a member of the band, <b>Clark</b> <b>has</b> since rejoined the group and handles most of the touring. In June 2008 Farrell announced that Sheldon had left the band to focus on his family, having recently had a fourth child. The band's official Myspace profile lists Sheldon's replacement as Dave Luckett, with Donald Horne being replaced by Hunter Munich. In December 2008 Adkins announced that the band had returned to Hopeless Records, one of their first record labels, in celebration of their 20th Anniversary, and that Guttermouth is working on a new album. A further line-up change occurred in 2009, when Munich {{was replaced}} by Brandon Zinkil.|$|E
