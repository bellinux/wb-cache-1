5|$|Earwigs are {{abundant}} {{and can be}} found throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The <b>common</b> <b>earwig</b> was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but tends to be more common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>earwig</b> is an omnivore, eating {{plants and}} ripe fruit {{as well as}} {{actively}} hunting arthropods. To a large extent, this species is also a scavenger, feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance. Observed prey include largely plant lice, but also large insects such as bluebottle flies and woolly aphids. Plants that they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, hollyhock, lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, potatoes, roses, seedling beans and beets, and tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the corn.|$|E
50|$|Unlike its relative, Archidermapteron martynovi, Asiodiplatys speciousus had cerci, or rear {{appendages}} {{similar to}} antannae, that {{were less than}} the length of their abdomen. By contrast, Archidermapteron martynovi had cerci that were not only longer than their abdomen, but longer than their abdomen and thorax combined. The size of Asiodiplatys speciousus's cerci is much more similar to the cerci of modern-day earwigs, such as most male <b>Common</b> <b>earwigs,</b> or Forficula auricularia.|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Understanding {{the evolution}} of subsocial behaviour and parental care requires experimental tests of the functional significance of such behaviours {{and the role of}} tending parents in the maintenance of family groups. Studies in subsocial insects addressing these issues experimentally and in the field are still relatively rare. 2. In such a field experiment, it is demonstrated here that the presence of tending females enhances the maintenance of family groups in <b>common</b> <b>earwigs,</b> Forficula auricularia (Dermaptera; Forficulidae). Experimental removal of tending mothers resulted in substantially decreased recovery of occupied nest burrows and larvae. This effect may have been because of decreased survival among experimental larvae, although a possible role for enhanced larval dispersal could not be fully ruled out. 3. Experimental (motherless) larvae were partly observed in family groups with a tending female, in both experimental and control nest burrows, suggesting that these larvae had been adopted by family groups moving to new nest burrows, and/or that experimental larvae may have actively joined other family groups. 4. This study demonstrates under field conditions the functional importance of maternal attendance for the maintenance of family groups in <b>common</b> <b>earwigs,</b> and suggests that adoption and clutch-joining are factors affecting the social structure of this species...|$|R
50|$|Unlike most extant earwigs in the Forficulina suborder, Archidermapteron martynovi had cerci, {{that were}} {{as long as}} its thorax and abdomen combined, or about 80% {{of the length of}} its body. This would have been longer than their antennae. By contrast, most male <b>Common</b> <b>earwigs,</b> Forficula auricularia, have cerci that are {{slightly}} less than the length of their abdomen, but in rare cases can reach lengths that are slightly longer. Common earwigs' cerci almost never reach lengths longer than their abdomen, let alone their abdomen and thorax combined.|$|R
25|$|Forficula auricularia, the <b>common</b> <b>earwig</b> or European earwig, is an {{omnivorous}} insect in {{the family}} Forficulidae. The European earwig survives {{in a variety of}} environments and is a common household insect in North America. The name earwig comes from the appearance of the hindwings, which are unique and distinctive among insects, and resemble a human ear when unfolded; the species name of the <b>common</b> <b>earwig,</b> auricularia, is a specific reference to this feature. However, they are considered a pest because of the damage they do to crops, their frightening appearance, their ability to fly (which they rarely use), foul odor, and tendency to invade crevices in homes and consume pantry foodstuffs.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a debate}} whether earwigs are harmful or {{beneficial}} to crops, as they eat both the foliage and the insects eating such foliage, such as aphids, though {{it would take a}} large population to do considerable damage. The <b>common</b> <b>earwig</b> eats a wide variety of plants, and also a wide variety of foliage, including the leaves and petals. They have been known to cause economic losses in fruit and vegetable crops. Some examples are the flowers, hops, red raspberries, and corn crops in Germany, and in the south of France, earwigs have been observed feeding on peaches and apricots. The earwigs attacked mature plants and made cup-shaped bite marks [...] in diameter.|$|E

5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of earwig species are in Forficulina, grouped into nine families of 180 genera, including Forficula auricularia, the <b>common</b> European <b>Earwig.</b> Species within Forficulina are free-living, have functional wings and are not parasites. The cerci are unsegmented and modified into large, forceps-like structures.|$|R
5|$|Earwigs are {{regularly}} preyed upon by birds, {{and like many}} other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs. Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, Triarthria setipennis, has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century. Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs, Ocytata pallipes, has shown promise as a biological control agent as well. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (Vespula maculifrons), preys upon earwigs when abundant. A small species of roundworm, Mermis nigrescens, is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on earwigs. The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs. A species of tyroglyphoid mite, Histiostoma polypori (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on <b>common</b> <b>earwigs,</b> sometimes in great densities; however, this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not its live earwig transportation. Hippolyte Lucas observed scarlet acarine mites on European earwigs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{responses}} of arthropod communities to an agroforestry landscape was {{studied at the}} Leeds University Field Station (Bramham), in northern England. The experimental design consisted of tree rows (containing four species of furniture timber trees, hazel bushes and grass alleys between the tree rows), forestry plots (comprising three species of timber trees and hazel bushes) and natural woodlots (consisting of mostly pine and beech trees). Forty tree sparrow nest-boxes with guards were constructed to study the structure of this model community. The material used for nest construction was determined based on a used tree sparrow nest obtained from a hedge at the field station. Numbers of arthropods found in tree rows were significantly higher compared to both the forest plots and woodlots. Similarly, the number of green lacewings, flies and beetles were all significantly higher in the tree rows than the forestry plots and woodlots. However, {{no significant difference between}} the varying resources of artificial nesting materials was found in total fauna. The <b>common</b> <b>earwigs,</b> Forficula auricularia were attacked by a tachinid fly, Triarthria. setipennis. The rate of parasitism was 43 %. This tachinid fly was further parasitised by two hymenopteran, the pteromalids, Dibrachys. cavus and D. boarmiae. There were no significant differences observed between the brood sizes of the tachinid hyperparasitoids...|$|R

5|$|Earwigs {{are fairly}} {{abundant}} and {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There {{is no evidence that}} they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans.

500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name for the}} order, [...] "Dermaptera", is Greek in origin, stemming from the words derma, meaning skin, and pteron (plural ptera), wing. It was coined by Charles DeGeer in 1773. The <b>common</b> term, <b>earwig,</b> {{is derived from the}} Old English , which means [...] "ear", and , which means [...] "insect", or literally, [...] "beetle". Entomologists suggest that the origin of the name is a reference to the appearance of the hindwings, which are unique and distinctive among insects, and resemble a human ear when unfolded. The name is more popularly thought {{to be related to the}} old wives' tale that earwigs burrowed into the brains of humans through the ear and laid their eggs there.

40|$|International audienceIn <b>common</b> <b>earwig,</b> Fur ficula auricularia L., {{parental care}} is {{necessary}} for the develop ment of eggs. However, so far the selective value of family group remains as an outstanding question.

40|$|Begging {{signals of}} {{offspring}} are condition-dependent cues {{that are usually}} predicted to display information about the short-term need (i. e. hunger) to which parents respond by allocating more food. However, recent models and experiments have revealed that parents, depending on the species and context, may respond to signals of quality (i. e. offspring reproductive value) rather than need. Despite the critical importance of this distinction for life history and conflict resolution theory, there is still limited knowledge of alternative functions of offspring signals. In this study, we investigated the communication between offspring and caring females of the <b>common</b> <b>earwig,</b> Forficula auricularia, hypothesizing that offspring chemical cues display information about nutritional condition to which females respond in terms of maternal food provisioning. Consistent with the prediction for a signal of quality we found that mothers exposed to chemical cues from well-fed nymphs foraged significantly more and allocated food to more nymphs compared with females exposed to solvent (control) or chemical cues from poorly fed nymphs. Chemical analysis revealed {{significant differences in the}} relative quantities of specific cuticular hydrocarbon compounds between treatments. To our knowledge, this study demonstrates {{for the first time that}} an offspring chemical signal reflects nutritional quality and influences maternal care...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{applications}} of hydrophobic kaolin particle film in apple orchards suppressed numbers of blossom weevil (Anthonomus pomorum), {{brown leaf weevil}} (Phyllobius oblongus), attelabid weevil (Caenorhinus pauxillus), leafhoppers (Empoasca vitis and Zygina flammigera) and green apple aphid (Aphis pomi) colonies. The kaolin treatments reduced the apple sawfly (Hoplocampa testudinea) fruit infestation on cultivar J. Grieve, and the fruit damage caused by oyster scale (Quadraspidiotus ostreaeformis), mussel scale (Lepidosaphes ulmi), early caterpillars, leaf rolling moths (Tortricidae), fruitlet-mining tortrix moth (Pammene rhediella) and codling moth (Cydia pomonella). There was {{no effect on the}} number of colonies of rosy leaf curling aphid (Dysaphis devecta), nor on the fruit damage caused by <b>common</b> <b>earwig</b> (Forficula auricularia) and apple sawfly on cv. G. Delicious. The level of infestation of rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea), leaf miner moths (Phyllonorycter blancardella, Lyonetia clerkella), and agromyzid flies (Phytomyza heringiana) increased in the kaolin-treated plots. Kaolin treatments promoted woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) infestation, which became severe, while it reduced the abundance of polyphagous predators like F. auricularia, predaceous Heteroptera and Coleoptera, the red velvet mite (Allothrombium fuliginosum), spiders (Araneae) and the abundance of common black ant (Lasius niger). The treatments also reduced parasitism of the apple sawfly by the ichneumonid Lathrolestes ensator. Many weeks after ending the kaolin treatments, the number of predaceous Coleoptera and especially the number of spiders remained low in the kaolin-treated plots...|$|E
40|$|The {{external}} and internal head morphology including the musculature of the <b>common</b> <b>earwig</b> Forficula auricularia is described in detail. We specified and corrected previous descriptions and provided a detailed documentation. The head of Forficula is characterized by prognathism, generalized mandibles with a mesal cutting edge distally of the mola and its drop-shaped appearance. We added the following new apomorphies for Dermaptera to the various previously reported ones: (I) coronal and frontal cleavage lines with corresponding strong internal strengthening ridges; (II) {{the division of the}} praementum into a basal and a distal sclerite; (III) the presence of a bumpulus {{at the tip of the}} paraglossa; (IV) the presence of large distal palpilla on the terminal maxillary and labial palpomeres and (V) the origin of M. tentoriohypopharyngealis on the submentum. Another potential apomorphy are the lateral lobes on the distal hypopharynx which are most likely not homologous to the superlingua of apterygote insect. Other characters such as the prominent ball-and-socket joint between scapus and pedicellus or the unique antennal heart are poorly studied within Dermaptera and therefore cannot be phylogenetically polarized. In contrast to the various ordinarial apomorphies, the dermapteran head exhibits only one potential synapomorphy with other polyneopteran orders: the absence of the linguactual tendon and the associated muscle that is shared with Plecoptera and/or Zoraptera. Our results show that additional studies of the presumingly basal splits of Dermaptera are required to understand the head evolution of the group...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{was discussed}} in the institute of vegetable growing and floriculture of Faculty of Horticulture in Mendel University in Brno, Lednice in the periods of the years 2010 [...] 2011. The thesis is mostly focused on description of Irises, group limniris, list of diseases and pests on irises and suggestion how to cure them. Diseases and pests have been observed and collected, on collection area with irises in ZF, Lednice three times, within vegetation. All described damages have been found on second collection, in efflorescence. Irises have been damaged also by wrong growing conditions, such as unsuitable watering, insufficiency of nutrients, wrong pH and unsuitable soil structure. Amongst viruses found on these irises it was mainly mold grey iris (Botrytis cinerea) and dry spottiness on leaves of iris (Davidiella macrospora). Snails (Pulmonata), Mononychus punctumalbum, Oxythyrea funesta, <b>common</b> <b>earwig</b> (Forficula auricularia), leaf aphids (Aphidoidea), ants (Formicoidea) and Acronicta sp. are mostly occuring pests on these collections. Mostly damaged species was I. sibirica, what means, that although it is most cultivated species in our country, {{it is not going}} that well. For determined location it can be recommended mainly prevention and biological protection such as natural enemies of pests and plants, which repels pests. In case of persistence in occuring of pathogens, it would be better use chemicals (Rovral Flo, Captan 50 WP, Saprol New, Decis 2, 5 EC, Actellic 50 EC, Furadanu 5 G, Aztec 140 EW or Pirimor 25 WG). These chemicals can, in wrong usage damage plants, so prevention and biological protection is recommended first, and it is also eco friendly...|$|E
