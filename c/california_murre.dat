40|$|The {{decline of}} the Common Murre (Uria aalge) colony on Redding (or ???Reading???) Rock, Humboldt County, California, was {{investigated}} and restoration options examined for preventing colony loss and increasing numbers of breeding birds to self sustaining levels. Restoring the Redding Rock murre colony was targeted in the Stuyvesant Oil Spill Restoration Plan, {{as well as the}} Kure and Luckenbach oil spill restoration plans, to partly repair impacts to the northern <b>California</b> <b>murre</b> population caused by mortalities of thousands of murres in these oil spills and their lost progeny. This assessment includes: 1) population trends of Common Murres, California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), Steller sea lions (Eumatopius jubatus), and other breeding seabirds on Redding Rock in 1979 - 2008 from nearly annual aerial photographic surveys; 2) status of the murre colony and sea lion haul-out in 2009 from more intensive boat and aerial photographic surveys; 3) potential long-term impacts to the murre colony from sea lions and maintenance of the Redding Rock Aid to Navigation (ATON); and 4) possible methods for restoring the Redding Rock murre colony. In 1979 - 1990, Redding Rock supported about 1, 600 breeding murres (800 pairs) per year. While annual variation occurred, colony size appeared to be fairly stable. After a two-year hiatus in surveys in 1991 - 1992, the colony was found to be nearly empty (29 birds) in 1993 during intense El Ni??o conditions when large numbers of California sea lions were first noted. Several distinct breeding areas were empty, including the largest breeding cluster on the top plateau of the rock. From 1994 - 2002, the murre colony continued to decline and by 2002 most historic nesting areas were abandoned; counts in breeding areas averaged only 204 birds (range = 83 - 375), a 79...|$|E
40|$|Efforts in 2010 {{represent}} the 15 th year of restoration and associated monitoring of central California seabird colonies {{conducted by the}} Common Murre Restoration Project (CMRP). These efforts began in 1996 to restore breeding colonies of seabirds, especially Common Murres (Uria aalge), harmed by the 1986 Apex Houston, 1998 Command, and extended Luckenbach oil spills, gill net fishing, human disturbance, and other factors. From 1995 to 2005, the primary goal was to restore the previously extirpated Devil???s Slide Rock colony using social attraction techniques and to assess restoration needs at other central California colonies. Since 2005, efforts have been directed to surveillance of human disturbance to central <b>California</b> <b>murre</b> colonies, assessing the impacts of that disturbance, and assessing other factors affecting growth of colonies; additionally, the outcome of initial restoration efforts at Devil???s Slide Rock continue to be monitored. This information informs outreach and education efforts conducted by the Seabird Protection Network (coordinated by the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary) and monitors the success of those efforts. The goal of the Seabird Protection Network is to restore central California breeding colonies mainly through reduction of human disturbance. Surveillance and monitoring were conducted almost daily from mid-April to late July at the following Common Murre colonies in central California: Point Reyes; Devil???s Slide Rock & Mainland; and the Castle-Hurricane Colony Complex. Another four colonies were surveyed weekly or bi-weekly including three in the Drakes Bay area (Point Resistance, Millers Point Rocks, and Double Point Rocks) and at San Pedro Rock (near Devil???s Slide). In addition to human disturbance, we measured seasonal attendance patterns and reproductive performance of Common Murres and five other seabird species as well as breeding population sizes for some species. At the Bird Island colony located near the Golden Gate, surveys were conducted three times per week (mainly by volunteers) to follow this recent murre colonization. For aircraft, detection rates were measured {{as the number of}} fixed-wing planes and helicopters observed per hour that flew < 305 m (1000 ft) above sea level (ASL) over colonies. Boat activity was measured as the number of vessels detected per observer hour (hereafter, per hour) that approached within 457 m (1500 ft) of colonies. Aircraft, boat and other anthropogenic disturbance rates were measured as the number of disturbance events per hour. At Point Reyes, combined aircraft and boat activity in 2010 was similar to previous years and the overall disturbance rate was lower than the baseline mean (average of 2005 - 2006, including aircraft, boats and other). In the Drakes Bay area, few aircraft or boats were observed at Point Resistance and Millers Point Rocks. At nearby Double Point Rocks, combined aircraft and boat detection rates were the highest of all monitored colonies. Although overall disturbance rates at Double Point Rocks were relatively high in 2010, they were 46...|$|E

The goal of the Seabird Protection Network is to restore central California breeding colonies primarily through reduction of human- caused disturbance. Surveillance and monitoring were conducted almost daily from mid-April to late July at the following Common Murre colonies in central California: Point Reyes, Devil???s Slide Rock & Mainland, and the Castle-Hurricane Colony Complex. Four additional colonies were surveyed weekly or bi-weekly including three in the Drakes Bay area (Point Resistance, Millers Point Rocks, and Double Point Rocks) and San Pedro Rock (near Devil???s Slide). We measured detection and disturbance rates associated with planes, helicopters, and watercraft (or, boats). Seasonal attendance patterns, productivity, adult co-attendance patterns and reproductive success of Common Murres were also assessed. Additionally, population sizes and/or reproductive success of five other seabird species were assessed. At the Bird Island colony located near the Golden Gate, surveys were conducted three times per week, mainly by volunteers, to follow the recent murre colonization in 2008. At Point Reyes, the combined aircraft and boat detection rate (number of aircraft or boats observed per observer hour) was the lowest of any year monitored, and the combined disturbance rate (disturbance events per observer hour) was the lowest since 2002. Detection and disturbance rates at Drakes Bay colonies were also well below the baseline mean (average of 2005 - 2006, including aircraft, boats, and other). Devil???s Slide Rock & Mainland (DSRM) continued to have the highest combined aircraft and watercraft detection and disturbance rates of all colonies. At DSRM, combined aircraft and watercraft detection rates were lower than the baseline mean, but disturbance rates were higher. Most disturbances were agitation events (i. e., no flushing or displacement). At the Castle - Hurricane Colony Complex, the combined aircraft and boat detection rate was the lowest since 2007, but the disturbance rate was slightly higher than the baseline mean. Unmarked aircraft (e. g., private or charter) were the most commonly observed planes and helicopters and caused the most observed disturbances at all monitored colonies. The next most common source of aircraft disturbance was from military aircraft. The majority of watercraft observed were small private recreational boats (46...|$|E

The goal of the Seabird Protection Network is to restore central California seabird breeding colonies primarily through reduction of human disturbance. In this report, we summarize seabird monitoring results from the 2014 breeding season including human disturbance, productivity, relative population sizes, and other data. At Point Reyes Headlands (PRH), the combined aircraft and watercraft detection rate was less than the baseline mean (average of 2005 - 2006, including aircraft, watercraft, and other), and less than in 2012. The combined disturbance rate at PRH was less than the baseline mean, but greater than in 2012 ??? driven by five agitation events caused by helicopters. Detection and disturbance rates at Drakes Bay Colony Complex (DBCC) were also less than the baseline mean, with no observed disturbance events. Devil???s Slide Rock and Mainland (DSRM) continued to have the greatest combined aircraft and watercraft detection and disturbance rates of all colonies. However, detection and disturbance rates in 2013 were both less than the baseline mean, and less than in 2012. Agitation events accounted for most disturbances, with only four flushing events observed in 2013. At the Castle Hurricane Colony Complex (CHCC), the combined aircraft and watercraft detection rate was less than the baseline mean and 2012 rates, and none resulted in disturbance. General aviation planes and helicopters (e. g., private or charter), followed by military helicopters, and the CDFW survey aircraft were the most commonly observed aircraft and caused the majority of disturbances at all monitored colonies. The majority of watercraft observed were private recreational fishing boats, but none caused any disturbance in 2013. Two vessels were recorded inside state Special Closures at Devil???s Slide Rock, including a private fishing boat and a kayak. Neither vessel caused any disturbance. The aerial photograph count of 2, 001 Common Murres on Devil???s Slide Rock (DSR) was 55...|$|R

The goal of the Seabird Protection Network is to restore central California breeding colonies, primarily through reduction of human disturbance, to compensate for losses during the Luckenbach and Command oil spills. Surveillance and monitoring were conducted almost daily from mid-April to mid-August at the following Common Murre colonies in central California: Point Reyes, Devil???s Slide Rock & Mainland, and the Castle-Hurricane Colony Complex. Another four colonies were surveyed weekly or bi-weekly including three in the Drakes Bay area (Point Resistance, Millers Point Rocks, and Double Point Rocks). Human disturbance rates associated with planes, helicopters, and watercraft were calculated. Seasonal attendance patterns, productivity, adult co-attendance patterns (the percentage of observation time that both parents are present at a nest site) and reproductive performance of Common Murres were also assessed. Additionally, population sizes and/or productivity of five other seabird species were assessed. Bird and nest counts were conducted three times per week at Bird Island and once per week at San Pedro Rock. Detections of aircraft and watercraft (boats) and associated disturbances are reported as a rate per observation hour and compared to a baseline (average of 2005 - 2006 rates). At Point Reyes, the combined aircraft and boat detection rate was less than the baseline mean (including aircraft, boats, and other), but greater than in 2011. The combined disturbance rate was less than any year since 2002. Detection and disturbance rates at Drakes Bay colonies were also less than the baseline mean, with no observed disturbance events. Devil???s Slide Rock & Mainland (DSRM) continued to have the greatest combined aircraft and boat detection and disturbance rates of all colonies. At DSRM, overall detection and disturbance rates were the greatest recorded to date, largely due to fixed-wing aircraft rates. Most disturbances were agitation events (i. e., no flushing or displacement) but several flushing events occurred, mostly from low helicopter overflights. At the Castle-Hurricane Colony Complex, the combined aircraft and boat detection rate was the least since 2007, but the disturbance rate was slightly greater than the baseline mean (but less than in 2011). xiv Unmarked planes and helicopters (e. g., private or charter), followed by military aircraft, were the most commonly observed aircraft and caused the majority of disturbances at all monitored colonies.
