During {{the current}} {{investigation}} experiments for the preparation of alginate beads with aqueous solutions of sodium alginate, calcium lactate or <b>calcium</b> <b>dichloride</b> and dietary fiber in different concentrations: inulin {{with varying degrees of}} polymerization, wheat bran and amidated apple pectin were carried out.

The Ca 2 + cation is seven-coordinated by five O atoms and one N atom of four pyrazine- 2, 3 -dicarboxylate anions, and one water molecule. The complete deprotonated pyrazine- 2, 3 -dicarboxylate anion adopts a &# 956; 4 -coordination mode, {{resulting in the}} formation of a three-dimensional structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} conductivity of Geosynthetic Clay Liners for the confinement of waste disposal facilities mainly {{depends on the}} {{hydraulic conductivity}} of the core bentonite clay encased between the two geotextiles. Bentonite clay {{is the most common}} material for Geosynthetic Clay Liners. Even though sodium bentonite has the lowest hydraulic conductivity to water, calcium bentonite is widely used because of low cost and availability. This research concerns the evaluation of the treatment of calcium bentonite with an anionic polymer, Sodium CarboxyMethyl Cellulose (Na-CMC) with HYPER clay technology. Permeability tests were performed in order to compare HYPER clay behaviour to the standard sodium activation treatment of calcium bentonite. Increasing concentrations of <b>calcium</b> <b>dichloride,</b> 5 mM – 100 mM – 200 mM, were used as hydrating solutions. Test results showed the beneficial effect of the anionic polymer treatment on the hydraulic performance of the clay analysed in the long term...|$|E
40|$|Digital (droplet) {{microfluidics}} (DµF) is {{a powerful}} platform for automated lab-on-a-chip procedures, ranging from quantitative bioassays such as RT-qPCR to complete mammalian cell culturing. The simple MEMS processing protocols typically employed to fabricate DµF devices limit their functionality to two dimensions, and hence constrain the applications for which these devices can be used. This paper describes the integration of vertical functionality into a DµF platform by stacking two planar digital microfluidic devices, altering the electrode fabrication process, and incorporating channels for reversibly translating droplets between layers. Vertical droplet movement was modeled to advance the device design, and three applications that were previously unachievable using a conventional format are demonstrated: (1) solutions of <b>calcium</b> <b>dichloride</b> and sodium alginate were vertically mixed to produce a hydrogel with a radially symmetric gradient in crosslink density; (2) a calcium alginate hydrogel was formed within the through-well to create a particle sieve for filtering suspensions passed from one layer to the next; and (3) a cell spheroid formed using an on-chip hanging-drop was retrieved for use in downstream processing. The general capability of vertically delivering droplets between multiple stacked levels represents a processing innovation that increases DµF functionality and has many potential applications...|$|E
