6000|$|Our joy in {{your good}} news is the only gleam of {{anything}} of the sort with which we have been {{for a long time}} visited; as an admirable letter from you to Aleck, which he read me last night, seemed to indicate (more than anything we have yet had from home) some definite impression of. Yes indeed, we are steeped in the very air of anxieties and horrors--and they all seem, where we are situated, so little far away. I have written two or three times to Harry, and also to your Mother, since leaving London, and Peggy and Aleck in particular have had liberal responses from each. But those received up to now rather suggest a failure quite to grasp the big black realities of the whole case roundabout us far and near. The War blocks out of course--for that you have realised--every other object and question, every other thinkability, in life; and I needn't tell you what a strain it all is on the nerves and the faith of a poor old damaged septuagenarian uncle. The extraordinary thing is the way that every interest and every connection that seemed still to exist up to exactly a month ago has been as annihilated as if it had never lifted a head in the world at all.... That isn't, with reflection, so far as one can [...] "calmly" [...] reflect, all that I see; on the contrary there is a way of looking at what is taking place that is positively helpful, or almost, when one can concentrate on it at all--which is difficult. I mean the view that the old systematic organisation and consecration of such forces as are now let loose, of their unspeakable infamy and insanity, is undergoing such a triumphant exhibition in respect to the loathsomeness and madness of the same, that it is what we must all together be most face to face with when the actual blackness of the smoke shall have cleared away. But I can't go into that now, any more than I can make this letter long, dearest Bill and dearest Alice, or can say anything just now in particular reference to what is happening.... You get in Boston probably about as much news as we do, for this is enormously, and quite justly, under <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities,</b> and nothing reaches us but what {{is in the interest of}} operations, precautions, every kind of public disposition and consideration, for the day and hour. This country is making an enormous effort--so far as its Fleet is concerned a triumphantly powerful and successful one; and there is a great deal more of the effort to come. Roughly speaking, Germany, immensely prepared and with the biggest fighting-power ever known on earth, has staked her all on a colossal onslaught, and yet is far even yet from having done with it what she believed she would in the time, or on having done it as she first designed. The horrors of the crucifixion of Belgium, the general atrocity of the Kaiser's methods, haven't even yet entirely availed, and there are chances not inconsiderable, even while I write, that they won't entirely avail; that is that certain things may still happen to prevent them. But it is all for the moment tremendously dark and awful. We kind of huddle together here and try to lead our lives in such small dignity and piety as we may.... More and more is it a big fact in the colossal public situation that Germany is absolutely locked up at last in a maritime way, with all the seas swept of her every vessel of commerce. She appears now absolutely corked, her commerce and communications dead as a doornail, and the British activity in undisturbed possession of the seas. This by itself is an enormous service, an immeasurable and finally determinant one, surely, rendered by this country to the Allies. But after hanging over dearest Alice ever so blessingly again, and tickling the new little infant phenomenon with a now quite practised old affectionate nose, I must pull off and be just, dearest Bill, your own all-fondest old Uncle, ...|$|E

He also lavished patronage on such scholars as Angelo Mai, Giuseppe Mezzofanti, and Gaetano Moroni. This largesse, however, significantly weakened the finances of the Papal States.|$|E

50|$|Jagan's term {{had not yet}} {{ended when}} another round of labor unrest rocked the colony. The pro-PPP GIWU, which had become an {{umbrella}} group of all labor organizations, called on sugar workers to strike in January 1964. To dramatize their case, Jagan led a march by sugar workers from the interior to Georgetown. This demonstration ignited outbursts of violence that soon escalated beyond the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities.</b> On May 22, the governor finally declared another state of emergency. The situation continued to worsen, and in June the governor assumed full powers, rushed in British troops to restore order, and proclaimed a moratorium on all political activity.

50|$|During Mallery's tenure {{with the}} Signal Corps, he was briefly {{stationed}} at Fort Rice in Dakota Territory, where the indigenous system of communication by signs and gestures attracted his attention. He {{began to make}} note of them, {{which led to a}} parallel investigation of the pictographs on rocks, skins, and bark, of which he made a large number of transcriptions. He foresaw that these customs would ultimately be lost and forgotten as the Indians were brought more and more under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities.</b> Before Mallery began his researches it was generally supposed that the pictographs, some of which were believed to be of pre-Columbian origin, were simply pictures and devoid of meaning. He was gradually convinced that gesture-speech and the cognate pictographs formed a complete system, involving mythology and history and having an important relation to the spoken language.|$|E
50|$|Jakubowicz {{points out}} the danger of forgetting and of the ignorance caused by it. It is {{particularly}} noticeable in his work Pływalnia (Swimming-pool) dedicated to a Poznań synagogue, which in 1940 {{was turned into a}} swimming-pool. Jakubowicz designed a postcard displaying a photo of the synagogue with a Hebrew sign meaning “swimming-pool” on one side, and a photograph of boys swimming in the pool on the other. The original character of the interior is meaningless to them. They do not know it. Unawareness, ignorance and the resulting passiveness, together with a lack of resistance, led throughout the history to the expansion of totalitarian regimes and irreversible modifications of reality. Jakubowicz emphasizes the importance of historical sense as well as of visual awareness, with either one's increase being made possible through art, which also enables spreading of knowledge, beyond the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{thousands}} of Christians in the prisons held small worship communities {{where it was}} possible. In their homes, Christians started to gather in secret. After the Cultural Revolution, there were about 50 million Christians, and they could again gather in their own places of worship. The official Three-self church was under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities,</b> while the house church a retained a large network of underground churches. The number of Christians in China was estimated to increase by about thirty thousand each day. There was an enormous need for Bible teachers and bibles. In the 1980s, China opened up more to receive Western expertise and especially to foreign trade. Today, the Norwegian Pentecostal missionary enthusiasm for China is based mostly on intercession and help for Bible distribution. Bibles are printed both overseas and in China. With an increase {{of tens of thousands}} believing in Jesus each day, the biblical requirements are enormous.|$|E

On paper, the party was organised on the basis of democratic centralism, which assumed a democratic appointment of authorities, making decisions, and managing its activity. Yet in fact, the key roles were played by the Central Committee, its Politburo and Secretariat, which were subject to the strict <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> of the Soviet Union.

40|$|In {{the face}} of climatic changes and {{environmental}} problems, indigenous knowledge is increasingly being accepted {{as an alternative to}} Western science in conservation policies. While indigenous knowledge may help indigenous empowerment, it is also placed under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> whose science and structures it is meant to challenge. Indigenous knowledge is therefore the subject of a two-way appropriation by indigenous peoples as well as environmental authorities. This process is illustrated by the Sami reindeer herders in the World Heritage site of Laponia in Arctic Sweden, who are negotiating a new joint management scheme with Swedish authorities, including a Sami majority on the park board. Sami indigenous knowledge will form the basis for the new management policies, but with minimal changes to existing national legislation. While the Sami will gain some political control, Swedish authorities will also gain access to and control over Sami indigenous knowledge, hence a two-way appropriation...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} descriptive macroeconometric {{models with}} random coefficients {{in order to}} capture the possible relationship between the coefficients in the equations of the variables under the (partial) <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> {{and those in the}} behavioral equations as observed in the rational expectation framework. This relationship is the main element of the Lucas Critique. This model family allows us to test for the immunity to this critique and implicitly for the presence of contemporaneous breaks as in the approach proposed by Hendry [1988] and Engle and Hendry [1993]. When the immunity is rejected, we then can also propose a measure of the consequences of some particular changes in the coefficients involved in the policy equation on modeled macroeconomic variables. We illustrate this approach on French data. Starting from descriptive considerations, we specify a system of linear equations with random coefficients to study the response of the French household consumption to the changes in monetary policy linked to the entry in EMS and the Maastricht Treaty. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to reveal}} how religiousness {{is in the}} United States based on the ideas of Roger Williams. From various sources, there are three things that form the {{background}} of Roger Williams thinking. Those are {{when he was in}} England, where the seekers of truth burned alive in front of his house, the indication of churches dominating on the people’s life and the using of their force on one’s beliefs; his acquaintance with the Indians who taught him that anyone can say honestly without having to swear {{in the name of the}} holy book, and that anyone can help each other without having or within one belief. Religiousness in America in terms of the thinking of Roger Williams is that the people have freedom to show their belief through both deeds and symbols as long as it does not annoy the others. The good and tolerant deeds are actually needed in a multicultural society. Religiousness means someone more aware of his choice in choosing a belief; his worship to the Lord was not as something imposed because of the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities...</b>|$|E
