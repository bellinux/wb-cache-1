60|$|But we {{must speak}} of candles {{as they are}} in commerce. Here are a couple of candles {{commonly}} called dips. They are made of lengths of <b>cotton</b> <b>cut</b> off, hung up by a loop, dipped into melted tallow, taken out again and cooled, then re-dipped until there is an accumulation of tallow round the cotton. In order that you may have an idea of the various characters of these candles, you see these which I hold in my hand--they are very small, and very curious. They are, or were, the candles used by the miners in coal mines. In olden times the miner had to find his own candles; and it was supposed that a small candle would not so soon set fire to the fire-damp in the coal mines as a large one; and for that reason, as well as for economy's sake, he had candles made of this sort--20, 30, 40, or 60 to the pound. They have been replaced since then by the steel-mill, and then by the Davy-lamp, and other safety-lamps of various kinds. I have here a candle that was taken out of the Royal George[1], it is said, by Colonel Pasley. It has been sunk in the sea for many years, subject to the action of salt water. It shews you how well candles may be preserved; for though it is cracked about and broken a good deal, yet, when lighted, it goes on burning regularly, and the tallow resumes its natural condition as soon as it is fused.|$|E

30|$|We {{evaluated}} cone flammability, fire sustainability, {{and consumption}} (sensu Fonda and Varner 2004) using a brick surface burn table ventilated by a fume hood. We weighed each cone before placing it on three kerosenesoaked <b>cotton</b> strings <b>cut</b> {{to the length}} of the cone. The strings were laid parallel on a metal tray, spaced evenly relative to cone diameter. We measured the weight of the tray, kerosenesoaked strings, and cone before ignition. We ignited the kerosene-soaked strings with a propane torch and started two timers upon cone ignition. Following Fonda and Varner (2004), we stopped the first timer when flames disappeared. The second timer measured total burning time and ran until smoke or embers were no longer visible, whichever was later. Pilot observations indicated that some combustion continued for several hours after smoke and embers ceased to be visible, but the mass loss was minimal (1 % to 2 %) so we adhered to the burning time protocol of Fonda and Varner (2004).|$|R

5000|$|In 1937, Joseph A.

Around this time, there was industry concern that sanitary products using nylon, labeled as cotton balls, were going to crowd out cotton balls actually containing cotton, harming cotton-exporting regions. In 1986, Johnson & Johnson, a manufacturer of cotton balls, published advertisements stating that [...] "doctors advise" [...] cotton balls over [...] "synthetic puffs".

The wet thin line swished like scratched silk running through the dark fingers of the man, and the plunge of the lead close to the ship's side made a vanishing silvery scar upon the golden glitter; then after an interval the voice of the young Malay uplifted and long-drawn declared the depth of the water in his own language.|$|R
