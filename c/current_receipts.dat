40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "State and local governments provide an array of services to their residents, such as primary and secondary education, libraries, police and fire services, social programs, roads and other infrastructure, public colleges and universities, and more. These subnational governments may face fiscal stress similar to the federal government. Given {{the nature of the}} partnership among levels of government in providing services to Americans and the economic interrelationships among levels of government, understanding potential future fiscal conditions of the state and local government sector is important for federal policymaking. To provide Congress and the public with this broader context, we developed a fiscal model of the state and local sector. This report describes this model and provides (1) simulations of the state and local government sector's long-term fiscal outlook, (2) an analysis of the underlying causes of potential fiscal difficulties for the sector, (3) a discussion {{of the extent to which}} the long-term simulations are sensitive to alternative assumptions, and (4) an examination of how the state and local government sector could add to future federal fiscal challenges. The potential fiscal outcomes of the state and local government sector are projected through two fiscal balance measures: net lending or borrowing and what we call the operating balance. Net lending or borrowing [...] which is roughly analogous to the federal unified surplus or deficit [...] is a measure of the balance of all receipts and expenditures during a given time frame. Historically, total expenditures have usually exceeded total receipts, and the sector issues debt to cover part of the costs of its capital projects. As such, net lending or borrowing typically measures the need for the sector to borrow funds or draw down assets to cover its expenditures. The operating balance net of funds for capital expenditures [...] referred to in this report as the "operating balance" [...] is a measure of the ability of the sector to cover its current expenditures out of <b>current</b> <b>receipts,</b> that is, the balance of expenditures and receipts related to activities taking place in a given year. Most states have some sort of requirement to balance operating budgets. Projects with longer time frames are typically budgeted separately from the operating budgets and financed by a combination of <b>current</b> <b>receipts,</b> federal grants, and the issuance of debt. Because some <b>current</b> <b>receipts</b> may be used to fund part of longer-term investments, we developed a measure of the operating balance that makes adjustments for the extent to which <b>current</b> <b>receipts</b> are unavailable to fund current expenditures because they have been spent on longer-term projects, such as investments in buildings and roads. ...|$|E

There are few population-based studies on hypertension epidemiology to guide public health strategies in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a community-based strategy that integrated screening for HIV and non-communicable diseases, we determined the prevalence, awareness, treatment rates, and sociodemographic factors associated with hypertension in rural Uganda. Methods: A household census was performed to enumerate the population in Kakyerere parish in Mbarara district, Uganda. A multi-disease community-based screening campaign for hypertension, diabetes, and HIV was then conducted. During the campaign, all adults received a blood pressure (BP) measurement and completed a survey examining sociodemographic factors. Hypertension was defined as elevated BP (≥ 140 /≥ 90 mmHg) on the lowest of three BP measurements or current use of antihypertensives. Prevalence was calculated and standardized to age distribution. Sociodemographic factors associated with hypertension were evaluated using a log-link Poisson regression model with robust standard errors.

Methods: All adult HIV-infected patients with documented S. aureus bacteremia admitted to the University of Maryland Medical Center between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005 were included. CA-MRSA was defined as a USA 300 MRSA isolate with the MBQBLO spa-type motif and positive for both the arginine catabolic mobile element and Panton-Valentin Leukocidin.

40|$|This article {{looks at}} various ways of {{investing}} the money of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation in Russian financial assets (bank deposits, government and corporate securities) and surveys world experience in investing pension funds' resources. A common {{rule of thumb}} for sound investment is a preference for investing in market-based government securities. However, investments in large companies with a high rating, mutual funds, real estate, and other high-yield assets are also widely used in countries with a reliable and well-established financial system and prudential oversight. The portfolios of U. S. pension funds consist primarily of securities: bonds (government, corporate, and mortgage bonds) and stocks. The yield for corporate pension plans in the United States is somewhat {{higher than that of}} state and municipal pension plans, which is due to the higher portion of stocks in the portfolios of corporate pension funds (and the higher level of risk). The social security fund in the United States (Old Age and Survivors' Insurance Fund; OASIF), which pays out pensions, was created in 1935. OASIF is presently experiencing financial difficulties and makes payments from its <b>current</b> <b>receipts,</b> rather than from accumulated income, which means that it is essentially a distribution fund. The balance in OASIF is invested in low-yield U. S. government bonds. Particularly in developing countries, pension funds are under strict government control. There are five main types of restrictions on investments: � on assets (a ceiling on certain types of assets in a fund's portfolio); � on risk (the greatest acceptable risk associated with a security); � on concentration of ownership (a ceiling on the portion of an individual company's total amount of shares that a fund may own); � on the issuers (a ceiling on the portion of individual companies'assets in a fund's portfolio); and � on securities (a ceiling on individual types of securities). Moreover, most countries permit a pension fund to invest in only those securities for which the risk has been evaluated (for example, BBB in Chile). In addition to these rules, restrictions are frequently placed on the concentration of assets. Countries with pension funds that have been operating for a long time usually set a limit on the minimum investments in government bonds (15 - 50 percent of all assets) or on the maximum investments in stocks (20 - 30 percent). Most countries set limits (16 percent on the average for developed countries) on pension funds'investments in foreign securities. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{local public}} finance in Brazil, {{with a focus}} on how federal and state government policies affect local spending and revenue generation. In Chapter I, I provide a descriptive analysis of local public finance in Brazil, {{with a focus on}} local revenue generation. In addition to describing the system of public finance in Brazil from a municipal perspective, I discuss the major challenges facing local governments in Brazil and in other low and middle income countries and present the reader with a descriptive picture of local revenue generation in Brazilian municipalities using publicly available data on municipal accounting records, municipal population and GDP, and municipal revenue generation infrastructure and administration. In Chapter II, I study the relationship between intergovernmental transfers and local revenue generation in Brazil. A major consideration in designing an intergovernmental transfer system is the concern that government transfers may "crowd out" local revenue generation. While traditional public finance theory suggests that this will be the case, empirical findings often refute this theoretical prediction in favor of the so-called Flypaper Effect. I take advantage of exogenous changes to state formulas determining the municipalities' share of value-added tax resources as an instrument for endogenous transfers to estimate local revenue generation responses to transfers. I find no evidence that government transfers reduce local per capita revenue generation in the context of two states in Northeastern Brazil, contributing to the limited body of rigorous evidence finding that intergovernmental transfers do not necessarily reduce incentives for local revenue generation and that the Flypaper Effect can indeed exist in certain contexts. In Chapter III, I measure the impact of Brazil's personnel expenditure limits imposed as a component of its Law of Fiscal Responsibility, implemented in 2001. Personnel expenditure limitations require that municipalities spend no more than 60 % of liquid <b>current</b> <b>receipts</b> on personnel. I measure the expenditure limit's impacts on a series of public finance outcomes by comparing changes in outcomes among those bound by the limits (those that were initially above the limit) to those just below the limit using a difference-in-difference regression framework with municipality fixed effects and controlling for state-specific flexible time trends. Chapter III adds to the large body of literature examining the impacts of tax and expenditure limits (TELs) but {{is one of the few}} to do so outside of the US context. It is also one of the few studies of expenditure limitations rather than tax limitations, as most of the US TELs are focused on limiting taxation rather than spending. While Brazil's personnel expenditure limits are generally successful in reducing personnel expenditures, municipalities seem to be substituting non-personnel expenditures for personnel expenditures rather than slowing the growth of total expenditures. At the same time, the expenditure limits seem to encourage municipalities to ease their spending constraints by increasing revenues where they can. The net effect is a small but significant reduction in deficit spending...|$|E

The main task of the pension system of any country in the world is to ensure the corresponding stable level of incomes of pensioners {{and at the same time}} maintain their financial stability. The increase in the proportion of pensioners increases the burden on pension systems, and mainly measures taken by countries are aimed at reducing pension costs and parametric reforms. Methodology. This article investigates the prerequisites and consequences of reforming the pension systems of the Member States of the Organization for International Cooperation and Development. Considered measures to ensure the financial stability of pension systems of the countries concerned, increased the social and stimulating role of pension insurance in the society. The methodological basis of the article is methods of scientific cognition, which enable to expose basic conformities to the law of development of the pension systems, priority ways to ensure their financial sustainability. Such methods are in particular used: analysis and synthesis – during research of financial indicators of pension systems; systematization – for revealing methods for reforming pension systems, their detailed analysis and the definition of their features; scientific abstraction – with the purpose of forming theoretical generalizations and conclusions. Results. The article investigates the trends of reforming pension insurance systems in some countries. It is established that today the main characteristics of pension reforms in foreign countries are increasing the retirement age, improving the solidary component of the pension system, reducing the role of state pension insurance. Some countries raise their contribution rates; the conditions for early retirement are becoming tougher. Almost nobody decided to reduce the nominal size of pensions, but some countries introduce automatic adjustment of their size depending on the growth of life expectancy, incomes and expenditures of the pension system. In recent years, a number of countries, despite budgetary problems, have introduced tax incentives or co-financing voluntary savings to increase the proportion of citizens taking part in them. Others used nonfinancial incentives to expand coverage. The article outlines the main directions of reforming the pension system in Ukraine, namely, the expansion of the tax base for the working population, the introduction of the second pillar of the pension system, and the popularization of individual funded programs.

While efficacy itself and career-oriented behaviors have been widely studied, the current investigation used as its subjects Wisconsin participants in the welfare reform program initiated in 1997. The welfare reform program places stringent work requirements and limits time benefits for recipients, making planning for self-sufficiency essential. Efficacy beliefs and planning behavior among welfare reform recipients have not previously been systematically studied. To investigate the role of demographic variables and efficacy on planning processes, analyses using data gathered from 184 W- 2 recipient subjects were performed. Preliminary analysis revealed significant correlations among many of the demographic and test variables. Exploratory analysis investigating {{the relationship between}} familial use of public assistance and <b>current</b> <b>receipt</b> of similar benefits provided significant results as well lending support to previous studies that explored the existence of a social component to welfare use. Multiple regression analyses identified both marital status and level of participation in W- 2 as predictors of both efficacy and planning behavior. Efficacy also predicted planning scores. The combined effects of the demographic variables and efficacy scores were not more predictive of planning scores than either individually as had been hypothesized. The current study provides a descriptive and meaningful look at self-efficacy and planning processes. These findings have implications for research as well as for intervention programs that may have potential in the long run to affect participation in public assistance programs.

40|$|Three interrelated issues must {{be faced}} in {{assessing}} the future of OASI. I shall discuss each in turn. Balancing Contributions and Benefits. The overriding long-run issue about OASI is the balance between the tax contributions of {{the young and the}} benefits of the old. The system is now geared to scale up benefits automatically so as to maintain the ratio of benefits to contemporaneous wages, the replacement ratio, at its historical level of roughly 40 percent. Payroll tax rates are the residual balancing item in the OASI financial equation. They have been raised steadily for years, and according to current projections they will have to be raised substantially next century if the replacement ratio is to be maintained. The generations involved, however, may at some point prefer to move to or toward a different option-freezing the tax rates and adjusting future benefits instead. This would mean that in the 21 st century the benefit/wage ratio would fall; OASI benefits would still be rising in absolute purchasing power, but they would decline relative to the wages of active workers. It is not too soon to begin serious consideration of the options. Erosion of Confidence. The confidence of young workers in Social Security has eroded in recent years. Some are worried that the system will go broke. Others perceive that their rate of return on the payroll tax contributions they and their employers make will be quite low, in contrast to the interest rates they observe in financial markets today. They wonder why participation itself should be compulsory. The link between the contributions of, or on behalf of, any individual participant and his or her eventual benefits is quite loose, and quite mysterious. The system is a hybrid, mixing social retirement insurance with some intragenerational redistribution in favor of workers with low earnings. This is bound to diminish the rates of return high wage workers perceive they can earn through OASI. Old issues return anew: Should OASI be made more purely an insurance program, letting the general federal budget handle redistribution via needs-tested transfers? Should the link between contributions and benefits be actuarially fair for individual participants? Should the benefit entitlements earned by past contributions be reported regularly and clearly to participants throughout their careers? Should compulsory participation be limited to defined levels of contributions and benefits? As Robert Ball recounts in Chapter 1 of this volume, the founders of Social Security confronted these questions and compromised. Compromises, even theirs, are not graven in stone. Times, circumstances, and attitudes change. At the end of this chapter I shall sketch, as an option worth considering, a system that links contributions and benefits more explicitly and tightly. Financing Social Security. The issues just raised regarding the links between contributions and benefits for individual participants are related to questions about the financing of the system as whole. Until now Social Security has been mainly a pay-as-you-go system, using its <b>current</b> <b>receipts</b> from workers' contributions to pay its current benefits. Its trust fund, as its reserves are called, has been deliberately kept small. Under the 1983 legislation, this fund will grow to unprecedented heights relative to annual outlays over the next 15 to 20 years. Thereafter it is projected to decline, and to vanish after midcentury. A case can be made on macroeconomic grounds for a funded system in preference to pay-as-you-go. Full funding would mean a trust fund commensurate to OASI's liabilities for the future benefits accumulation of such a fund, it can be argued, would add to national saving and investment enough productive capital to yield the promised benefits. That yield might well be a higher rate of return than pay-as-you-go can offer. History cannot be rerun. A shift to funding would take nearly a half century to accomplish. Moreover, the proposal inevitably raises the question of the relation between Social Security trust funds and the overall federal budget. I shall discuss these financial issues, and in my sketch of possible reforms for the next century I shall describe how the long transition to a funded system might be managed.

40|$|Abstract Background HIV {{patients}} are {{at increased risk}} of development of infections and infection-associated poor health outcomes. We aimed to 1) assess the prevalence of USA 300 community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) among HIV-infected patients with S. aureus bloodstream infections and. 2) determine risk factors for infective endocarditis and in-hospital mortality among patients in this population. Methods All adult HIV-infected patients with documented S. aureus bacteremia admitted to the University of Maryland Medical Center between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005 were included. CA-MRSA was defined as a USA 300 MRSA isolate with the MBQBLO spa-type motif and positive for both the arginine catabolic mobile element and Panton-Valentin Leukocidin. Risk factors for S. aureus -associated infective endocarditis and mortality were determined using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Potential risk factors included demographic variables, comorbid illnesses, and intravenous drug use. Results Among 131 episodes of S. aureus bacteremia, 85 (66 %) were MRSA of which 47 (54 %) were CA-MRSA. Sixty-three patients (48 %) developed endocarditis and 10 patients (8 %) died in the hospital on the index admission Patients with CA-MRSA {{were significantly more likely to}} develop endocarditis (OR = 2. 73, 95 % CI = 1. 30, 5. 71). No other variables including comorbid conditions, <b>current</b> <b>receipt</b> of antiretroviral therapy, pre-culture severity of illness, or CD 4 count were significantly associated with endocarditis and none were associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions CA-MRSA was significantly associated with an increased incidence of endocarditis in this cohort of HIV patients with MRSA bacteremia. In populations such as these, in which the prevalence of intravenous drug use and probability of endocarditis are both high, efforts must be made for early detection, which may improve treatment outcomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Hypertension {{is one of}} {{the largest}} causes of {{preventable}} morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are few population-based studies on hypertension epidemiology to guide public health strategies in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a community-based strategy that integrated screening for HIV and non-communicable diseases, we determined the prevalence, awareness, treatment rates, and sociodemographic factors associated with hypertension in rural Uganda. 				 				 					 						Methods 					A household census was performed to enumerate the population in Kakyerere parish in Mbarara district, Uganda. A multi-disease community-based screening campaign for hypertension, diabetes, and HIV was then conducted. During the campaign, all adults received a blood pressure (BP) measurement and completed a survey examining sociodemographic factors. Hypertension was defined as elevated BP (&# 8805; 140 /&# 8805; 90 &# 160;mmHg) on the lowest of three BP measurements or current use of antihypertensives. Prevalence was calculated and standardized to age distribution. Sociodemographic factors associated with hypertension were evaluated using a log-link Poisson regression model with robust standard errors. 				 				 					 						Results 					Community participation in the screening campaign was 65 %, including 1245 women and 1007 men. The prevalence of hypertension was 14. 6 %; awareness of diagnosis (38. 1 %) and <b>current</b> <b>receipt</b> of treatment (20. 6 %) were both low. Age-standardized to the WHO world standard population, hypertension prevalence was 19. 8 %, which is comparable to 21. 6 % in the US and 18. 4 % in the UK. Sociodemographic factors associated with hypertension included increasing age, male gender, overweight, obesity, diabetes, alcohol consumption, and family history. Prevalence of modifiable factors was high: 28. 3 % women were overweight/obese and 24. 1 % men consumed &# 8805; 10 alcoholic drinks per month. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					We found a substantial burden of hypertension in rural Uganda. Awareness and treatment of hypertension is low in this region. Enhanced community-based education and prevention efforts tailored to addressing modifiable factors are needed...|$|R

40|$|Melanoma {{incidence}} {{is increased}} after organ transplantation, {{but there is}} uncertainty as to why this occurs. Diagnoses of invasive melanoma were ascertained in 8, 152 kidney transplant recipients (1982 - 2003) by linking national Australian population-based registers, the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry, and the Australian National Cancer Statistics Clearing House. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and standardized incidence ratios were used to compare melanoma risk during periods of transplant function and failure. Standardized incidence ratios were also computed by time since transplantation. Risk factors were examined using multivariate Poisson regression. Linkage identified 82 melanomas (134 / 100, 000 person-years). Incidence was lower after resumption of dialysis and reduction of immune suppression than during transplant function [IRR, 0. 09; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 0. 01 - 0. 66]. During first transplant function, melanoma (n = 74) relative risk peaked {{in the second year}} and declined linearly thereafter (P trend = 0. 03). During first transplant function, risk was positively associated with increasing year of age (IRR, 1. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 03 - 1. 07) and receipt of lymphocyte-depleting antibody (IRR, 1. 73; 95 % CI, 1. 05 - 2. 84). Female sex (IRR, 0. 57; 95 % CI, 0. 35 - 0. 94), non-Caucasian race (IRR, 0. 15; 95 % CI, 0. 02 - 1. 05), and increasing time since transplantation (P trend = 0. 06) were inversely associated with risk. The incidence pattern and risk factor profile for melanoma after transplantation strongly suggest that the <b>current</b> <b>receipt,</b> intensity, and possibly the recency of iatrogenic immunosuppression increase melanoma risk. Melanoma risk was also associated with proxy indicators of high personal sun exposure and sensitivity. These findings show the marked influence of immunologic control over melanoma incidence.
