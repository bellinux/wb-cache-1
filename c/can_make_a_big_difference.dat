2500|$|The Tipping Point: How Little Things <b>Can</b> <b>Make</b> <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Difference</b> is {{the debut}} book by Malcolm Gladwell, first {{published}} by Little Brown in 2000. Gladwell defines {{a tipping point}} as [...] "the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point". The book seeks to explain and describe the [...] "mysterious" [...] sociological changes that mark everyday life. As Gladwell states: [...] "Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses do". The examples of such changes in his book include the rise in popularity and sales of Hush Puppies shoes in the mid-1990s and the steep drop in New York City's crime rate after 1990.|$|E

Considerably narrowing the widening state-society gap, however, it has endowed Iran with a normative surge of soft power, ripening the ground for a new way of statecraft that can bring about a whole change of identity for the state.

Malcolm Gladwell popularized this idea in his 2000 bestseller, “The Tipping Point: How Little Things <b>Can</b> <b>Make</b> <b>A</b> <b>Big</b> Difference”. In his book, Mr. Gladwell uses the example of an epidemic such as measles which starts with a very few cases, but reaches a point at which the spread is rapid and daunting in its scope.
