5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 1952, Jacobs {{assumed a}} leading role in the Orthodox community's {{campaign}} for the abolition of New York State's Blue Law, which mandated the <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>businesses</b> on Sundays. As chairman of the Joint Committee for a Fair Sabbath Law, Jacobs led delegations of Jewish leaders to Albany to lobby legislators on the issue, and worked hard to mobilize Christian support for abolition of the law. Jacobs utilized his contacts in the Madison Club, the key local Democratic Party branch in Brooklyn, to advance the Sabbath Law effort. The campaign represented one of the earliest organized forays by Orthodox Jews into the world of American political lobbying. They achieved a partial victory in 1963, when the state legislature agreed to permit businesses in New York City to open on Sundays. Two years later, the rule was extended to the rest of the state.|$|R
