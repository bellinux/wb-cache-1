2500|$|Cable & Wireless Guernsey/Sure Sure in Guernsey started {{rolling out}} 20Mbit/s on their Sure Internet Pro service in January 2011. Up to 20Mbit/s download, 1024kbit/s upload, 20:1 <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> ...|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} networking, the <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{the ratio}} of the potential maximum demand to the actual bandwidth. The higher the <b>contention</b> <b>ratio,</b> the greater the number of users that may be trying to use the actual bandwidth at any one time and, therefore, thelower the effective bandwidth offered, especially at peak times.|$|E
5000|$|Up {{until the}} launch of [...] "Max" [...] services, the only ADSL {{packages}} available via BT Wholesale were known as IPStream Home 250, Home 500, Home 1000 and Home 2000 (<b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> of 50:1); and Office 500, Office 1000, and Office 2000 (<b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> of 20:1). The number in the product name indicates the downstream data rate in kilobits per second. The upstream data rate is up to 250 kbit/s for all products.|$|E
50|$|<b>Contention</b> <b>ratios</b> are {{no longer}} officially stated either, except that the Office {{products}} will generally see a reduced level of contention to their Home counterparts. This {{is the product of}} amalgamating Home and Office users onto a single consolidated, but larger, virtual path.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the nature}} of peer to peer serving means that each user {{of the system is}} also a server. The upload speed of {{standard}} home broadband connections is usually a fraction of the download speed, so several upload sources may be required by each additional peer. Additionally, on services with high <b>contention</b> <b>ratios</b> or poorly configured switches, large numbers of people attempting to use the service may slow all internet usage to unusable speeds. Acting as an upload server to the limit of ones upload bandwidth increases the round trip time for webpage requests, making web browsing while using PPS.tv difficult.|$|R
50|$|Since 2003, BT {{has been}} {{introducing}} SDSL to exchanges {{in many of}} the major cities. Services are currently offered at upload/download speeds of 256 kbit/s, 512 kbit/s, 1 Mbit/s or 2 Mbit/s. Unlike ADSL, which is typically 256 kbit/s upload, SDSL upload speeds are the same as the download speed. BT usually provide a new copper pair for SDSL installs, which can be used only for the SDSL connection. At a few hundred pounds a quarter, SDSL is significantly more expensive than ADSL, but is significantly cheaper than a leased line. SDSL is marketed to businesses and offers low <b>contention</b> <b>ratios,</b> and in some cases, a service level agreement. At present, the BT Wholesale SDSL enablement programme has stalled, most probably {{due to a lack of}} uptake.|$|R

5000|$|The company {{provides}} {{wireless broadband}} services for residential and business customers, including up to 4Mb symmetric DSL links (4:1 <b>contention</b> <b>ratio).</b> Services {{are provided by}} means of transmitters located on high points (e.g. tall buildings or hills). [...] these {{are located in the}} main cities in the Republic of Ireland, providing local services in those urban areas. Trading as NTR Broadband the company also provide broadband services in Northern Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Most {{broadband}} Internet {{users in}} Thailand {{complain about the}} ISPs {{not being able to}} provide the speeds they promised. Many Internet service providers have high <b>contention</b> <b>ratios</b> on home ADSL packages, sometimes up to 1:50. There was also limited international bandwidth due to CAT Telecom being the sole provider of international Internet gateway, but this has improved since the liberalization of Internet gateway operations in 2005. At that time, most ISPs focus on expanding their domestic connections to accommodate online gaming demands. This led to a come-back of premium ADSL packages at a higher price point for premium home users and corporate customers. Although many users still argue that these packages will still not improve the international bandwidth availability for home users. Internet service providers are usually also criticized for throttling BitTorrent traffic.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new channel selection strategy for reliable contentionaware data dissemination in multi-hop cognitive radio network. The key challenge {{here is to}} select channels providing a good tradeoff between connectivity and contention. In other words, channels with good opportunities for communication due to (1) low primary radio nodes (PRs) activities, and (2) limited <b>contention</b> of cognitive <b>ratio</b> nodes (CRs) acceding that channel, have to be selected. Thus, by dynamically exploring residual resources on channels and by monitoring the number of CRs on a particular channel, SURF allows building a connected network with limited contention where reliable communication can take place. Through simulations, we study the performance of SURF when compared with three other related approaches. Simulation results confirm that our approach is effective in selecting the best channels for efficient and reliable multi-hop data dissemination...|$|R

50|$|A contended {{service is}} a service which offers (or {{attempts}} to offer) the users of the network a minimum statistically guaranteed <b>contention</b> <b>ratio,</b> while typically offering peaks of usage of up to the maximum bandwidth supplied to the user. Contended services are usually much cheaper to provide than uncontended services, although they only reduce the backbone traffic costs for the users, and do not reduce the costs of providing and maintaining equipment for connecting to the network.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the BE and O2 brands being delivered over the same network, since 10 March 2008, BE/O2 resold wholesale access to its network to other providers. The first of these companies was Vaioni, which launched an [...] "up to 20 Mbit/s business class ADSL2+ service" [...] featuring up to 2.5 Mbit/s upstream and a guaranteed 10:1 <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> with prices starting from £140.99 per month. Vaioni's product, branded 'Ultra 20', was aimed at small to medium-sized businesses and schools.|$|E
50|$|In the US and on {{satellite}} internet connections, the <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is often}} higher, and other formulas are used, such as counting only those users {{who are actually}} online at a particular time. It is also less often divulged by ISPs elsewhere {{than it is in}} the UK. The connection speed for each user will therefore differ depending on the number of computers using the uplink connection at the same time because the uplink (where all the low bandwidth connections join) will only handle the speed that has been implemented on that line.|$|E
50|$|Broadband ADSL Internet {{access is}} offered by JT, Newtel and Sure. JT also offers an SDSL {{wholesale}} and retail service range. JT offers its ADSL services both to wholesale and retail consumers, the majority of which take the 2 Mbit/s downlink and 384 kbit/s uplink configuration however speeds up to 20Mbit/s downstream are available. The contention ratios vary between its various service offerings from 20:1 (business) up to 50:1 (residential). Its SDSL service has a standard 10:1 <b>contention</b> <b>ratio.</b> In 2008 Airtel-Vodafone, and later Sure, entered the broadband market using a 3G USB ‘dongle’. In April 2009 JT announced its 3G 7•2Mbit/s mobile broadband service.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the issues}} with a stated <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is that it is}} not, on its own, {{adequate}} for comparing services. There is a huge difference between 1000 users each on a 2Mbit/s service sharing a 40 Mbit/s pipe, and 50 users each on a 2 Mbit/s service sharing a 2 Mbit/s pipe. In the latter case two users trying to download at the same time means each get 50% of the speed. When there are a 1000 users it would take 20 users maxing out their 2Mbit/s link {{at the same time to}} show any congestion. However both of these would be quoted as 50:1 contention.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, an RADSL (Rate Adaptive Digital Subscriber Line) {{connection}} used to {{be marketed}} with a <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> between 20:1 and 50:1 within the BT network, meaning that 20 to 50 subscribers, each assigned or sold a bandwidth of [...] "up to" [...] 8 Mbit/s for instance, may be sharing 8 Mbit/s of downlink bandwidth (to your home). With the advent of ADSL2+ ("up to" [...] 20 Mbit/s service, though in theory, ADSL2+ provides up to 24 Mbit/s), FTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet) offering 40 Mbit/s services and even FTTP (Fibre to the Premises) offering 100 Mbit/s, BT no longer work on [...] "contention ratio" [...] as a planning rule.|$|E
50|$|Competition {{by users}} {{of a system}} {{for use of the}} same {{facility}} at the same time. This may also be known as oversubscription. The term <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> applies specifically to the number of people connected to an ISP who share a set amount of bandwidth. Typical values would be 50:1 for home users (that is to say that 50 people or lines will vie for the same bandwidth) and 20:1 for business users. It {{is for this reason that}} the shortfall between supplier-claimed access speeds and those experienced by the consumer once signed-up to a contract is particularly bad at just those times when most consumers actually want to use the service.|$|E
50|$|In the past, the {{majority}} of home users used packages with 500 kbit/s (downstream) and 250 kbit/s (upstream) with a 50:1 <b>contention</b> <b>ratio.</b> However, BT Wholesale introduced the option of a new charging structure to ISPs {{which means that the}} wholesale service cost was the same regardless of the ADSL data rate, with charges instead being based on the amount of data transferred. Nowadays, most home users use a package whose data rate is only limited by the technical limitations of their telephone line. Initially this was 2 Mbit/s downstream. Until the advent of widespread FTTC, most home products were first ADSL Max-based (up to 7.15 Mbit/s), using ADSL G.992.1 and then later ADSL2+ (up to 21 Mbit/s).|$|E
5000|$|Contention ratios are {{essentially}} just planning rules {{which are used}} to design a network offering (typically) an Internet service. The perception {{of the quality of}} that service will depend on the actual usage of the users of the service. This is partly why rules such as 20:1 for business and 50:1 for residential users came about. The actual usage demands of users have changed over the years and for evening/weekend traffic residential users can be demanding a lot of bandwidth making 50:1 contention ratios inappropriate. Contention ratios also only really make sense if dealing with relatively consistent speeds. The fact that a single back-haul in the UK could have users at 500 kbit/s and users at 100 Mbit/s makes normal <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> planning a thing of the past. In practice, a well run network aims to avoid links hitting limits, and upgrades the links when they do - this only works where the pricing model allows extra revenue to pay for the higher usage links and this is hitting some [...] "unlimited use" [...] tariffing models.|$|E
30|$|TCPCC is a cross-layer {{approach}} {{conducted by}} Zhang et al. [37]. In this study, the authors {{show that the}} over-injection of conventional TCP window mechanism results in severe contentions, and medium contentions cause network congestion. They also show that, two important metrics, channel utilization (CU) and <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> (CR) {{should be used to}} characterize the network status. Then, based on these two metrics, they propose a new TCP transmission rate control mechanism based on channel utilization and <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> (TCPCC). In this mechanism, each node collects the information about the network busy status and determines the CU and CR accordingly. The CU and CR values fed back through ACK are ultimately determined by the bottleneck node along the flow. The TCP sender controls its transmission rate based on the feedback information.|$|E
40|$|Using {{detailed}} plan-level data, {{this paper}} examines the choice, price {{and quality of}} broadband services available to consumers in Ireland over time. We find modest geographical (county level) variation in broadband services. Hedonic regression analysis is used to value various components of the broadband service. Download and upload speed attract positive valuations, whereas <b>contention</b> <b>ratio</b> is valued negatively as expected. The {{results suggest that the}} marginal valuation of download speed decreases as the speed level increases, with little value currently placed upon speeds above about 60 Mb/s...|$|E
40|$|Transactional memory (TM) [?] {{has been}} widely studied {{over the last decade}} as it {{provides}} a scalable and easyto-use alternative to locks. Over the last years, a wide body of literature has been published on TM, and several variants have been developed, including hardwarebased (HTM), software-based (STM), and distributed (DTM) [?]. One of the key results highlighted by existing research is that, independently {{of the nature of the}} synchronization scheme adopted by a TM platform, its actual performance is strongly workload dependent and affected by a number of complex, often intertwined factors (e. g. duration of transactions, level of data <b>contention,</b> <b>ratio</b> of update vs read-only transactions). This work is based on the belief that most workloads have a natural degree of parallelism, i. e., there is a workload-specific threshold below which adding more threads will improve transaction throughput, and over which new threads will not help and might even degrade performance because of higher contention and aborts rates, even if sufficiently many cores are available. In this position paper we discuss on the importance of adapting the concurrency level to the workload (which we call elastic scaling) in various application settings. Note that related problems have been already addressed in previous research. For instance, Felber et al. [?] tackled the problem of how to tune at run time the number of “locks ” and their coverage of the whole address space in the TINYSTM library. Wang et al. [?] exploit machine learning techniques to select which STM implementation to adopt on the basis of the application workload. Ansari et al. [?] adapt the parallelism of STM applications in order to maintain the transaction abort rate under a predefined level. In the area of replicated relational databases, recent works [?,?] have proposed mechanisms for supporting elastic scaling, namely automatically adapting, i...|$|E
