40|$|We {{present a}} {{software}} approach to mitigate access-driven side-channel attacks that leverage last-level caches (LLCs) shared across <b>cores</b> to <b>leak</b> information between security domains (e. g., tenants in a cloud). Our approach dynamically manages physical memory pages shared between security domains to disable sharing of LLC lines, thus preventing "Flush-Reload" side channels via LLCs. It also manages cacheability of memory pages to thwart cross-tenant "Prime-Probe" attacks in LLCs. We have implemented our approach as a memory management subsystem called CacheBar within the Linux kernel to intervene on such side channels across container boundaries, as containers {{are a common}} method for enforcing tenant isolation in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds. Through formal verification, principled analysis, and empirical evaluation, we show that CacheBar achieves strong security with small performance overheads for PaaS workloads...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the historical overview, remediation procedures, and documenting {{the environmental impact of}} Hanford Nuclear Reservation. As a result of the production and disposal methods of nuclear waste, Hanford site has had major implications on the environment. When production ended in the 1980 s there were more than 100, 000 uranium fuel rods on site. The K-basin, for example, held two nuclear reactors for plutonium production. A combination of <b>core</b> reactors <b>leaking</b> and holding pond overflows leached contaminants into the groundwater. Multiple methods were used to store nuclear waste and hazardous chemicals including holding ponds, unlined pits, trenches, landfills, reverse wells, and underground storage tanks. As a result, contamination has caused major implications on the environment, and contaminated pre-contact archaeological sites including: pre-contact pit houses, hunting and kill sites. In 1994, the remediation process began to extract contaminated water and sediment. The degree to which these sites have been compromised is unknown. This research identifies environmental issues associated with Hanford, and clean-up procedures during remediation processes. It is important to know the history of Hanford and its adverse effects on the environment as well as cultural resources...|$|R
5000|$|For {{applications}} requiring {{very low}} back-reflection, the fiber end-face is polished {{at an angle}} (the typical industry standard being 8°) to prevent light that reflects from the interface from traveling back up the fiber. Because of the angle, the reflected light does not stay in the fiber <b>core</b> but instead <b>leaks</b> out into the cladding. Angle-polished connectors only mate properly to other angle-polished connectors. Mating to a non-angle polished connector causes very high insertion loss. Generally angle-polished connectors have higher insertion loss than good quality straight physical contact ones. [...] "Ultra" [...] quality connectors may achieve comparable back reflection to an angled connector when connected, but an angled connection maintains low back reflection even when the output end of the fiber is unmated.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an input}} and output device that enables illumination, bi-directional data communication, and position sensing on a soft cloth. This “LightCloth ” is woven from diffusive optical fibers. Sensor-emitter pairs attached to bundles of contiguous fibers enable bundle-specific light {{input and output}}. We developed a prototype system that allows full-color illumination and 8 -bit data input by infrared signals. Author Keywords Soft deformable user interface; diffusive optical fiber; illumination; light communication; position sensing. ACM Classification Keywords H. 5. 2. Information interfaces and presentation (e. g., HCI) : User Interfaces. What is LightCloth? An optical fiber typically acts as a waveguide {{from one end to}} the other. Another type of the fiber is “diffusive” optical fiber which leaks some light through micro-scratches on its surface. A cloth woven from such diffusive optical fibers has been used in fashion and spatial design fields for making light-emitting fabric products [1, 2]. A diffusive optical fiber not only leaks light but also receives light incident on its surface. The light entering from the scratches on the surface goes through the <b>core</b> and <b>leaks</b> out from the ends. Focusing on this property, we developed a new fabric I/O (input and output) device, called “LightCloth, ” that enables illumination, bi-directional data communication, and position sensing (Figure 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The steel solidifying process during {{continuous}} casting {{starts in the}} mould, where between 15 and 30 % of total heat is abstracted. The strand withdrawn from the mould should have a solidified shell to ensure a failure free operation of the continuous caster. For a steel {{continuous casting}} process, {{it is necessary to}} obtain the correct shell thickness of the strand forming in the mould. If the shell thickness is insufficient, it will break out and the liquid <b>core</b> will <b>leak,</b> causing pouring of one or more segments of the machine. The presented paper shows the results of calculations of the shell thickness of the strand withdrawn, made with various mathematical models and the ProCAST software. Design/methodology/approach: Three mathematical models with various degree of complexity with a complex numerical model were compared. Similar values of the strand shell thickness were have been received, and small differences result from the degree of complexity of the applied calculation models. Findings: Similar findings related to the shell thickness were obtained. However, the use of more complex models is more likely to give correct and more accurate results. Practical implications: For a failure-free steel continuous casting process, it is necessary to obtain the correct shell thickness of the strand forming in the continuous caster mould. Originality/value: The presented paper compares the values of strand shell thickness obtained on the basis of mathematical models with various degree of complexity with a complex numerical model of the continuous casting process. Similar findings were obtained...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{instability}} of circular vortices is studied numerically {{in the surface}} quasigeostrophic (SQG) model, and their evolutions are {{compared with those of}} barotropically unstable 2 D vortices. The growth rates in the SQG model evidence similarity with their barotropic counterparts for moderate radial gradients of temperature (or of vorticity in the 2 D model). For stronger gradients, SQG vortices are more unstable than 2 D vortices. The nonlinear, finite-amplitude evolutions of perturbed vortices provide evidence that moderately unstable, elliptically perturbed vortices form tripoles. When they are more unstable, they break into two dipoles. Weakly unstable vortices with triangular perturbations form transient quadrupoles that break; they stabilize only for large gradients of mean temperature. Finally, with square perturbations, pentapoles degenerate into dipoles, at least for the range of mean temperature gradients explored here. The analysis of nonlinear stabilizations reveals that the deformation of the vortex <b>core</b> and the <b>leak</b> of its temperature anomaly to the periphery are essential ingredients to stabilize the perturbation at finite amplitude. In conclusion, SQG vortex instability exhibits considerable similarity to the barotropic {{instability of}} 2 D vortices...|$|R
40|$|For {{situations}} in which the standard point kinetic model does not adequately characterize the kinetic behavior of a reflected system, the Avery-Cohn differential equations can be used. However, these equations require that one determine the coupling parameters between the core and the reflector, f{sub cr} and f{sub rc}. The coupling parameter, f{sub cr}, represents {{the probability that a}} neutron in the <b>core</b> will <b>leak</b> into the reflector, and the coupling parameter, f{sub rc}, represents the probability that a neutron in the reflector will scatter back into the core. As discussed in Reference 3, these two coupling parameters can be calculated from the multiplication factor of the bare core, k{sub c}, the effective multiplication factor of the integral system, k{sub eff}, and the fraction of system neutrons absorbed in the core region, P{sub ca}. The methodology presented in Ref. 3 was described for a fully reflected system, but it is also applicable to some types of partially reflected systems. In particular, it is applicable to those systems where neutrons leaving any core surface not contiguous to the reflector have a zero probability of entering the reflector. In other words, these surfaces have a view factor of 0 to all reflector surfaces in the system. However, if the view factor between an unreflected core surface and a reflector surface is not zero, then the aforementioned methodology has to be modified. To calculate f{sub cr}, one must include an estimate of the single-pass probability that a neutron escapes from the core to infinity, f{sub ci}. This is accomplished by including a view factor(s) in the calculations that accounts for the fraction of neutrons that are not traveling on a line intersecting some portion of the reflector. This paper illustrates this modification by assuming the partially reflected system shown in Fig. 1 c...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} twofold; on the one hand it investigates the susceptibility to suffusion of glacial till, and, on the other, it presents approaches to evaluate internal erosion susceptibility of dams composed of this type of <b>core</b> soil. Concentrated <b>leak</b> erosion, backward erosion, contact erosion, and suffusion erosion are the mechanisms associated with the initiation of internal erosion. How these interplay in the continuation phase is still a relatively unresolved issue. In engineering practice, these mechanisms have all been seen in dams with glacial till cores; backward erosion activity as seen in Juktan dam, Juklavatn dam, Grundsjöndam, Wreck Cove dam, and in Brodhead dam; possible suffusion as seen in Lövön dam and in Stenkullafors dam; and, furthermore, signs indicating concentrated leaks, such as in Songa dam. A laboratory program of tests was performed on four natural, non-plastic glacial till soils from the core or its borrow area of existing earth dams in Sweden, and on eight mixtures based on these tills, making in total 12 tests. The longest running for 77 days, and the highest applied gradient was 9. 5, in bounds of what can occur in dam cores. The tests revealed that gradations of low fines content (§ 60 %) are susceptible to suffusion. These are grading characteristics present in the coarse end of the envelope of glacial till cores in many existing dams. Available state-of-the-art assessment criteria for internal stability were evaluated in reference to these experimental data, yielding a modification to the Kenney-Lau adaptation by Li-Fannin. Furthermore, a screening tool for the assessment of internal erosion of dams is proposed, i. e., the unified-plot approach, which combines attributes of the filter gradation and the probable occurrence of internal erosion in a dam. Given the variety of potential mechanism interplaying in the internal erosion of dams with cores of glacial till, it lend confidence to an assessment approach which addresses, susceptibility to several mechanisms.
