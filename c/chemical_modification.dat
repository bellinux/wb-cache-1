5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by <b>chemical</b> <b>modification</b> of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by <b>chemical</b> <b>modification</b> of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E

Among all the existing processes, wood modification with acetic anhydride has been noted for the high anti-shrink or anti-swell efficiency (ASE) attainable without damage to wood. However, acetylation of wood {{has been slow to}} be commercialised due to the cost, corrosion and the entrapment of the acetic acid in wood.

25|$|More {{recently}} {{it has become}} apparent {{that there is a}} significant influence of non-DNA-sequence specific effects on transcription.

25|$|DNA {{methylation}} is {{the process}} in which a methyl group is added to either a cytosine or adenine.

40|$|The {{biodegradable}} polymer such as poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) {{is promising}} in drug delivery applications because its chemical structure {{allows it to}} hydrolyze into non-toxic substances in the human body. In such applications, drugs are embedded in a polymer matrix and released at {{the rate at which}} it degrades. PLLA degradation rate of is a strong function of its crystallinity. Thus, control over crystallinity allows for continuous modification of drug release profiles. The excimer laser is used in this study to induce surface crystallinity changes because its spatially uniform intensity profile is favorable for surface treatment. The effects of excimer laser irradiation on the surface morphology, crystallinity, and <b>chemical</b> <b>modifications</b> are investigated via optical microscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A model is developed to numerically examine the spatial and temporal temperature profiles, as well as the amount of <b>chemical</b> <b>modifications.</b> It is found that PLLA crystallinity decreases as a function of laser fluence, and that the amount of <b>chemical</b> <b>modifications</b> is minimized by annealing before laser treatment and reducing laser fluences, which decrease free radical mobility and thus the dissociation quantum yield. A working window is demonstrated in which PLLA crystallinity decreases with no measurable <b>chemical</b> <b>modifications,</b> and the working window can be enlarged by decreasing free radical mobility...|$|R
25|$|Each snoRNA {{molecule}} {{acts as a}} {{guide for}} only one (or two) individual modifications in a target RNA. In order to carry out modification, each snoRNA associates with at least four protein molecules in an RNA/protein complex referred to as a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP). The proteins associated with each RNA depend on the type of snoRNA molecule (see snoRNA guide families below). The snoRNA molecule contains an antisense element (a stretch of 10-20 nucleotides), which are base complementary to the sequence surrounding the base (nucleotide) targeted for modification in the pre-RNA molecule. This enables the snoRNP to recognise and bind to the target RNA. Once the snoRNP has bound to the target site, the associated proteins are in the correct physical location to catalyse the <b>chemical</b> <b>modification</b> of the target base.|$|E
25|$|Biocides are {{chemical}} substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{chemical substances}} {{are incorporated into}} an anti-fouling surface coating, typically through physical adsorption or through <b>chemical</b> <b>modification</b> of the surface. Biofouling occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm. The biofilm creates a surface onto which successively larger microorganisms can attach. In marine environments this buildup usually concludes with barnacle attachment. The biocides often target the microorganisms that create the initial biofilm, typically bacteria. Once dead, {{they are unable to}} spread and can detach. Other biocides are toxic to larger organisms in biofouling, such as the fungi and algae. The most commonly used biocide, and anti-fouling agent, is the tributyltin moiety (TBT). It is toxic to both microorganisms and larger aquatic organisms. Biocides are also added to pool water, drinking water, and liquid lines for cooling electronics to control biological growth.|$|E
2500|$|Chromatin's {{structure}} is currently poorly understood despite {{being subjected to}} intense investigation. Its structure depends on several factors. The overall structure depends {{on the stage of}} the cell cycle. During interphase, the chromatin is structurally loose to allow access to RNA and DNA polymerases that transcribe and replicate the DNA. The local structure of chromatin during interphase depends on the genes present on the DNA. [...] That DNA which codes genes that are actively transcribed ("turned on") is more loosely packaged and associated with RNA polymerases (referred to as euchromatin) while that DNA which codes inactive genes ("turned off") is more condensed and associated with structural proteins (heterochromatin). Epigenetic <b>chemical</b> <b>modification</b> of the structural proteins in chromatin also alters the local chromatin structure, in particular chemical modifications of histone proteins by methylation and acetylation. As the cell prepares to divide, i.e. enters [...] mitosis or meiosis, the chromatin packages more tightly to facilitate segregation of the chromosomes during anaphase. During this stage of the cell cycle this makes the individual chromosomes in many cells visible by optical microscope.|$|E

Results from microsecond MD-simulations of 15 different siRNA- 7 -hAGO 2 complexes provide insights about how the key noncovalerit interactions and conforinatirinal changes at the seed region are modulated, depending upon the nature and position of <b>Chemical</b> <b>modifications.</b> Such modification induced structural changes can affect siRNA loading into hAGO 2, which may influence RNAi activity.

40|$|The aim of {{research}} is to achieve <b>chemical</b> <b>modifications</b> of corn starch. Therefore, the present study focuses on its <b>chemical</b> <b>modifications,</b> {{in order to increase}} its aqueous solubility and to ameliorate its adsorption properties for one hydrophobic pollutant, belonging to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), as a model.

According to the registered results, starch modification with succinic anhydride conducts to an aqueous solubility of 34. 00 g·L- 1, significantly increased in comparison with the solubility of native corn starch which is insoluble in water at room temperature. With this modified starch, promising results for BaP aqueous solubilisation were obtained...|$|R

2500|$|Merck records {{indicate}} its researchers {{returned to the}} compound sporadically. A 1920 Merck patent describes a <b>chemical</b> <b>modification</b> to MDMA. In 1927, Max Oberlin studied the pharmacology of MDMA while searching for substances with effects similar to adrenaline or ephedrine, the latter being structurally similar to MDMA. Compared to ephedrine, Oberlin observed that it had similar effects on vascular smooth muscle tissue, stronger effects at the uterus, and no [...] "local effect at the eye". MDMA was also found to have effects on blood sugar levels comparable to high doses of ephedrine. Oberlin concluded {{that the effects of}} MDMA were not limited to the sympathetic nervous system. Research was stopped [...] "particularly due to a strong price increase of safrylmethylamine", which was still used as an intermediate in methylhydrastinine synthesis. Albert van Schoor performed simple toxicological tests with the drug in 1952, most likely while researching new stimulants or circulatory medications. After pharmacological studies, research on MDMA was not continued. In 1959, Wolfgang Fruhstorfer synthesized MDMA for pharmacological testing while researching stimulants. It is unclear if Fruhstorfer investigated the effects of MDMA in humans.|$|E
