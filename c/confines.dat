40|$|The <b>confining</b> {{stress in}} FRP (fiber {{reinforced}} polymer) <b>confined</b> concrete {{is dependent on}} the lateral strain of the concrete but the lateral strain of the concrete {{is dependent on the}} <b>confining</b> stress. Hence, the <b>confining</b> stress and lateral strain are inter-related and have to be evaluated at the same time. However, up to now, such evaluation has remained a difficult task. Consequently, the variation of the <b>confining</b> stress during loading and the effectiveness of the FRP confinement at various stages of loading are still not fully understood. Herein, a theoretical model for evaluating the lateral strain, <b>confining</b> stress and axial stress in FRP <b>confined</b> concrete is developed. The theoretical model is first applied to analyze the FRP <b>confined</b> concrete specimens tested by others to verify its accuracy and then used to perform a parametric study on the effects of <b>confining</b> stiffness.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a lateral strain model of <b>confined</b> concrete, which makes no assumptions on {{the properties of}} <b>confining</b> materials and is therefore generally applicable regardless {{of the type of}} confinement. It can be applied to concrete members or columns <b>confined</b> by fiber reinforced polymer (FRP), steel tubes or steel tubes wrapped with FRP or steel rings/spirals, provided the appropriate stress-strain models of the <b>confining</b> materials are incorporated in the analysis. The lateral strain model {{can also be used to}} directly evaluate the lateral strain of <b>confined</b> concrete with non-cylindrical section or under eccentric loading where the lateral strain and <b>confining</b> stress could vary across the section using finite element analysis. The first part of the thesis presents the details of the derivations of the lateral strain model of <b>confined</b> concrete. A total of 95 actively <b>confined</b> concrete specimens and 34 passively <b>confined</b> concrete specimens covering a wide range of concrete strength from 25 to 120 MPa and <b>confining</b> stress from 0 to 0. 99 times the concrete strength tested by other researchers in the published literature have been investigated for the influence of concrete strength, <b>confining</b> stress and axial strain on the lateral strain of <b>confined</b> concrete. Based on the regression analysis, the influence of concrete strength, <b>confining</b> stress and axial strain is accurately and consistently captured and a constitutive model for predicting the lateral strain of <b>confined</b> concrete under different levels of confinement from pre-crack and elastic state to post-crack and inelastic state is proposed. In the second part of the thesis, theoretical models integrating the proposed lateral strain model, axial stress-strain model of <b>confined</b> concrete, stress-strain model of steel tube, FRP, steel rings/spirals have been proposed to analyze the axial stress-strain curves of a total of 174 FRP <b>confined</b> concrete, 138 concrete-filled steel tubes (CFST) without external confinement, 89 CFST with FRP jackets and 98 CFST with external steel rings/spirals. The lateral strain, <b>confining</b> stress can be obtained by an iterative procedure and the axial stress/load can be evaluated by substituting the so obtained <b>confining</b> stress into the axial stress-strain model of <b>confined</b> concrete. It is observed that the theoretical models can predict the axial and lateral stress-strain behaviour of FRP <b>confined</b> concrete, CFST, and CFST with external confinement accurately and consistently. Finally, a parametric study has been carried out by varying a series of structural parameters such as concrete strength, steel tube yield strength and thickness-to-diameter ratios, FRP <b>confining</b> stiffness and rupture strain, and steel rings/spirals <b>confining</b> stiffness to study the effects on strength and ductility. From the data generated by the parametric study, design formulas for predicting the yield and ultimate strength of FRP <b>confined</b> concrete, CFST with or without external confinements are proposed and compared with existing codes and design charts for evaluating the minimum FRP <b>confining</b> stiffness or steel rings/spirals thickness-to-diameter ratio to achieve different levels of ductility for CFST with various concrete strength are presented. Moreover, the minimum <b>confining</b> stiffness of external confinement to avoid delamination is evaluated for design guidance. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
