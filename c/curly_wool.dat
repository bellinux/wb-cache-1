5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically <b>curly</b> <b>wool</b> and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E
60|$|The {{very next}} day after this sad event the {{travellers}} came to a native village, at which they stayed a night, in order to rest and procure fresh provisions. The trader was well-known at this village, but the natives, {{all of whom were}} black, of course, and nearly naked, had never seen a little white girl before, so that their interest in and wonder at Ailie were quite amusing to witness. They crowded round her, laughing and exclaiming and gesticulating in a most remarkable manner, and taking special notice of her light-brown glossy hair, which seemed to fill them with unbounded astonishment and admiration; as well it might, for they had never before seen any other hair except the coarse <b>curly</b> <b>wool</b> on their own pates, and the long lank hair of the trader, which happened to be coarse and black.|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} peasant too, a young {{one with a}} swift eye and hard cheek and hard, {{dangerous}} thighs. He has folded his stocking cap, so that it comes forward to his brow like a phrygian cap. He wears close knee breeches and close sleeved waistcoat of thick brownish stuff that looks like leather. Over the waistcoat a sort of cuirass of black, rusty sheepskin, the <b>curly</b> <b>wool</b> outside. So he strides, talking to a comrade. How fascinating it is, after the soft Italians, to see these limbs in their close knee-breeches, so definite, so manly, with the old fierceness in them still. One realises, with horror, that the race of men is almost extinct in Europe. Only Christ-like heroes and woman-worshipping Don Juans, and rabid equality-mongrels. The old, hardy, indomitable male is gone. His fierce singleness is quenched. The last sparks are dying out in Sardinia and Spain. Nothing left but the herd-proletariat and the herd-equality mongrelism, and the wistful poisonous self-sacrificial cultured soul. How detestable.|$|E

30|$|In this computer-centric {{world we}} now live in, Schaller, {{who has spent}} over fifty years {{conducting}} fieldwork and promoting wildlife conservation throughout the world, understands the value {{of time spent in}} the field: ‘I console myself that natural history remains the cornerstone of conservation, that it must be learned on the ground, asking questions, observing, listening, taking notes, getting the boots muddy. Technology helps to open the world but technology can also close it unless one learns directly from nature.’ The following passage about the snow leopard is an interesting example of his passion for understanding wild animals and the mountains they live in and the fieldwork that is necessary: ‘I examined each scat with special interest. A sniff gave an idea of its freshness. Picked apart, the hair and bone fragments reveal what the cat had eaten. Long, curved incisors and tan, black-tipped hairs are from marmot, brittle grayish hair from blue sheep, or <b>curly</b> white <b>wool</b> from domestic sheep, to mention just three. Sometimes I stumbled on a kill, wild or domestic. I recorded species, sex, approximate age, and physical condition, and saved the lower jaw for determining age at death more precisely from the tooth wear. Scuff marks and tracks gave an indication of how the animal was ambushed, and tooth and claw marks show how it was killed. Was the body warm? How much had been eaten?’ The ability to ask these kinds of questions comes from lots of time spent in the field. Schaller also has an uncanny ability to synthesize arcane bits of zoological data into easily understood facts about Tibetan wildlife and their habitats, greatly improving the reader’s understanding of the ecology of the Roof of the World.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is a great}} future {{before the}} country; gold is found {{in many of the}} rivers, tin is {{probably}} more abundant than in any other part of the world, and the exports are now very large; there are immense quantities of valuable timber, such as teak, sandalwood, and ebony. The climate is, except on the low land near the rivers, very healthy; nutmegs, cloves, and other spices can be grown there, and indigo, chocolate, pepper, opium, the sugarcane, coffee, and cotton, are all successfully cultivated. Some day, probably, the whole peninsula will fall under our protection, and when the constant tribal feuds are put a stop to, the forests cleared, and the ground cultivated, {{as is the case in}} our own settlement of Malacca, it will be found one of the most valuable of our possessions. Any amount of labor can be obtained from China, and it is probable that the races who inhabit the mountainous districts, who are said to be industrious and peaceable, will also readily adapt themselves to the changed conditions. They are not Malays like the people of the lowlands, but are a black race with <b>curly</b> <b>wool,</b> like the natives of Africa, and probably inhabited the whole peninsula before the arrival of the Malays." ...|$|E
60|$|Down in {{a hollow}} under a thick {{spreading}} mimosa bush was the noisiest fire of all, for there were assembled {{some of the}} natives belonging to the waggons of Hans and Jan Smit. These carried on an uproarious discussion of some sort, appealing frequently to our friend Ruyter the Hottentot, {{who appeared to be}} regarded by them as an umpire or an oracle. The Hottentot race is a very inferior one, both mentally and physically, but there are among them individuals who rise much above the ordinary level. Ruyter was one of these. He had indeed the sallow visage, high cheek-bones, and dots of <b>curly</b> <b>wool</b> scattered thinly over his head, peculiar to his race, but his countenance was unusually intelligent, his frame well made and very powerful, and his expression good. He entered heartily into the fun of attempting to teach the Hottentot klick to some of the younger men among the emigrants, who were attracted to his fire by the shouts of laughter in which the swarthy slaves and others indulged. Abdul Jemalee, the Malay slave, was there; also Booby the Bushman--the former grave and silent, almost sad; the latter conducting himself like a monkey--to which animal he seemed closely related--and evoking shouts of laughter from a few youths, for whose special benefit he kept in the background and mimicked every one else.|$|E

5000|$|Knapp's {{views of}} Filipinos {{may be found}} in the 1902 history {{textbook}} she wrote for Filipino students, The Story of the Philippines. Most of Knapp's history is concerned with European colonialism in the islands. Among the inhabitants before the arrival of the Spanish, Knapp briefly mentioned two [...] "wild tribes", the Negritos and Igorotes, whom she distinguished from the [...] "civilized Filipino people" [...] who were members of the Malay race. [...] "The Negritos", she wrote [...] "are dying out. They are a small, timid people, with thick lips and flat noses. Their hair is like <b>curly</b> <b>wool.</b> They hunt and fight with bows and arrows, and are very quick and active. Their chief food is fish, and the brown mountain rice which they plant and harvest. Even if taken when children and brought up in a city, they do not grow to like civilized life, but run away {{and go back to the}} mountains as soon as they have the chance." [...] Of the Igorots she wrote, [...] "The Igorrotes are the finest and strongest of all the wild tribes in the country. They are very brave, and are good fighters, using in warfare a short, broad knife, which they wield with deadly skill. They never submitted to the Spaniards, and were badly used by that people. The Spaniards always made war upon them, and at one time tried to put an end to all of the tribe in Luzon. They burned their villages and killed all who fell in their power. They could not conquer them, however, and the Igorrotes have always hated the Spanish fiercely." [...] The Malays she describes as [...] "a sea-going folk, daring sailors, and skillful in managing their boats" [...] who [...] "went boldly to sea in tiny crafts, with only the stars to guide them, taking risks such as no Europeans dared to take." ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that morphological structures like awns, bristles, or hooks increase retention potential of plant diaspores to the coats of animals, but this basic assumption {{has rarely been}} tested. In this paper we introduce a lab-experiment in which detachment rates of diaspores from mechanically shaken animal coats are measured using a standardized protocol and compared with detachment rates measured under natural conditions. The lab-experiments {{were used to assess}} ‘retention potentials’ of diaspores for more than 100 plant species. ‘Retention potential’ is defined as the proportion of diaspores still attached to the animal coat after a certain time period. We assessed the effect of several diaspore traits on retention potential and found that a strong negative effect of diaspore mass overrides the expected positive effect of structures like awns, bristles or hooks. However, a positive effect of these structures was proven, when analysing the dataset separately for diaspores of different mass classes. Additionally, we found a negative effect of flat appendages. Coat type also affects retention potentials, with higher values in curly sheep wool compared to straight cattle hair. Species with diaspore mass 2 mg might also be dispersed over long distances, at least by sheep. The frequency distribution of retention potentials clearly shows that a binary classification of species dispersed in animal hair vs. species not dispersed is artificial since differences are gradual. The relative importance of diaspore mass for determining retention potential was higher in straight hair, whereas diaspore morphology had a relatively higher impact in <b>curly</b> <b>wool.</b> Hence, different sets of plant species are dispersed by different animals...|$|E
