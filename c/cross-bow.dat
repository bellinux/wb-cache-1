60|$|There was a {{large body}} of Genoese archers who fought with <b>cross-bows,</b> a very heavy but a very {{efficient}} weapon. The officers who commanded these archers were in favor of waiting for the attack till the next day, as their men were very weary from the fatigue of carrying their <b>cross-bows</b> so far.

The murder remains unsolved.|$|E
60|$|Gunpowder {{and guns}} {{had not been}} {{introduced}} as means of warfare at this time; the most formidable weapon that was then employed was the <b>cross-bow.</b> With the <b>cross-bow</b> a sort of square-headed arrow was used called a quarrel.|$|E
60|$|On {{entering}} the harbor, they rowed close along an armed galley, {{of the most}} ancient form. Soldiers with <b>cross-bows</b> were stationed on the deck.|$|R

60|$|I {{pushed my}} chair back creakingly. This ancient {{landlubber}} was becoming as great an affliction as any <b>cross-bowed</b> mariner. He shook a musty effluvium from his piebald clothes, overturned my inkstand, {{and went on}} with his insufferable nonsense.|$|R
60|$|Marzak {{looked at}} him and sneered. Then he {{snatched}} from Vigitello's hands one of the <b>cross-bows</b> that he bore and set a shaft to it. And then at last Sakr-el-Bahr was to learn the malice that was at the root of all this odd pretence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, Dick, it {{is written}} that the rain falls on the just and the unjust; and the unjust, that is the French, or rather the Italians whom they hire, use these new-fangled <b>cross-bows</b> which as you know cannot be cased like ours, and {{therefore}} stretch their strings in wet." ...|$|R

60|$|The battle now raged on all sides. The English {{strove to}} grapple with and board the enemy, while the Spaniards poured upon them a shower of bolts and quarrels from their <b>cross-bows,</b> hurled immense masses of stone from their {{military}} engines, and, as they drew alongside, cast into them heavy bars of iron, which pierced holes {{in the bottom of}} the ship.|$|R
6000|$|The springalds, used in defence of {{the castle}} of Lauder, were balistae, or large <b>cross-bows,</b> wrought by machinery, and capable of {{throwing}} stones, beams, and huge darts.

60|$|On {{his hand}} {{he holds his}} hawk, and his dogs are enjoying the great wood fire.

60|$|Still they knocked {{until some}} guards {{appeared}} armed with <b>cross-bows,</b> and asked their business. They said they desired {{to see his}} Holiness, {{or at least one}} of his secretaries, whereon the guards asked whence they came. They replied from Italy, and were told that if so they would find no entrance there, since the Death had come from Italy. Now Hugh gave his name and stated his business on hearing which the guards laughed at him.|$|R
60|$|If {{the heavens}} were alive with pigeons, {{the whole village}} seemed equally in motion with men, women, and children.

60|$|Harry was auctioneer, {{and rattled}} off {{the most amazing}} medley of {{nonsense}} in praise of the articles, which he rapidly knocked down to the highest bidder. The competition was lively, for the boys laughed so much they hardly {{knew what they were}} doing, and made the rashest offers; but they all knew what the money was to be used for, so they paid their bills handsomely, and marched off with <b>cross-bows,</b> old guns, rusty swords, and tin armor, quite contented with their bargains.|$|R
