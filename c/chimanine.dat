40|$|Ten 2 -substituted {{quinoline}} alkaloids {{isolated from}} a plant used {{for treatment of}} New World cutaneous leishmaniasis have antileishmanial in vitro activities against the extracellular forms of Leishmania spp. BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania amazonensis PH 8 or H- 142 or Leishmania venezuelensis were treated 1 day after the parasitic infection with a quinoline alkaloid (100 mg/kg of body weight per day) or with reference drug N-methylglucamine antimonate (Glucantime) (56 mg of pentavalent antimony [Sbv] per kg per day) for 14 days. Lesion development was the criterium used to assess disease severity. Two three-carbon chain quinolines [2 -n-propylquinoline and 2 -(1 ', 2 '-trans-epoxypropyl) quinoline (<b>chimanine</b> D) ] were more potent than N-methylglucamine antimonate against L. amazonensis PH 8, and five quinoline alkaloids [2 -(3, 4 -methylenedioxyphenylethyl) quinoline, cusparine, 2 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenylethyl) quinoline, 2 -(E) -prop- 1 '-enylquinoline (<b>chimanine</b> B), and skimmianine] were {{as effective as the}} reference drug. Single treatment near the site of infection, 14 days after infection with L. amazonensis, with 2 -n-propylquinoline or <b>chimanine</b> B reduced the severity of lesions but less notably than N-methylglucamine antimonate. 2 -n-Propylquinoline exhibited significant activity against the virulent strain L. venezuelensis. The active products did not show any apparent toxicities during the experiment. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to show the activity of 2 -substituted quinoline alkaloids for experimental treatment of New World cutaneous leishmaniasis. Further investigations of these compounds might yet prove helpful for the development of new antileishmanial drugs...|$|E
40|$|The antileishmanial efficacies of 2 -n-propylquinoline, chimanines B and D, 2 -n-pentylquinoline, 2 -phenylquinoline, 2 -(3, 4 -methylenedioxyphenylethyl) quinoline, and two total alkaloidal {{extracts}} of #Galipea longiflora$ {{were evaluated}} in BALB/c mice infected with #Leishmania amazonensis$ or #Leishmania venezuelensis$. Animals were treated for 4 to 6 weeks postinfection with a quinoline by the oral route at 50 mg/kg {{of body weight}} twice daily for 15 days or by five intralesional injections at intervals of 4 days with a quinoline at 50 mg/kg of body weight. The reference drug, N-methylglucamine antimonate (Glucantime), was administered by subcutaneous or intralesional injection (regimens of 14, 28, or 56 mg of pentavalent antimony per kg of body weight daily). Twice-daily oral treatment with <b>chimanine</b> B at 50 mg/kg resulted in a decrease in lesion weight by 70 % (P < 0. 001) {{and a decrease in}} the parasite loads by 95 % (P < 0. 001). Five injections of <b>chimanine</b> B at intervals of 4 days reduced the lesion weight by 74 % and the parasite loads in the lesion by 90 % compared with the values for the group of untreated mice. Subcutaneous administration of N-methylglucamine antimonate at 28 mg of pentavalent antimony kg per day for 15 days reduced the parasite burden by 95 % (P < 0. 001) and five intralesional injections at the same concentration reduced the parasite burden by 96 % (P < 0. 001). Other 2 -substituted quinolines, 2 -n-propylquinoline administered by the oral and intralesional routes, 2 -phenylquinoline administered by the oral route, 2 -n-pentylquinoline administered by intralesional injection, and two total alkaloidal extracts of #G. longiflora$ administered by the oral route, had intermediate effects. These findings suggest that <b>chimanine</b> B may be chosen as a lead molecule in the development of oral therapy against leishmaniasis. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Potent antileishmanial {{activity}} {{has recently been}} described in vivo when certain 2 -substituted quinoline alkaloids are administered to mice with cutaneous leishman-iasis. We now report the antileishmanial activity of four 2 -substituted quinoline alkaloids, namely <b>chimanine</b> D or 2 -(l', 2 '-rra/w-epoxypropyl) quinoline (I), 2 -n-propylquinoline (II), 2 -styrylquinoline (III) and 2 -(2 '-hydroxypropyl) quinoline (IV), for experimental treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in infected BALB/c mice. Subcutaneous treatment with <b>chimanine</b> D for 10 days at 0 - 54 mmol/kg per day resulted in 86 - 6 % parasite suppression in the liver. Oral administration of 0 - 54 mmol/kg of 2 -n-propylquinoline once daily for 5 or 10 days to L. donovani-infected mice suppressed parasite burdens in liver by 87 - 8 and 99 - 9 %, respectively. Cutaneous administration of meglumine antimonate for 10 days resulted in 97 - 4 % parasite suppression in the liver. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the activity of 2 -substituted quinoline alkaloids in experi-mental treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. Further biological and chemical studies of these products might yet prove helpful {{for the development of}} new antileish-manial drugs...|$|E
