5000|$|Aedes vexans is a known vector of Dirofilaria immitis (dog heartworm); {{myxomatosis}} (a deadly rabbit viral disease); and Tahyna virus, a seldom-diagnosed Bunyaviridae {{which affects}} humans in Europe, causing a fever which disappears after two days, but afterward can cause encephalitis or meningitis. Aedes vexans {{is the most}} <b>common</b> <b>mosquito</b> in Europe, often comprising more than 80% the European mosquito community. Its abundance depends upon availability of floodwater pools. In summer, up to 8,000 mosquitoes can be collected per trap per night. [...] Aedes vexans exhibited significantly higher transmission rates of Zika virus than Aedes aegypti, and its wide geographic distribution, periodic extreme abundance, and aggressive human biting behavior increase its potential {{to serve as a}} Zika virus vector in northern latitudes outside the range of the primary vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.|$|E
50|$|The western {{encephalitis}} mosquito, or Culex tarsalis, {{is one of}} the <b>common</b> <b>mosquito</b> vectors for the HP virus {{because of}} its prevalence in North America. Wild birds are the most frequent host of the HP virus because they are the target of blood-feeding Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes. Female Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes primarily feed on birds but in late summer, their blood feeding on larger mammals such as man increases. The host transition from birds to humans plays a huge role in the potential for widespread viral infections of the HP virus and similar strains. One important find from recent studies, is that the HP virus seems unable to be transmitted transovarially from infected females to their offspring. This restricts the direct spread of the virus because the progeny do not inherit the Hart Park virus from their maternal parent. The Hart Park virus does not currently have a disease related to its infection in other animals, but its transmission through feral birds is a cause for concern.|$|E
50|$|Vector control measures, {{especially}} mosquito control, {{are essential}} to reducing the transmission of disease by arboviruses. Habitat control involves draining swamps and removal of other pools of stagnant water (such as old tires, large outdoor potted plants, empty cans, etc.) that often serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Insecticides can be applied in rural and urban areas, inside houses and other buildings, or in outdoor environments. They are often quite effective for controlling arthropod populations, though use {{of some of these}} chemicals is controversial, and some organophosphates and organochlorides (such as DDT) have been banned in many countries. Infertile male mosquitoes have been introduced in some areas {{in order to reduce the}} breeding rate of relevant mosquito species. Larvicides are also used worldwide in mosquito abatement programs. Temefos is a <b>common</b> <b>mosquito</b> larvicide.People can also reduce the risk of getting bitten by arthropods by employing personal protective measures such as sleeping under mosquito nets, wearing protective clothing, applying insect repellents such as permethrin and DEET to clothing and exposed skin, and (where possible) avoiding areas known to harbor high arthropod populations. Arboviral encephalitis can be prevented in two major ways: personal protective measures and public health measures to reduce the population of infected mosquitoes. Personal measures include reducing time outdoors particularly in early evening hours, wearing long pants and long sleeved shirts and applying mosquito repellent to exposed skin areas. Public health measures often require spraying of insecticides to kill juvenile (larvae) and adult mosquitoes.|$|E

40|$|Focal {{control of}} malaria vectors, a {{potentially}} cost-effective alternative to conventional control, requires a spatio-temporal {{understanding of the}} mosquitoes. Trapping of African malaria vectors has generally been limited to inside houses making distribution estimates dependent on the location of dwellings. The development of tent-traps to sample outdoor biting mosquitoes has enabled more independent estimates. Here we describe both temporal and spatial variation in mosquito movements in an irrigation project village in southern Mozambique. Six hundred and ninety-three tent-trap collections (525 of which were paired with light-trap collections), 552 exit collections and 391 collections of mosquitoes resting inside houses were undertaken from March 2005 to April 2006. Fifteen species of mosquito were collected (five exclusively as larvae). Mansonia africana {{was the most common}} finding, numbers being greatest away from the village. Only Anopheles funestus, An. tenebrosus and Culex quinquefasciatus were collected in greater numbers in light-traps compared to tent-traps. Among the <b>common</b> <b>mosquitoes,</b> correlations in numbers of mosquito collected in paired tent and in light-traps were significant for all but An. tenebrosus. Inverse distance weighting was used to produce raster density maps of the most <b>common</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> All species, with minor variations, in both hot and cool seasons, were collected in greatest numbers close to the edges of the village where water suitable for larval development was available. All exophilic anophelines species tested negative for sporozoites.

40|$|Background Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae) is a mosquito–borne, {{zoonotic}} pathogen.

Mosquito vectors are therefore the definitive {{host of the}} malaria parasite.
