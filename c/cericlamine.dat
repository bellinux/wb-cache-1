50|$|<b>Cericlamine</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} JO-1017) {{is a potent}} and {{moderately}} selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) of the amphetamine family (specifically, a derivative of phentermine, and closely related to chlorphentermine, a highly selective serotonin releasing agent) that was investigated as an antidepressant {{for the treatment of}} depression, anxiety disorders, and anorexia nervosa by Jouveinal but did not complete development and was never marketed. It reached phase III clinical trials in 1996 before development was discontinued in 1999.|$|E
40|$|Biochemical and {{electrophysiological}} approaches {{were used}} to assess the possible changes in 5 -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the rat brain after a long-term treatment with <b>cericlamine</b> [2 -(3, 4 -dichlorobenzyl) - 2 -dimethylamino- 1 -propanol], a novel serotonin reuptake inhibitor with antidepressant properties. Possible changes in other serotonin receptor binding sites (5 -HT 2 A, 5 -HT 2 C and 5 -HT 3) were also investigated after this treatment. <b>Cericlamine</b> was injected for 2 weeks at a dose (16 mg/kg i. p., twice daily) that ensured complete prevention of 4 -methyl-alpha-ethyl-meta-tyramine-induced depletion of brain serotonin. In vitro binding and quantitative autoradiographic studies showed that neither 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 2 A, 5 -HT 2 C nor 5 -HT 3 receptor binding sites in various brain areas were affected by the 14 -day treatment with <b>cericlamine.</b> Although forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was significantly increased in hippocampal homogenates from cericlamine-treated rats, the reduction in this enzymatic activity due to 5 -HT 1 A receptor stimulation by 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT) was unchanged in these animals as compared with controls. In contrast, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological recordings of serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus revealed a clearcut functional desensitization of somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors. Thus the potency of 8 -OH-DPAT and ipsapirone to depress the firing rate of these neurons in brain stem slices was significantly reduced after the 2 -week treatment with <b>cericlamine.</b> In vivo, the potency of an injection of <b>cericlamine</b> to inhibit the discharge of serotoninergic neurons was also markedly less in rats that had been pretreated for 2 weeks with this drug as compared with controls. However, the inhibitory effects of systemically injected 8 -OH-DPAT and ipsapirone on the electrical activity of serotoninergic neurons were as pronounced in cericlamine-treated rats as in controls. In addition, the reduction in serotonin synthesis due to an acute treatment with 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 1 or 0. 3 mg/kg s. c.) was not significantly different in both groups of rats. These data support the idea that postsynaptic (in the hippocampus) and somatodendritic (in the dorsal raphe nucleus) 5 -HT 1 A receptors are differently regulated in the rat brain, because only the latter receptors desensitized after a long-term blockade of serotonin reuptake by <b>cericlamine.</b> They also suggest that the inhibitory influence of systemically administered direct 5 -HT 1 A agonists such as 8 -OH-DPAT and ipsapirone on the electrical and metabolic activity of serotoninergic neurons does not result solely from the stimulation of somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors...|$|E
