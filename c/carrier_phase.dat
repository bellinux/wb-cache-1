2500|$|However it is {{possible}} to talk about a modulation index exceeding 100%, without introducing distortion, in the case of double-sideband reduced-carrier transmission. In that case, negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the <b>carrier</b> <b>phase,</b> as shown in the third waveform below. This cannot be produced using the efficient high-level (output stage) modulation techniques (see below) which are widely used especially in high power broadcast transmitters. Rather, a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a linear amplifier. What's more, a standard AM receiver using an envelope detector is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal. Rather, synchronous detection is required. Thus double-sideband transmission is generally not referred to as [...] "AM" [...] even though it generates an identical RF waveform as standard AM as long as the modulation index is below 100%. Such systems more often attempt a radical reduction of the carrier level compared to the sidebands (where the useful information is present) to the point of double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission where the carrier is (ideally) reduced to zero. In all such cases the term [...] "modulation index" [...] loses its value as it refers to the ratio of the modulation amplitude to a rather small (or zero) remaining carrier amplitude.|$|E

The increased number of <b>carrier</b> <b>phases</b> provides additional information in cases where a coarse quantization at the receiver is considered. Another study is presented in [19], where multidimensional quantizer designs are investigated in the context of channels with memory. The proposed quantizers in [19] are optimized for channels with memory whose quantization regions incorporate multiple receive samples.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A dual-rate Kalman Filter (DRKF) {{has been}} {{developed}} to integrate the time-differenced GPS <b>carrier</b> <b>phases</b> and the GPS pseudoranges with INS measurements. The time-differenced GPS <b>carrier</b> <b>phases,</b> which have low noise and millimeter measurement precision, are integrated with INS measurements using a Kalman Filter with high update rates to improve {{the performance of the}} integrated system. Since the time-differenced GPS <b>carrier</b> <b>phases</b> are only relative measurements, when integrated with INS, the position error of the integrated system will accumulate over time. Therefore, the GPS pseudoranges are also incorporated into the integrated system using a Kalman Filter with a low update rate to control the accumulation of system errors. Experimental tests have shown that this design, compared to a conventional design using a single Kalman Filter, reduces the coasting error by two-thirds for a medium coasting time of 30 s, and the position, velocity, and attitude errors by at least one-half for a 45 -min field navigation experiment...|$|R

5000|$|Imagine two antennas {{that are}} {{separated}} by their wavelength/3. In the transverse direction the two signals will sum, but in the tangential direction they will cancel. Thus as the signal [...] "moves" [...] from one antenna to the next, the distortion in the antenna pattern will increase and then decrease. The peak distortion occurs at the midpoint. This creates a half-sinusoidal 1500 Hz amplitude distortion {{in the case of}} a 50 antenna system, (1,440 Hz in a 48 antenna system). This distortion is itself amplitude modulated with a 60 Hz amplitude modulation (also some 30 Hz as well). This distortion can add or subtract with the above-mentioned 60 Hz distortion depending on the <b>carrier</b> <b>phase.</b> In fact one can add an offset to the <b>carrier</b> <b>phase</b> (relative to the sideband phases) so that the 60 Hz components tend to null one another.
