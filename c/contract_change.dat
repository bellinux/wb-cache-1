2500|$|Additionally, Marshall Wainwright {{notes that}} other sources {{indicate}} {{the first eight}} aircraft were to originally have been powered by Allison V-1710-13 engines fitted with GE Type B-6 turbosuperchargers. These aircraft were eventually delivered with improved V-1710-23(D2) engines. Wainwright further states {{that two of the}} YFM-1 airframes were changed on the production line to accept the V-1710-41 without turbosupercharging, becoming YFM-1Bs. This is noted in a <b>contract</b> <b>change</b> dated 19 October 1939 which shows that aircraft 38-489 and 38-490 had their turbos, all associated ducting, and controls removed and V-1710-41(D2A) [...] "Altitude Rated" [...] engines installed instead. The (D2A) was essentially a -23 with higher supercharger gear ratios (8.77:1 versus 6.23:1), which allowed the motor to develop around [...] up to [...] ASL. They used the same ratings and components as the Altitude Rated V-1710-33(C15) Allison fitted to the original Curtiss XP-40. Allison was paid $1,690 to modify each engine.|$|E

50|$|The {{unanimous}} opinion by Justice Harlan noted two {{issues in the}} case.

Mobile Gas held that the NGA did not authorize a unilateral <b>contract</b> <b>change,</b> and that holding also applied to the FPA.|$|E

5000|$|Some other {{substantial}} reason ("SOSR") {{is a kind}} of catch-all that employers use to justify dismissal.

50|$|In 2014, the National Audit Office {{reported}} on the handling of IEP and Thameslink rolling stock projects by the DfT. Issues specific to the IEP were the failure to re-submit the contract to tender after {{the terms of the}} <b>contract</b> <b>change</b> (electrification program) led to an altered bid from Hitachi. The report also questioned the DfT's attempt to take leadership in the project, contradictory to general policy, without any prior experience of large scale rolling stock procurement. The NAO also gave its opinion that the DfT had handled communications with bidders poorly, increasing the likelihood of a legal challenge to their decisions.|$|E

Instead, {{for as long as}} a PHA accepts operating and capital funding each year, it remains in the public housing program and must comply with [...] "all applicable statutes, executive orders, and regulations issued by HUD, as they shall be amended from time to time." [...] This means that as Congress enacts new laws that affect the public housing program, or as HUD issues new regulations, a PHA must comply with those laws and regulations, irrespective of any cost associated with doing so.

50|$|Common law {{examples}} are imminent defection to competitor, unreasonable refusal to agree a <b>contract</b> <b>change,</b> going AWOL, repeated complaints of constructive dismissal without resignation, damaging breakdown in relations {{caused by the}} employee, threats to resign followed by ambiguous absence, imprisonment, expiry of fixed term and pressure from a customer or supplier. If the breakdown in relations could {{have been caused by}} several staff then all must be given warnings and eventually all may have to be dismissed if one culprit cannot fairly be singled out. If a customer demands a dismissal, the impact on the employer of keeping the employee needs to outweigh the impact on the employee of the dismissal. If a supplier demands a dismissal, the employer needs to weigh up the cost of going elsewhere. The employer should always consider a transfer to another department.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Contract</b> <b>Change</b> Management (CCM) {{system is}} an on-line {{collaboration}} tool, which supports the <b>contract</b> <b>change</b> management process of NEC (New Engineering Contract) form of contract. It is currently used in practice {{on a wide}} range of live civil, power and building projects in the UK. Anecdotal evidences show that the system helps construction projects in saving costs, reducing risk and increasing predictability. The aim of this study is to ascertain these benefits through first-hand feedback from its users. Key questions are: Does CCM help the <b>contract</b> <b>change</b> management process of NEC projects? What are its main benefits? Is there any difference between the views of different types of users, such as clients, contractors, or consultants? To achieve this aim, a questionnaire survey was conducted amongst 260 CCM users with a response rate of 33 %, or 85 valid replies. The results have shown that most users are very positive and consistent in their responses. Process supports, such as audit trail and communication records, received the highest positive replies. Answers to benefits related to cost saving and business improvement are more mixed. Amongst the different user groups, clients and consultants are more positive towards the system than contractors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{productivity}} {{impact of a}} <b>contract</b> <b>change</b> for tea pluckers in an Indian plantation. The contract, implemented {{at the end of}} a three-year cycle in which contracts are generally revised, was (a) the joint outcome of negotiations between twenty unions and plantations, (b) mandated to respect a state government notification stipulating a new minimum wage for plantation workers statewide, and (c) applicable equally to all the plantations in the local region. The contract raised the baseline wage by 30 % but lowered marginal incentives, by shifting the existing piece rates to higher minimum thresholds and eliminating an existing penalty per unit for low output. In the one month following the <b>contract</b> <b>change,</b> output increased by a factor between 30 - 60 %, the exact number depending on the choice of counterfactual and the set of controls applied. This large and contrarian response to a flattening of marginal incentives is at odds with the standard model, including one that incorporates dynamic incentives, and it can only be partly accounted for by higher supervisory effort. We conclude that the increase is a "behavioral" response. Yet in subsequent months, the increase is comprehensively reversed. In fact, an entirely standard model with no behavioral or dynamic features that we estimate off the pre-change data, fits the observations four months after the <b>contract</b> <b>change</b> remarkably well. While not an unequivocal indictment of the recent emphasis on "behavioral economics," the findings suggest that non-standard responses may be ephemeral, especially in employment contexts in which the baseline relationship is delineated by financial considerations in the first place. From an empirical perspective, therefore, it is ideal to examine responses to a <b>contract</b> <b>change</b> over an substantial period of time...|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ An {{important}} {{contributor to}} cost overruns of infrastructure projects is contract changes after the construction contract has been concluded. Using mainly descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests, real project {{data were analyzed}} from forty-five Dutch transportation infrastructure projects with a total construction contract value of over € 8. 5 billion. First it was explored if we could find evidence for the presumption that contractors bid low on contracts to recover the loss of bid profit by claiming <b>contract</b> <b>change</b> costs in the project implementation. We conclude {{that we could not}} find evidence for the opportunistic behavior of contractors. Second, the different sizes and reasons for the contract changes were explored. We conclude that: scope changes are the most significant reason for contract changes, followed by technical necessities; smaller projects tend to have higher relative <b>contract</b> <b>change</b> costs; and contract changes due to omissions in the contract are more present in smaller projects than in larger projects. The results of the analysis suggest among other things that policymakers and planners should pay more attention to flexible contracting, and to the contract management of smaller projects...|$|E
