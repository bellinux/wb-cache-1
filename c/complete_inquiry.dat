25|$|The primary mode of {{informing the}} quality of water of rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, estuaries, coastal waters and {{wetlands}} of the U.S. is through the National Water Quality Inventory Report. Water quality assessments are conducted pursuant to water quality standards adopted by states and other jurisdictions (territories, interstate commissions and tribes). The report is conveyed to Congress {{as a means to}} inform Congress and the public of compliance with quality standards established by states, territories and tribes. The assessments identify water quality problems within the states and jurisdictions, list the impaired and threatened water bodies, and identify non-point sources that contribute to poor water quality. Every two years states must submit reports that describe water quality conditions to EPA with a <b>complete</b> <b>inquiry</b> of social and economic costs and benefits of achieving goals of the Act. The report is organized into two major sections; Section 1 shows national assessment of each type of water body, with causes and sources identified. Section 2 summarizes recommendations on improvement of water resource management.|$|E

Kim flinched under the leather, and, rolling sideways, brought down the Chaplain, who, ever a man of action, caught him by the throat and nearly choked {{the life out of}} him. Kim then kicked him desperately in the stomach. Mr Bennett gasped and doubled up, but without relaxing his grip, rolled over again, and silently hauled Kim to his own tent.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the use of guided science inquiry methods with self-monitoring checklists to support problem-solving for students with moderate cognitive disabilities in both science and functional daily activities. The present study contributes to the literature examining guided inquiry methods as a means for student with a moderate intellectual disability to 1) gain access to the general curriculum standards and 2) build self-determination skills, and expands on the current literature by adding generalization conditions where students apply inquiry problem solving skills to functional daily applications that may benefit them directly in post school settings (Miller, 2012). The study investigates two hypotheses; H 1 : When provided a self-monitoring checklist, students with a moderate intellectual disability enrolled in a functional curriculum will increase their level of autonomy when <b>completing</b> <b>inquiry</b> problem-solving activities linked to science content, with the null hypotheses stating, Ho: When provided a self-monitoring checklist, students with a moderate intellectual disability enrolled in a functional curriculum will not increase their level of autonomy when <b>completing</b> <b>inquiry</b> problem-solving activities linked to science content, and H 2 : When provided a self-monitoring checklist, students with a moderate intellectual disability enrolled in a functional curriculum will increase their level of autonomy when presented with novel problem-solving tasks related to daily living situations, the null hypotheses stating, Ho 2 : When provided with a self-monitoring checklist, students with a moderate intellectual disability enrolled in a functional curriculum not increase their level of autonomy when presented with novel problem-solving tasks related to daily living situations. The study resulted in a rejection of both null hypotheses with the need for replication studies to verify findings. ...|$|R

In an effort to increase science capacity in youth, it is easy to focus only on developing the concrete skills and knowledge that a trained scientist must possess. However, when science learning is presented in a youth-development setting, the context of the program also matters. This paper reports the development and testing of the Science Process Skills Inventory (SPSI) and its usefulness for measuring science inquiry skill development in youth development science programs. The results of the psychometric testing of the SPSI indicated the instrument is reliable and measures a cohesive construct called science process skills, as reflected in the 11 items that make up this group of skills. The 11 items themselves are based on the cycle of science inquiry, and represent the important steps of the <b>complete</b> <b>inquiry</b> process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we aimed to {{identify}} the relation between students’ reflection levels and their inquirylearning outcomes (i. e. their formulated conclusions) after conducting a <b>complete</b> <b>inquiry</b> cycle in anonline Go-Lab Inquiry Learning Space (ILS). We expected that students exhibiting a higher reflectionlevel would be more experienced in formulating higher quality conclusions than students at a lowerreflection level. Forty-three students from the 9 th grade {{with an average age}} of 15 years from twoEstonian public schools participated in this study. During the interventions students worked with achemistry-based ILS called “What does pH measure?” Students were given a pre-defined problem tobe solved by following an inquiry cycle. In each phase students had tasks to perform which led toconcrete learning outcomes. The students used specific application called Conclusion Tool to statetheir conclusions and used Reflection Tool to answer two open-ended reflective questions to reflect ontheir study process. The results suggest that students who reflect at a higher reflection level are moresuccessful in formulating higher quality inquiry outcomes such as hypotheses, observations andconclusions. Therefore it seems that reflection {{should be part of the}} learning process in order tosupport students to achieve higher quality inquiry learning outcomes...|$|E

[...] The word coniuratio during this period carried multiple connotations; literally a [...] "swearing together" [...] or [...] "oath," [...] it could refer both to a ritualized oath-taking and to a political conspiracy. The suppression of the Bacchanalia thirteen years later, recorded by Livy and a bronze tablet inscribed with the senate's decree, was also described as a series of coniurationes, and demonstrates at least a perceived connection between political dissent and private religious practices. Those whom Minucius arrested at Bruttium for sacrilege were sent to Rome, then returned to Locri with instructions from the senate that they restore the funds taken from the shrine.|$|R

40|$|Background: The present rapid {{shift of}} {{industrialization}} from developed {{to developing countries}} requires developing countries to understand issues related to work organization, management, and working conditions. There are many factors slackening production, of which working conditions is part. A <b>complete</b> <b>inquiry</b> into the workers' working conditions can enable managements to reduce risks in the workplaces and improve productivity. Understanding and awareness {{of the benefits of}} workplace research and a probe into the working conditions in the Ugandan apparel assembly plants are urgently required. Methods: A total of 103 (70 women and 33 men) workers from five different plants were interviewed. Together with the top management of various plants, questionnaires about the workers' opinions of their physical working conditions were prepared. Data was collected using two methods: (1) questionnaire; and (2) observation of the workers during their work. Results: The results indicated that poor plant working conditions were mainly contributed by the workers' social factors and the management policies. Conclusion: The government, together with the management, should work to improve the working conditions in the apparel assembly plants, as it greatly affects both.

The package is widely available for both statistical situations, confirmatory analysis and exploratory analysis, and is planned to obtain statistical wisdom and to choose optimal process of statistical analysis for senior statisticians. System Modules The NISAN system has the following diversity functions: (1) highly portable, (2) interactive service, (3) data base, (4) inquiry, (5) documentation and (6) abundant data investigation. The computer language used in the NISAN system is FORTRAN only, and the system consists mainly of four large modules which are interlaced with one another. (1 - 8). Most STAT modules introduce several adequate processes of statistical analysis, which include current and newly developed statistical methods in exploratory or confirmatory situations. Therefore it may be said at present that the modules attempt {{to give us the}} most progressive methodology for the practical use of statistical program packages. The NISAN system files consist of a data file for analysis and a document file for records. DATA modules control the data file, and DOC modules control the document file.
