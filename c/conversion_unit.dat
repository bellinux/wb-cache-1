5|$|No. 4 Operational Training Unit (No.4 OTU) was an {{operational}} <b>conversion</b> <b>unit</b> of the Royal Australian Air Force during World WarII. It was formed at Williamtown, New South Wales, in October 1942 to train pilots and wireless air gunners to operate Vultee Vengeance dive bombers. The school {{was equipped with}} Vengeances and CAC Wirraway aircraft. Accidents were common in operational conversion units, and No.4 OTU suffered several fatal crashes during its existence. It was disbanded in April 1944, handing Williamtown over to No.5 Operational Training Unit.|$|E

Energy <b>conversion</b> <b>units</b> (16, 18) are between contacts (20, 22) at the base and contacts (24, 26) at the loading link. Similar energy <b>conversion</b> <b>units</b> (30, 32) are between contacts (34, 36) at the support and contacts (38, 40) at the loading link. The energy <b>conversion</b> <b>units</b> can have a piezo-electric actuator, a shape memory retention actuator, an electro- or magneto-rheological fluid actuator or damper, or an electro- or magneto-restrictive actuator. USE - The interface is for damping mechanical vibrations between working assemblies e. g. at electrical current generators, in machinery, automotive engineering, construction or aerospace technology. The vibration damping gives increased comfort, less wear and a longer component life.

5|$|The {{squadron}} was re-raised in 1948 as the RAAF's bomber operational <b>conversion</b> <b>unit.</b> It has primarily {{served in}} this capacity since that time, {{though it has}} also maintained a secondary strike capability and was also tasked with reconnaissance duties between 1979 and 1993. No.6 Squadron is currently based at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and has been most recently equipped with Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft between January 2011 and December 2016.

5|$|During World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{established}} several {{operational training}} units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No.2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational <b>Conversion</b> <b>Unit</b> in September 1958.|$|E

5|$|In October 1950, No.482 Squadron {{personnel}} undertook airframe and Avon engine {{courses in}} preparation for the introduction of the recently ordered English Electric Canberra jet bomber, forty-eight of which began re-equipping No.82 Wing's flying squadrons in December 1953. During the 1950s and 60s, No.482 Squadron provided ground support for exercises involving the Canberras in Darwin and New Guinea, and for ceremonial occasions including several royal visits. In April 1968, No.1 Operational <b>Conversion</b> <b>Unit</b> (OCU), responsible for converting aircrew to the Canberra, was made independent of No.82 Wing to concentrate on providing crews for No.2 Squadron, which was on active duty in the Vietnam War. Maintenance responsibilities for the Canberras then transferred from No.482 Squadron to No.1 OCU, along with relevant staff and equipment.|$|E

5|$|The Harrier GR.1 {{made its}} first flight on 28 December 1967. It officially entered service with the RAF on 18 April 1969 when the Harrier <b>Conversion</b> <b>Unit</b> at RAF Wittering {{received}} its first aircraft. The aircraft were built in two factories—one in Kingston upon Thames, southwest London, and the other at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey—and underwent initial testing at Dunsfold. The ski-jump technique for launching Harriers from Royal Navy aircraft carriers was extensively trialled at RNAS Yeovilton from 1977. Following these tests ski-jumps {{were added to the}} flight decks of all RN carriers from 1979 onwards, in preparation for the new variant for the navy, the Sea Harrier.|$|E
5|$|The RAN's jet {{aircraft}} operational <b>conversion</b> <b>unit,</b> 724 Squadron, was also equipped with Skyhawks during 1968. By December {{of that year}} the squadron was operating a mixed fleet of TA-4G Skyhawks, de Havilland Sea Vampires and Sea Venoms from Albatross. The Skyhawk conversion courses conducted by this unit lasted for six months, and involved {{a total of about}} 110 hours of flying in TA-4Gs and A-4Gs. During this period pilots became familiar with flying the type and practised combat missions as well as air-to-air refuelling from other Skyhawks using buddy fuel tanks. They were also required to complete about 100 simulated carrier landings at Albatross before landing a Skyhawk on board Melbourne.|$|E

Four Victors, fitted with Yellow Astor reconnaissance radar, together with a number of passive sensors, were used to equip a secretive unit, the Radar Reconnaissance Flight at RAF Wyton.

Throughout Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, it prepared aircrew for operational service with No. 35 Squadron, and maintained a detachment in Papua and New Guinea to provide pilots with experience flying in tropical conditions. A Caribou was deployed to Pakistan from 1975 to 1978 to support United Nations peacekeepers, and detachments were established within Australia during the 1980s to provide search and rescue capabilities and work with Australian Army units. From 1999 until 2001, a detachment was deployed to East Timor {{as part of the}} Australian-led peacekeeping force in the newly independent nation.
