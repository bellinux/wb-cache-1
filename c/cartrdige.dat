5000|$|When Ruger {{entered the}} [...]416 caliber (10.36 mm) fray, {{they did so}} with a {{cartridge}} shorter but internally fatter than the [...]416 Remington Magnum {{which was based on}} their [...]375 Ruger necked up to [...]416 in. The cartridge was a co-development between Ruger and Hornady where Ruger developed the rifles and Hornady the ammunition. Compared to the [...]416 Ruger, the Remington cartridge has a greater case capacity and a higher S.A.A.M.I. recommended pressure level. This means that the Remington cartridge should perform better than the Ruger <b>cartrdige.</b> The Hornady's [...]416 Ruger ammunition matches both the Rigby and Remington [...]416 cartridges it does so working close to its maximum pressure level using a specially blended powder unavailable to the public. Those who handload their ammunition will have some difficulty reaching the performance of the factory loaded ammunition while staying within the maximum average pressure rating of the cartridge. Data published by Hornady provide a velocity for the 400 gr g of 2300 ft/s for the [...]416 Ruger, 2400 ft/s for the Rigby, 2450 ft/s for the [...]416 Remington Magnum and 2700 ft/s for the [...]416 Weatherby.|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the growth of each bundle of eight optic fibers from one ommatidium into the optic lamina of Daphnia occurs {{in such a way}} that one of the eight fibers precedes the others into the lamina. The growth cone of this lead fiber makes surface contact with undifferentiated neuroblasts near the midplane. This is followed by a glial-like wrapping of each neuroblast around the fiber. In this report, gap junctions are shown to form for a short period of time between the growing lead fiber and the neuroblast that is wrapping around it. It is proposed that these junctions may represent a morphological correlate of informational exchange between axon and neuroblast. This signaling would then reflect the fact that the sequence of axon proliferation by the lamina neuroblasts within an optic <b>cartrdige,</b> ultimately composed of five lamina neurons and eight optic fibers, parallels the order in which the neuroblasts undergo the wrapping reaction with the lead fiber...|$|E
