25|$|On 13 January 2016, 56 deputies of the {{parliamentary}} coalition formed around PD proposed controversial businessman Vlad Plahotniuc {{for the position}} of prime minister. The proposal was immediately rejected by President Nicolae Timofti, invoking integrity reasons. Timofti asked coalition representatives to propose another name until 14 January at 12 a.m. In the evening of 13 January, the coalition announced that will propose again Plahotniuc, thus escalating the constitutional conflict. The same day, two rallies took place in Chișinău, one that supports Vlad Plahotniuc for the position of prime minister and another that opposes the nomination. Next day, protests continued, {{with tens of thousands}} of people demonstrating in central Chișinău against Plahotniuc. By night, Timofti nominated the Secretary General of the Presidency, Ion Păduraru, candidate for this position, defying PD's proposal. However, Ion Păduraru announced his withdrawal from the race in less than 24 hours after the announcement of his nomination. He justified his gesture by the fact that {{the parliamentary}} majority has already nominated another proposal of premier, and President Timofti will consider it as a compromise solution. On 16 January, the parliamentary coalition grouped around the Democratic Party of Vlad Plahotniuc announced that disagrees with the proposal of President Timofti and came up with a new proposal for premier, instead of Plahotniuc – Pavel Filip. Later that day, up to 20,000 people joined three different rallies that were organized by both the left Socialist Party of Moldova and the centre-right <b>Civic</b> <b>Platform</b> DA. The protesters called on the Moldovan president and chief prosecutor to resign, demanding early elections and prompt measures against corruption. They also opposed the nomination of Pavel Filip to the post of Prime Minister.|$|E

The {{processes}} of the Polish transformation resulted in a considerable loss of economic potential and people who depended on such potential were deprived of means to support their existence. Gross national income dropped by over 18% within two years, which in Poland amounted to a deepest recession since the Great Depression crisis of 1929–33. The ideologically motivated, frenetic privatization, a sell out of best state enterprises {{for a fraction of}} their worth, was called by Aleksander Małachowski a [...] "reform by ruin". According to Karol Modzelewski (2013), the psychological, cultural and political consequences of the social degradation experienced still burden everyday life of the Poles and threaten the regained freedom. The trauma of the great transformation has been exploited by right-wing populists. David Ost wrote the following (2016), referring to the [...] "post-communist" [...] Democratic Left Alliance, its ascent to power and its decline in 1993–1997 and 2001–2005: [...] "Twice before PiS first came to power, parties aligned with the liberal left secured strong labor support. But by insisting on marketization, privatization and participation (as a peripheral player) in the global capitalist economy, and disparaging demands for more security, they soon squandered that support, and ended up driving regular workers into the arms of PiS." [...] Then in 2007–2015, [...] "market liberals of <b>Civic</b> <b>Platform</b> (...) pursued a pragmatic politics of adapting to the European Union (...) while suicidally pursuing a hard agenda against workers." [...] Economic insecurity having fueled the rise of the Right as elsewhere in Europe, [...] "Kaczyński won in 2015 by focusing on economic issues" [...] and because of PiS' [...] "promise of economic security".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the key to the centrist <b>Civic</b> <b>Platform’s</b> victory in the 2011 Polish election, the first by an {{incumbent}} governing party in post-communist Poland, was its ability to generate fear about the possible consequences of the right-wing Law and Justice party returning to power. Although many of the <b>Civic</b> <b>Platform’s</b> supporters were disappointed with its slow progress in modernising the country, most voters viewed the party as the better guarantor of stability at a time of crisis and continued to harbour deeply ingrained concerns about the main opposition party. The election appeared to provide further evidence of the consolidation and stabilisation of the Polish party system around the Civic Platform–Law and Justice divide. However, other factors pointed to the dangers of declaring that the Polish party system was ‘frozen’ around these two political blocs and suggested that it remained vulnerable to further shocks and re-alignments...|$|R

This paper reports on a mixed-methods study of a <b>civic</b> tech <b>platform</b> that enabled the public to provide feedback on public transport to the service providers. The overall aim of this research was to investigate the public's use of a leading <b>civic</b> tech <b>platform,</b> FixMyTransport. The key findings were that: an effective and easy-to-use <b>civic</b> technology <b>platform</b> enables broad participation; data and process complexity need to be removed; factual information can be captured in situ with impacts, consequences and opinions added later; emotions (if important) need to be explicitly elicited; feedback to, and a 'conversation' with, the users is important for engagement, as is a feeling of being part of a community.
