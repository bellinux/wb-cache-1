To exert toxicity and carcinogenicity Cr (VI) must be reduced inside cells, {{and it can}} be reduced both enzymatically and non-enyzmatically.

Chromate poisoning cause severe skin disorders allergic dermatitis, liver and kidney damage. Thus chromium causes great public concern. A wide range of separation process has been investigated for the removal of Chromium (VI) from water. Adsorption using activated carbons posed to be the efficient method for removal of Chromium ions from water. To use carbon as an adsorbent requires activation or surface modification of carbon. Methods like thermal and chemical methods of activation are common, but some problems are associated with them. Electrochemical method as one of the method of surface modification of commercially available activated carbon can be applied. The result is better adsorption of Chromium (VI) ions. The present thesis includes various adsorption techniques. A literature review of adsorption characteristics has been included. Our project work include fabrication of an experimental setup, surface modification (oxidation at anode) in 0. 5 M KCl solution at various intensity of currents, and latter comparisons of BET surface area, porosity, FTIR analysis (for identification of changes in bonds after electrochemical oxidation) and adsorption in spectrophotometer. Surface area, pore volume and pore size all decrease with increase in current intensity. A significant loss in porosity and decrease in pore diameter were observed and is due to blockage of pores by formation of functional groups (carboxylic acidic groups, hydroxyl groups, lactonic grops, phenolic group) and aggregation of humic substances. As the intensity of oxidation is increased by increasing the intensity of source current the amount of adsorption also increases. Also it is observed that if the intensity of current is increased from 0. 1 Amp to 2. 1 Amp, the amount of adsorption increases. But as the current approaches to 2. 1 Amp the adsorption amount doesn’t change significantly. Sample oxidized at 2. 1 ampere was analyzed in FTIR.

The present study {{deals with the}} sorption efficiency of metal adsorption through the chemically modified PAA with dihydroxybenzenes into the polymeric matrix present in the tannery effluents and a parallel investigation of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> ions in aqueous solution was carried out. From the Langmuir model the removal of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> has the maximum adsorption capacity with 181. 4  mg g− 1. Batch sorption to remove <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> and lead (II) from the tannery effluents was investigated by using different parameters. The sorption efficiency {{was found to be}} 75 % and 99 % for <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> and lead (II), respectively, present in the tannery effluents.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> by Chitosan Coated Montmorillonite (CCM) from {{aqueous solution}} was studied. To evaluate the adsorption capacity, {{the effects of}} pH, initial concentration and temperature on the adsorption were investigated. The isothermal data was applied to Langmuir linear and the Freundlich linear isotherm equation and the thermodynamic parameters (ΔH, ΔG, ΔS) were calculated according {{to the values of}} binding Langmuir constant, K L. Results indicated that the adsorption between CCM and <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> was significantly physical, the negative ΔH constant at lower temperature confirmed that the more <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> was adsorbed by chitosan coated montmorillonite at lower temperature. The kinetics of the sorption process of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> on chitosan coated montmorillonite were investigated using the pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetics, results showed that the pseudo-second order equation model provided the best correlation with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the possibility of using maize tassel as an alternative adsorbent for the removal of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> and cadmium (II) ions from aqueous solutions. The effect of pH, solution temperature, contact time, initial metal ion concentration and adsorbent dose on the adsorption of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> and cadmium (II) by tassel was investigated using batch methods. Adsorption for both <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> and cadmium (II) was found to be highly pH dependent compared to the other parameters investigated. Obtained results gave an adsorption capacity of 79. 1 % for <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> at pH 2, exposure time of 1 h at 25 ºC. Maximum capacity of cadmium of 88 % was obtained in the pH range of 5 - 6 at 25 ºC after exposure time of 1 h. The adsorption capacities of tassel for both <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> and cadmium (II) were found to be comparable to those of other commercial adsorbents currently in use for the removal of heavy metals from aqueous wastes. These results have demonstrated the immense potential of maize tassel as an alternative adsorbent for toxic metal ions remediation in polluted water and wastewater...|$|R
40|$|Granular Activated Charcoal (GAC) was {{prepared}} by using Cordia macleodii tree bark and was {{tested for the}} removal of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI).</b> All the experiments were carried out in batch process. To enhance its metal ions adsorption capacity, activated carbons were impregnated with the chelating agents like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium dodecyl benzeneulfonate (SDBS) and Dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt (DOSS) and were tested {{for the removal of}} <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI).</b> Adsorption isotherms of Chromium ions in aqueous solution have been experimentally measured on both modified and unmodified charcoal. Effects of adsorbent dose, pH, contact time, initial concentration and temperature were investigated on removal of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI).</b> Adsorption was confirmed by SEM-EDAX and FTIR morphological analysis. The adsorption data were fitted well by Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Approximately 96. 54 % of hexavalent Chromium was removed at pH 2 within 3 hr. It was found that chemically modified GAC with chelating agents demonstrated better <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> removal capabilities as compared to pure adsorbents in terms of their adsorption rate. On the basis of present studies, it can be concluded that granular activated charcoal impregnated with chelating agents has a higher <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> adsorption capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{study on}} {{performance}} of low-cost adsorbent such as saw dust of Gmelina arborea (Ghambhari tree) in {{the removal of}} <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> ion from aqueous solution is performed. The adsorbent material adopted {{was found to be}} an efficient media for removal of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> ion in continuous mode using fixed bed column. A comparative study has also been done on the adsorption capacity of saw dust of different mesh sizes. The column studies were conducted with a fixed column of diameter 7 cms and a bed height of 50 cms. The flow rate of solution passing through the adsorbent bed was maintained at a fixed value of 1 litre/min. It was found that the metal uptake capacity (amount of removal) of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> ion decreased but the adsorption capacity (percentage of removal) increased with the decrease in the concentration of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> in the initial sample solution. It was also observed that the order of metal uptake capacity & adsorption capacity of saw dust of different ISS mesh size for removal of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> removal was as follows: (- 30 + 10) > (- 50 + 30) > (- 70 + 50). ...|$|R
