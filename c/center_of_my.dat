25|$|The {{historic}} {{territory of}} Champa roughly equals the South Central Coast region, {{although it has}} at times extended well into the North Central Coast and its influence also extended into the Central Highlands. Except for its first capital, all of Champa's political centers were located in the South Central Coast. Some of the earlier capitals, {{as well as the}} religious <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mỹ</b> Sơn and the port city of Hội An were located in the territory of present-day Quảng Nam Province. Probably due to defeats in wars against Đại Việt the political center shifted further south to Vijaya in what is now Bình Định Province. After the fall of Vijaya to Vietnam in 1471, Champa had to retreat to the southern principality of Panduranga (now at Phan Rang in Ninh Thuận Province), while much of occupied Champa continued to exist as a sort of protectorate within Vietnam for some time.|$|E

60|$|When {{consciousness}} returned, and, as I soon learned, I {{was down}} but a moment, I sprang quickly {{to my feet}} searching for my sword, and there I found it, buried to the hilt in the green breast of Zad, who lay stone dead upon the ochre moss of the ancient sea bottom. As I regained my full senses I found his weapon piercing my left breast, but only through the flesh and muscles which cover my ribs, entering near the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> chest and coming out below the shoulder. As I had lunged I had turned so that his sword merely passed beneath the muscles, inflicting a painful but not dangerous wound.|$|E
60|$|But {{of course}} there is no telling where it went to. And besides, whoever gets it will hide it; I know it because I would do it myself. I believe I can be honest in all other matters, but I already begin to realize that the core and <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> nature is love of the beautiful, a passion for the beautiful, and {{that it would not be}} safe to trust me with a moon that belonged to another person and that person didn't know I had it. I could give up a moon that I found in the daytime, because I should be afraid some one was looking; but if I found it in the dark, I am sure I should find some kind of an excuse for not saying {{anything}} about it. For I do love moons, they are so pretty and so romantic. I wish we had five or six; I would never go to bed; I should never get tired lying on the moss-bank and looking up at them.|$|E
60|$|Entirely {{outfitted}} I {{would not}} have known myself, so strange was my garb and my armament. Upon my back were slung my bow, arrows, shield, and short spear; from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> girdle depended my knife; at my right hip was my stone hatchet; and at my left hung the coils of my long rope. By reaching my right hand over my left shoulder, I could seize the spear or arrows; my left hand could find my bow over my right shoulder, while a veritable contortionist-act was necessary to place my shield {{in front of me}} and upon my left arm. The shield, long and oval, is utilized more as back-armor than as a defense against frontal attack, for the close-set armlets of gold upon the left forearm are principally depended upon to ward off knife, spear, hatchet, or arrow from in front; but against the greater carnivora and the attacks of several human antagonists, the shield is utilized to its best advantage and carried by loops upon the left arm.|$|E

40|$|The main theme <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{thesis is}} {{institution}} of extraordinary punishment {{and the way}} how it is comprehended by Czech law. While imprisonment for life can be imposed in almost all European countries and this punishment isn't systematicaly excluded from criminal codes, the Czech conception is different. Czech law not only states which crimes are punishable by imprisonment for life but also that said crimes must fulfil legal conditions which characterize offender's motivations, means of execution and consequences of said criminal offence. These legal conditions, {{that are part of}} czech law since 1961, are in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>of</b> <b>my</b> thesis {{in spite of the fact}} that in the past it was embodied by death penalty which is unallowable for today's standarts. Other possibilities of imposing imprisonment for longer period than legally determined are also mentioned together with the strictest ways of criminal law punishments of legal persons or persons that are less than 18 years old. Other aims of this thesis are exploring of extraordinary punishment history (in terms of both death penalty and imprisonment) and comparation with current legal order. Domestic legal adaptation is evaluated from international and constitutional point of view, since life imprisonment can be rated as inadmissible by European [...] ...|$|R

60|$|I now {{began to}} feel {{unsettled}} and ill at ease about the stomach, as if matters were all topsy-turvy there; and felt strange and giddy about the head; and so I made no doubt {{that this was the}} beginning of that dreadful thing, the sea-sickness. Feeling worse and worse, I told one of the sailors how it was with me, and begged him to make my excuses very civilly to the chief mate, for I thought I would go below and spend the night in my bunk. But he only laughed at me, and said something about my mother not being aware <b>of</b> <b>my</b> being out; which enraged me not a little, that a man whom I had heard swear so terribly, should dare to take such a holy name into his mouth. It seemed a sort of blasphemy, and it seemed like dragging out the best and most cherished secrets <b>of</b> <b>my</b> soul, for at that time the name of mother was the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> all <b>my</b> heart's finest feelings, which ere that, I had learned to keep secret, deep down in my being.|$|R
