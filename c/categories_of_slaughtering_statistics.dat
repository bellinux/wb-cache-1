Local male sheep which were used as subject research obtained from Temanggung, i. e. healthy male sheep, aged 1. 5 - 12 months; <b>slaughtered</b> at 6 <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>slaughter</b> weight ranging from 5 to 30 kg.    The sheep was slaughtered and sampled for chemical composition determination of Longissimus dorsi (LD) dan Biceps femoris (BF). The nested ANOVA was used to analyze data and any differences among the groups were further tested using Duncan Multiple Range Tests (DMRT).   The results showed that moisture, ash, fat and cholesterol content of the meat from different slaughtered weight were not significant (P> 0. 05).   The increase <b>of</b> <b>slaughter</b> weight significantly (P 0. 05).   The conclusion of the research were (1) moisture, ash, fat and cholesterol content of local male sheep meat from different slaughtered weight were not significant, but protein and vitamin A content of the meat from different slaughtered weight were significant, (2) chemical composition of local male sheep from LD and BF were not significant.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of welfare issues {{relating}} to religious slaughter and the handling of animals both before slaughter and at point <b>of</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Most notably perceived pain and distress by cattle during the neck cut and the duration of sensibility in the period after slaughter prior to loss of brain function are often examined within religious slaughter methods. This paper will examine two different methods <b>of</b> the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> cattle: penetrating captive bolt versus traditional halal slaughter. The two methods at point <b>of</b> <b>slaughter</b> will first be illustrated, and then pre-slaughter methods relating to the restraint of the animal prior to slaughter will be compared and contrasted. Ultimately, these comparisons will answer the question: is commercial captive bolt stunning more humane than the practice <b>of</b> halal style <b>slaughter?</b> Several physiological indicators such as bleed-out rate, sentience at point <b>of</b> <b>slaughter,</b> and time to collapse among others will be examined and compared between the two methods...|$|R

There are several interesting aspects of the world environment friendly economy. In the introduction chapter development swine-breeding and pork consumption in our country is outlined. The main part of this study compares the difference between conventional farming and organic farming. Considerable part of this work is focused on various <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> pigs with the emphasis on welfare. Principles of group housing of sows and piglets are also mentioned, as well as an outdoor pig housing, which is still only marginally used in the Czech Republic. The work includes principles of nutrition and feeding pigs in each <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> pigs according to ecological principles, which are very different from the normal feeding on the basis of complete feed mixtures. The work also describes the principles <b>of</b> <b>slaughtering</b> animals in organic farming. It is irreplaceable that swine-breeding is not subsidized, only through arable land, which produces feed. The question is whether the subsidy is sufficient at higher field intensity of production and consequently organic swine-breeding...|$|R
