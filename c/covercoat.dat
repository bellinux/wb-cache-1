50|$|A decal {{typically}} comprises three layers: the color, or image, layer which {{comprises the}} decorative design; the <b>covercoat,</b> a clear protective layer, which may incorporate a low-melting glass; and the backing paper {{on which the}} design is printed by screen printing or lithography. There are various methods of transferring the design while removing the backing-paper, {{some of which are}} suited to machine application.|$|E
40|$|Within this work, a two-component {{anti-corrosive}} {{epoxy primer}} formulation, Sigmacoverâ„¢ 280, and its resulting films were prepared and evaluated. The optimum coating time following formulation was extended by adding an appropriate amount of solvent as a controlled thinner. The draw down coating method was identified to be a reproducible and a robust paint film deposition process. Gravimetric analysis, Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and through-dry testing {{were used in}} the characterization of the curing and drying behavior of each applied primer film. The shortest time for achieving a through-dry state occurred with thinner films cured at the higher temperature, as seen in the film curing/drying. The minimum <b>covercoating</b> time and full cure time of the paint films, cured under the different conditions, were evaluated by means of its dryness, hardness, and curing state studies/characterization...|$|R
