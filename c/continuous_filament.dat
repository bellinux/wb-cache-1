5|$|The modern {{method for}} {{producing}} glass wool is {{the invention of}} Games Slayter working at the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. (Toledo, Ohio). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933. The first commercial production of glass fiber was in 1936. In 1938 Owens-Illinois Glass Company and Corning Glass Works joined to form the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation. When the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber, they introduced <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> glass fibers. Owens-Corning is still the major glass-fiber producer in the market today.|$|E
5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> of the silk protein, fibroin, gummed together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking in hot water, and the silk is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E

Mohawk Industries released everSTRAND in 1999, a 100% post-consumer recycled content PET fiber. Since that time, more than 17 billion bottles have been recycled into carpet fiber. Pharr Yarns, a supplier to numerous carpet manufacturers including Looptex, Dobbs Mills, and Berkshire Flooring, produces a BCF (bulk <b>continuous</b> <b>filament)</b> PET carpet fiber containing a minimum of 25% post-consumer recycled content.|$|E

500|$|In the <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> process, {{after the}} fiber is drawn, a size is applied. [...] This size helps protect the fiber {{as it is}} wound onto a bobbin. [...] The {{particular}} size applied relates to end-use. [...] While some sizes are processing aids, others make the fiber have an affinity for a certain resin, if the fiber {{is to be used}} in a composite. Size is usually added at 0.5–2.0% by weight. Winding then takes place at around 1 km/min.|$|E
500|$|Bushings are {{the major}} expense in fiber glass production. [...] The nozzle design is also critical. [...] The number of nozzles ranges from 200 to 4000 in {{multiples}} of 200. [...] The {{important part of the}} nozzle in <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> manufacture is the thickness of its walls in the exit region. [...] It was found that inserting a counterbore here reduced wetting. [...] Today, the nozzles are designed to have a minimum thickness at the exit. [...] As glass flows through the nozzle, it forms a drop which is suspended from the end. [...] As it falls, it leaves a thread attached by the meniscus to the nozzle as long as the viscosity is in the correct range for fiber formation. [...] The smaller the annular ring of the nozzle and the thinner the wall at exit, the faster the drop will form and fall away, and the lower its tendency to wet the vertical part of the nozzle. [...] The surface tension of the glass is what influences the formation of the meniscus. [...] For E-glass it should be around 400mN/m.|$|E
500|$|Pure silica (silicon dioxide), when cooled as {{fused quartz}} {{into a glass}} with no true melting point, {{can be used as}} a glass fiber for fiberglass, but has the {{drawback}} that it must be worked at very high temperatures. In order to lower the necessary work temperature, other materials are introduced as [...] "fluxing agents" [...] (i.e., components to lower the melting point). Ordinary A-glass ("A" [...] for [...] "alkali-lime") or soda lime glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called cullet glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass. E-glass ("E" [...] because of initial electrical application), is alkali free, and was the first glass formulation used for <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> formation. It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass ("S" [...] for [...] "Strength") is used when high tensile strength (modulus) is important, and is thus important in composites for building and aircraft construction. The same substance is known as R-glass ("R" [...] for [...] "reinforcement") in Europe. C-glass ("C" [...] for [...] "chemical resistance") and T-glass ("T" [...] is for [...] "thermal insulator" [...] – a North American variant of C-glass) are resistant to chemical attack; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{knitting}} may be {{done with}} ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers. [...] In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a Z-twist or S-twist yarn.

[...] In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the microwave filament processing project is to develop microwave techniques to manufacture <b>continuous</b> ceramic oxide <b>filaments.</b> Microwave processing uses the volumetric absorption of microwave power in oxide filament tows to drive off process solvents, to burn out organic binders, and to sinter the dried fibers to produce flexible, high-strength ceramic filaments. The technical goal is to advance filament processing technology by microwave heating more rapidly with less energy and {{at a lower cost}} than conventional processing, but with the same quality as conventional processing. The manufacturing goal is to collaborate with the 3 M Company, a US manufacturer of ceramic oxide filaments, to evaluate the technology using a prototype filament system and to transfer the microwave technology to the 3 M Company. <b>Continuous</b> ceramic <b>filaments</b> are a principal component in many advanced high temperature materials like continuous fiber ceramic composites (CFCC) and woven ceramic textiles.

This technology opens up possibilities of building curved plastic parts that have conductive electronic tracks and components printed {{as an integral part of}} the plastic component, thereby eliminating printed circuit boards and wiring. It is not possible to do this with existing flat-layer additive manufacturing technologies as the continuity of a circuit could be interrupted between the layers.
