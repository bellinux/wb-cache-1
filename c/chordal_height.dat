Gore & Assoc, Flagstaff, AZ) in {{patients}} with degenerative mitral valve insufficiency has become a standard technique used by surgeons in mitral valve repair with good long-term results. Nevertheless, determining the correct length of the artificial chordae has remained problematic. Although various procedures have been previously published, {{in this article we}} describe our approach used to achieve an accurate <b>chordal</b> <b>height</b> adjustment...|$|E
40|$|I {{have read}} with great {{interest}} the article by Hata et al [1]. I would like to congratu-late the authors because very good results {{in a very long}} follow-up are evident in this article. However, at the outset, I wish to emphasize several concepts. Firstly, the superiority of the chordal replacement over the chordal shortening in the particular setting of the anterior leaflet prolapse of the mitral valve has been established [2]. Secondly, complete endothelization with no signs of inflammatory re-sponse of the ePTFE neo-chodae has been also observed by others [3]. And thirdly, what is particularly disturbing is {{the problem of how to}} properly measure the exact length of the artificial chordae. The problem is so great as there are no standarized methods to do so. Dr Robert W. M. Frater did me the honour of sending two illustra-tions which emphasize the way to do just that. This is very similar to what has been described by the authors [1]. However, I must recognize that there have been many technical inaccuracies regarding the right selection of the artificial <b>chordal</b> <b>height.</b> This technique above may solve the matter in tying the knot at the intended length. But the issue of deciding the length of the neo-chordae is still unresolved. Small clip...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 5 -Axis milling simulations in CAM software {{are mainly}} {{used to detect}} collisions between the tool and the part. They are very limited in terms of surface topography investigations to validate machining strategies as well as machining parameters such as <b>chordal</b> deviation, scallop <b>height</b> and tool feed. Z-buffer or N- buffer machining simulations provide more precise simulations but require long computation time, especially when using realistic cutting tools models including cutting edges geometry. Thus, {{the aim of this}} paper is to evaluate Nvidia CUDA architecture to speed-up Z-buffer or N-buffer machining simulations. Several strategies for parallel computing are investigated and compared to single-threaded and multi-threaded CPU, relatively to the complexity of the simulation. Simulations are conducted with two different configurations including Nvidia Quadro 4000 and Geforce GTX 560 graphic cards...|$|R
