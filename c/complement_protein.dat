50|$|The {{membrane}} attack {{complex is}} initiated when the <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C5 convertase cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b.|$|E
5000|$|Patients {{naturally}} {{have different}} levels of <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> in their serum. To negate any effects this might have on the test, the <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> in the patient's serum must be destroyed and replaced by a known amount of standardized <b>complement</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Complement</b> control <b>proteins</b> {{also play}} a role in malignancy. <b>Complement</b> <b>proteins</b> protect against {{malignant}} cells- both by direct complement attack and through initiation of Complement-dependent cytotoxicity, which synergises with specific monoclonal antibody therapies. However, some malignant cells have been shown to have increased expression of membrane-bound <b>complement</b> control <b>proteins,</b> especially CD46, DAF and CD59. This mechanism allows some tumours to evade complement action.|$|R
50|$|It {{is caused}} by a deficit of the <b>complement</b> <b>protein,</b> C5; however, case reports have {{described}} it in relation to deficits in either C3 or C4.|$|E
50|$|Protein S (also {{known as}} S-Protein) is a vitamin K-dependent plasma {{glycoprotein}} synthesized in the liver. In the circulation, Protein S exists in two forms: a free form and a complex form bound to <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C4b-binding protein (C4BP). In humans, protein S is encoded by the PROS1 gene.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of TEP1 and its vertebrate homologue - <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C3- is mostly conserved. However, {{there are some}} {{differences between the two}} molecules, for example unlike C3, TEP1 lacks an anaphylatoxin domain. The absence of this domain means that the exposed thioester bond of active TEP1 is unstable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Complement</b> <b>proteins</b> C3a, C4a, and C5a work by {{triggering}} histamine {{release from}} mast cells and basophil granulocytes.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of other immunoglobulins (especially IgA) and/or <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> (especially C4) increases the specificity of a positive test.|$|R
5000|$|A known {{amount of}} {{standard}} <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> {{are added to}} the serum. (These proteins are frequently obtained from guinea pig serum.) ...|$|R
50|$|When the {{paratope}} of Ig class gamma (IgG) binds its matching epitope, IgG's Fc region conformationally {{shifts and}} can host a <b>complement</b> <b>protein,</b> initiating the complement cascade that terminates by punching {{a hole in}} a cell membrane. With many holes so punched, fluid rushes into the cell and ruptures it.|$|E
50|$|Urinalysis {{typically}} demonstrates hematuria and proteinuria. Levels of the <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C3 are low, while {{levels of}} C-reactive protein and cryoglobulins may be modestly elevated. Blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid cultures demonstrate Staphylococcus epidermidis, a coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. Biopsy of the kidney frequently demonstrates membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, with deposits of C3, IgM, and IgG.|$|E
5000|$|Eculizumab is a {{recombinant}} humanized {{monoclonal antibody}} against the <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C5. [...] It is an immunoglobulin G-kappa (IgGÎº) consisting of human constant regions and murine complementarity-determining regions grafted onto human framework light and heavy chain variable regions. The compound contains two 448-amino acid heavy chains and two 214-amino acid light chains, {{and has a}} molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons (kDa).|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{has demonstrated that}} the complement cascade {{is involved in a}} variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes in addition to its role as an immune effector. Research in a variety of organ systems has shown that <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> are direct participants in maintenance of cellular turnover, healing, proliferation and regeneration. As a physiologic housekeeper, <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> maintain tissue integrity in the absence of inflammation by disposing of cellular debris and waste, a process critical to the prevention of autoimmune disease. Developmentally, <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> influence pathways including hematopoietic stem cell engraftment, bone growth, and angiogenesis. They also provide a potent stimulus for cellular proliferation including regeneration of the limb and eye in animal models, and liver proliferation following injury. Here, we describe the complement cascade as a mediator of tissue growth and regeneration...|$|R
5000|$|In certain {{diseases}} or conditions, an individual's blood {{may contain}} IgG antibodies that can specifically bind to antigens on the RBC surface membrane, and their circulating RBCs can become coated with IgG alloantibodies and/or IgG autoantibodies. <b>Complement</b> <b>proteins</b> may subsequently bind to the bound antibodies and cause RBC destruction. The direct Coombs test {{is used to}} detect these antibodies or <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> that are bound {{to the surface of}} red blood cells; a blood sample is taken and the RBCs are washed (removing the patient's own plasma) and then incubated with anti-human globulin (also known as [...] "Coombs reagent"). If this produces agglutination of RBCs, the direct Coombs test is positive, a visual indication that antibodies (and/or <b>complement</b> <b>proteins)</b> are bound to the surface of red blood cells.|$|R
40|$|Self {{protection}} of host cells against inadvertent injury resulting from attack by autologous <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> is well reported for vascular epithelium. In intestinal epithelium, {{the expression of}} C <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> and regulatory proteins remains currently poorly reported. This study looked at the distribution of C <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> and regulatory decay accelerating factor (DAF) in four cultured human intestinal cell lines of embryogenic or colon cancer origins. C 3 and C 4 proteins and DAF were widely present in human colon adenocarcinoma T 84, HT- 29 glc-/+ cells compared with human embryonic INT 407 cells. In contrast, no expression of C 5, C 5 b- 9, and CR 1 was seen {{for any of the}} cell lines. Taking advantage of the Caco- 2 cells, which spontaneously differentiate in culture, it was seen that the C 3, C 4, and DAF were present in undifferentiated cells and that their expression increased {{as a function of the}} cell differentiation. These results, taken together with other reports on the presence of C <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> and DAF in the intestinal cells infer that the expression of regulatory C <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> develops in parallel with the expression of C proteins to protect these cells against the potential injury resulting from the activation of these local C proteins. Moreover, the finding that the pathogenic C 1845 Escherichia coli binds to the membrane bound DAF in the cultured human intestinal cells synthetising locally C proteins and regulatory C proteins supports the hypothesis that E coli could promote inflammatory disorders by blocking local regulatory protein function...|$|R
50|$|Beta-2 {{comprises}} C3 (<b>Complement</b> <b>protein</b> 3). It {{is raised}} in the acute phase response. Depression of C3 occurs in autoimmune disorders as the complement system is activated and the C3 becomes bound to immune complexes and removed from serum. Fibrinogen, a beta-2 protein, is found in normal plasma but absent in normal serum. Occasionally, blood drawn from heparinized patients does not fully clot, resulting in a visible fibrinogen band between the beta and gamma globulins.|$|E
50|$|Protein microarrays have {{stringent}} production, storage, {{and experimental}} conditions {{due to the}} low stability and necessity of considering the native folding on the immobilized proteins. Peptides, on the other hand, are more chemically resistant and can retain partial aspects of protein function. As such, peptide microarrays {{have been used to}} <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> microarrays in proteomics research and diagnostics. Protein microarrays usually use Escherichia coli to produce proteins of interest; whereas peptide microarrays use the SPOT technique (stepwise synthesis of peptides on cellulose) or photolithography to make peptides.|$|E
50|$|TEP1 is an {{antimicrobial}} protein {{which acts}} {{in a system}} reminiscent of the human complement pathway, which damages the cell membranes of pathogens. Studies have shown that TEP1 is structurally and functionally homologous to the human <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C3. TEP1 is now known {{to be important in}} the resistance of Anopheles mosquitoes to Plasmodium infection, targeting the malaria parasite during its invasion into the mosquitoes body cavity. Following this discovery insect thioester containing proteins have come under increased scrutiny from the scientific community as possible targets for disease control.|$|E
50|$|The {{lymph nodes}} {{irritation}} causes a response by the dust cells/alveolar macrophages, which cause enzymes, <b>complement</b> <b>proteins,</b> and regulatory {{factors such as}} interleukin-1 to get produced.|$|R
50|$|There was {{no basis}} for {{combining}} that I could see.... I began calling around and talking to people and asking them what the justification was for saying {{that you had to}} <b>complement</b> <b>proteins,</b> and there was none. And what I got instead was some interesting insight from people who were knowledgeable and actually felt that there was probably no need to <b>complement</b> <b>proteins.</b> So we went ahead and made that change in the paper. The paper was approved by peer review and by a delegation vote before becoming official.|$|R
40|$|An {{extracellular}} protein of Streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC), and its variant, called DRS (distantly {{related to}} SIC), are expressed by some S. pyogenes strains. SIC from type 1 (M 1) isolates of S. pyogenes interferes with complement-mediated cell lysis, reportedly via its interaction with <b>complement</b> <b>proteins.</b> In {{this study we}} demonstrate that S. pyogenes strains carrying emm 12 and emm 55 (the genes for the M 12 and M 55 proteins, respectively) express and secrete DRS. This protein, like SIC, binds to the C 6 and C 7 <b>complement</b> <b>proteins,</b> and competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments demonstrate that DRS competes with SIC for C 6 and C 7 binding. Similarly, SIC competes with DRS for binding to the <b>complement</b> <b>proteins.</b> Despite this, the recombinant DRS preparation showed no significant effect on complement function, as determined by lysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes. Furthermore, the presence of DRS is not inhibitory to SIC activity...|$|R
5000|$|As noted, C4 (mixture of C4A and C4B) {{participates in}} {{all three of the}} {{complement}} pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin); the alternative pathway is [...] "triggered spontaneously," [...] while the classical and alternative pathways are elicited in response to the recognition of particular microbes. All three pathways converge at a step in which <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C3 is cleaved into proteins C3a and C3b, which results in a lytic pathway and formation of a macromolecular assembly of multiple proteins, termed the membrane-attack complex (MAC), which serves as a pore in the membrane of the targeted pathogen, leading to invading cell disruption and eventual lysis.|$|E
50|$|A {{cytokine}} storm, or hypercytokinemia is {{a potentially}} fatal immune reaction {{consisting of a}} positive feedback loop between cytokines and immune cells, with highly elevated levels of various cytokines. In normal immune function, positive feedback loops can be utilized to enhance the action of B lymphocytes. When a B cell binds its antibodies to an antigen and becomes activated, it begins releasing antibodies and secreting a <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> called C3. Both C3 and a B cell's antibodies can bind to a pathogen, and when a B cell has its antibodies bind to a pathogen with C3, it speeds up that B cell's secretion of more antibodies and more C3, thus creating a positive feedback loop.|$|E
50|$|Anaphylatoxins, or {{complement}} peptides, are fragments (C3a, C4a and C5a) {{that are}} produced {{as part of}} the activation of the complement system. Complement components C3, C4 and C5 are large glycoproteins that have important functions in the immune response and host defense. They have a wide variety of biological activities and are proteolytically activated by cleavage at a specific site, forming a- and b-fragments. A-fragments form distinct structural domains of approximately 76 amino acids, coded for by a single exon within the <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> gene. The C3a, C4a and C5a components are referred to as anaphylatoxins: they cause smooth muscle contraction, histamine release from mast cells, and enhanced vascular permeability. They also mediate chemotaxis, inflammation, and generation of cytotoxic oxygen radicals. The proteins are highly hydrophilic, with a mainly alpha-helical structure held together by 3 disulfide bridges.|$|E
40|$|Sheep {{erythrocytes}} {{have been}} spin labeled with 5 -, 12 -, and 16 -nitroxystearic acid {{in order to}} investigate complement-induced changes in the physical state of the lipid bilayer. Formation of osmotic lesions in the membrane causes {{an increase in the}} fluidity of the membrane which overcomes the decrease in membrane fluidity caused by the interaction of the <b>complement</b> <b>proteins.</b> A decrease in membrane fluidity is observed only when complement-lysed membranes are resealed or when <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> react with isosmolar ghosts that do not undergo osmotic lysis. The decrease in bulk fluidity of the membrane is first observed when C 8 binds to the membranes bearing C 5 b 67 and is enhanced upon the subsequent binding of C 9. The decrease in membrane fluidity shown by the electron spin resonance spectra of spin-labeled fatty acids suggests that certain of the <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> penetrate the membrane and interact with hydrophobic regions of the lipid bilayer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Functionally active {{complement}} system and <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> {{are present in}} the normal human and rodent eye. Complement activation and its regulation by ocular <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> contribute to the pathology of various ocular diseases including keratitis, uveitis and age-related macular degeneration. Furthermore, a strong relationship between age-related macular degeneration and polymorphism in the genes of certain <b>complement</b> components/complement regulatory <b>proteins</b> is now well established. Recombinant forms of the naturally occurring <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> have been exploited in the animal models for treatment of these ocular diseases. It is hoped that in the future recombinant <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> will be used as novel therapeutic agents in the clinic for the treatment of keratitis, uveitis, and age-related macular degeneration...|$|R
25|$|The {{complement}} system {{has the potential}} to be extremely damaging to host tissues, meaning its activation must be tightly regulated. The {{complement system}} is regulated by <b>complement</b> control <b>proteins,</b> which are present at a higher concentration in the blood plasma than the <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> themselves. Some <b>complement</b> control <b>proteins</b> are present on the membranes of self-cells preventing them from being targeted by complement. One example is CD59, also known as protectin, which inhibits C9 polymerisation during the formation of the membrane attack complex. The classical pathway is inhibited by C1-inhibitor, which binds to C1 to prevent its activation.|$|R
50|$|The {{target of}} C5 convertase is <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C5. C5 is a two-chain (Î±, Î²) plasma {{glycoprotein}} (Mr = 196,000). C5 and C3 have similar structure. However, C5 {{does not appear}} to contain the internal thiol ester group reported for C3 and C4. C5 has relatively few disulfide bonds. There are three disulfide bonds in C5a, the Î±-chain has 15 half-Cystines, and the Î²-chain has only 6 half-Cystines. This comparatively low level of stabilizing disulfide bridges may provide a partial explanation for the irreversible conformational change imparted on C5 after cleavage to C5a and C5b. In addition, the relatively low number of disulfide bonds could account for instability of C5 when exposed to chaotrophs such as potassium thiocyanate. Electron micrographs of negatively stained C5 indicate that the protein is irregular in shape and contains several lobes.|$|E
50|$|TEP1 is {{a central}} {{component}} in the mosquito's immune response against invading parasites such as Plasmodium. Similar to the <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C3 in function, TEP1 acts as a opsonin which facilitates extensive parasite killing. TEP1 covalently binds {{to the surface of}} invading pathogens, promoting phagocytosis, lysis and melanisation. Through this activity TEP1 is considered an important determinant of Anopheles vector capacity. TEP1 is an antimicrobial peptide which associates with APL1C/LRIM1 heterodimers to act as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) which identifies and responds to specific patterns on pathogen cell surfaces. Studies have shown TEP1 to be a key molecule in limiting parasite numbers in mosquitoes.RNA interference(RNAi) experiments have illustrated the importance of TEP1 in clearing malaria infections in mosquitoes. RNAi knockdown of TEP1 using dsRNA resulted in a five-fold increase of Plasmodium oocysts in TEP1-S silenced mosquitoes. Knock down of TEP1-R stops parasite melanisation.|$|E
50|$|B cell {{activation}} {{occurs in}} the secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), such as the spleen and lymph nodes. After B cells mature in the bone marrow, they migrate through the blood to SLOs, which receive a constant supply of antigen through circulating lymph. At the SLO, B cell activation begins when the B cell binds to an antigen via its BCR. Of the three B cell subsets, FO B cells preferentially undergo T cell-dependent activation while MZ B cells and B1 B cells preferentially undergo T cell-independent activation.B cell activation is enhanced through the activity of CD21, a surface receptor in complex with surface proteins CD19 and CD81 (all three are collectively known as the B cell coreceptor complex). When a BCR binds an antigen tagged with a fragment of the C3 <b>complement</b> <b>protein,</b> CD21 binds the C3 fragment, co-ligates with the bound BCR, and signals are transduced through CD19 and CD81 to lower the activation threshold of the cell.|$|E
40|$|Structural, {{functional}} and immunological {{similarities between the}} ninth component of complement (C 9) and the lymphocyte pore-forming protein (PFP, perforin) have recently been described (8 - 10). PFP is shown here to be immunologically related to all other components of the membrane attack complex (MAC) of human complement, namely, C 5 b- 6, C 7, C 8, and C 9. Polyclonal antibodies raised against purified human C 5 b- 6, C 7, C 8, or C 9 react with other components of the MAC and with mouse lymphocyte PFP. The antigenic epitopes shared by human <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> and mouse lymphocyte PFP are limited to cysteine-rich domains. Only <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> that have been reduced and alkylated elicit the production of crossreactive antibodies when used as immunogens. The nonreduced forms of complement components or lymphocyte PFP neither react with these antibodies nor give rise to crossreactive antibodies. The homologous domains of <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> and lymphocyte PFP may play related functions in their attachment to lipid membranes and assembly of membrane lesions...|$|R
50|$|Fc binds {{to various}} cell receptors and <b>complement</b> <b>proteins.</b> In this way, it mediates {{different}} physiological effects of antibodies (detection of opsonized particles; cell lysis; degranulation of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils; and other processes).|$|R
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 30 serum <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> (15 % of the globulin fraction), excluding cell surface receptors, and regulatory proteins. Many are manufac-tured in the liver, and reduced complement is {{a feature of}} severe liver failure. <b>Complement</b> <b>proteins</b> contribute to the acute phase response, and high levels are seen in chronic untreated inflammation (eg, rheumatoid arthritis). Once activated, complement is strongly pro-inflammatory. Indeed, {{almost half of the}} complement system proteins/ receptors play regulatory roles, reflecting the importance of controlling inappropriate activation. This review focuses on disease states arising as a direct consequence of complement deficiency or dysfunction. In the 1880 s, heat labile, serum factors, capable o...|$|R
