40|$|Myosin-binding protein C (MyBPC) is {{proposed}} {{to take on}} a trimeric <b>collar</b> <b>arrangement</b> around the thick filament backbone in cardiac muscle, based on interactions between cardiac MyBPC domains C 5 and C 8. We have now determined, using yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays, that the C 5 :C 8 interaction is not dependent on the 28 -residue cardiac-specific insert in C 5. Furthermore, an interaction of similar affinity occurs between domains C 5 and C 8 of fast skeletal muscle MyBPC, but not between these domains of the slow skeletal muscle protein. These data have implications for the role and quaternary structure of MyBPC in skeletal muscle...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{study of the}} heat transfer from a heated horizontal disk to a thin film of liquid is described. The liquid was delivered to the disk by a <b>collar</b> <b>arrangement</b> such that the film thickness and radial velocity were known at the outer radius of the collar. This method of delivery is termed as a controlled impinging jet. Flow visualization tests were performed and heat transfer data were collected along the radius of the disk for different volumetric flow rates and inlet temperatures in the supercritical and subcritical regions. The heat transfer coefficient was found to increase with flow rate when both supercritical and subcritical regions were present on the heated surface. A numerical simulation of this free surface problem was performed, which included the effects of conjugate heat transfer within the heated disk and the liquid. The numerical predictions agree with the experimental results and show that conjugate heat transfer has {{a significant effect on}} the local wail temperature and heat transfer coefficient...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{sensitivity}} {{of an active}} fast neutron assay system for the measurement of 235 U enrichment in small samples of low-enriched triuranium octoxide (U 3 O 8) is described. The system comprises four organic liquid scintillation detectors in a polyethylene container in which a stimulating americium-lithium neutron source is placed below the sample to be interrogated. The sensitivities of both the singles and doubles assay have been corrected for the contribution from the stimulating source and for spontaneous fission in 238 U and found to be (0. 116  ±  0. 008) cps per detector per % wt. (7 %) and (0. 0006  ±  0. 0002) cps per detector per % wt. (33 %), respectively. The singles approach with the 4 -detector arrangement has been compared via Monte Carlo (MCNP- 5) simulations with a fast neutron counting system based on 12 detectors in which the source is placed adjacent to the sample, similar to the arrangement {{referred to as the}} liquid scintillator uranium neutron collar. This comparison confirms that whilst singles assay with the 4 -detector arrangement is feasible, the <b>collar</b> <b>arrangement</b> does not yield a singles yield that can be correlated with enrichment due to the perturbative scattering by the U 3 O 8 sample. The 4 -detector arrangement is particularly suitable for small samples of fresh, low-enriched material that might arise in forensic applications and the analysis of un-irradiated, orphan wastes. In these cases the efficiency of coincidence methods may be too low to yield a practical route to enrichment assessment. Conversely, the use of many detectors and/or a high-intensity source by which sensitivity might be increased might restrict the portability and ease of use of the apparatus. A correction for the contribution by (α, n) reactions, the stimulating source, spontaneous fission in 238 U and self-multiplication in U 3 O 8 is made via preparatory passive measurements...|$|E

50|$|When {{woody plants}} {{naturally}} shed branches {{because they are}} nonproductive, usually from lack of light reaching lower branches, these lower branches typically die back to the branch collar. Insects and fungi decompose the dead branch, and it eventually falls off, leaving the exposed branch core {{at the point of}} its attachment at the branch <b>collar.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> helps to resist the spread of decay organisms into the parent branch or trunk during the time it takes for the increment growth of the trunk to seal over the dead branch stub.|$|R

40|$|The U 1 H Shaft Project is {{a design}} build {{subcontract}} {{to supply the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) a 1, 045 ft. deep, 20 ft. diameter, concrete lined shaft for unspecified purposes. The subcontract awarded to Atkinson Construction by Bechtel Nevada to design and construct the shaft for the DOE has been split into phases with portions of the work being released as dictated by available funding. The first portion released included the design for the shaft, permanent hoist, headframe, and <b>collar</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The second release consisted of constructing the shaft collar {{to a depth of}} 110 ft., the service entry, utility trenches, and installation of the temporary sinking plant. The temporary sinking plant included the installation of the sinking headframe, the sinking hoist, two deck winches, the shaft form, the sinking work deck, and temporary utilities required to sink the shaft. Both the design and collar construction were completed on schedule. The third release consisted of excavating and lining the shaft to the station depth of approximately 950 feet. Work is currently proceeding on this production sinking phase. At a depth of approximately 600 feet, Atkinson has surpassed production expectation and is more than 3 months ahead of schedule. Atkinson has employed the use of a Bobcat 331 excavator as the primary means of excavation. the shaft is being excavated entirely in an alluvial deposit with varying degrees of calcium carbonate cementation. Several more work packages are expected to be released in the near future. The remaining work packages include, construction of the shaft station a depth of 975 ft. and construction of the shaft sump to a depth of 1, 045 ft., installation of the loading pocket and station steel and equipment, installation of the shaft steel and guides, installation of the shaft utilities, and installation of the permanent headframe, hoist, collar utilities, and facilities...|$|E

60|$|April 19.--I {{made this}} a busy day. I wrote {{on at the}} history until two o'clock, then took a gallant walk, then began reading for Gillies's article. James Ferguson dined with us. We smoked and I became woundy sleepy. Now I have taken <b>collar</b> to this <b>arrangement,</b> I find an open sea before me which I could not have anticipated, for though I should get through well enough with my {{expectations}} during the year, yet {{it is a great}} thing to have a certainty to be clear as a new pin of every penny of debt. There is no being obliged or asking favours or getting loans from some grudging friend who can never look at you after but with fear of losing his cash, or you at him without the humiliating sense of having extorted an obligation. Besides my large debts, I have paid since I was in trouble at least £2000 of personal encumbrances, so no wonder my nose is still under water. I really believe the sense of this apparently unending struggle, schemes for retrenchment in which I was unseconded, made me low-spirited, for the sun seems to shine brighter upon me as a free man. Nevertheless, devil take the necessity which makes me drudge like a very hack of Grub Street.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the management of foreign-exchange risk. We take the perspective of a domestic firm that is exposed to foreign currencies (such as the GBP, CHF, and JPY) operating in a member country of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). Three important questions are involved in hedging: (i) to hedge or not; (ii) the choice of the hedging instrument; and (iii) measurement of the hedge ratio. Our results show that there is no difference in performance and risk under these three hedging strategies (always to hedge, to hedge or not to hedge, and always not to hedge) for all of the GCC currencies against foreign currencies. Our examination of the effectiveness of three financial hedging techniques&mdash;forward hedging, money-market hedging and cross-currency hedging&mdash;shows that it makes no difference whether we use forward hedging or money-market hedging (for all of the GCC currencies against foreign currencies). However, in relation to cross-currency hedging, the results are mixed. We find that the effectiveness of cross-currency hedging depends on the correlation between the exchange rates of the base currency against the exposure currency, and the currency used as the hedging instrument. In examining the effectiveness of financial hedging (such as forward hedging) versus operational hedging, (such as risk-sharing <b>arrangements,</b> currency <b>collars,</b> and hybrid <b>arrangements)</b> we find that forward hedging is more effective than either risk-sharing arrangements or hybrid arrangements. However, when compared with currency collars, the results are mixed. Finally, we find that the use of different econometric models to estimate the hedge ratio fails either to add value or improve the effectiveness of the hedge. This implies that {{there is no need for}} a sophisticated econometric model to estimate the hedge ratio, because what matters is correlation...|$|R
