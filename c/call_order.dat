Further, suppose I should grant this groundless notion, Were not the Jews in Old Testament times to enter the church by circumcision? (Gen 17; Exo 12). For that, though water is not, was the very entering ordinance. Besides, as I said before, there was a full forbidding of all that were not circumcised from entering into fellowship, with a threatening to cut them off from the church if they entered in without it: yet more than six hundred thousand entered that church without it. But how now, if such an one as you had then stood up and objected, Sir Moses, What is the reason that you transgress the order of God, to receive members without circumcision? Is not that the very entering ordinance? Are not you commanded to keep out of the church all that are not circumcised? Yea, and for all those that you thus received, are you not commanded to cast them out again, to cut them off from among this people (Gen 17:13,14; Exo 12:44-46).

5000|$|The {{philosophical}} {{concept of}} li is inherently {{difficult to define}} and is easily mistranslated into various simplifications of the core idea.Many philosophers have tried to better explain it, Alan Watts {{being one of the}} prominent 20th century authors on the subject. The tao is a certain kind of order, and this kind of order is not quite what we <b>call</b> <b>order</b> when we arrange everything geometrically in boxes, or in rows. That is a very crude kind of order, {{but when you look at}} a plant it is perfectly obvious that the plant has order. We recognize at once that it is not a mess, but it is not symmetrical and it is not geometrical looking. The plant looks like a Chinese drawing, because they appreciated this kind of non-symmetrical order so much that it became an integral aspect of their painting. In the Chinese language this is called li, and the character for li means the markings in jade. It also means the grain in wood and the fiber in muscle. We could say, too, that clouds have li, marble has li, the human body has li. We all recognize it, and the artist copies it whether he is a landscape painter, a portrait painter, an abstract painter, or a non-objective painter. They all are trying to express the essence of li. The interesting thing is, that although we all know what it is, there is no way of defining it. Because tao is the course, we can also call li the watercourse, and the patterns of li are also the patterns of flowing water. We see those patterns of flow memorialized, as it were, as sculpture in the grain in wood, which is the flow of sap, in marble, in bones, in muscles. All these things are patterned according to the basic principles of flow. In the patterns of flowing water you will find all kind of motifs from Chinese art, immediately recognizable, including the S-curve in the circle of yang-yin.So li means then the order of flow, the wonderful dancing pattern of liquid, because Lao-tzu likens tao to water:The great tao flows everywhere, to the left and to the right, It loves and nourishes all things, but does not lord it over them.

For example, in acoustic insects and anuransthat chorus, males often adjust their song timing relative to neighbours, and females may pay attentionto these adjustments in timing. Many laboratory studies show how males may delay the phase of theirsong rhythm {{with respect to a}} song stimulus such that they call just prior to the stimulus; similarly,females may choose a male whose song rhythm leads a neighbour by a brief interval. However, theimportance of male phase adjustments and female attention to <b>call</b> <b>order</b> in actual choruses hasremained poorly understood. We studied female choice in laboratory choruses in the bushcricketEphippiger diurnus, a species with preferences for leading calls but also for longer calls and fasterrhythms, features representing broadcast energy. Although chorusing males varied in all features, wefound that females largely focused on <b>call</b> <b>order.</b> This overriding preference for <b>call</b> <b>order</b> may be reflectedby the prevalence of male phase adjustment throughout the population, a feature that wouldhave been subject to strong sexual selection. We found that the broadcast of leading calls within a choruswas not repeatable among males but rather shifted among the chorus participants. This observation toomay reflect the strong selection imposed by female choice for <b>call</b> <b>order,</b> and it may have implications forthe role of receiver psychology in the evolution of mate choice. 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|Abstract. Tabled {{evaluation}} is a recognized and powerful implementation technique that overcomes some limitations of traditional Prolog systems {{in dealing with}} recursion and redundant sub-computations. Tabling based systems use call similarity {{to determine if a}} tabled subgoal will produce their own answers or if it will consume from another subgoal. While call variance has been a very popular approach, call subsumption can yield superior time performance and space improvements as it allows greater reuse of answers. However, the <b>call</b> <b>order</b> of the subgoals can greatly affect the success and applicability of the call subsumption technique. In this work, we present an extension, named Retroactive Call Subsumption, that supports call subsumption by allowing full sharing of answers between subsumed/subsuming subgoals, independently on the order in which they are called. Our experiments using the YapTab tabling engine show considerable gains in evaluation time for some applications, at the expense of a very small overhead for the programs that cannot benefit from it.

40|$|Abstract. Tabling is an {{evaluation}} strategy for Prolog programs that works by storing answers in a table space {{and then by}} using them in similar subgoals. Some tabling engines use call by subsumption, where it is determined that a subgoal will consume answers from a more gen-eral subgoal {{in order to reduce}} the search space and increase efficiency. We designed an extension, named Retroactive Call Subsumption (RCS), that implements call by subsumption independently of the <b>call</b> <b>order,</b> thus allowing a more general subgoal to force previous called subgoals to become answer consumers.

In this paper, we present the new STST table space design and we discuss the main modifications made to the original Time Stamped Tries approach to non-retroactive call by subsumption.

40|$|A control {{hijacking}} attack exploits software vulnerabilities such as {{buffer overflow}} {{to seize the}} execution control of a server program, and uses the privileges of the victim program to make system calls to compromise the computer. In this dissertation, we first present a novel low overhead array bounds checking system called Cash that prevents buffer overflow from happening. Even if an attack can successfully hijack the execution control of a program, we present a defense system called Paid to prevent the attack from making illegitimate system calls. The Cash approach allocates a separate segment to each static or dynamic array, and generates instructions for array references {{in such a way}} that the segment limit check in X 86 ’s virtual memory protection mechanism performs the required array bounds checking for free. In those cases that hardware bounds checking is not possible, it falls back to software bounds checking.

40|$|Abstract. Sample {{compression}} schemes are {{schemes for}} “encoding ” {{a set of}} examples in a small subset of examples. The long-standing open sample compression conjecture states that, for any concept class C of VC-dimension d, there is a sample compression scheme in which samples for concepts in C are compressed to samples of size at most d. We show that every order over C induces a special type of sample compression scheme for C, which we <b>call</b> <b>order</b> compression scheme. It turns out that order compression schemes can compress to samples of size at most d if C is maximum, intersection-closed, a Dudley class, or of VCdimension 1 –and thus in most cases for which the sample compression conjecture {{is known to be}} true. Since order compression schemes are much simpler than sample compression schemes in general, their study seems to be a promising step towards resolving the sample compression conjecture. We reveal a number of fundamental properties of order compression schemes, which are helpful in such a study. In particular, order compression schemes exhibit interesting graph-theoretic properties as well as connections to the theory of learning from teachers. ...|$|E

In this study, digital acoustic tag recordings were used to investigate social call use within bouts, the use of bouts across different social contexts, and whether particular call type combinations were favored. <b>Call</b> <b>order</b> within bouts was investigated using call transition frequencies and information theory techniques. Call bouts were defined through analysis of inter-call intervals, as any calls within 3. 9 [*]s of each other. Bouts were produced significantly more when new whales joined a group compared to groups that did not change membership, and in groups containing multiple adults escorting a female and calf compared to adult only groups. Although social calls tended to be produced in bouts, there were few repeated bout types. However, the order in which most call types were produced within bouts was non-random and dependent on the preceding call type. These bouts appear to be at least partially governed by rules for how individual components are combined...|$|E
40|$|Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) {{often have}} usage constraints, such as <b>call</b> <b>order</b> or call conditions. API misuses, i. e., {{violations}} of these constraints, {{may lead to}} software crashes, bugs, and vulnerabilities. Though researchers developed many API-misuse detectors {{over the last two}} decades, recent studies show that API misuses are still prevalent. Therefore, we need to understand the capabilities and limitations of existing detectors in order to advance the state of the art. In this paper, we present the first-ever qualitative and quantitative evaluation that compares API-misuse detectors along the same dimensions, and with author validation. To accomplish this, we develop MUC, a classification of API misuses, and MUBENCHPIPE, an automated benchmark for detector comparison, on top of our misuse dataset, MUBENCH. Our results show that the capabilities of existing detectors vary greatly and that existing detectors, though capable of detecting misuses, suffer from extremely low precision and recall. A systematic root-cause analysis reveals that, most importantly, detectors need to go beyond the naive assumption that a deviation from the most-frequent usage corresponds to a misuse and need to obtain additional usage examples to train their models. Our work provides these and several other novel insights that enable more powerful API-misuse detectors. Comment: 17 pages, 1 figure, submitted to TSE, artifact page [URL]...|$|E
