40|$|This paper tests real {{interest}} parity (RIP) {{for a group}} of industrialized countries using quarterly data on long-term and short-term interest rates from 1957 : 1 to 2003 : 1. The paper looks at such issues as the lack of power in the standard unit root tests, spans of data, the base country, and the high volatility of exchange rates under the <b>current</b> <b>float</b> as possible reasons for the weak support for RIP. Overall, the standard ADF unit root test provides more supporting evidence in favor of RIP than the more powerful ADF-GLS test and the KPSS stationarity test, and the results {{do not seem to be}} sensitive to the choice of the base country. Lack of power seems to be an issue in short samples for the standard ADF test and the ADF-GLS test. The paper also investigates the behavior of {{real interest}} differentials (RIDs) across the Bretton Woods era and the <b>current</b> <b>float.</b> The results are consistent with the ¡®neutrality proposition¡¯, and indicate smaller RIDs post-Bretton Woods; thus, the claim that the <b>current</b> <b>float</b> caused RIDs to widen is not supported.

SUR tests on panels of Group-of-Ten log nominal rates reject the null of unit roots for various samples over the <b>current</b> <b>float,</b> with significance levels from 0. 5 % to 15 %. In out-of-sample forecasts, meanreversion models beat random walks on average, in some forecast periods significantly. For monthly data, the range of expected USD-DEM appreciation rates exceeds 15 %/year in the mean reversion model. Mean reversion places strong restrictions on international models: over the sample period, the G- 10 had to run monetary policies consistent with stable long-run nominal rates...|$|E

This result implies that purchasing power parity (PPP) does not hold even as a long run relationship.

Our major findings are as follows. First, we suggest cases where VECMs are of limited usefulness even when all the variables in the system are not weakly exogenous. Second, using century-long exchange rates, we find that the relative price plays an important role for PPP reversion when real shocks occur. Third, protracted hump-shaped responses of real exchange rates are frequently observed when there is a relative price shock, leading to sluggish adjustments toward PPP. Nominal exchange rate shocks generate humped dynamics much less frequently. ...|$|E

40|$|Real {{exchange}} rates are quite persistent. Standard unit root tests {{are not very}} powerful in drawing a conclusion regarding the validity of purchasing power parity [PPP]. Rather than asking if PPP holds throughout the whole sample period, we examine if PPP holds sometimes by employing Hamilton-type (1989) Markov regime switching models. There are various reasons that the persistence of real {{exchange rates}} changes over time. When {{at least one of}} multiple regimes is stationary, PPP holds locally within the regime. Employing 5 real exchange rates spanning more than 100 years, we find strong evidence that the strength of PPP is changing over time. We make comparisons to an early work throughout the article. The new model selection criterion, provided by Smith et al. (2006), called the Markov switching criterion devised especially for discriminating Markov regime switching models, unambiguously indicates a preference for the Hamiltontype Markov regime switching model employed in this article.

In this paper, the resource scheduling problem is handled using simulation, where logic dependence and resource availability limits are considered simultaneously during the time scheduling process. Simulation is applied to the resource scheduling problem at the project level. A simulation system called SIRBUS is used to schedule construction projects under resource constraints. Constant resource demand of activities is assumed, and the activity once started cannot be interrupted. Six example projects previously solved by different heuristic methods are re-solved using simulation. The results are compared with the latest heuristic models: <b>current</b> <b>float</b> technique and ranked positional weight method. In addition to the advantage that resource availability is considered during time scheduling as a starting point, which is an apparent feature of simulation, SIRBUS gives good results compared with existing heuristic methods.
