5|$|Lying {{approximately}} 264 light-years (81 parsecs) {{away with}} an apparent magnitude of 4.39, HD 66141 is 6.8 {{billion years old}} and has evolved into an orange giant of spectral type K2III with a diameter around 22 {{times that of the}} Sun, and weighing 1.1 solar masses. It is 174 times as luminous as the Sun, with an absolute magnitude of −0.15. HD 66141 was mistakenly named 13 Puppis, as its <b>celestial</b> <b>coordinates</b> were recorded incorrectly when catalogued and hence mistakenly thought to be in the constellation of Puppis; Bode gave it the name Lambda Canis Minoris, which is now obsolete. The orange giant is orbited by a planet, HD 66141b, which was detected in 2012 by measuring the star's radial velocity. The planet has a mass around 6 times that of Jupiter and a period of 480 days.|$|E
500|$|In 1906, Percival Lowell—a wealthy Bostonian who {{had founded}} Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894—started an {{extensive}} project {{in search of}} a possible ninth planet, which he termed [...] "Planet X". By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible <b>celestial</b> <b>coordinates</b> for such a planet. Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were. There are fourteen other known prediscovery observations, with the oldest made by the Yerkes Observatory on August 20, 1909.|$|E
2500|$|The {{armillary sphere}} {{was used for}} {{observation}} in India since early times, and finds mention {{in the works of}} Āryabhata (476 CE). The Goladīpikā—a detailed treatise dealing with globes and the armillary sphere was composed between 1380–1460 CE by Parameśvara. On the subject of the usage of the armillary sphere in India, Ōhashi (2008) writes: [...] "The Indian armillary sphere (gola-yantra) was based on equatorial coordinates, unlike the Greek armillary sphere, which was based on ecliptical coordinates, although the Indian armillary sphere also had an ecliptical hoop. Probably, the <b>celestial</b> <b>coordinates</b> of the junction stars of the lunar mansions were determined by the armillary sphere since the seventh century or so. There was also a celestial globe rotated by flowing water." ...|$|E

50|$|From these bases, {{directions}} toward {{objects in}} the sky can be quantified by constructing <b>celestial</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems. Similar to terrestrial longitude and latitude, the equatorial coordinate system specifies positions relative to the celestial equator and celestial poles, using right ascension and declination. The ecliptic coordinate system specifies positions relative to the Earth's orbit, using celestial longitude and latitude. Besides the equatorial and ecliptic systems, some other <b>celestial</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems, such as the galactic coordinate system, are more appropriate for particular purposes.|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{precession}} of the Earth's axis, {{the position}} of the vernal point on the celestial sphere changes over time, and the equatorial and the ecliptic coordinate systems change accordingly. Thus when specifying <b>celestial</b> <b>coordinates</b> for an object, one has to specify at what time the vernal point and the celestial equator are taken. That reference time is called the equinox of date.|$|E

50|$|In astronomy, a <b>celestial</b> <b>coordinate</b> {{system is}} a system for specifying {{positions}} of celestial objects: satellites, planets, stars, galaxies, and so on.

50|$|A few exoplanets {{have been}} given names that {{do not conform to}} the above standard. For example, the planets that orbit the pulsar PSR 1257 are often {{referred}} to with capital rather than lowercase letters. Also, the underlying name of the star system itself can follow several different systems.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, CSIRO {{scientists}} used a technique based on Lloyd's mirror to make accurate {{measurements of the}} position of various galactic radio sources from coastal sites in New Zealand and Australia. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the technique was to observe the sources combining direct and reflected rays from high cliffs overlooking the sea. After correcting for atmospheric refraction, these observations allowed the paths of the sources above the horizon to be plotted and their <b>celestial</b> <b>coordinates</b> to be determined.|$|E

50|$|In astronomy, equinox is {{a moment}} in time at which the vernal point, {{celestial}} equator, and other such elements are taken {{to be used in the}} definition of a <b>celestial</b> <b>coordinate</b> system.

Like a standard equatorial mount, equatorial GoTo mounts can track the night sky by driving the right-ascension axis. Since both axes are computer controlled, GoTo technology also allows telescope manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth telescope mounts.|$|E
50|$|In astronomy, an epoch is {{a moment}} in time used as a {{reference}} point for some time-varying astronomical quantity, such as the <b>celestial</b> <b>coordinates</b> or elliptical orbital elements of a celestial body, because these are subject to perturbations and vary with time. These time-varying astronomical quantities might include, for example, the mean longitude or mean anomaly of a body, the node of its orbit relative to a reference plane, the direction of the apogee or aphelion of its orbit, or the size of the major axis of its orbit.|$|E
