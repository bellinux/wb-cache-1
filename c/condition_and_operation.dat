Therefore, detection of the moisture content is a very essential task within power transformer diagnostics. While conventional methods for estimation of the water content of the insulation system require a transformer shutdown of several hours, the proposed method calculates the profiles of water concentration in the cellulosic part of the insulation system, {{as well as the}} concentration of water in transformer oil from operational parameters. An one-dimensional model for the moisture diffusion in paper estimates the temperature dependent moisture distributions in the paper. It includes temperature dependent diffusion coefficients and acts as a non-linear control loop for the water concentration in transformer oil. Beside experimental work, two-dimensional finite element (FE) calculations of the temperature dependent water concentration distribution in the transformer insulation system have been performed for model verification. The calculations are based on an opensource Whitney- Element solver.

C. parvum oocysts are removed by filtration and inactivated by the chemical treatments used {{but only to}} various levels of success. Pool operators need an easy method for assessing the ability of their treatments to deal with oocysts. The efficacy of a pool water treatment plant depends on its original design and on its existing <b>condition</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation.</b> Oocyst removal by filtration depends much on the size, depth and condition of the filter media, the filtration rate and effective use of coagulation. Either ozone or chlorine dioxide treatment can produce useful inactivation especially at normal pool water temperatures. Chlorination used without other disinfectants has negligible effect in oocyst inactivation even with the long contact times. However, allied to treatment with ozone or chlorine dioxide, chlorination can make a small contribution due to synergism.
