50|$|It {{was decided}} for GTK+ {{to move to}} a <b>Cascading</b> <b>Style</b> <b>Sheet</b> (CSS)-based model for how {{graphical}} control elements (widgets) are styled and rendered. Shadows, borders, padding, and style properties have well-defined semantics in CSS. Some of those semantics are difficult to implement with the old GTK+ drawing model.|$|E
50|$|Computable Document Format {{supports}} GUI {{elements such}} as sliders, menus, and buttons. Content is updated using embedded computation in response to GUI interaction. Contents can include formatted text, tables, images, sounds, and animations. CDF supports Mathematica typesetting and technical notation. Paginated layout, structured drill down layout, and slideshow mode are supported. Styles can be controlled using a <b>cascading</b> <b>style</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inkscape's primary {{format is}} Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) version 1.1, {{meaning that it}} can create and edit with the {{abilities}} and within the constraints of this format. Any other format must either be imported (converted to SVG) or exported (converted from SVG). The SVG format is using the <b>Cascading</b> <b>Style</b> <b>Sheet</b> (CSS) standard internally. Inkscape's implementation of SVG and CSS standards is incomplete. Most notably, it does not support animation natively. Inkscape has multilingual support, particularly for complex scripts.|$|E

50|$|Web pages usually include {{information}} as to the colors of text and backgrounds and very often also contain links to images and sometimes other types of media {{to be included in}} the final view. Layout, typographic and color-scheme information is provided by <b>Cascading</b> <b>Style</b> <b>Sheet</b> (CSS) instructions, which can either be embedded in the HTML or can be provided by a separate file, which is referenced from within the HTML. The latter case is especially relevant where one lengthy stylesheet is relevant to a whole website: due to the way HTTP works, the browser will only download it once from the web server and use the cached copy for the whole site.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the problems of manipulation with Cascading Style Sheets. The first aim is to create a library for manipulation with Cascading Style Sheets - an object interface of <b>Cascading</b> <b>Style</b> <b>Sheet</b> is proposed, a parser is generated by means of an appliance of JavaCC, the implementation of interface is completed and as a whole connected to a functional unit. The library enables reading <b>Cascading</b> <b>Style</b> <b>Sheet</b> and its transfer into an object representation, editing and subsequently exporting back to the text file. The second part of the thesis deals with the implementation of library for assign property values - every (X) HTML document is formed by the tree of elements to which the rules are consequently searched for in CSS and their declarations are asigned in the correct order. In conclusion of the thesis the DEMO application, which illustrates the possibilities of both libraries and facilitates performing of experiments or testing, is described. Hereafter the technique of profiling, which enables to find out the efficiently demanding passages, which can be optimised further, in the source code, is shown...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cascading</b> <b>Style</b> <b>Sheets</b> {{provide a}} {{flexible}} mechanism for governing {{the appearance of}} Web pages. <b>Cascading</b> <b>Style</b> <b>Sheets</b> Level 2 (CSS 2) are an enhancement to the original CSS 1 specification, giving Web page designers additional control over the appearance of Web pages. However, the CSS 2 specification is written in English, leaving open the possibility of ambiguity or inconsistency. We present a formalization of {{a subset of the}} CSS 2 specification using constraints hierarchies to help ensure that potential problems in the specification are caught and corrected.
