Eleven study areas in central and southern France and in Slovenia are examined.

Quantitative and <b>chronological</b> <b>indices</b> show settlement intensity and dynamics while qualitative indices express the hierarchical typology of settlements.

50|$|Raithby {{published}} anonymously, in 1798, ‘The Study and Practice of the Law considered,’ 8vo, an ably written treatise, {{for some}} time attributed to Sir James Mackintosh. An American edition appeared at Portland, Maine, in 1806, and the second English edition was issued at London in 1816, with the author's name. With Sir Thomas Edlyne Tomlins, Raithby issued a new edition of the ‘Statutes at Large,’ from Magna Charta to the Union, 41 Geo. III, 10 vols. 4to, 1811 (also in 20 vols. 8vo, 1811). Tomlins co-operated in the edition down to 49 Geo. III, when he relinquished the task to Raithby and Nicholas Simons. Raithby compiled a useful ‘Index’ to the work, ‘from Magna Charta to 49 Geo. III,’ which appeared in 1814, in 1 vol. 4to and in 3 vols. 8vo. He likewise compiled alphabetical and <b>chronological</b> <b>indexes</b> to the ‘Statutes of the Realm,’ which were published by the record commissioners in 1824 and 1828, folio.|$|R
5000|$|Documents {{are thus}} always ordered and {{accessed}} chronologically. Metadata-based queries on the collection produce [...] "substreams," [...] or chronologically ordered subsets {{of the original}} documents. The rationale for time-based ordering is that [...] "time is a natural guide to experience; it is the attribute that comes closest to a universal skeleton-key for stored experience". Whether chronology is our principal or even a common natural coding mechanism psychologically can be debated. But since any PKB system can easily create such an index, it seems worthwhile to follow Lifestreams' lead and allow the user to sort and retrieve based on time, as many systems have done. If nothing else, it relieves the user from having to create names for knowledge elements, since the timestamp is always an implicit identifying mark. PlanPlus, based on the Franklin-Covey planner system, is also chronologically modeled, {{and a number of}} products based on other data models offer <b>chronological</b> <b>indexing</b> in addition to their core paradigm.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} Ilustración Nariñense [Nariñense Illustration], a cultural magazine {{of the first}} half of the XX c., edited in Pasto for more than three decades. This publication achieved an important role in the construction of a collective imaginary about the progress of the region, and its attempt to overcome geographic isolation. The editorial aim of this publication was to become an instrument for the establishment of a common project for regional transformation, through the struggle to install a transport system, that enabled communication with the interior of the country as well as with other countries; under the assumption that the progress of the region was linked to the construction of a railroad. The magazine´s journalistic work and essays attempted to break with the intellectual isolation of the area, and to promote the circulation of regional interests and problems. Material and content aspects were examined for the study of this publication. This implied the construction of thematic and <b>chronological</b> <b>indexes,</b> as well as a hermeneutic analysis of its articles, allowing for the interpretation of the axes that structured the magazine...|$|R

[...] Newton charged the Abbé with a breach of promise, and answered the objections which Fréret had urged against his system. Father Étienne Souciet entered the field in defence of Fréret; and in consequence of this controversy Newton was induced to prepare his larger work, which was published in 1728, after his death, and entitled The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended.|$|E

40|$|Background As life {{expectancy}} is increasing and healthy ageing {{becomes more and more}} important, skin ageing is a growing topic of interest from both a medical and a commercial point of view. The urgency to unravel the causes of skin ageing is rising. However, {{there is a lack of}} objective, simple, noninvasive methods to assess biological skin age - a term introduced to describe how old someone looks, covering both the appearance and function of the skin. A rapid, noninvasive assessment of biological skin age would greatly facilitate the execution of the studies required to find the causes of skin ageing. Objectives To find an objective, easy-to-apply method to assess biological skin age. Methods Skin age score (SAS) was compared with skin autofluorescence, a measure of advanced glycation end products in the skin, and several subject characteristics in 32 healthy, white women with little sun-exposed skin and no history of smoking. Results A moderate, positive correlation (R- 2 = 0. 32, P = 0. 001) between SAS and skin autofluorescence-based biological skin age was found. However, the variation in biological skin age according to SAS could be explained better by body mass <b>index,</b> <b>chronological</b> age and hormonal status (R- 2 = 0. 86, P < 0. 001). Conclusions In the current setting skin autofluorescence did not contribute better to the prediction of biological skin age than chronological age. Biological skin age was best predicted by body mass <b>index,</b> <b>chronological</b> age and hormonal status, and this approach provides a considerable simplification of the application of biological skin age...|$|R
