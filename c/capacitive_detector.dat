An object's capacitance increases when another object is brought closer to it. The human body is a great charge-holding object (capacitor) (this biological property is called body capacitance), and sensitive <b>capacitive</b> <b>detectors</b> {{can be made to}} function as proximity <b>detectors.</b> The <b>capacitive</b> property of the human body is also helpful in making touch switches, such as those used in touch-activated lamps.

40|$|Environmental gas sensing {{typically}} requires both {{sensitivity and}} specificity; target vapor species {{must not only}} be detected and quantified, but also differentiated from interferents. This mission {{can be accomplished by}} micro gas chromatographs (μGCs), which allow preconcentration of samples and subsequent separation of complex vapor mixtures into individual constituents by their specific retention times. This thesis focuses on the system-level design, fabrication, and integration of μGCs, with the ultimate goal of fully microfabricated systems that can be easily manufactured and distributed to end-users. This thesis also explores the optimization of a micro gas pump – a critical μGC component, and generally recognized as a challenge for microsystems. Three generations of integrated µGC systems have been designed, fabricated, and evaluated. The iGC 1 system demonstrates the feasibility of a low-cost three-mask fabrication approach for a µGC including a Knudsen pump, a preconcentrator, a separation column and a microdischarge-based detector, which are integrated in a 4 -cc stack. The iGC 2 system demonstrates a valveless µGC architecture, in which a bi-directional Knudsen pump provides reversible gas flow for (multi-stage) preconcentrators, which is essential for quantitative analysis. The iGC 3 system replaces the microdischarge-based detectors in iGC 1 and iGC 2 with complementary <b>capacitive</b> <b>detectors,</b> facilitating a purely electronic interface for the fluidics. Additionally, it is compatible with the use of room air as the carrier gas. The quantitative analysis of 19 chemicals with concentration levels of well below 100 ppb is demonstrated, showing the promise of automated, continuous monitoring of indoor air pollutants. The pumps used in the iGCx systems are Knudsen pumps that use thermal transpiration provided by nanoporous media and have no moving parts. This thesis also describes an exploratory effort in which lithographically fabricated channels in silicon substrates provide the thermal transpiration. The Si-micromachined Knudsen pumps demonstrate > 200 sccm flow rate. To increase the output pressure head, these pumps are arrayed in series, using both a stacked configuration and a planar one. The results show that the pressure and flow characteristics can be tailored over a wide performance range, extending the possible applications beyond µGC systems...|$|R

40|$|A {{method and}} system for {{locating}} leaks of conductive fluids from non-conductive pipes and other structures or for locat- ing non-conductive pipes or structures having conductive fluid contained therein, employ a charge generator {{to apply a}} time varying charge to the conductive fluid, and a capaci- tive type detector that can detect the variable charge that is induced in the fluid. The <b>capacitive</b> <b>detector,</b> which prefer- ably includes a handheld housing, employs a large conduc- tive pickup plate {{that is used to}} locate the pipe or leak by scanning the plate over the ground and detecting the induced charge that is generated when the plate comes in close proximity to the pipe or leak. If a leak is encountered, the resulting signal will appear over an area larger than expected for a buried pipe, assuming the leak provides an electrically conductive path between the flow and the wet surrounding ground. The detector uses any suitable type of indicator device, such as a pair of headphones that enable an operator to hear the detected signal as a chirping sound, for example...|$|E
40|$|A {{transimpedance}} amplifier {{is a common}} preamplifier solution for a <b>capacitive</b> charge/current <b>detector,</b> and is widely used in optical communication. The concept is ideal for a mass spectrometry (MS) system, in particular the Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) MS, the MS with the highest resolution and the highest mass accuracy. To push the performance toward a prospective goal of single-ion detection, a novel T Feedback Network was designed and tested in two transimpedance preamplifiers. At a given transimpedance, the T Feedback Network can reduce the feedback resistance by 100 fold, thus reducing the thermal noise voltage due to this resistor by 10 fold, whilst preserving more bandwidth. Each of the elements in the T Feedback Network reported here can be any complex impedance, which allows adaptation of this novel feedback system to other frequency and transimpedance characteristics for applications not only in other mass spectrometers, such as the Orbitrap, time-of-flight, and ion trap systems, but also in other charge/current detecting systems such as optical communication, spectroscopy/microscopy systems, or chargecoupled devices (CCDs), et...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{structures}} {{can fail}} because of fatigue crack propagation {{or because of}} section loss from corrosion. Regular inspection is required to intercept such failures, and in situ sensors would be a superior technology for that purpose. We are developing MEMS-based transducers for ultrasonic flaw detection, to be permanently mounted at critical locations on structures. Ultrasonic testing requires the emission of a short pulse of ultrasonic energy and the detection of echoes from nearby surfaces or flaws. In a permanently mounted device, phased-array detection {{will be needed to}} scan for flaws in off-axis locations. The device we envision will use a mm-scale piezoelectric emitter and an array of MEMS <b>capacitive</b> diaphragm <b>detectors.</b> We have designed and fabricated arrays of MEMS capacitive diaphragm transducers using the MUMPS process and we report on their performance as pulse-echo detectors in direct contact with metal specimens. Our chip contains 23 sensor elements, featuring nine elements in a linear array and 14 other elements to study alternative diaphragm designs. In the linear array, each element contains 180 hexagonal diaphragms with a leg length of 49 microns, a polysilicon diaphragm thickness of 2 microns, and a gap of 2 microns. The diaphragm diameter was chosen to obtain a lowest-mode resonant frequency of approximately 4 MHz for an unloaded device, corresponding to a ultrasonic wavelength which is well-suited for flaw detection in structural applications. The unloaded elements were characterized by capacitance-voltage measurements under ambient conditions and by admittance measurements i...|$|R
40|$|Transformative {{impacts on}} our energy {{security}} rely on creative approaches for consumption and generation of electricity. Technological contributions can impact both areas if {{they focus on}} problems of scale. For example, occupancy-based electrical loads (HVAC and lighting) accounted for roughly 50 % of the total consumed electricity in the U. S. in 2008. Meanwhile, roughly 50 % of consumed oil in the U. S. is imported. The U. S. Department of Energy has appropriately identified "sensing and measurement" {{as one of the}} "five fundamental technologies" essential for achieving energy security. Complementing reductions in consumption with increases in deployment of fossil-fuel-independent generation (solar and wind) and energy storage (batteries, capacitors and fuel cells) will yield a two-fold impact. Lofty energy security goals can be made realizable by aggressive application of inexpensive technologies for minimizing waste and by maximizing energy availability from desirable sources. Long-standing problems in energy consumption and generation can be addressed by adding degrees of freedom to sensing and power conversion systems using multiple electrical sources. This principal drove the invention of the hybrid electric vehicle, which achieves efficiency increases by combining the energy capacity of gasoline with the flexible storage capability of batteries. Similarly, fresh strategies for electrical circuit design, control, and estimation in systems with multiple electrical sources can minimize consumption, extend the useful life of storage, and improve the efficiency of generation. A solar array constitutes a grid or network of panels or cells that may best be modeled and treated as independent sources needing careful control to maximize overall power generation. A fuel cell stack, an array of sources in its own right, is best used in a hybrid arrangement with batteries or capacitors to mitigate the impact of electrical transients. Meanwhile, room lighting constitutes a network of multiple electrostatic field sources that can be particularly useful for occupancy detection. Exploiting performance benefits of multi-source electrical networks requires an increased flexibility in the analysis required to make informed design choices. This thesis addresses the added complexity with linear analytical and modeling approaches that reveal the salient features of complicated multisource systems.

40|$|DE 19844686 A UPAB: 20000606 NOVELTY - Micromechanical {{rotational}} {{rate sensor}} comprises a structured wafer (14, 18) bonded to a substrate wafer (12, 16) by an insulating bond layer (15). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A micromechanical rotational rate sensor comprises a structure wafer (14, 18) which has {{one or more}} seismic masses (20 a, 20 b), each connected by a spring (22 a, 22 b) to a suspension (24), and which is bonded to a substrate wafer (12, 16) by an insulating bond layer (15) such that the or each seismic mass can perform an excitation oscillation and a rotational rate-dependent detection oscillation relative to the substrate wafer. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for production of the above micromechanical rotational rate sensor by mechanically bonding the substrate and structure wafers with the insulating bond layer to form a wafer stack, structuring the structure wafer to form the seismic masses and their springs and suspensions and then removing the insulating bond layer at least from below the seismic masses. Preferred Features: The substrate wafer face, opposite the bond layer face, has a metallization (16) comprising flat detection electrodes (34 a, 34 b) below the seismic masses, allowing a <b>capacitive</b> <b>detector</b> to detect detection oscillations caused by Coriolis forces. The structure wafer includes a reed drive system (26, 28) for generating the excitation oscillations, the stationary portion (26 a, 26 b) of the system having a metallization (18) for voltage application. The or each seismic mass has an opening to allow removal of the underlying bond layer (15) by lateral etching. The substrate wafer has buried electrodes below the seismic masses and the structure wafer is at most 50 (preferably 20 - 30) times thicker than the bond layer. The bond layer acts as an etch-stop during dry etching for structuring the structure wafer and is subsequently (partially) removed by a selective dry etching process. USE - As a micromechanical rotational rate sensor. ADVANTAGE - Compared with a sensor employing a single SOI wafer or a substrate with a grown polysilicon layer, the use of separate substrate and structure wafers allows a choice of optimal wafer materials to provide wide freedom of design and low cost production...|$|E
40|$|A micromechanical {{gyroscope}} was developed, produced, and characterized on {{the basis}} of LIGA technology within the framework of this study. The working principles of gyroscopes as known from the literature were examined for their suitability for the LIGA process. As a consequence, the Coriolis force was chosen as the operating principle for the LIGA gyroscope. It acts upon an oscillating seismic mass rotating at the rate to be measured. The excitation oscillation is generated by an electrostatic actuator. The signal is picked up by a <b>capacitive</b> <b>detector</b> and processed electronically. Preparatory experiments were performed to determine the critical process parameters for the detector gap and the intrinsic quality of nickel, which has an important bearing upon the design of the sensor. The design was developed so as to achieve a compact unit with high levels of process and functional reliability, and also to optimize resolution and temperature dependence. Linear accelerations are compensated by a separate acceleration sensor. Optimized arrangement of the detection electrodes helped to reduce drastically the material-induced temperature dependence of the sensitivity. The system noise of the sensor element in combination with its electronics was described in mathematical terms, which allows to calculate and minimize the resolution of the sensor from the characteristic data of the sensor element and from the electronics. FEM simulations were carried out to check the resonance frequencies of the gyroscope and determine the eigenfrequencies of disturbing modes as well as optimize the stress bearing properties of the sensor frame. Sub-steps of the sacrifical layer process used for manufacture were analyzed and improved to increase the process yield. Substrate yield of approx. 30 % were attained. Optimum operation of the sensor requires an ambient pressure of < 0. 4 mbar. For this purpose, a vacuum-tight enclosure of the sensors was developed in which the vacuum required for optimum operation can be maintained for years. Linearity, bandwidth, resolution, drifting of the offset and of the sensitivity, temperature dependence of the offset and the sensitivity, and the sensitivity of the offset relative to linear accelerations were determined experimentally for various sensors. Very good values were achieved especially for the temperature dependence of the sensitivity. Selecting relatively low resonance frequencies of 600 Hz allowed a resolution of the sensor of up to 0. 04 /s to be achieved at a bandwidth of 27 Hz. Also, the excellent suitability of the sensor for determining angles of displacement was demonstrated {{as a result of the}} very small linerarity error of the sensor of <#+-# 0. 5 %. (orig.)
