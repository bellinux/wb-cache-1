5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.|$|E

5|$|The 137 minute {{theatrical}} <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{movie was}} first released on VHS in November 1991. On November 24, 1993, the Terminator2: Judgment Day – Special Edition <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film was released to Laserdisc and VHS, containing 15 minutes of previously unseen footage including scenes with Michael Biehn reprising {{his role as}} Kyle Reese in a dream sequence. Some scenes, however, were still {{not included in the}} two-cassette VHS cut. In October 1997, the film received its first DVD release which featured the original theatrical cut.|$|E

5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, an {{extended}} cut {{was released on}} VHS and premiered on the ABC television network. It added roughly 12minutes to the film. The added footage was largely unfinished, and cobbled together for the network premiere; Wise hadn't wanted some of the footage {{to be included in}} the final <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film. This version was released by Paramount in late 1983 on VHS, Betamax, and Laserdisc.|$|E

Cuddy and House watch an early <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> documentary, which has been edited to portray House as a compassionate, {{sympathetic}} doctor. House is aghast and leaves the room, questioning whether he can still trust Michael Moore movies. The documentary continues, revealing that the surgery was successful, and that Kenny thanks Dr. House.|$|E

5|$|Landis' {{difficulties}} continued {{even after}} principal photography was completed. The first <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film lasted {{two and a}} half hours, with an intermission. After one early screening, Wasserman demanded it be shortened, and 20 minutes were cut. The film's final budget was $27.5 million ($ in modern dollars), $10 million over its original budget.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was already}} under way in January 2005, when Baron Cohen caused a near riot in what would ultimately be the rodeo scene in the final <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film. An interview with Baron Cohen by Rolling Stone indicated that more than 400 hours of footage had been shot for the film.|$|E
5|$|Renoir {{edited the}} film while shooting; his first cut was three hours long. He and editor Marguerite {{completed}} a 113-minute final <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film in July 1939. Jay hated it {{and demanded that}} Renoir make cuts, including the excision of Renoir's entire performance as Octave. Renoir refused to completely omit Octave but agreed to remove 13 minutes from the film.|$|E

5|$|Stone had a love scene {{removed from}} the final <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Quick and the Dead before the film's release in the United States. The actress/co-producer thought the scene did not {{fit in with the}} picture's {{established}} reality. It was restored for the home cinema releases of the film.|$|E
5|$|The director's {{original}} cut of Sholay has {{a different}} ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board {{was concerned about the}} violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film preserves the original full frame and is 204minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198minutes long.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the live action footage was deleted; because Bakshi {{wanted to keep the}} breakdancing sequences, he used rotoscoping to animate the footage, but did not animate all of the movements for budgetary reasons. Little dialogue from the 1974 <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film was retained in the animated version, which instead featured newly recorded dialogue by Proval, Romanus, and Philip Michael Thomas, who had starred in Coonskin.|$|E
40|$|In {{these notes}} we {{describe}} how to formulate the Lagrangian insertion technique {{in a way}} that mimics generalized unitarity. We introduce a notion <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> in position space and show that <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correlators in the super-correlators/super-amplitudes duality correspond to generalized unitarity <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equivalent amplitudes. <b>The</b> <b>cuts</b> consist <b>of</b> correlation functions <b>of</b> operators in <b>the</b> chiral part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stress-tensor multiplet as well as other half-BPS operators. We will also discuss <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> method to other correlators as well as non-planar contributions...|$|R
50|$|According to Christophe Gans, {{the film}} was shot both in French and English. The Canadian DVD has both <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|R

5|$|Universal Pictures spent $2.1million {{to market}} the film in a 30-second {{television}} spot during Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003. And a 70-second teaser trailer was attached to Spider-Man on May 3, 2002. Just weeks before the film's release, a number of workprints were leaked on the Internet. The visual and special effects were already being criticized, {{despite the fact that}} it was not the final editing <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles had {{received}} a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, {{there was no time}} to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
