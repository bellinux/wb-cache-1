5|$|The written {{archives}} do not {{date from}} before Igrish-Halam's reign, which saw Ebla paying tribute to Mari, and an extensive invasion of Eblaite {{cities in the}} middle Euphrates region led by the Mariote king Iblul-Il.

Afterwards they <b>concluded</b> <b>a</b> temporary alliance with Pharnabazus which secured some much needed immediate cash for the army, but despite this Alcibiades was still forced to depart in search for more booty to pay the soldiers and oarsmen of the fleet.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was stopped}} at Kőszeg {{and failed to}} conquer Vienna, Suleiman {{additionally}} secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several forts, since Ferdinand and Charles evaded an open field battle. Immediately after the Ottoman withdrawal, Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and Hungary. Nevertheless, Suleiman <b>concluded</b> <b>a</b> peace treaty with Ferdinand in 1533, in Constantinople. The treaty confirmed the right of John Zápolya as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession of {{that part of the}} country that enjoyed the status quo.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the siege}} {{consumed}} {{a large part}} of the Caliphate's manpower and resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine frontier in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured a fortress near Melitene and in 718 Amr ibn Qais raided the frontier. On the Byzantine side, the numbers are unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (which might have been neglected following his deposition), the Byzantines could count on the assistance of the Bulgars, with whom Leo <b>concluded</b> <b>a</b> treaty that possibly included alliance against the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|Around 1848—the exact date of his {{marriage}} is not recorded—Rainilaiarivony, then around 20 or 21 years old and having adopted the name Radilifera, <b>concluded</b> <b>a</b> marriage with his paternal cousin Rasoanalina. She bore him sixteen children {{over the course of}} their marriage. In addition, a one-year-old son that Rasoanalina had conceived with another man prior to the union, Ratsimatahodriaka (Radriaka), was adopted by Rainilaiarivony as his own. As a young man, Ratsimatahodriaka was groomed by Rainilaiarivony to become his successor, but the youth fell from a balcony while intoxicated and died in his early twenties.|$|E

5|$|But in that month, Constans was in {{his turn}} overthrown and killed by the usurper Magnentius, a laetus from Gaul who was comes (commander) of an elite brigade in Constans' comitatus (imperial escort army). In the East, Constantius had been engaged in a lengthy war against the Persians under Shah Shapur II (337-350). But he {{immediately}} <b>concluded</b> <b>a</b> truce {{in order to deal}} with Magnentius. He led his own comitatus to Illyricum where he assumed also command of the local comitatus, bringing his combined strike force to about 60,000. Magnentius gathered an army consisting of the Gaul comitatus (c. 25,000 men) and probably some Frankish and Saxon foederati (allies) and marched into Illyricum to confront Constantius. (For explanation of the term comitatus, see Late Roman army).|$|E
5|$|But, after {{assessing}} {{the situation in}} Alsace, Julian evidently decided that his force was insufficient to prevail over the Alamanni alone. Instead, {{he set out to}} recover Cologne. From Metz, he led his army via Treviri (Trier) to Roman-held Koblenz and thence along the Rhine to Cologne. Entering the ruined city unopposed, Julian's men were set to work to rebuild the city walls. Julian then <b>concluded</b> <b>a</b> peace treaty with the Franks. This had the important result of removing half the opposition from the equation and allowing Julian to focus his resources on dealing with the Alamanni.|$|E
5|$|By 878 the Vikings {{had seized}} eastern Mercia and nearly conquered Wessex, and Alfred {{was reduced to}} being a {{fugitive}} in the Somerset marshes, but he fought back and won the Battle of Edington.

A further Viking assault in the mid 890s was unsuccessful.|$|E

When they refused, in 926, Kourkouas led the army across the border. Aided by his brother Theophilos and an Armenian {{contingent}} under the strategos of Lykandos, Mleh (Melias in Greek sources), Kourkouas targeted Melitene (modern Malatya), the center of an emirate which had long been a thorn in Byzantium's side. The Byzantine army successfully stormed the lower city, and although the citadel held out, Kourkouas <b>concluded</b> <b>a</b> treaty by which the emir accepted tributary status.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{took over}} the Georgia Tech {{football}} program in 1945 following Coach Alexander's retirement as head football coach. Dodd's coaching philosophy revolved around player treatment and character development. He {{did not believe in}} intense physical practices but rather precise and well executed practices. Dodd's philosophy translated to winning; he set the record for career wins at Tech with 165, including a 31-game unbeaten streak from 1951–1953. He also managed to capture two Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1951 and 1952) and the 1952 national title, which <b>concluded</b> <b>a</b> perfect 12–0 season and Sugar Bowl conquest of Ole Miss. Under Dodd's leadership, Tech played in 13 major bowl games, winning 9, including six in a row. Bobby Dodd compiled a 165–64–8 record as head coach at Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his victory}} at Marj Ibn Amer, 4,000 locals, {{including}} many residents of Nazareth, joined Zahir's forces to completely subdue Jabal Nablus.

Zahir's forces pursued the Jarrars to their throne village of Sanur, but ultimately withdrew after failing to subdue the fortress. This defeat marked the limit of Zahir's influence south of Marj Ibn Amer and established the Jarrars as the dominant force of Jabal Nablus over their rivals, the Tuqans. While the Jarrars and Zahir eventually <b>concluded</b> <b>a</b> truce, the former continued to mobilize the clans of Jabal Nablus to prevent Zahir's southward expansion.|$|E
