5|$|Downriver of the Hells <b>Canyon</b> <b>is</b> the Lower Snake River Project, {{authorized}} by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945, which {{was created by the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a navigable channel on the Snake River from its mouth to the beginning of Hells Canyon. These dams are, in downstream order: Lower Granite Lock and Dam, Little Goose Lock and Dam, Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, and Ice Harbor Lock and Dam. Dredging work was also done throughout the length of the navigation channel to facilitate ship passage. These dams form a cascade of reservoirs with no stretches of free-flowing river in between. Immediately below Ice Harbor Dam is Lake Wallula, formed by the construction of the McNary Dam on the Columbia River. (McNary Dam {{is not part of the}} Lower Snake River Project.) Above Lower Granite Dam, the river channel from Lewiston to Johnson Bar, just below Hells <b>Canyon,</b> <b>is</b> also maintained for jet-boats as this section is too rugged for ships. These dams have been proposed for removal, and if they were to be removed, it would be the largest dam removal project ever undertaken in the United States. The removal has been proposed on the grounds that it would restore salmon runs to the lower Snake River and the Clearwater River and other smaller tributaries. Idaho's Snake river once teemed with sockeye salmon. However, there are almost no wild sockeye salmon left in the river due to a number of factors.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, {{the canyon}} likely {{originated}} {{millions of years}} ago as the result of San Diego Creek cutting through the San Joaquin Hills. Uplift diverted that stream to its present course, leaving Laguna Canyon as a wind gap. California State Route 133 runs {{the entire length of the}} canyon connecting Laguna Beach and Irvine, while California State Route 73 crosses it, running southeast-northwest. A majority of the <b>canyon</b> <b>is</b> located within the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park; small portions are part of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park and the cities of Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Woods and Aliso Viejo.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Canyoning</b> <b>is</b> {{frequently}} done {{in remote}} and rugged settings and often requires navigational, route-finding and other wilderness travel skills. [...] <b>Canyons</b> that <b>are</b> ideal for <b>canyoning</b> <b>are</b> often {{cut into the}} bedrock stone, forming narrow gorges with numerous drops, beautifully sculpted walls, and sometimes spectacular waterfalls. Most <b>canyons</b> <b>are</b> cut into limestone, sandstone, granite or basalt, though other rock types <b>are</b> found. <b>Canyons</b> can <b>be</b> very easy or extremely difficult, though emphasis in the sport is usually on aesthetics and fun rather than pure difficulty. A wide variety of <b>canyoning</b> routes <b>are</b> found throughout the world, and <b>canyoning</b> <b>is</b> enjoyed by {{people of all ages}} and skill levels.|$|R
50|$|Cedar <b>Canyon</b> <b>was</b> {{laid out}} in 1909, and named for a local valley where cedar trees are abundant. A post office called Cedar <b>Canyon</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1914, and remained in operation until 1949.|$|R

5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park. Glaciers existed throughout the park area {{during most of the}} Pleistocene with smaller ones persisting at higher elevations until comparatively recent times. Lassen Peak is situated at a center from which many of these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose <b>canyon</b> <b>is</b> mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E
5|$|SR52 begins {{just west}} of I-5 at {{the eastern end of}} La Jolla Parkway. Before {{entering}} San Clemente Canyon, the road becomes a freeway as it intersects I-5. The <b>canyon</b> <b>is</b> part of Marian Bear Natural Park. The freeway runs north of the Rose Canyon Fault, composed of Late Cretaceous rock estimated to be 90million years old, and Mount Soledad. Following exits with Clairemont Mesa Boulevard / Regents Road and Genesee Avenue, SR52 intersects I-805 before exiting the canyon and traveling along the southern edge of the MCAS Miramar military base.|$|E
5|$|State Route 133, locally called Laguna Canyon Road, {{winds through}} Laguna Canyon {{for the entire}} length of the gorge. California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east-west. The lower section of the <b>canyon</b> <b>is</b> part of the Laguna Coast Wilderness, while the upper section also has a few smaller {{wilderness}} preserves. The upper section contains the Laguna Lakes, a series of small natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line, which are the namesake of the canyon. A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed. The northernmost extreme of the canyon lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405.|$|E
50|$|Big and Little Petroglyph <b>Canyons</b> <b>are</b> {{situated}} on {{property of the}} China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station. The two <b>canyons</b> <b>are</b> a designated U.S. National Historic Landmark. In 2001, they were incorporated into a larger National Historic Landmark District, called the Coso Rock Art District.|$|R
5000|$|A {{statue of}} Steve <b>Canyon</b> <b>was</b> erected in Idaho Springs, Colorado, and a nearby {{mountain}} <b>canyon</b> <b>was</b> renamed [...] "Steve Canyon."

50|$|<b>Canyoning</b> <b>is</b> an {{activity}} which involves climbing, descending, jumping and trekking through canyons. The sport originates from caving and involves both caving and climbing techniques. When people mention <b>canyoning</b> they <b>are</b> typically referring to descents that involve rope work, down-climbing, or jumps that are technical in nature. <b>Canyoning</b> <b>is</b> frequently done in remote and rugged settings and often requires navigational, route-finding and other wilderness skills.|$|R
5|$|The Ridge Route was {{official}}ly the Castaic-Tejon Route. The official {{limits of the}} Ridge Route, as built in the 1910s, were SR 126 at Castaic Junction and {{the bottom of the}} grade at Grapevine. Until 1930â€“31 the road from San Fernando to Castaic Junction ran through the Newhall Tunnel at San Fernando Pass and along San Fernando Road, Magic Mountain Parkway (both part of SR126 until the early 2000s) and Feedmill Road to a former bridge over the Santa Clara River. A 1930 bypass of the tunnel and Newhall through Weldon <b>Canyon</b> <b>is</b> now part of The Old Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{vegetation cover}} of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 {{years after the}} beginning of a new 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth. The <b>canyon</b> <b>is</b> one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred species of plants, most native to California, are found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, goldenrod, and sagebrush.|$|E
5|$|Wildlife in {{this park}} include the pronghorn, black bear, coyote, muskrat, six species of lizard, cougar, raccoon, beaver, elk, river otter, bobcat, and mule deer. In addition, the <b>canyon</b> <b>is</b> {{the home of}} a number of {{resident}} birds including the American dipper, two species of eagle, eight species of hawk, six species of owl, and Steller's jay as well as migratory birds such as the mountain bluebird, peregrine falcon, magpie, white-throated swift and canyon wren.|$|E
50|$|In {{most parts}} of the world <b>canyoning</b> <b>is</b> done in {{mountain}} canyons with flowing water. The number of countries with established <b>canyoning</b> outfitters <b>is</b> growing yearly.|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} discoveries <b>is</b> that <b>canyons</b> <b>are</b> major sources and sinks for sediment and organic matter on continental margins. [...] They act as fast-track pathways for sediment and organic matter from the shelf to the deep sea, and can act as temporary depots for sediment and carbon storage. Particle flux through <b>canyons</b> has <b>been</b> found to be between two and four times greater than on the open slope, though the transfer of particles through <b>canyons</b> <b>is</b> thought to be largely [...] "event-driven", which introduces a highly variable aspect to canyon conditions. Determining what drives sediment transport and deposition within <b>canyons</b> <b>is</b> one of the major challenges for HERMIONE.|$|R
5|$|Zion Canyon Scenic Drive {{provides}} {{access to}} Zion Canyon. Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as {{a major problem in}} the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane-powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000. As part of its shuttle fleet, Zion has two electric trams each holding up to 36 passengers. Usually from early April through late October, the scenic drive in Zion <b>Canyon</b> <b>is</b> closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The <b>canyon</b> <b>is</b> a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of piÃ±on and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The <b>canyon</b> <b>is</b> far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E
50|$|The north {{terminus}} {{region of}} the Defiance Plateau contains three canyons, with watercourses flowing due-west, as headwaters of Chinle Creek. The <b>canyons</b> <b>are</b> the <b>Canyon</b> de Chelly National Monument; two other <b>canyons</b> <b>are</b> southwest, part of the five canyon system, Little White House and Three Turkey Canyons.|$|R
50|$|The {{layout of}} the White <b>Canyon</b> <b>was</b> quite similar to the famous Coney Island Cyclone. Before White <b>Canyon</b> <b>was</b> closed in 2013, it was the longestâ€”1100 mâ€”and tallestâ€”35 mâ€”Cyclone-layout roller coaster in the world.

50|$|Slot <b>canyons</b> <b>are</b> {{found in}} many parts of the world, {{predominantly}} in areas with low rainfall. Some of the most well known slot <b>canyons</b> <b>are</b> to be found in the Southwestern United States. Other significant areas include the Sierra de Guara in northern Spain, the Pyrenees on the border of France and Spain, and the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia.|$|R
5|$|Next in the {{geologic}} {{column is}} the -thick Toroweap Formation (see 6c in figure 1). It consists {{of red and}} yellow sandstone and shaly gray limestone interbedded with gypsum. The formation was deposited in a warm, shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. The {{average age of the}} rock is about 273million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, corals, and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and siltstone. Brady <b>Canyon</b> <b>is</b> a cliff-forming gray limestone with some chert. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic sandstone. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen <b>Canyon,</b> <b>is</b> also named for their leader.|$|E
5|$|The cratered terrain, {{a rolling}} surface covered by {{numerous}} impact craters and centered on Ariel's south pole, is the moon's {{oldest and most}} geographically extensive geological unit. It is intersected by a network of scarps, canyons (graben), and narrow ridges mainly occurring in Ariel's mid-southern latitudes. The canyons, known as chasmata, probably represent graben formed by extensional faulting, which resulted from global tensional stresses caused by the freezing of water (or aqueous ammonia) in the moon's interior (see below). They are 15â€“50km wide and trend mainly in an east- or northeasterly direction. The floors of many canyons are convex; rising up by 1â€“2km. Sometimes the floors are separated from the walls of canyons by grooves (troughs) about 1km wide. The widest graben have grooves running along the crests of their convex floors, which are called valles. The longest <b>canyon</b> <b>is</b> Kachina Chasma, at over 620km in length (the feature extends into the hemisphere of Ariel that Voyager 2 did not see illuminated).|$|E

5|$|The temple is D-shaped, and its {{alignment}} is 10.7 degrees off true east-west. Its {{location and}} orientation indicate that its builders understood {{the cycles of}} both {{the sun and the}} moon. It is aligned to the major lunar standstill, which occurs once every 18.6 years, and the sunset during the winter solstice, which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform {{at the south end of}} Cliff Palace, across Fewkes Canyon. At the bottom of the <b>canyon</b> <b>is</b> the Sun Temple fire pit, which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice. Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans.|$|E
5|$|West to east {{trending}} canyons provide {{easier access}} by foot {{into the heart}} of the range as no vehicular roads traverse the range except at Teton Pass, which is south of the park. Carved by a combination of glacier activity as well as by numerous streams, the canyons are at their lowest point along the eastern margin of the range at Jackson Hole. Flowing from higher to lower elevations, the glaciers created more than a dozen U-shaped valleys throughout the range. Cascade <b>Canyon</b> <b>is</b> sandwiched between Mount Owen and Teewinot Mountain to the south and Symmetry Spire to the north and is situated immediately west of Jenny Lake. North to south, Webb, Moran, Paintbrush, Cascade, Death and Granite Canyons slice through Teton Range.|$|E
5|$|A long-distance {{communication}} system that used {{smoke and mirrors}} existed in the region, and direct lines of sight have been established between Pueblo Alto, HuÃ©rfano Mountain in northern New Mexico, and Chimney Rock Pueblo in southern Colorado. Messages could have been relayed between these three points within minutes. On the mesa behind Chaco <b>Canyon</b> <b>is</b> an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl, then northward along {{the east side of}} Pueblo Alto before joining with the Great North Road. The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along Escavada Wash. It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods, construction timber, and people throughout the San Juan Basin. Several road segments appear to be related to a row of Chetro Ketl's exterior rooms, which are thought to have been community storage space.|$|E
