40|$|The limited {{partnership}} {{emerged as a}} key societal innovation during the early modern age. It allowed an effective separation between partners – those acting and those conferring capital – and it granted limited liability to partners in case of insolvency. The diffusion of {{limited partnership}} – between the Sixteenth and Seventeenth centuries - came at a <b>crucial</b> <b>crossroad</b> <b>in</b> the economic history of early modern Italian cities. Banking on new archival sources this paper will argue that in Bologna the diffusion of this new societal form was closely associated to a fundamental renewal of the city economic landscape. On the one hand {{the rise of the}} limited partnership came {{as a response to the}} international banking crisis of the last quarter of the Sixteenth century, the string of financial bankruptcies and the ensuing dramatic credit squeeze that affected the city. The limited partnership offered investors a new (and less risky) outlet for capital, and eased the credit crunch businesses were reeling from. On the other hand its diffusion was not business neutral, as a matter of fact it was closely related to the expansion of the silk manufacturing sector, that emerged as the forward sector of the city economy...|$|R
40|$|The design {{realized}} in 2005, for the railway station in Naples in Corso Garibaldi, addresses {{the themes of}} urban decay, poor functions and degraded habitats, {{to the creation of}} new social ties, giving answers to settlement needs with distributive and constructive solutions. The area including Garibaldi Square and the Circumvesuviana Station is a <b>crucial</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>in</b> the transport system of Naples: pedestrian mobility, intersects with surface and underground mass transport, private transport, parking. The Station, about 500 metres from the main Garibaldi Square, is the terminal of a regional network of rail services, that has been gradually invaded by immigrants from outside Europe, particularly from China. The paper deals with the preservation, promotion and integration processes applied to public spaces in order to return to citizenship the right to public space, educating residents and newcomers. The cultural assumptions behind the choices are due to the principles that a design of outdoor public spaces, may be a precondition for the creation of an intercultural dialogue. Spaces shaping, morphology design, construction are the shared framework among individuals, groups and communities (Gifford R. 1987), that can convey messages of coexistence and dialogue supported by technical solutions compatible with local conditions (Butina G., Bentley I., 2007) ...|$|R

40|$|Zimbabwe {{reached a}} <b>crucial</b> <b>crossroads</b> <b>in</b> its land reform with the {{expiration}} of the Lancaster House Constitution in April 1990, which {{opened the door}} for policy debate on alternative land-redistribution options. Proponents of the land reform have aggressively called for an expansion of the resettlement program to help redress the unequal distribution of land resources and to rectify acute land scarcity in communal areas. Opponents of rapid and substantial land reform have emphasized the superior efficiency of the commercial farming sector and the adverse consequences that a substantially expanded resettlement sector would have on agricultural output and the balance of trade. Many key questions {{lie at the heart of}} the land policy debate. First, what tenure arrangements might best serve farmers in the different sectors-communal, commercial, and resettlement-and how might they be instituted to provide equitable access, secure tenure, and flexibility in the face of changing economic conditions? Second, what legal framework ought to be instituted to facilitate the movement of land between farmers and enterprises within the system and what outcomes would be expected in terms of the distribution of agricultural landholdings among individuals and groups in society? Third, how would the process of land reform influence output, trade, and income distribution? Specifically, should land reform continue, and if so, what form should it take? What is the comparative efficiency of production in the commercial and communal sectors, and what gains or losses might be anticipated from resettlement? What legislative, institutional, and market reforms are needed to complement resettlement and to resolve the problems of land resource degradation in communal areas? These and other questions serve to focus this study. Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
50|$|On 18 June, SDF forces {{reached the}} western {{entrance}} of Manbij, two {{kilometers from the}} city center, in the process inflicting heavy casualties on ISIL, including two killed senior commanders. By {{the next day the}} SDF had secured the <b>crucial</b> Al-Kitab <b>crossroad</b> <b>in</b> western Manbij, while they continued to assault the ISIL-held villages of Yasta and Eyn En-Nexîl northeast of the city. The two villages were eventually captured after heavy clashes, depriving ISIL forces of their last strongholds in Manbij's outskirts. Subsequently, a SDF field commander claimed that the SDF had captured all villages around Manbij from ISIL, and that the situation for the besieged forces in the city became dire. He reported that some ISIL emirs had attempted to bribe the SDF to let them flee the city. Furthermore, clashes between SDF and ISIL took place near al-Kawkali and al-Arima, where ISIL forcibly conscripted 200 locals to fight against the SDF.|$|R
40|$|Common {{to complex}} systems are two {{fundamental}} themes-the universal interconnectedness and interdependence of all phenomena, and the intrinsically dynamic nature of reality. "At {{each level of}} complexity we encounter systems that are integrated, self-organizing wholes consisting of smaller parts and, at the same time, acting as parts of larger wholes" (Capra). Many of the original health complexity leaders, like Plesek, Dooley, Berwick, and Lindberg, have pioneered the approaches that led to many diverse pathways to health improvement. But have these ideas been sufficiently adopted by decision makers to make a difference? We stand at <b>crossroads</b> <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> to health systems evidence, funding and organization, particularly in the USA. Many cherished reductionist ideas {{about the nature of}} disease and illness and how systems should be organized to improve health outcomes have not delivered their promises, e. g. "disease management carve outs," and are found to be costly, fragmenting, and ineffective. In addition, comparative metrics have revealed many unintended and unwelcome consequences such as widening health inequities, overtreatment, and poor access to care to name a few. However, the opportunity to influence policy and practice has never been greater, as major shifts in healthcare provision are being forced by the international financial crises...|$|R

40|$|Earlier this term, the United States Supreme Court heard oral {{argument}} in the consolidated case of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, {{the first of a}} litany of cases in which for-profit business entities are invoking the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (2 ̆ 2 RFRA 2 ̆ 2) in support of their claim that the Affordable Care Act’s HHS Mandate violates their freedom of religion. In particular, these plaintiffs argue that the Mandate’s requirement that employer-provided health insurance covers the costs of contraceptives, the 2 ̆ 2 morning after 2 ̆ 2 pill, and other fertility-related drugs conflicts with their deeply-held religious belief that life begins at conception and is, therefore, unconstitutional. While the Mandate does exempt 2 ̆ 2 religious employers 2 ̆ 2 from this requirement, it does not excuse all secular, for-profit corporations from complying simply because their officers, founders, or directors may have religious beliefs that conflict with the Mandate’s provisions. Authors Day and Diaz were sitting just feet away from the advocates during the riveting Hobby Lobby {{oral argument}}. One question by Justice Kennedy piqued their interest in the nondelegation doctrine and the principle of separation of powers as they apply to the HHS Mandate. In the first academic article authored during the crucial time between oral arguments and the Court’s decision, this paper breaks down the complex legal issues and provides a solid dose of 2 ̆ 2 common sense 2 ̆ 2 in analyzing what will ultimately be a decision with momentous and far-reaching consequences. First, this Article sets the stage for the Court’s forthcoming decision by providing some background and insight into the parties’ arguments, the history of free exercise jurisprudence, and RFRA, the centerpiece of Hobby Lobby’s claim. The Article poses critical and timely questions, such as whether this decision will reinstate or expand the pre-Smith standard for assessing religious exercise claims and whether Hobby Lobby, as a for-profit commercial business, has standing under RFRA to bring a free exercise claim. Second, this Article deconstructs the complexities of RFRA, providing a step-by-step analysis of its legal framework. It first provides a comprehensive overview of the dense 2 ̆ 2 substantial burden 2 ̆ 2 inquiry, which asks whether the government has imposed a substantial burden on the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. Then, it outlines and analyzes the strict scrutiny standard, which RFRA applies. Next, the Article simplifies the complex and less widely-discussed nondelegation doctrine and addresses the dangerous trend spreading countrywide, in which states are enacting their own RFRA laws to exempt religious employers from complying with public accommodation laws. These exemptions essentially condone a new wave of discrimination, which give license to wedding vendors and other businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples or homosexual patrons. Lastly, the Article cautions that, in the wake of Hobby Lobby and the other RFRA cases, where the clash between religion, politics, and the law have met head-on, this Court must be cautious not to set a dangerous precedent and shield for-profit, secular businesses from liability when they fail to comply with public accommodation laws based on their asserted religious beliefs. Not only do we face a <b>crucial</b> <b>crossroad</b> <b>in</b> this Country’s free exercise jurisprudence, we also risk overlooking an impermissible delegation of legislative authority, which, when coupled with deference to administrative decision-making, threatens the constitutional structure and separation of powers. An accretion of administrative agency power [...] the headless fourth branch of government [...] threatens all of our rights, not just religious freedom...|$|R

40|$|<b>Crossroads</b> <b>in</b> the Black Aegean is a compendious, timely, and {{fascinating}} study of African rewritings of Greek tragedy. It consists of detailed readings of six dramas and one epic poem, from different locations across the African diaspora. Barbara Goff and Michael Simpson ask why the plays of Sophocles' Theban Cycle figure so prominently among the tragedies adapted by dramatists of African descent, and how plays that dilate {{on the power}} of the past, in the inexorable curse of Oedipus and the regressive obsession of Antigone, can articulate the postcolonial moment. Capitalizing on classical reception studies, postcolonial studies, and comparative literature, <b>Crossroads</b> <b>in</b> the Black Aegean co-ordinates theory and theatre. It crucially investigates how the plays engage with the 'Western canon', and shows how they use their self-consciously literary status to assert, ironize, and challenge their own place, and that of the Greek originals, <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> to that tradition. Beyond these oedipal reflexes, the adaptations offer alternative African models of cultural transmission...|$|R
