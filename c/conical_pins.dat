5000|$|An initial {{attempt to}} solve the blade {{fracture}} problem by increasing {{the breadth of the}} blade roots from 7 to 14 mm was unsuccessful. Fatigue tests and stress analysis by the CSIR showed that both sizes of blades failed due to fatigue at the sharp fillets {{as a result of the}} repeated changes in the centrifugal load due to variations in the turbine rotational speed. The solution was arrived at when it was realised that none of the single [...] "lock" [...] blades, which were supported by two <b>conical</b> <b>pins,</b> of any rotor had ever failed. When such <b>conical</b> <b>pins</b> were also introduced between all the other blades in the rotors, fatigue tests showed that this made them considerably stronger. Some time later it was found that welding the blades onto the rotor edge proved to be a good cheaper alternative. The design was eventually amended with the redesigned exhaust fan being manufactured from manganese steel and the problem was solved.|$|E

AA 1060 and C 11000 sheets were joined using different process parameters and tool geometries. The {{presence of a}} copper rings also called hooks were observed in all the produced spot welds and their length increases with the tool shoulder plunge depth; whereas the spot welds produced at 1200 rpm for the two tool geometries exhibited a decrease and a slight increment in {{the length of the}} copper ring using a flat pin/flat shoulder and conical pin/ concave shoulder, respectively. Furthermore, the mapping of the produced spot weld using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) exhibited different microstructures with the presence of copper fragments and particles in the aluminium matrix.

In this work, {{we report}} on the {{friction}} stir weldability of a semi-solid cast ZK 60 alloy modified with 1. 5 wt % mischmetall in the lap-joint configuration using a 120 WV 4 steel tool with concave shoulder and <b>conical</b> <b>pin.</b> The coarser solidification microstructure in the semi-solid cast ZK 60 - 1. 5 %RE alloy requires low strain rates and increased heat input to produce lap-joints without inner defects. This was achieved with 250 rpm tool rotation and 50 mm/min welding speed. Friction stir welding results in a very fine grained microstructure in the stir zone probably due to dynamic recrystallization. In the thermomechanically affected zones dynamic recrystallization seems to occur within the solute enriched intergranular zones. The distribution of longitudinal residual stresses exhibit stress maxima at both thermomechanically affected zones. A compression peak is observed at the retreating side, whereas a tensile stress maximum occurs at the advancing side...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe heat treatable aluminum–copper alloy AA 2014 finds wide {{application}} in the aerospace and defence industry {{due to its}} high strength-to-weight ratio and good ductility. Friction stir welding (FSW) process, an emerging solid state joining process, is suitable for joining this alloy compared to fusion welding processes. This work presents the formulation of a mathematical model with process parameters and tool geometry to predict the responses of friction stir welds of AA 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy, viz yield strength, tensile strength and ductility. The most influential process parameters considered are spindle speed, welding speed, tilt angle and tool pin profile. A four-factor, five-level central composite design was used and a response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to develop the regression models to predict the responses. The mechanical properties, such as yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and percentage elongation (%El), are considered as responses. Method of {{analysis of variance was}} used to determine the important process parameters that affect the responses. Validation trials were carried out to validate these results. These results indicate that the friction stir welds of AA 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy welded with hexagonal tool pin proﬁle have the highest tensile strength and elongation, whereas the joints fabricated with <b>conical</b> tool <b>pin</b> proﬁle have the lowest tensile strength and elongation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is {{regarded}} as the most significant development in joining over the past two decades. In FSW, process parameters and tool geometry play a fundamental role in obtaining desirable mechanical properties and microstructures in the welded zone. The tool geometry {{plays an important role in}} producing sound friction stir welds. Tool designs are however, generally propriety to individual researchers and only limited information is available in open literature. There are however, continuous efforts to understand the material flow and the influence that the FSW tool design has on the friction stir welded material. Within industries that use various welding techniques it well known that FSW is particularly suited for the welding of aluminium; there is great potential for FSW of copper. Given the limited supply, high cost, copper theft and commercial demand associated with copper, engineers and scientists will either attempt to reduce the quantity of copper consumed by industries or alternatively replace copper with a substitute metal that exhibits similar attributable properties. On account of the limited supply and consequently the high cost associated with copper and copper alloys; the need to join aluminium and copper and its’ alloys is anticipated to increase in the near future. FSW of dissimilar alloys/metals has attracted extensive research interest due to potential engineering prominence and inherent problems associated with conventional welding methods. This research identifies the choice of suitable tool designs and process parameters to produce sound dissimilar friction stir welds of 5754 aluminium and C 11000 copper. This research focuses primarily on determining the effect of FSW process parameters on the forces experienced by the FSW tool and the relationship that this has on the electrical conductivity properties of the friction stir dissimilar weld. The experimental work was performed by completing dissimilar friction stir welds on 3 mm thick butt welds of the two materials by means of an I-stir FSW platform. During the experimental work, the rotational speed was varied between 600 and 1200 rpm in intervals on 300 related to low, medium and high rotational speeds respectively and four different FSW tool geometries were tested. The first tool was a new design with a unique shoulder topography and a cylindrical pin named the “Reddy tool”. The second tool was a tool consisted of a concave shoulder and <b>conical</b> <b>pin.</b> Tests were performed using the second tool at a 0 degree tilt and at a 2 degree tilt relative to the work-piece. The third tool consisted of a concave shoulder and cylindrical pin. The forth tool design consisted of a flat shoulder and a cylindrical pin. This research forms part of the initial experimental work to determine the forces and electrical resistance of dissimilar friction stir welds of aluminium and copper by employing different tool shoulder designs. The welds were characterised through visual inspection, weld defect and material flow analysis, microstructural evaluation, electrical resistance measurements and tool forces and tool torque analysis. Microstructural evaluation results revealed complex flow patterns of copper and aluminium material. Lamellae structures composed of copper particles with a streamline shape and continuous aluminium strips were present. Some evidence of dynamic recrystallization was observed in the nugget of the defect free welds. Based on material flow evaluation and defect formation results, the Reddy tool design is most suitable for high and low rotational speeds, the conical Shoulder tool at no tilt is most suitable for medium rotational speeds, the conical shoulder tool at a two degree tool tilt is most suitable for medium rotational speeds, the [...] .
