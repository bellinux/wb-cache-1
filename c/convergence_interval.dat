40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} a new application of p-cyclic iterations, for arbitrary p⩾ 2. The block SOR method for the computation of the steady state-distribution of finite Markov chains that possess p-cyclic infinitesimal generators is considered. It is shown that convergence, in a sense more general than the usual, may be obtained even if the SOR iteration violates the usual conditions for semiconvergence. Necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence in this extended sense are derived. They are then applied in the case where the pth power of the associated Jacobi matrix of the system to be solved possesses only nonnegative eigenvalues. Exact <b>convergence</b> <b>intervals</b> and the optimal ω-values are derived for this case. In addition to the “usual” optimal ω in the interval (1,p(p− 1)), other ω-values that yield convergence in the extended sense are found {{to achieve the same}} optimal convergence rate.

The objective is to split the initial problem into two parts: a problem set in the whole domain Ω, for which fast solvers can be used, and local subproblems set in narrow domains around the connected components of B, which can be solved in a fully parallel way. We shall present here a method based on a multi-domain formulation of the initial problem, which leads to a fixed point algorithm.

A 2 -packing is maximal if no proper superset of S is a 2 -packing. This paper presents a safely converging self-stabilizing algorithm for maximal 2 -packing problem. Under a synchronous daemon, it quickly converges to a 2 -packing (a safe state, {{not necessarily the}} legitimate state) in three synchronous steps, and then terminates in a maximal one (the legitimate state) in O(n) steps without breaking safety during the <b>convergence</b> <b>interval,</b> where n {{is the number of}} nodes. Space requirement at each node is O(logn) bits. This is a significant improvement over the most recent self-stabilizing algorithm for maximal 2 -packing that uses O(n 2) synchronous steps with same space complexity and that does not have safe convergence property. We then generalize the technique to design a self-stabilizing algorithm for maximal k-packing, k ≥ 2, with safe convergence that stabilizes in O(kn 2) steps under synchronous daemon; the algorithm has space complexity of O(kn logn) bits at each node; existing algorithms for k-packing stabilize in exponential time under a central daemon with O(logn) space complexity...|$|E

40|$|We {{test for}} price bubbles in 14 {{national}} {{real estate investment}} trust (REIT) markets, and measure the degree of their convergence towards a common trend. Our methodology consists of the recently developed test of Phillips, Shi and Yu (2014) for mildly explosive processes, and the Phillips and Sul (2007) method for modelling convergence among random variables. We find evidence of explosive behaviour in index levels of seven of the 14 markets. In contrast, explosive dynamics are found in only one price/dividend ratio. More than half of the episodes of explosive behaviour are date-stamped to periods prior to the 2007 – 2009 financial crisis.

40|$|Purpose Together {{with the}} {{development}} of MRI contrasts that are inherently small in their magnitude, increased magnetic field accuracy is also required. Hence, mapping of the static magnetic field (B 0) and the excitation field (B 1) is not only important to feedback shim algorithms, but also for postprocess contrast-correction procedures. Methods A novel field-inhomogeneity mapping method is presented that allows simultaneous mapping of the water shift and B 1 (WASABI) using an off-resonant rectangular preparation pulse. The induced Rabi oscillations lead to a sinc-like spectrum in the frequency-offset dimension and allow for determination of B 0 by its symmetry axis and of B 1 by its oscillation frequency. Results Stability of the WASABI method with regard to the influences of T 1, T 2, magnetization transfer, and repetition time was investigated and its <b>convergence</b> <b>interval</b> was verified. B 0 and B 1 maps obtained simultaneously by means of WASABI in the human brain at 3 [*]T and 7 [*]T can compete well with maps obtained by standard methods. Finally, the method was applied successfully for B 0 and B 1 correction of chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI (CEST-MRI) data of the human brain. Conclusion The proposed WASABI method yields a novel simultaneous B 0 and B 1 mapping within 1 [*]min that is robust and easy to implement.

40|$|AbstractIn 1975 Chen and Gentleman {{suggested}} a 3 -block SOR method for solving least-squares problems, {{based on a}} partitioning scheme for the observation matrix A intoA=A 1 A 2 where A 1 is square and nonsingular. In many cases A 1 is obvious from {{the nature of the}} problem. This combined direct-iterative method was discussed further and applied to angle adjustment problems in geodesy, where A 1 is easily formed and is large and sparse, by Plemmons in 1979. Recently, Niethammer, de Pillis, and Varga have rekindled interest in this method by correcting and extending the SOR <b>convergence</b> <b>interval.</b> The purpose of our paper is to discuss an alternative formulation of the problem leading to a 2 -block SOR method. For this formulation it is shown that the resulting direct-iterative method always converges for sufficiently small SOR parameter, in contrast to the 3 -block formulation. Formulas for the optimum SOR parameter and the resulting asymptotic convergence factor, based upon ‖A 2 A- 11 ‖ 2, are given. Furthermore, it is shown that this 2 -cyclic block SOR method always gives better convergence results than the 3 -cyclic one for the same amount of work per iteration. The direct part of the algorithm requires only a sparse-matrix factorization of A 1. Our purpose here is to establish theoretical convergence results, in line with the purpose of the recent paper by Niethammer, de Pillis, and Varga. Practical considerations of choosing A 1 in certain applications and of estimating the resulting ‖A 2 A- 11 ‖ 2 will be addressed elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Interactive (that with haptic feedback) {{simulation}} of surgery needs for increasingly fast simulation techniques. Feedback rates are nowadays fixed around 1 kHz for haptic peripherals and around 30 Hz for visual display. Such tremendous rates impose very drastic limitations to the simulation procedure. In {{order to achieve}} haptic realism, several techniques have been tested in the literature. These include mass-spring systems, the use of linear elastic explicit finite element codes or, more recently, the use of Graphic Processing Units (GPU) to speedup the simulation. In any case, {{in order to achieve}} realistic results compatible with the sense of touch, large strains must be taken into account, together with sophisticated, state of the art constitutive models for the soft tissues. This has not been achieved to date, up to the author's knowledge. Techniques based on model order reduction (MOR) have received an increasing attention in the last years, and have been employed for interactive {{simulation of}} linear elastic solids undergoing large strains (Barbic and James, 2005). In this thesis, however, a study has been made in order to discern if MOR techniques are suitable for the simulation of soft living tissues. In chapter 2 a technique based upon Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has been employed to simulate at haptic rates the governing equations for a human cornea under a hyperelastic, fiber-reinforced constitutive model. While the technique is able to efficiently simulate these models, errors up to 20 % have been noticed, still cceptable. In chapter 3 a novel technique has been developed that allows for an accurate solution of material and geometrical non-linear hyperelastic models without the need of stiffness matrix inversions. It is based upon the combination of POD techniques and Asymptotic Numerical Methods, which provide an accurate description of the nonlinear stress-strain curve of these organs in a <b>convergence</b> <b>interval</b> of sufficient width. Finally, the use of globally supported basis functions, an essential characteristic of POD techniques, very much complicates the task of simulating surgical cutting.

A combinação desses fatores elimina a necessidade de utilizar estruturas cabeadas e configurações pré-definidas. Neste trabalho, o autor desenvolve uma versão simulada, através do simulador de rede “network Simulator 3 ” (ns- 3), do arcabouço “Heterogeneous Technologies Routing” (HTR), que se propõe à interconectar dispositivos em redes heterogêneas ad hoc, estendendo o seu suporte às tecnologias heterogêneas com a adição de dispositivos WiMAX e LTE, propõe uma extensão para fornecer um roteamento baseado em múltiplos caminhos (“Multipath”) e investiga o impacto de modificar os parâmetros de configuração do roteamento no tempo de convergência da rede e consumo de energia. Apesar de um grande número de obras existentes que investigam o impacto da mudança de parâmetros de configuração do roteamento, no meu conhecimento, nenhum deles investiga o impacto destes no tempo de convergência do protocolo e consumo de energia. O “Multipath HTR”, a extensão proposta, oferece vários benefícios como balanceamento de carga, tolerância a falhas, prevenção de “loops” de roteamento, conservação de energia, baixo atraso fim-a-fim, e evita o congestionamento, entre outros. Este trabalho faz uma análise comparativa da extensão ao HTR proposta, com a base do HTR, e o protocolo amplamente utilizado “Optimized Link State Routing” (OLSR). Além disso, o esse trabalho investiga o impacto de variar o intervalo de envio de mensagens de HELLO e realiza uma análise comparativa do HTR modificado (“Tuned HTR”) com o protocolo OLSR. As duas avaliações são {{realizadas}} através de simulação usando tecnologias heterogêneas como WiMAX, 3 GPP LTE e Wi-Fi. Resultados mostram que a extensão de múltiplos caminhos proposta melhora a taxa de transmissão de dados, e reduz o atraso fim-a-fim sem maiores impactos no consumo de energia da rede. Para o “Tuned HTR”, resultados mostram que a variação do intervalo de envio de mensagens de HELLO pode melhorar a convergência do protocolo e reduz o consumo de energia. Recent {{years have}} witnessed {{the emergence of new}} communication techniques in Computer Science that use both wireless technologies and self-organizing features. Their combination eliminates the need for using pre-defined wired structures and prior configurations. In this work, we develop a simulated version, using the network simulator 3 (ns- 3), of the Heterogeneous Technologies Routing (HTR) framework that is suitable for interconnecting devices in a heterogeneous ad hoc network, extending its supported heterogeneous technologies with the addition of WiMAX and LTE devices, proposes an extension to enable multipath routing over this framework and investigates the impact of tuning routing parameters on <b>convergence</b> <b>interval</b> and energy consumption. Although a large number of works exist that investigate the tuning of routing parameter settings, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, none of them investigate the impact of these on protocol convergence and energy consumption. Multipath HTR routing, the extension we propose, offers several benefits such as load balancing, fault tolerance, routing loop prevention, energy-conservation, low end-to-end delay, and congestion avoidance, among others. This work performs a comparative analysis of the proposed HTR extension, with the baseline HTR, and the widely used Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of tuning the HELLO refresh interval and perform a comparative analysis of the tuned HTR with the OLSR protocol. Both evaluations are validated through the simulation of heterogeneous technologies such as WiMAX, 3 GPP LTE and Wi-Fi. Results show that the multipath extension effectively improves the data delivery ratio, and reduces the end-to-end delay without major impact on network energy consumption. For the tuned HTR, results show that varying the HELLO refresh interval can improve the convergence of the protocol and reduce the energy consumption...|$|E
