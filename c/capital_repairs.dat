50|$|After 25 years, Soho Rep {{left the}} Walkerspace in September 2016, after {{discovering}} {{that it had}} been unknowingly violating zoning restrictions {{on the use of the}} building, and could not afford the alterations which would be needed to keep performing there. The company produced its shows other venues throughout Manhattan, until the city's Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, Julie Menin, persuaded Rick Chandler, the Building Commissioner to intervene.

50|$|The City of London and the City of London Arena Trust have a 50-year lease {{with the}} city as the {{landlord}} and the trust the tenant. In turn, the London Civic Centre Corporation is in a 50-year participatory occupancy lease with the City of London Arena Trust. The London Civic Centre Corporation maintains the sports-entertainment centre {{and is on the}} hook for improvements, but they also have a facility fee on tickets to accumulate money for those improvements and they have a confidential agreement with Global Spectrum to manage the facility. While the City of London may take slight annual profits, which are dashed by the annual debt payments, those don't include further costs such as maintaining parking and Jubilee Square in front of the sports-entertainment centre. From years one to five, the city's share of net profit was 20% and increased to 45% in years six to 10 then 70% for years 11 to 50. The private aspect anticipated profit returns of about 12% with City of London staff estimating the city's return on investment would be between 1 and 2%. Though it sounds financially beneficial to the City of London long-term, especially given the increase in profits after the 11th year, events filling the sports-entertainment centre nearly every other day during the year and City of London revenue averaging about $650,000 annually between 2011 and 2014, the risk far outweighs the rewards. Though sports-entertainment centres have a serviceable life of 40 to 60 years, in recent years that has shrunk to 20 to 30 years before teams or municipalities begin demanding new arenas. The City of London also has the option of exercising an early and zero termination fee during {{the first six months of}} the 21st fiscal period (year). The existence of that clause and the possibility of others among several of the mostly secret agreements in accordance with the sports-entertainment centre would leave the City of London in complete control of all financial and operational costs. It is unlikely the City of London would enact the clause due to the nature of maintaining an aging sports-entertainment centre that would need <b>capital</b> <b>repairs.</b> It is unknown if the London Civic Centre Corporation has a similar termination clause.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} analysis of shortcomings {{and benefits of}} individual techniques for the <b>capital</b> <b>repair</b> of out-of-commission water wells of standard designs. The author considers the <b>capital</b> <b>repair</b> procedure of water well No 3 B of Zhodino ‘Severniy’ water supply point by means of installing a repair filter of smaller diameter inside the failed one, cushioning the tubular annulus with gravel. It is shown {{that this kind of}} repair can be considered a temporary arrangement inasmuch as the water well specific yield and service life period will reduce significantly. For prolongation of the useful life of the water wells, the paper suggests performing preliminary unloading of their filters. The study reveals that the well <b>capital</b> <b>repair</b> by means of extracting the old filter and exchanging it with a new one can be complicated by the column burst along the welding joints working in tension. The performed column strength test demonstrated the fact that the required heave might exceed the welding joint tolerant tensile force owing to considerable friction of the column against the ground. The author arrives at a design equation of the heave required for extracting the production column with the filter applying only the static force. In which they offer to determine frictional force of the mudded filter against the formation from calculating formulae of the supporting power of an augered pile working with pulling loads. For decreasing the heaves via reducing frictional loads of the mudded filter against the formation, an improved design of the water well has been introduced recognized as an invention with the filter capable of downward biasing. Such water well design allows at the filter mud fill in the first instance the entire filtering column to be biased (knocked) down inside a special sleeve placed lower the settler by applying external buffing force, and then only extracting the filtering column out of the well by decreased traction pull. The energy balance equation for vertical displacement of the water well pipe column results in the computation expression for the hammer striking part weight and its drop height during the <b>capital</b> <b>repair</b> of the water well of improved design.  </p...|$|R

The last day of the horse line on the bridge was 15 May 1905, when it was replaced with an electric tram and later, in 1908, with buses.

40|$|Purpose. The article aims {{to analyze}} the {{stabilization}} process of train movement after interruption and loss of the working capacity. Methodology. To examine the process of train movement on the route (double-track line with sorting station) in extreme conditions during the maintenance windows for <b>capital</b> <b>repair</b> of the track. During the investigation of this process time calculations of a normal motion restoration after the maintenance windows were carried out. In this process there are no organizational interventions aimed to change various coefficients.

It was found out that the major losses of working capacityduring the maintenance windows occur as a result of perturbations caused by interruptions, not the interruptions in themselves.
