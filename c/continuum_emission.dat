40|$|The {{observations}} of transient gamma-ray line and sporadic <b>continuum</b> <b>emissions</b> from the Crab {{over the last}} two decades are reviewed, and these measurements are used to explore the emission mechanisms and regions.

40|$|Uranium <b>continuum</b> radio <b>emission</b> {{detected}} by the Voyager 2 Planetary Radio Astronomy experiment during the January 1986 encounter is considered. The <b>continuum</b> <b>emissions</b> comprised four components (equatorial emissions, anomaly emissions, strong nightside emissions, and weak nightside emissions) associated with different sources. The equatorial emissions appeared most prominently {{during the days}} before closest approach and extended from 40 kHz or below to about 120 kHz. The anomaly emissions were seen about 12 hours before closest approach and extended to about 250 kHz. The agreement found between Miranda's phase and strong radio emission at 20. 4 kHz, just after closest approach, suggests intense dynamic activity on the Miranda L shell...|$|R
40|$|We present high {{resolution}} ALMA {{observations of the}} CO(3 - 2) and 350 GHz <b>continuum</b> <b>emissions</b> of the debris disc of 49 Ceti, known to be particularly rich in molecular gas {{in spite of its}} age. The main new results are: i) both CO and dust discs share a same position angle and a same inclination but the gas disc is more homogeneous, more central and thinner than the dust disc; ii) evidence is obtained for a significant deficit of observed CO(3 - 2) emission at Doppler velocities differing from the star systemic velocity by less than 1; iii) gas velocities are accurately measured and found Keplerian over a broad range of disc radii; iv) the observed CO(3 - 2) line width is dominated by Keplerian shear and upper limits are obtained to the intrinsic line width. Simple phenomenological models of both CO(3 - 2) and 350 GHz <b>continuum</b> <b>emissions</b> are presented, requiring the use of only very few parameters. The results are discussed in the frame of currently favoured models. Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
25|$|Radio-quiet quasars/QSOs. These are {{essentially}} more luminous versions of Seyfert 1s: {{the distinction is}} arbitrary and is usually {{expressed in terms of}} a limiting optical magnitude. Quasars were originally 'quasi-stellar' in optical images as they had optical luminosities that were greater than that of their host galaxy. They always show strong optical <b>continuum</b> <b>emission,</b> X-ray <b>continuum</b> <b>emission,</b> and broad and narrow optical emission lines. Some astronomers use the term QSO (Quasi-Stellar Object) for this class of AGN, reserving 'quasar' for radio-loud objects, while others talk about radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. The host galaxies of quasars can be spirals, irregulars or ellipticals. There is a correlation between the quasar's luminosity and the mass of its host galaxy, in that the most luminous quasars inhabit the most massive galaxies (ellipticals).|$|E
25|$|X-ray <b>continuum</b> <b>emission.</b> This {{can arise}} both from a jet {{and from the}} hot corona of the {{accretion}} disc via a scattering process: in both cases it shows a power-law spectrum. In some radio-quiet AGN there is an excess of soft X-ray emission {{in addition to the}} power-law component. The origin of the soft X-rays is not clear at present.|$|E
25|$|Seyfert galaxies. Seyferts {{were the}} {{earliest}} distinct class of AGN to be identified. They show optical range nuclear <b>continuum</b> <b>emission,</b> narrow and occasionally broad emission lines, occasionally strong nuclear X-ray emission {{and sometimes a}} weak small-scale radio jet. Originally they {{were divided into two}} types known as Seyfert 1 and 2: Seyfert 1s show strong broad emission lines while Seyfert 2s do not, and Seyfert 1s are more likely to show strong low-energy X-ray emission. Various forms of elaboration on this scheme exist: for example, Seyfert 1s with relatively narrow broad lines are sometimes referred to as narrow-line Seyfert 1s. The host galaxies of Seyferts are usually spiral or irregular galaxies.|$|E
40|$|The <b>continuum</b> to {{molecular}} <b>emission</b> {{intensity ratio}} in cometary spectra is examined {{as an indicator}} of initial composition of the comets. This ratio presumably measures the dust to gas ratio in comets, or the component of gas yielding visible emissions. The spectral relationships and compositions of new comets and more evolved ones are compared. No significant difference in the <b>continuum</b> to <b>emission</b> ratio was noted between new and more evolved comets, which is in contradiction to Oort's conclusion. This suggests that no systematic change occurs in the <b>continuum</b> to <b>emission</b> ratio as comets evolve from new to periodic. Perihelion passage does not seem to produce a general weakening of the continuum, although it occurs in individual cases...|$|R

Note that the Arase satellite traversed across the plasmapause at L[*]=[*] 6.6 at ~[*] 2150 UT, {{which was also}} detected by HFA (not shown), implying that this event was observed just outside the plasmapause.

25|$|Radio galaxies. These objects show {{nuclear and}} {{extended}} radio emission. Their other AGN properties are heterogeneous. They can broadly {{be divided into}} low-excitation and high-excitation classes. Low-excitation objects show no strong narrow or broad emission lines, and the emission lines they do have may be excited by a different mechanism. Their optical and X-ray nuclear emission is consistent with originating purely in a jet. They {{may be the best}} current candidates for AGN with radiatively inefficient accretion. By contrast, high-excitation objects (narrow-line radio galaxies) have emission-line spectra similar to those of Seyfert 2s. The small class of broad-line radio galaxies, which show relatively strong nuclear optical <b>continuum</b> <b>emission</b> probably includes some objects that are simply low-luminosity radio-loud quasars. The host galaxies of radio galaxies, whatever their emission-line type, are essentially always ellipticals.|$|E
500|$|Radio {{observations}} {{revealed a}} {{sharp increase in}} <b>continuum</b> <b>emission</b> at a wavelength of [...] after the largest impacts, which peaked at 120% of the normal emission from the planet.

Consideration is given to the sources in which thermal processes dominate and those which are dominated by nonthermal processes, {{as well as to the}} methods in which source properties can be deduced from millimeter and submillimeter observations. Attention is also given to sources where both thermal and nonthermal processes have to be considered, namely Seyfert-type galaxies (such as NGC 1068 and Arp 220) and radio-quiet QSOs. Possible future directions for millimeter and submillimeter observations of AGN are suggested...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} current status of {{research}} on solar radio <b>continuum</b> <b>emissions</b> from metric to hectometric wave frequencies, emphasizing the role of energetic electrons in the 10 - 100 keV range in these emissions. It is seen that keV-energy electrons generated in active sunspot groups must be the sources of radio <b>continuum</b> storm <b>emissions</b> for wide frequency bands. These electrons excite plasma oscillations in the medium, which in turn are converted to electromagnetic radiation. The radio noise continuum sources are usually associated with type III burst activity observed above these sources. Although the mechanism for the release of the energetic electrons is not known, it seems they are ejected from storm source regions in association with rapid variation of associated sunspot magnetic fields due to their growth into complex types. To explain some of the observed characteristics, the importance of two-stream instability and the scattering of ambient plasma ions on energetic electron streams is pointed out...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to HI gas, {{it is thought}} that radio <b>continuum</b> <b>emission</b> should be present from NGC 5238 as well. The galaxy is a strong ultraviolet emitter, indicating that the galaxy is undergoing rapid star formation. Based on this, it is to be expected that there should be radio <b>continuum</b> <b>emission</b> from the galaxy, due to the acceleration of electrons in HII regions, known as bremsstrahlung. However, such emission has not been found in NGC 5238, contradicting models. To resolve this mystery, it has been hypothesized that the star formation has subsided recently enough that the UV excess from massive stars is still present, but the hydrogen has already recombined.|$|E
