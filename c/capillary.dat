5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, <b>capillary</b> blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, <b>capillary</b> blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double <b>capillary</b> network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the <b>capillary</b> network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
50|$|Lymphatic <b>capillaries</b> are {{slightly}} larger in diameter than blood <b>capillaries,</b> and have closed ends (unlike the blood <b>capillaries</b> open {{at one end}} to the arterioles and open at the other end to the venules). This structure permits interstitial fluid to flow into them but not out. Lymph <b>capillaries</b> have a greater internal oncotic pressure than blood <b>capillaries,</b> due to the greater concentration of plasma proteins in the lymph.|$|R
40|$|Within {{infected}} tissue Treponema pallidum shows {{a characteristic}} predilection for perivascular areas. After intact <b>capillaries</b> {{had been prepared}} from rabbit brain tissue treponemes were incubated with isolated <b>capillaries</b> and visualised by darkfield, phase contrast, and scanning electron microscopy. The organisms rapidly attached {{to the surface of}} the <b>capillaries</b> at the tip of the treponeme; attached organisms retained motility for longer periods than unattached organisms. Treponema pertenue also attached to <b>capillaries.</b> Heat-inactivated T pallidum and three non-pathogenic treponemes did not, however, attach to the <b>capillaries.</b> Immune rabbit serum contains a factor that blocks the attachment of T pallidum to <b>capillaries.</b> Compared with cultured mammalian cells <b>capillaries</b> should provide a better tool for investigating host-parasite relationships in syphilis...|$|R

5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the <b>capillary</b> network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the <b>capillary</b> network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Most fish {{exchange}} gases using gills {{on either}} side of the pharynx. Gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments. Each filament contains a <b>capillary</b> network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, <b>capillary</b> blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. However, bony fish have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum.|$|E

5|$|Wetting is {{important}} in the bonding or adherence of two materials. Wetting and the surface forces that control wetting are also responsible for other related effects, including <b>capillary</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|Bats possess highly adapted lung {{systems to}} cope with the {{pressures}} of powered-flight. Flight is an energetically taxing aerobic activity and requires large amounts of oxygen to be sustained. In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary <b>capillary</b> blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals. Due to the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E
25|$|Class II: {{there are}} empty <b>capillaries</b> next to <b>capillaries</b> that have flowing red blood cells.|$|R
50|$|The <b>capillaries</b> are the {{smallest}} of the blood vessels and are part of the microcirculation. The <b>capillaries</b> have a width of a single cell in diameter to aid in the fast and easy diffusion of gases, sugars and nutrients to surrounding tissues. <b>Capillaries</b> have no smooth muscle surrounding them and have a diameter less than that of red blood cells; a red blood cell is typically 7 micrometers outside diameter, <b>capillaries</b> typically 5 micrometers inside diameter. The red blood cells must distort in order to pass through the <b>capillaries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of exchange through the peritubular <b>capillaries</b> occurs because of chemical gradients osmosis and hydrostatic pressure. Movement {{of water into}} the peritubular <b>capillaries</b> {{is due to the}} loss of water from the glomerulus during filtration, which increases the colloid osmotic pressure of the blood. This blood leaves the glomerulus via the efferent arteriole, which supplies the peritubular <b>capillaries.</b> The higher osmolarity of the blood in the peritubular <b>capillaries</b> creates an osmotic pressure which causes the uptake of water. Other ions can be taken up by the peritubular <b>capillaries</b> via solvent drag. Water is also driven into the peritubular <b>capillaries</b> due to the higher fluid pressure of the interstitium, driven by reabsorption of fluid and electrolytes via active transport, and the low fluid pressure of blood entering the peritubular <b>capillaries</b> due to the narrowness of the efferent arteriole.|$|R
5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into <b>capillary</b> beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the <b>capillary</b> beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E
5|$|Orešković and Klarica hypothesise that CSF is not {{primarily}} {{produced by the}} choroid plexus, but is being permanently produced inside the entire CSF system, {{as a consequence of}} water filtration through the <b>capillary</b> walls into the interstitial fluid of the surrounding brain tissue, regulated by AQP-4.|$|E
5|$|Types of glial cell are astrocytes (including Bergmann glia), oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells (including tanycytes), radial glial {{cells and}} microglia. Astrocytes {{are the largest}} of the glial cells. They are stellate cells with many {{processes}} radiating from their cell bodies. Some of these processes end as perivascular end-feet on <b>capillary</b> walls. The glia limitans of the cortex is made up of astrocyte foot processes that serve in part to contain the cells of the brain.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{observation}} of Stricker, it has been known that <b>capillaries</b> were capable of independent contraction. Golubew and Tarchanoff made a similar observation on the <b>capillaries</b> of the tadpole's tail and attributed the contraction to a swelling of “Spindle elements” in the vessel wall. Rouget {{in the course of}} histological study, described about branched cells, which he held to be muscle cells surrounding certain <b>capillaries</b> and in a later study he found this same type of adventitial non-pigmented cell to be present on the <b>capillaries</b> of the tadpole's tail. These observations were followed by Meyer, Steinach and Kahn and Vimtrup. They recognized that the contraction of <b>capillaries</b> was due to that of these cells. But recently Flory and Carleton disowned the existence of these cells in their histological study of blood <b>capillaries.</b> In my histological observation I could not find the so-called “Rouget cells” and have come to the following conclusion that it is doubtful whether the presence of Rouget cells has the ncessary relation with the contraction of <b>capillaries,</b> for I could not find those cells on the <b>capillaries</b> in the mesentery of a grown-up frog, though Rouget and others succeeded in finding those cells on the <b>capillaries</b> of the tadpole's tail...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{studies had}} failed to show the {{presence}} of <b>capillaries</b> between the white fibres of pigeon pectoralis muscle. In this paper, data are reported {{for the first time}} documenting that these <b>capillaries</b> occur in both intra- and inter-fasicular areas of the muscle. Fresh frozen sections of pigeon pectoralis major muscle were incubated for alkaline ATPase reaction following pretreatment with different EDTA solutions (4. 3 mM, pH 4. 3). The results showed the existence of an inherent heterogeneity of <b>capillaries.</b> The <b>capillaries</b> of white fibres stained intensely for K-/Mg 2 [...] EDTA or Mg 2 +-EDTA pre-incubated ATPase; the <b>capillaries</b> of red fibres stained poorly. Both white fibre and red fibre <b>capillaries</b> were examined ultrastructurally in the non-perfused pigeon pectoralis muscle. It is suggested that a possible correlation exists between the distinctive metabolic and mechanical characteristics of the Type II white, glycolytic, fast-twitch fast-fatigue muscle fibres and the high ATPase activity of their <b>capillaries...</b>|$|R

25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by <b>capillary</b> action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the <b>capillary</b> fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a <b>capillary</b> fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The <b>capillary</b> head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal <b>capillary</b> rise in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E

50|$|The {{glomerulus}} is a tuft {{of small}} blood vessels called <b>capillaries</b> located within Bowman's capsule within the kidney. Between the <b>capillaries</b> and Bowman's capsule lies the mesangium. Blood enters the <b>capillaries</b> of the glomerulus {{by a single}} arteriole called an afferent arteriole and leaves by an efferent arteriole. The <b>capillaries</b> are lined by a layer of cells (an endothelium) that has a unique structure, allowing blood components to be filtered, and resulting ultimately {{in the formation of}} urine.|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{stage of the}} mouse embryo at which <b>capillaries</b> first occurred and their localisation in the neuroepithelium were investigated on serial sections of 9 and 10 days old embryos embedded in paraffin and Epon. In addition, areas of the neuroepithelium in which <b>capillaries</b> had been observed at the light microscopical level were investigated by electron microscopy carried out on embryos fixed with glutaraldehyde supplemented with tannic acid. In 5 - 7 microns serial sections of paraffin-embedded embryos, <b>capillaries</b> were initially seen in the CNS anlage at Theiler's Stage 14 (1972). At this stage, <b>capillaries</b> also occurred in the prosencephalon, the rhombencephalon and in the developing spinal cord. In 1 micron serial sections of resin-embedded embryos, <b>capillaries</b> could be identified in the neuroepithelium one stage earlier, i. e. at Stage 13. These very early <b>capillaries</b> were seen in the dorsal part of the lateral wall of the prosencephalon which later forms the diencephalon.
