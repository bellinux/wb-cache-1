40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) to characterise the hydraulic conditions near river engineering structures such as dams, fish passes and groins, as part of ecological and hydromorphological assessments. However, such ADCP applications can be limited by <b>compass</b> <b>errors,</b> obstructed view to navigation satellites, frequent loss of bottom tracking and spatially heterogeneous flow leading to erroneous water velocity measurements. This study addresses these limitations by (i) developing a heading sensor integration algorithm that corrects <b>compass</b> <b>errors</b> from magnetic interference, (ii) testing a Total Station based technique for spatial ADCP data referencing and (iii) evaluating a recently proposed data processing technique that reduces bias from spatial flow heterogeneity. The integration of these techniques on a radio control ADCP platform is illustrated downstream of a weir with fish pass on the River Severn, UK. The results show that each of the techniques can have a statistically significant effect on the estimated total water velocities and can strongly affect measures of vorticity. The obtained three-dimensional flow maps are suitable to describe the magnitude and orientation of the fish pass attraction flow in relation to competing flows and to highlight areas of increased vorticity...|$|R
25|$|Like any {{magnetic}} device, compasses {{are affected}} by nearby ferrous materials, {{as well as by}} strong local electromagnetic forces. Compasses used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to ferrous metal objects or electromagnetic fields (car electrical systems, automobile engines, steel pitons, etc.) as that can affect their accuracy. Compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks, cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of built-in magnets or other devices. Large amounts of ferrous metal combined with the on-and-off electrical fields caused by the vehicle's ignition and charging systems generally result in significant <b>compass</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|R

50|$|On {{aircraft}} or vessels {{there are}} three types of bearing: true, magnetic, and compass bearing. <b>Compass</b> <b>error</b> {{is divided into two}} parts, namely magnetic variation and magnetic deviation, the latter originating from magnetic properties of the vessel or aircraft. Variation and deviation are signed quantities. As discussed above, positive (easterly) variation indicates that magnetic north is east of geographic north.|$|E
50|$|In {{navigation}} manuals, magnetic deviation often refers {{specifically to}} <b>compass</b> <b>error</b> caused by magnetized iron within a ship or aircraft. This iron has {{a mixture of}} permanent magnetization and an induced (temporary) magnetization that is induced by the Earth's magnetic field. Because the latter depends on {{the orientation of the}} craft relative to the Earth's field, {{it can be difficult to}} analyze and correct for it.|$|E

Although many legends suggest mysterious circumstances for the sinkings, historical writers have attributed the area's record of shipping disasters to conventional maritime hazards such as bad weather, shifting cargoes, fires, submerged reefs exposed during periods of low water levels, and <b>compass</b> <b>errors</b> due to natural geomagnetic anomalies.|$|R

The so-called [...] "prayer wheel" [...] is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use.|$|R

[...] While they were periscope reconnoitering Tarawa, Nautilus received an order for a rescue mission, to observe the waters for any downed naval aviators that were shot down during the bombardment of the island.

Mapping was carried out in the tail drift, access drift, canister drift, heater drifts, instrumentation alcove, and receiving room. The fractures mapped as intersecting a horizontal datum in the canister and heater drifts are shown on one figure. Fracture sketch maps have been compiled as additional figures. Geologic mapping efforts were scheduled around and significantly impacted by the excavation and construction schedules. Several people were involved in the mapping, and over 2500 geologic discontinuities were mapped, including joints, shears, and faults. Some variance between individuals` mapping efforts was noticed, and the effects of various magnetic influences upon a compass were examined. The examination of <b>compass</b> <b>errors</b> improved the credibility of the data. The compass analysis work is explained in Appendix A.

40|$|Abstract. With {{increasing}} {{reliance on}} the location and orientation sen-sors in smartphones for not only augmented reality applications, but also for meeting government-mandated emergency response requirements, the reliability of these sensors {{is a matter of}} great importance. Previous studies measure the accuracy of the location sensing, typically GPS, in handheld devices including smartphones, but few studies do the same for the compass or gyroscope (gyro) sensors, especially in real-world augmented reality situations. In this study, we measure the reliability of both the location and orientation capabilities of three current gener-ation smartphones: Apple iPhone 4 and iPhone 4 s (iOS) phones, as well as a Samsung Galaxy Nexus (Android). Each is tested in three different orientation/body position combinations, and in varying environmental conditions, in order to obtain quantifiable information useful for under-standing the practical limits of these sensors when designing applications that rely on them. Results show mean location errors of 10 – 30 m and mean <b>compass</b> <b>errors</b> around 10 – 30 ◦, but with high standard deviations for both making them unreliable in many settings...|$|R

Finally, we confirm the simple formulas experimentally. Crossfield may cause <b>compass</b> <b>error</b> up to 2. 6 deg., depending on the compass orientation. The most effective way to suppress the crossfield error is using magnetic feedback, however this is not always possible.

40|$|Electronic compass {{is often}} used to provide the {{absolute}} heading reference for tracking the user’s head and hands in Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), especially for outdoor AR applications. However, compass is vulnerable to environment magnetism disturbance. Existing compass calibration methods require complex steps and true heading reference which is often impossible to be obtained in outdoor AR applications, and is useful only when compass is in horizontal plane. An autocalibration method without the need of heading reference and redundant sensors is proposed in this paper. First the <b>compass</b> <b>error</b> model based on physical principle is presented, then the algorithm to calculate the compensation coefficients with a set of sample measurements of the sensors in the compass is described.

Low cost vehicle systems utilize a magnetometer, and Doppler sonar for dead reckoning, and a DGPS fix when surfaced.

50|$|Compass turns (turns {{using the}} compass {{as the primary}} {{reference}} instrument) are not standard practice in modern aircraft.

40|$|The {{construction}} of fish passes {{has been a}} longstanding measure to improve river ecosystem status by ensuring the passability of weirs, dams and other in- channel structures for migratory fish. Many fish passes have a low biological effectiveness because of unsuitable hydrodynamic conditions hindering fish to rapidly detect the pass entrance. There has been a need for techniques to quantify the hydrodynamics surrounding fish pass entrances {{in order to identify}} those passes that require enhancement and to improve the design of new passes. This PhD thesis presents the development of a methodology for the rapid, spatially continuous quantification of near-pass hydrodynamics in the field. The methodology involves moving-vessel Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements in order to quantify the 3 -dimensional water velocity distribution around fish pass entrances. The approach presented in this thesis is novel because it integrates a set of techniques to make ADCP data robust against errors associated with the environmental conditions near engineered in-channel structures. These techniques provide solutions to (i) ADCP <b>compass</b> <b>errors</b> from magnetic interference, (ii) bias in water velocity data caused by spatial flow heterogeneity, (iii) the accurate ADCP positioning in locales with constrained line of sight to navigation satellites, and (iv) the accurate and cost-effective sensor deployment following pre-defined sampling strategies. The effectiveness and transferability of the methodology were evaluated at three fish pass sites covering conditions of low, medium and high discharge. The methodology outputs enabled a detailed quantitative characterisation of the fish pass attraction flow and its interaction with other hydrodynamic features. The outputs are suitable to formulate novel indicators of hydrodynamic fish pass attractiveness and they revealed the need to refine traditional fish pass design guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{preserve}} their efficiency, submarine tidal turbines and other marine renewable energy systems need an accurate knowledge of sea currents directions. The speeds and directions of these currents {{can be measured in}} a cell of water with currentmeters (AQD) or on a water column with profilers called AQP or ADCP which stands for Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. When these instruments are installed on carriers, mooring lines or mooring cages, it is necessary to correct the measured data in heading, roll and pitch, in order to interpret them in a terrestrial referential. In this way, they are equipped with a magnetic compass and tilt sensors. Magnetic environment influences compasses responses. There was no system to calibrate AQD and AQP in their using configurations. Following a method perfected in 2007 in order to correct angle errors and warranting a measurement uncertainty in the case of instruments fixed in mooring cages, a calibration platform for magnetic compasses and tilt sensors has been built. In order to show the interest and the corrections allowed by this equipment, this publication shows the effects of the instrumentation of a DORA mooring cage on the compass response of an AQD. The measurements underscore that the initial <b>compass</b> <b>error</b> of 4 ° peak-peak is between – 10 ° and + 5. 7 ° after installation in the cage. This publication shows also the results obtained after the calibration of a stock of 30 AQD currentmeters and 22 AQP profilers. The manufacturer specifications of 2 ° in heading are respected only in 37 % of cases for AQD’s and 23 % for AQP’s. The heading and roll specifications of 0. 2 ° are never respected but 86 % of profilers and 53 % of currentmeters show errors less than 2 °. ...|$|E
40|$|On {{the bridge}} of a ship the {{officers}} are looking for visual aids to guide navigation in order to reconcile the outside world with the position communicated by the digital navigation system. Aids to navigation include: Lighthouses, lightships, sector lights, beacons, buoys, and others. They {{are designed to help}} navigators calculate their position, establish their course or avoid dangers. In poor visibility and dense traffic areas, it can be very difficult to identify these critical aids to guide navigation. The paper presents the usage of Augmented Reality (AR) as a means to present digital information about these aids to support navigation. To date, nautical navigation related mobile AR applications have been limited to the leisure industry. If proved viable, this prototype can facilitate the creation of other similar applications that could help commercial officers with navigation. While adopting a user centered design approach, the team has developed the prototype based on insights from initial research carried on board of several ships. The prototype, built on Nexus 9 tablet and Wikitude, features a head-up display of the navigational aids (lights) in the area, presented in AR and a bird’s eye view mode presented on a simplified map. The application employs the aids to navigation data managed by Hydrographic Offices and the tablet’s sensors: GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass and camera. Sea trials on board of a Navy and a commercial ship revealed the end-users’ interest in using the application and further possibility of other data to be presented in AR. The application calculates the GPS position of the ship, the bearing and distance to the navigational aids; all within a high level of accuracy. However, during testing several issues were highlighted which need to be resolved as the prototype is developed further. The prototype stretched the capabilities of Wikitude, loading over 500 objects during tests in a major port. This overloaded the display and required over 45 seconds to load the data. Therefore, extra filters for the navigational aids are being considered in order to declutter the screen. At night, the camera is not powerful enough to distinguish all the lights in the area. Also, magnetic interference with {{the bridge of}} the ship generated a continuous <b>compass</b> <b>error</b> of the AR display that varied between 5 and 12 degrees. The deviation of the compass was consistent over the whole testing durations so the team is now looking at the possibility of allowing users to manually calibrate the compass. It is expected that for the usage of AR in professional maritime contexts, further development of existing AR tools and hardware is needed. Designers will also need to implement a user-centered design approach in order to create better interfaces and display technologies for enhanced solutions to aid navigation...|$|E

50|$|A compass {{installed}} in a vehicle or vessel has {{a certain amount of}} error caused by the magnetic properties of the vessel. This error is known as compass deviation. The magnitude of the compass deviation varies greatly depending upon the local anomalies created by the vessel. A fiberglass recreational vessel will generally have much less compass deviation then a steel hulled vessel. Electrical wires carrying current have a small magnetic field around them and can cause deviation. Any type of magnet, such as found in a speaker can also cause large magnitudes of <b>compass</b> deviation. The <b>error</b> can be corrected using a Deviation Table. Deviation Tables are very difficult to create. Once a deviation table is established, it is only good for that particular vessel, with that particular configuration. If electrical wires are moved or anything else magnetic (speakers, electric motors, etc.) are moved, the deviation table will change. All Deviations on the Deviation Table are indicated West or East. If the compass is pointing West of the Magnetic North Pole, then the Deviation is Westward. If the compass is pointing East of the Magnetic North Pole, then the Deviation is Eastward.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a system of}} asynchronous autonomous mobile robots that can move freely in a twodimensional plane with no agreement on a common coordinate system. Starting from any initial configuration, the robots are required to eventually gather at a single point, not fixed in advance (gathering problem). Prior work has shown that gathering oblivious (i. e., stateless) robots cannot be achieved deterministically without additional assumptions. In particular, if robots can detect multiplicity (i. e., count robots that share the same location) gathering is possible for three or more robots. Similarly, gathering of any number of robots is possible if the robots share a common direction, as given by <b>compasses,</b> with no <b>errors.</b> Our work is motivated by the pragmatic standpoint that (1) compasses are error-prone devices in reality, and (2) multiplicity detection, while being easy to achieve, allow gathering for situations with more than two robots. Consequently, this paper focusses on gathering two asynchronous robots equipped with inaccurate compasses. In particular, we provide a self-stabilizing algorithm to gather, in {{a finite number of}} steps, two oblivious robots equipped with compasses that can differ by as much as π/ 4. リサーチレポート（北陸先端科学技術大学院大学情報科学研究科...|$|R
40|$|Vikings {{routinely}} {{crossed the}} North Atlantic without amagnetic compass and left their mark on lands {{as far away}} as Greenland, Newfoundland and Baffin Island. Based on an eleventh-century dial fragment artefact, found at Uunartoq in Greenland, it is widely accepted that they sailed along chosen latitudes using primitive Sun compasses. Such instruments were tested on sea and proved to be efficient hand-held navigation tools, but the dimensions and incisions of the Uunartoq find are far from optimal in this role. On the basis of the sagasmentioning sunstones, incompatible hypotheses were formed for Viking solar navigation procedures and primitive skylight polarimetry with dichroic or birefringent crystals. We describe here a previously unconceived method of navigation based on the Uunartoq artefact functioning as a 'twilight board', which is a combination of a horizon board and a Sun compass optimized for use when the Sun is close to the horizon. We deduced an appropriate solar navigation procedure using a twilight board, a shadow-stick and birefringent crystals, which bring together earlier suggested methods in harmony and provide a true skylight compass function. This could have allowed Vikings to navigate around the clock, to use the artefact dial as a Sun compass during long parts of the day and to use skylight polarization patterns in the twilight period. In field tests, we found that true north could be appointed with such a medieval skylight <b>compass</b> with an <b>error</b> of about +/- 4 degrees when the artificially occluded Sun had elevation angles between + 10 degrees and - 8 degrees relative to the horizon.
