The railroad line was extended westward, until it reached the town of Nenana and a construction party working north from Ship Creek, later renamed Anchorage. Until the railroad was finished and coal from Healy became available, Fairbanks burned wood as a heating source and to provide electricity. In 1913, the town burned between 12,000 and 14,000 cords of wood, with the Northern <b>Commercial</b> <b>Company</b> (owners of the power plant) burning 8,500 cords alone.|$|E

But even as the walls of Wickersham's courthouse were going up, dissatisfied miners were leaving the area. Hundreds left on rafts going downriver or steamers going to Dawson City.

40|$|The {{absence of}} a Romanian legal {{definition}} {{of the concept of}} nullity of <b>commercial</b> <b>companies</b> arouses a lot of questions. The delimitation of this concept is very important for a correct establishment of its field of application. In other words, are the cases of nullity of <b>commercial</b> <b>companies</b> regulated only by Law no. 31 / 1990 or by the provisions of common law as well? Started {{from the fact that the}} nullity is not considered by the legislator a simple sanction applicable to the juridical acts but it affects directly the existence of the company and becomes a means to sanction the creation of a legal person by disregarding the imperative legal provisions, we analyzed firstly the Romanian (II) and the EU legal provisions regarding the nullity of <b>commercial</b> <b>companies.</b> The elements of this analyze helped us to qualify the nullity of <b>commercial</b> <b>companies</b> and its effect (III). Finally, through the conclusion formulated we hope to call the attention on the fact that a company, even created through the non-observance of the legal rules, can be viable from economic point of view and it is senseless to make it disappearance. nullity of commercial companies; nullity of juridical acts; absolute nullity; relative nullity; declaration of the <b>commercial</b> <b>company’s</b> nullity. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1850, California was in {{the midst}} of a gold rush; backed by this sudden demand for luxuries, New England {{companies}} made the first shipments, by ship to San Francisco and Sacramento, in California, including a shipment of refrigerated apples. The market was proved, but shipping ice in this way was expensive and demand outstripped supply. Ice began to be ordered instead from the then Russian-controlled Alaska in 1851 at $75 a ton (901kg). The American-Russian <b>Commercial</b> <b>Company</b> was subsequently formed in San Francisco in 1853 to work in partnership with the Russian-American Company of Alaska to supply ice to the west coast of America. The Russian company trained Aleutian teams to harvest ice in Alaska, built saw-mills to produce insulating saw-dust and shipped the ice south along with supplies of chilled fish. The costs of this operation remained high and M. Tallman founded the rival Nevada Ice Company, which harvested ice on Pilot Creek and transported to Sacramento, bringing the west coast price for ice down to seven cents ($2) a pound (0.5kg).|$|E
5|$|The Russian-American Company (RAC) was {{incorporated}} in 1799, {{putting an end}} to the promyshlenniki period and beginning an era of centralized monopoly. Its charter was laid out in a 1799 ukase by the new Tsar Paul, which granted the company monopolistic control over trade in the Aleutian Islands and the North America mainland, south to 55° north latitude (approximating the present border on coast between British Columbia and Alaska). The RAC was modeled on Britain's East India Company (EIC) and Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). Russian officials intended the company to operate both as a business enterprise and a state organization for extending imperial influence, similar to the EIC and HBC. It was also hoped that the company would be able to conduct maritime trade with China and Japan, although this goal was not realized. In 1818 the Russian government took control of the RAC from the merchants who held the charter. The explorer and naval officer Ferdinand Petrovich von Wrangel was the first president of the company during the government period. In 1867, the Alaska Purchase transferred control of Alaska to the United States and the commercial interests of the Russian American Company were sold to Hutchinson, Kohl & Company of San Francisco, who then merged with several other groups to form the Alaska <b>Commercial</b> <b>Company.</b>|$|E

It is worth noting that joint ventures are. presently one of new forms of state enterprises. They have to operate in a form of companies on the grounds of Polish trade law 7. The opinimi is expressed in the article that the Act of Sept. 30, 1981 on workers' self-management in state enterprise is not in force de lege lata in sstate joint ventures (<b>commercial</b> <b>companies).</b> Adopting a contrary opinion would make essential legal norms of the Self-Management Act collide with norms of commercial code regulating <b>commercial</b> <b>companies.</b> It can be proved by comparing the key competence matters of partners' assembly in limited liability company with lay down competence of workers' council. The opinion of indispensable future changes of legislation was also expressed, they should be aiming at appointing institution of workers' self-management in joint ventures (<b>commercial</b> <b>companies).</b> Some examples of foreign regulation prove that workers' self-management can also function in <b>commercial</b> <b>companies.</b> Be lege ferenda, representatives of workers' management have to be introduced to supervisory boards of <b>commercial</b> <b>companies,</b> the scope of their competence should be considerably extended then.
