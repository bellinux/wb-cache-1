50|$|Glass <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes</b> can be {{used with}} most solvents, but tend to be more expensive. They can be cleaned like other {{laboratory}} glassware, and can be sterilized by autoclaving. They must be handled with care, since small scratches can cause failure under the strong forces imposed during a run. Glass tubes are inserted into soft rubber sleeves to cushion them during runs. Plastic <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes,</b> especially tend to be less expensive and, with care, can be just as durable as glass. Water is preferred when plastic <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes</b> are used. They are more difficult to clean thoroughly, and are usually inexpensive enough to be considered disposable.|$|R

30|$|The {{different}} {{concentrations of}} the silver nanoparticle solution were fabricated by increasing the concentration {{of the silver}} nanoparticle solution from 1  mM to 0.1  M by centrifugation. Centrifugation was conducted at 9, 000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 5  min in 10 -mL <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes.</b> The water was extracted from the <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes</b> using a pipette, leaving aqueous-based Ag nanoparticle paste at the bottom. Shock the tube to make the nanoparticle paste back into suspension, then collect {{the rest of the}} solution for the next centrifugation. Repeat this process until the required concentration solution was obtained.|$|R
30|$|Soil {{samples were}} {{collected}} in sterile 50  ml <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes</b> from the Lunsu water body situated in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, India. The Lunsu water body is 10  km from Kangra railway station and located at the longitude of 76.1667362 and latitude of 32.0067136. The literal meaning of “luun” is salt in local language, and hence named Lunsu. Soil sample (~ 5  g) was collected from water body site and mixed with 5  ml of 2  × LB medium containing 3 % NaCl and incubated at 30 °C for 3  days, with intermittent mixing for the enrichment of halophilic bacteria. For estimation of salts in Lunsu water, water sample was collected in sterile 50  ml <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Laboratory microcosms {{were used}} to: i) measure {{the effects of}} soil {{moisture}} on survival of Steinernema riobravis and ii) investigate the suitability of using microcosms to study motility and survival of these nematodes. Nematodes recovered from soil contained in petri dishes declined by more than 95 % during 7 days, whereas nematodes recovered from the inner surfaces of dishes increased 35 -fold. After 7 days in dishes, > 20 times as many nematodes were recovered from dish surfaces than from soil. Nematodes exhibited a negative geotropism; greater numbers of nematodes were recovered from the lid surfaces than from the surfaces of dishes. Survivorship of nematodes in soil in plastic <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes</b> was somewhat greater than in petri dishes, and fewer nematodes ascended above the soil line in tubes than dishes. Downward migration of nematodes was inversely related to soil column diameter, possibly due to relatively unimpeded movement along container surfaces. An assay was developed by which nematodes were rinsed from the inner surfaces of <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes</b> into the soil. The resulting slurry was then processed on Baermann trays to recover motile nematodes. Nematode survival in soil in <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes</b> was higher at soil moistures between 2 - 4 % than at lower (0. 5 - 1. 0 %) and higher (4. 0 - 12. 0 %) moisture levels. Survival of S. riobravis may be enhanced by quiescence induced by moisture deficits...|$|R

30|$|Once the {{reaction}} was complete, the fluid {{was removed from the}} reactor, emptied into 50 -mL <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes,</b> and <b>centrifuged</b> using an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany 22339) for 10 min at 11, 000 rpm. The clear supernatant liquid was discarded and a solution of 50 / 50 semiconductor grade methanol (99.9 %, Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA 01835, USA) and de-ionized water was added to the <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes</b> in order to remove sodium chloride and the surfactant from the surfaces of the particles. These tubes were shaken vigorously for 5 min. A second methanol/water wash and a final methanol wash were applied on the powders while decanting the supernatant after each centrifugation. The copper powders were then placed in a vacuum dessicator for 2 to 3 days. Once dry, the powders were ground by hand using a mortar and pestle.|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} continues {{by making}} a continuous sucrose gradient of continuously-variable density in a <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tube.</b> At the concentrations used (15-45% in the example), sucrose does not disrupt the association of ribosomes and mRNA.

5000|$|All {{biochemical}} tests {{come under}} chemical pathology. These are performed on {{any kind of}} body fluid, but mostly on serum or plasma. Serum is the yellow watery part of blood that is left after blood {{has been allowed to}} clot and all blood cells have been removed. This is most easily done by centrifugation, which packs the denser blood cells and platelets {{to the bottom of the}} <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tube,</b> leaving the liquid serum fraction resting above the packed cells. This initial step before analysis has recently been included in instruments that operate on the [...] "integrated system" [...] principle. Plasma is in essence the same as serum, but is obtained by centrifuging the blood without clotting. Plasma is obtained by centrifugation before clotting occurs. The type of test required dictates what type of sample is used.|$|E
30|$|RGOS and GOS powder {{purchased}} from Nanjing XFNano Materials Technology Company (Nanjing, China) {{were used for}} the preparation of suspension. Five milligrams of RGOS powder was dispersed in 100 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The mixture was then ultrasonicated for 4 h. After nature sedimentation for 4 h at room temperature, the supernatant of solution was centrifuged at 1, 000 rpm for 30 min to precipitate higher density aggregates. The supernatant in the <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes</b> was collected and used for the DEP assembly. The GOS were dispersed in de-ionized (DI) water via ultrasonication [14]. Five milligrams of GO powder was added into 100 ml of DI water. The mixture was then ultrasonicated for 2 h. The supernatant solution was then centrifuged at 1, 000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant in the <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tubes</b> was preserved for the DEP assembly.|$|R
30|$|The {{intracellular}} GSH redox-responsiveness of Cur/TPP-oHA-S-S-Cur micelles {{was evaluated}} using the dialysis method.

40|$|The {{viscosity}} of a fluid can {{be measured}} by observing the motion of a probe sphere (or ball) in a <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tube</b> filled with this fluid. The hydrodynamic behavior of the probe ball moving in the <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tube</b> has been solved theoretically. We have got the universal relationship (for balls of a given material and size in a given tube) between the terminal ball velocity, the fluid viscosity and the centrifuge acceleration using the only adjustable parameter — the rotational friction coefficient between the ball and the tube. The rotation of the <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tube</b> in the horizontal plane induces an inertia force which is counterbalanced by the friction force acting on the ball. As a result, the ball moves along the tube with some characteristic speed, which {{is a measure of}} the viscosity of the fluid. This speed was calculated in the lubrication approximation. The gravitational acceleration causes the ball to move very close to the bottom of the <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tube.</b> In this situation, the gravity is balanced by a “levitation” force introduced and calculated in the present paper. The origin of this force is the formation of the “bubble” behind and below the moving ball. The theoretical development on the terminal velocity for the ball moving very near the bottom of the horizontal <b>centrifuge</b> <b>tube</b> is tested by using a specially designed centrifuge for two types of balls and a wide set of viscosity standards. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment suggests that we have developed a new approach to measure high viscosities of fluids at low shear rates which might be especially useful for the investigation of polymer melts...|$|E
