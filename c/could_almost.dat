5|$|After Crisis Cores release, Kitase {{expressed}} {{surprised at}} {{the quality of the}} cutscenes, {{to the point where he}} felt it <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be a PlayStation 2 game. He also enjoyed the game's ending, surprised by how moving Zack's story became.|$|E

Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.|$|E

25|$|Usually {{debatable}} decisions {{work out}} fairly evenly over a Test rubber, but {{weight of evidence}} suggests that the umpires were mistaken in giving Bradman not out caught for 28 in the First Test, Edrich out leg-before-wicket for 89 in the Third Test, and Washbrook out caught behind the wicket for 39 in the Fourth Test. These decisions came at such points in England's bids to gain an advantage that they <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be termed turning-points of the three games.|$|E
25|$|But as fame {{of their}} unbeaten status spread, {{so did the}} status of their haka. At the {{beginning}} of their 22nd game in Wales at Llanelli, we read On the appearance of the men in red, 'Sosban Fach' was sung with great enthusiasm. Nepia then led the All Blacks in their famous war dance, which was very impressive. One <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> hear a pin drop while it was rendered. The crowd again sang 'Sosban Fach' in reply.|$|E

25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. I felt the rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E
25|$|After Manet's {{death the}} two {{pictures}} hung {{on either side}} of the 1877 painting Jean-Baptiste Faure in the Role of Hamlet. From this arrangement Stoichiţă concludes that the choice of this Spanish influenced painting was meant to evoke a renewed parallel to Velázquez. Another message derived from the juxtaposition is that the self-portraits <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be read as Manet in the Role of Manet. Juliet Wilson-Bareau, however, points out that Manet probably did not intend the pictures to be so displayed, as it was Léon Leenhoff who had the pictures framed and hung them {{on either side of}} the Faure portrait.|$|E
25|$|At Modon, Geoffrey {{entered into}} an {{alliance}} with a Greek archon (nobleman) from Messenia to conquer {{as much of the}} western Peloponnese as they <b>could.</b> <b>Almost</b> immediately afterward, however, the Greek died, and his son broke off the alliance. It was at this point that Geoffrey learned of the appearance of King Boniface I of Thessalonica (1204–1207) with his army before Nauplia (now Nafplion, Greece). He determined to seek aid and rode up early in 1205 to join the king. He was well received by Boniface I who would have retained Geoffrey in his service. But in the camp at Nauplia, Geoffrey found his good friend William of Champlitte and offered to the latter to share the conquest of the Peloponnese. His friend accepted the offer and the two also received royal permission for their expedition.|$|E

25|$|In Pakistan, stamp {{programmes}} are not {{issued in}} advance. Earlier, collectors <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> {{always count on}} stamps being issued {{on at least two}} dates: 23 March and 14 August. However, in recent years, the 23 March issues have become less frequent. The number of stamps issue per year also varies. However, no matter how many issues are released, their total cost rarely exceeds Rs. 300/- (approx USD 5). Besides postage stamps and souvenir sheets, the post office also sells first day covers, leaflets with and without stamps on it and postal stationery. Earlier, the post office did not use any specific numbering system but this changed when they started using a rather simple system on their leaflets: xxxx – y where xxxx is the year and y is the issue number within that year. All major catalogues include Pakistani stamps in them. Two local updated catalogues are available, each of which uses its own system of numbering.|$|E

That's a horrifying image to throw at a little kid. You really <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> think that your talking in line, say, was on a par with killing Jesus." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to shared {{technology}} and similar gameplay conventions, critics often compared Elite Forces multiplayer {{to that in}} , with varied opinions. For their part, Raven Software stated that so little had been fundamentally changed that the multiplayer <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be labeled as a modification of Quake III. Game Revolution commented that the multiplayer felt more refined than that in Quake III and innovative {{in its attempt to}} mimic a holodeck, and while Eurogamer agreed with the latter, criticisms were directed towards the gameplay seeming [...] "very slow and unexciting". However, other reviewers disagreed; IGN described the multiplayer as [...] "a solid experience", and GamePro expressed that it helped compensate for the short length of the single-player campaign.|$|E
500|$|In his 1966 {{analysis}} of the project's economic feasibility, Michael Brewer refuted the conclusions of the 1962 federal study, saying that {{the ability of the}} dam to pay for itself was [...] "an exercise in speculation". He also wrote that even if the dam was built and cheap electricity made available, [...] "Alaska did not possess a competitive advantage". He concluded by saying that the project was [...] "not economically efficient". Because of arguments like these, the common belief among informed observers outside Alaska was that the project was designed to benefit Alaska alone, and thus <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be considered [...] "foreign aid." [...] An editorial in The New York Times summed up non-Alaska opinions when it asked if the dam project was [...] "the world's biggest boondoggle".|$|E

500|$|A 1997 {{review in}} Salon {{stated that the}} novel <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be {{described}} as propaganda, and was terrifying as a result, particularly in its belief that the boot camp had to be an ingredient of any civilization. This {{was described as a}} highly unusual utopian vision. [...] Moorcock stated that the lessons Rico learns in boot camp: [...] "wars are inevitable, [...] that the army is always right". In discussing the book's utility in classroom discussions of the form of government, Alan Myers stated that its depiction of the military was of an [...] "unashamedly Earth-chauvinist nature". In the words of science fiction scholar Darko Suvin, Starship Troopers was an [...] "unsubtle but powerful black-and-white paean to combat life", and an example of agitprop in favor of military values.|$|E
500|$|From July 1991 until 1999, {{a series}} of Boddingtons {{advertisements}} created by the Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH) agency used [...] "The Cream of Manchester" [...] tagline. The campaign, credited with revitalising the image of Manchester, was arguably third behind Manchester United and Coronation Street in raising the city's profile. Originally a set of print advertisements, the campaign was extended to television in 1992. The television advertisements featured beautiful women with unlikely Mancunian accents and [...] "achieved the seemingly impossible task of making bitter glamorous". The most famous television advertisement featured a glamorous couple on-board gondolas on Manchester's River Irwell, in a parody of a well-known [...] "just one Cornetto" [...] ice cream advertisement. According to the Manchester Evening News, [...] "it told the world something about the reinvention of the murky old city, that its once-filthy waterway <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> pass for Venice." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Darwin's {{studies at}} the University of Cambridge {{included}} two other texts by Paley, and in his final exams in January 1831 he did well in questions on these texts. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired [...] "a burning zeal" [...] to research natural history. After the Beagle voyage he began development of his theory of natural selection, and in 1838 opened a notebook listing [...] "books to be read", including [...] "Paley's Nat. Theology". In 1859, on completing On the Origin of Species, he told a friend [...] "I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> formerly have said it by heart." ...|$|E
