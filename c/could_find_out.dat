5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1943, Alvarez {{returned}} to the United States with an offer from Robert Oppenheimer to work at Los Alamos on the Manhattan project. But Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the University of Chicago working with Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General Leslie Groves asked Alvarez {{to think of a}} way that the US <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> if the Germans were operating any nuclear reactors, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly xenon 133. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring fission products for intelligence gathering. It would become extremely important after the war.|$|E

Philip convinces Diana and Stephen {{that he has a}} job assisting Lily with her memoirs, and that he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what Lily intends to say in her book. Shrewdly, Diana agrees to hire Gilbert, Philip and Claire to write her new film while Philip spies on Lily.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, Geoff Johns {{announced}} that Lex Luthor and Captain Cold would be joining the Justice League. In {{the wake of}} the Crime Syndicate's invasion, public opinion of Lex Luthor was incredibly favorable, and he decided that he liked it. Another reason was he believed the entity that destroyed the Earth from the alternate universe which the Crime Syndicate came from was the larger threat and might eventually become a threat to their universe and wanted the Justice League to be prepared for that possibility beforehand. In an effort to continue being regarded as a hero, he tried to convince the Justice League to recruit him, but was initially unsuccessful. The Justice League eventually talked about how Luthor was going to keep on his crusade with or without the help of the Justice League. They let Luthor join the Justice League knowing he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> information that could put all of them in danger, but Batman figured at least they could keep a close watch on Luthor and LexCorp, and much to the chagrin of Superman, Luthor secured a place in the Justice League, even building a new Watchtower for them and recruiting Shazam onto the team.|$|E

500|$|The jury's foreman assured Robert Dudley in {{a letter}} of his own that for all they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out,</b> it {{appeared}} to be an accident. Dudley, desperately seeking to avert damage from what he called [...] "my case", was relieved to hear the impending outcome, but thought [...] "another substantial company of honest men" [...] should undertake a further investigation [...] "for more knowledge of truth". This panel should include any available friends of Lady Amy's and her half-brothers John Appleyard and Arthur Robsart, both of whom he had ordered to Cunmor immediately after Amy's death. Nothing came of this proposal.|$|E
500|$|The {{appearance}} of Molyneux's globes {{had a significant}} influence on the culture of his time. In Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors, written between 1592 and 1594, one of the protagonists, Dromio of Syracuse, compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe: [...] "No longer {{from head to foot}} than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> countries in her." [...] The jest gained its point from the publication of the globes; Shakespeare may even have seen them himself. Elizabethan dramatist Thomas Dekker wrote in one of his plays published in The Gull's Horn-book (1609): ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} week, Jackson and Presley had another argument. Newspaper reports had been {{suggesting}} that if Elvis were alive, {{he would not}} approve of his daughter's marriage. Annoyed, Jackson reportedly suggested that the couple <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> by holding a séance to contact the deceased [...] "King of Rock 'n' Roll". During the session they would ask his opinion of the union. Presley felt the idea was tasteless and, upon Jackson's continuing to push the idea, warned, [...] "If you stay on this particular road, they're gonna need a medium to contact you in the Great Beyond, because I'm about to put you there, right now." [...] The two supposedly never spoke of the incident again.|$|E

2500|$|At this time, French Captain Hugues {{appeared}} out of {{the mist}} with a flag of truce and was taken to Hohenlohe. Hugues spun [...] "a wonderful tissue of lies", claiming that Murat had 30,000 troops at hand and that Lannes with 60,000 more lurked {{on the road to}} Stettin. He insisted that the Prussian general surrender, which Hohenlohe refused to do. However, he sent his chief of staff Oberst Christian Karl August Ludwig von Massenbach back with Hugues, apparently to see what he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Macovei and General Prosecutor Kövesi {{defended the}} {{measures}} {{by stating that}} investigators would {{not have access to}} the actual content of records or conversations without warrants, but rather access to information on telephone and electronic traffic. [...] This meant investigators <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> with whom or how an individual communicated, but not what was said. Macovei said that the Romanian government obtained the technology to conduct his type of monitoring with financial support from the U.S. [...] PD President Emil Boc stated on the Romanian talk show Naşul that President Băsescu recommended that Macovei pass the emergency ordinances.|$|E

2500|$|Orville Gilley's {{testimony}} at Patterson's Decatur retrial was a mild sensation. He denied being a [...] "bought witness," [...] repeating his testimony about armed blacks ordering the white teenagers off the train. He confirmed Price's rape account, {{adding that he}} stopped the rape by convincing the [...] "negro" [...] with the gun to make the rapists stop [...] "before they killed that woman." [...] Leibowitz cross-examined him at length about contradictions between his account and Price's testimony, but he remained [...] "unruffled." [...] Gilley testified to meeting Lester Carter and the women the evening before the alleged rapes, and getting them coffee and sandwiches.

2500|$|The SS Roamar was {{the next}} to be sunk. A 110-ton schooner, the Roamar belonged to a Colombian diplomat, and her sinking off San Andres by [...] on July 21, 1942, gave Colombia the {{political}} grounds to declare war on Germany. The Germans knew that Colombia was still neutral at this time, so they opted to sink the Roamar quickly, before anybody <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out.</b> Accordingly, the Germans fired only two shots before the ship was reduced to [...] "nothing but splintered debris." [...] U-505s engineer, Hans Goebeler, said the following about the incident: [...] "We couldn't leave the evidence [...] floating around, so we sank her with the deck gun." [...] This was not the last ship sunk by the Germans during Colombia's neutrality period. On the very next day, the U-505 sank the 153-ton Urious in the same area, killing thirteen of the Colombian sailors on board.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, {{a special}} finish was {{witnessed}} at the Stadium as Alexander Vasquez outdueled twenty {{of his peers}} to win a field sprint. 1981 saw the arrival of Alpheus Williams, a precocious youngster who {{would go on to}} win three Classics before leaving Belize in 1985. Teammate Lindy Gillett set a record and became the youngest winner of a Classic at 18 in 1983; Robert Mossiah and Matthew Smiling took titles in 1985 and 1986, respectively. But in 1987, cyclists from the United States imported by Belizean team owners would {{put an end to the}} homegrown dominance. Ward Zauner broke Gillett's record in his 1987 win; Steve Steward and David Licker swept the top positions in 1988, and Frank [...] "Mac" [...] McCannon took the roses in 1989. These American winners rode a faster pace and were better sprinters, but Belizean sports fans figured they had the right person to beat them-if they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> who that was.|$|E

2500|$|Still, a {{happy ending}} is needed, and the Chairman asks the {{audience}} to choose two lovers from among the remaining cast members. The two chosen members declare their love, and then reprise [...] "Perfect Strangers". Just then, there comes a noise from the crypt, and a very-much-alive Edwin Drood appears, ready to tell all what really happened {{on the night of}} his disappearance ("The Writing On The Wall"). What happened was that when Drood was attacked, he was only stunned when he fell and not killed. Jasper dragged him to a crypt where he left him. When Drood woke, he escaped and fled from Cloisterham, only returning so that he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> who wanted him dead. He sings to the audience, eventually joined {{by the rest of the}} cast, imploring them to hold on to life for as long as they possibly can and telling them that 'holding on to life is all.' The mystery is solved, and the show concludes as the cast sings to the audience to read the writing on the wall.|$|E

2500|$|In 823, {{tensions}} {{had appeared}} in Harald's relations with his co-rulers. Louis was asked to mediate. The Royal Annals report [...] "Also Heriold came from Nordmannia, asking for help against the sons of Godofrid, who threatened to drive {{him out of his}} country. To explore this matter more thoroughly Counts Theothari and Hruodmund were sent to the sons of Godofrid. Traveling ahead of Heriold they carefully studied the dispute with the sons of Godofrid as well as the condition of the whole kingdom of the Norsemen and informed the emperor of all they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> in these lands. They returned with archbishop Ebo of Rheims, who had gone to preach {{in the land of the}} Danes on the counsel of the emperor and with the approval of the Roman pontiff and had baptized many converts to the faith during the previous summer." [...] Coupland notes that the entry reveals two things. First that [...] "the political situation in Denmark remained extremely tense" [...] and second that Louis continued to interfere in Danish affairs. The motivation behind his interest in the country is not stated in primary sources. The book [...] "An Introduction to the Viking History of Western Europe, Viking Antiquities in Great Britain and Ireland" [...] (1940) by Haakon Shetelig, presented the theory that Louis was laying the groundwork for a [...] "military invasion and occupation of Denmark". While the theory has its merits, Coupland notes that it ignores its context. The [...] "neighbouring Slav lands" [...] of Francia were in the process of becoming dependent territories, their rulers subordinating themselves to Louis. The emperor may have envisioned Denmark as another protectorate of Francia.|$|E
