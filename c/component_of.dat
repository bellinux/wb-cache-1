40|$|AbstractThe {{description}} of the intersections <b>of</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> a Springer fiber {{is a very complex}} problem. Up to now only two cases have been described completely. The complete picture for the hook case has been obtained by N. Spaltenstein and J. A. Vargas, and for two-row case by F. Y. C. Fung. They have shown in particular that the intersection of a pair <b>of</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> a Springer fiber is either irreducible or empty. In both cases all the components are non-singular and the irreducibility of the intersections is strongly related to the non-singularity. As it has been shown in J. Algebra 298 (2006) 1 – 4, a bijection between orbital varieties and <b>components</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding Springer fiber in GLn extends to a bijection between the irreducible <b>components</b> <b>of</b> the intersections of orbital varieties and the irreducible <b>components</b> <b>of</b> the intersections <b>of</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> Springer fiber preserving their codimensions. Here we use this bijection to compute the intersections <b>of</b> the irreducible <b>components</b> <b>of</b> Springer fibers for two-column case. In this case the components are in general singular. As we show the intersection <b>of</b> two <b>components</b> is non-empty. The main result of the paper is a necessary and sufficient condition for the intersection <b>of</b> two <b>components</b> <b>of</b> the Springer fiber to be irreducible in two-column case. The condition is purely combinatorial. As an application of this characterization, we give first examples <b>of</b> pairs <b>of</b> <b>components</b> with a reducible intersection having <b>components</b> <b>of</b> different dimensions...|$|R
