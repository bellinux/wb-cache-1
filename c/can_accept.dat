5|$|In {{the same}} year that Brønsted and Lowry {{published}} their theory, G. N. Lewis proposed an alternative theory of acid–base reactions. The Lewis theory is based on electronic structure. A Lewis base is defined as a compound that can donate an electron pair to a Lewis acid, a compound that <b>can</b> <b>accept</b> an electron pair. Lewis's proposal gives an explanation to the Brønsted–Lowry classification in terms of electronic structure.|$|E

Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities. The GLA consists of two elected components: the Mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and <b>can</b> <b>accept</b> or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year.|$|E

Alongside being able to fight enemies together, players can swap messages and exchange loot. There is also a Level Editor available, where players can access developer tools and create their own levels which can be shared with other players. The editor features {{a large amount of}} options for environment customization, including adjusting the shade of environmental elements like roads.|$|E

5|$|The {{night before}} the final battle, the player meets Morrigan, who proposes a way to slay the Archdemon without sacrificing anyone: the two conceiving a child. The child, also {{carrying}} the Taint, would merge with the Archdemon once it dies, creating a demonic essence which will spare any Grey Warden. Morrigan agrees to conceive the child, which would resultantly be born a demigod, {{on the condition that}} she be allowed to raise it alone.

5|$|To {{determine}} the equilibrium constant for this reaction, {{in which the}} ligand loses a proton, the pKa of the protonated ligand must be known. In practice, the ligand may be polyprotic; for example EDTA4− <b>can</b> <b>accept</b> four protons; in that case, all pKa values must be known. In addition, the metal ion is subject to hydrolysis, that is, it behaves as a weak acid, so the pK values for the hydrolysis reactions must also be known.|$|E
5|$|Australian Cattle Dogs {{have been}} {{successful}} in a range of dog sports including weight pulling, flyball and schutzhund. The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as canicross, disc dog, and skijoring or bikejoring. It is an effective hiking companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side. Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers. It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that <b>can</b> <b>accept</b> city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.|$|E

Every recursively enumerable language <b>can</b> be <b>accepted</b> by a network with three evolutionary processors: one substitution processor, one insertion processor and one output node. Also with insertion and deletion processors only (without substitution nodes), all recursively enumerable languages <b>can</b> be <b>accepted.</b> Then one insertion node, one deletion node and one output node are sufficient...|$|R

In this paper we solve this problem by proving that any language which <b>can</b> be <b>accepted</b> by a sequential multi-prover protocol <b>can</b> also be <b>accepted</b> by a single-round multi-party protocol, and thus the multi-prover round hierarchy collapses to its first level: MIP(poly) =MIP(1) =NEXP-time...|$|R
5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that <b>can</b> <b>accept</b> an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E

There was much outrage that two cabinet ministers had resorted to such a method, and they both felt compelled to resign from the government. Six months later, Canning published a full account of his actions in the affair, and many who had initially rallied to him became convinced Castlereagh had been betrayed by his cabinet colleague.|$|R
