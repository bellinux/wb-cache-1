25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri.

Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} {{from the}} electronic dance music elements presented in [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] and [...] "#thatPower", [...] "Fall Down" [...] leans towards an urban contemporary musical style.

500|$|Paul Lester of The Guardian {{described}} OutKast's lyrical style on {{the album}} by saying, [...] "They are, in a way, post-hip-hop, combining PM Dawn's kooky confections with the Pharcyde's hallucinatory whimsy, Public Enemy's hardline politicking with De La Soul's cartoon dementia, to fashion something vital and new." [...] The album commonly features the words [...] "stank" [...] and [...] "smell" [...] in their blues definition to mean [...] "low-down, blunt, pungent: a measure of authenticity". The group often incorporates word play into the lyrics, including references to the [...] "underground smellroad" [...] and chants of [...] "I stank I can, I stank I can", an allusion to The Little Engine That Could. [...] The song [...] "Red Velvet" [...] discusses the materialistic nature of the hip-hop scene. [...] "Humble Mumble" [...] addresses critics who make negative assumptions about hip-hop based on preconceived notions; André 3000 raps in the song: [...] "I met a critic/I made her shit her draws/She said she thought hip-hop was only guns and alcohol/I said oh hell naw/but yet it's that too/You can't discrima-hate <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> done read a book or two." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Amor Puro" [...] (Pure Love) is {{in a minor}} key with romantic lyrics, {{a string}} {{ensemble}} and techno synthesizers. Its lyrics focus {{on the meaning of}} true love. Queen sings: [...] "Pure love does not fight, it does not hurt you, love that is pure does not <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> to fall", and described the song as [...] "an honest statement of what love is". [...] "I Do" [...] is a minor-key, mid-tempo pop and R power ballad built on a handclapped rhythm and piano. Lyrically, the song is a message to men and women; Queen sings: [...] "My ladies, if you know better, if he loves you, let him come back. My fellas, if you love her, don't let nothing hold you back, run out and look for her". Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat. According to an editor for iTunes, the song [...] "puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad, complete with English lyrics and Auto-Tuned vocal." [...] The minor-key [...] "Acércate" [...] (Get Closer) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers; it has been described as [...] "pure reggaeton". The song was praised for the presence of Wisin & Yandel and its hook. Queen previously collaborated with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album, La Revolución (2009), with [...] "Perfecto" [...] (which also featured Yaviah).|$|E
500|$|It is an R {{song with}} {{elements}} of electro. Lyrically, Carey is recounting a past relationship which fell into [...] "violent times", {{and how she}} still deals {{with the effects of}} what she experienced. Carey begins with the line [...] "I was a girl/ You were ‘the man'/ I was too young to understand/ I was naïve /Believing everything you told me." [...] Although Carey never mentions Mottola's name, many critics believed that she was addressing him directly in the lines [...] "Shining like a chandelier/ That decorated every room inside/ The private hell we built", [...] "Sleeping with the enemy, aware that he was smothering every last part of me" [...] and [...] "Said you were strong/ Protecting me/ Then I found out that you were weak/ Keepin' me there, under your thumb/ <b>Cause</b> <b>you</b> were scared that I'd become much/ More than you could handle." [...] After confessing that she would [...] " [...] up scared some nights, still dreaming about the violent times," [...] Carey decides {{to walk away from the}} relationship, and declares [...] "but I still live with the side effects". J. Freedom De Luc of The Washington Post likened the [...] "echoing" [...] repetition of [...] "Side effects" [...] to that of Rihanna's on her 2007 single [...] "Umbrella". In an interview with Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, Carey explained why she felt compelled to write the song: ...|$|E

500|$|Similar {{to most of}} {{the songs}} from Light Years, [...] "Spinning Around" [...] is a [...] "string-laden" [...] dance-pop track with {{prominent}} influences from disco music. According to the sheet music of the song published by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of F minor and features a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of C5. Addressing the theme of reinvention, the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes; it contains lines like [...] "I'm spinning around/Move out of my way... I'm not the same" [...] and [...] "Mistakes that I made have given me the strength to really believe." [...] In an analysis of the lyrics of the song, Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them, in the line [...] "I know you're feelin me <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> like it like this." [...] The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like [...] "Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe." [...] The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The bridge of the song features the repetition of the hook [...] "You know you like it like this," [...] with Minogue's voice being vocoded. Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing Impossible Princess in 1997 was not the best decision.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is quite dark and mysterious, {{as much of it}} is often {{interpreted}} to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album's lyrics, Thayil said that [...] "a lot of Superunknown {{seems to me to be}} about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicing—like the Druids : 'Life is good, but death's gonna be even better!" [...] Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are [...] "a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to 'leave us alone. Cornell stated that [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] is about [...] "crawling back to the womb to die", [...] "Fell on Black Days" [...] is about realizing [...] "you're unhappy in the extreme", [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is about a [...] "surreal dreamscape", [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is a [...] "'shame-on-decadence' song", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] is about [...] "trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive", and [...] "4th of July" [...] is about using LSD. Cornell talked about [...] "Mailman" [...] at a concert saying, [...] "This next one is about killing your boss. It's about coming to work early one morning <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> have a special agenda and you're going to shoot him in the fucking head." [...] Conversely, [...] "Like Suicide" [...] was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house. He found the severely injured animal and killed it, hitting it with a brick to end its suffering.|$|E
500|$|... "Cruise Control", {{featuring}} reggae artist Damian Marley, {{is influenced}} by R and reggae, and finds her adapting to the genre by imitating Jamaican phrases, accents and styles of singing. [...] "I Stay in Love" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from the album. Written by Carey and Bryan-Michael Cox, is a mid-tempo [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that {{is influenced by}} pop and RB& music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. Its lyrics find Carey as her most vulnerable; she describes old times she shared with her lover, and that even though [...] "we said let go", and [...] "inside she knows it's over", she still [...] "stays in love with him". Featuring American rapper Young Jeezy, [...] "Side Effects" [...] describes Carey's abusive relationship with Tommy Mottola, her ex-husband. During the first verse, she discusses the pair's background, and how {{she was young and}} naive, and believed everything he preached to her. The lyrics read [...] "Keepin' me there, under your thumb / <b>Cause</b> <b>you</b> were scared that I'd become much / More than you could handle," [...] she confesses, and refers to herself as [...] "Shining like a chandelier / That decorated every room inside / The private hell we built / And I dealt with it / Like a kid I wished / I could fly away." [...] Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe described it as [...] "another look at her fractious marriage to Mottola", and wrote [...] "Although the union ended in 1998, Carey is still suffering, including dreams of the 'violent times' and 'sleeping with the enemy'. Interestingly, her vocal approach here is almost emo, as she hits her rock-solid middle register and refuses to be held captive by the demons of her past."

2500|$|An early {{interpretation}} of verse 3:55 (specifically [...] "I will <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> {{to die and}} raise you to myself"), Al-Tabari (d. 923) records an interpretation attributed to Ibn 'Abbas, who used the literal [...] "I will <b>cause</b> <b>you</b> to die" [...] (mumayyitu-ka) {{in place of the}} metaphorical mutawaffi-ka [...] "Jesus died", while Wahb ibn Munabbih, an early Jewish convert, is reported to have said [...] "God caused Jesus, son of Mary, to die for three hours during the day, then took him up to himself." [...] Tabari further transmits from Ibn Ishaq: [...] "God caused Jesus to die for seven hours", while at another place reported that a person called Sergius was crucified in place of Jesus. Ibn-al-Athir forwarded the report that it was Judas, the betrayer, while also mentioning the possibility it was a man named Natlianus.|$|E
