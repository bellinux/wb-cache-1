2500|$|Final {{treatment}} {{of iron and}} steel products before onward sale into manufacturing includes pickling in strong mineral acid to remove rust and prepare the surface for tin or <b>chromium</b> <b>plating</b> or for other surface treatments such as galvanisation or painting. [...] The two acids commonly used are hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. Wastewaters include acidic rinse waters together with waste acid. Although many plants operate acid recovery plants (particularly those using hydrochloric acid), where the mineral acid is boiled away from the iron salts, there remains a large volume of highly acid ferrous sulfate or ferrous chloride to be disposed of. Many steel industry wastewaters are contaminated by hydraulic oil, also known as soluble oil.|$|E
2500|$|Since 819 {{was built}} during World War II, some {{materials}} were in short supply. The Cotton Belt emblems, {{which would have}} normally been made of brass, were made of steel to save brass for the war effort. Decorative emblems, numbers, etc., were also made of steel and <b>chromium</b> <b>plating</b> was entirely eliminated. Work on the new L1 Northerns began on Tuesday June 2, 1942. But delivery of the boilers from the Baldwin Locomotive Works lagged. The five new boilers were shipped by Baldwin to Pine Bluff between November 5 and December 12, 1942. The rail journey from Philadelphia to Pine Bluff took about five days for each boiler. Work by the Cotton Belt shop forces took an additional five or six weeks to complete each new locomotive.|$|E

2500|$|BSA {{manufactured}} a {{range of}} bicycles from utility roadsters through to racing bicycles. The BSA range of Sports bicycles expanded in the 1930s following the granting of a patent for a new lighter design of seat lug in 1929 and tandems were introduced into the BSA bicycle range as well. BSA {{had a reputation for}} quality and durability and their components were more expensive that either Chater-Lea or Brampton. [...] BSA launched a high end club cyclists machine in the early 1930s initially branded as the [...] "Super-eeze". Never slow to avail of publicity BSA sponsored the great Australian cyclist Hubert Opperman [...] and re-branded the top of the range machine the [...] "Opperman" [...] model. [...] A less expensive range of clubman lightweight machines was introduced from 1936 with the [...] "Cyclo" [...] 3 speed derailleur equipped [...] "Clubman". Subtle changes were made to the range, most models being equipped with [...] "Russ" [...] patent forks [...] and some models were made for only two seasons. This all stopped around September 1939 with the outbreak of war. A revised catalogue with a much reduced range was issued in March 1940 which also saw the launch of the BSA [...] "Streamlight" [...] model. [...] A novel all white bicycle [...] was produced for the blackout but had disappeared from a severely reduced bicycle range the details of which were circulated to dealers from December 1941. BSA had ceased production of their 3 speed hub gear in 1939 and production appears to have started again by 1945 although with a black finish instead of <b>chromium</b> <b>plating.</b> [...] BSA bought Sunbeam in 1943 and produced Sunbeam bicycles using up existing frames and parts and using BSA components for the missing bits. [...] The first BSA produced Sunbeam catalogue was published in 1949 ...|$|E

50|$|Trivalent <b>{{chromium}}</b> <b>plating,</b> {{also known}} as tri-chrome, Cr+3, and chrome (III) plating, uses chromium sulfate or chromium chloride as the main ingredient. Trivalent <b>chromium</b> <b>plating</b> is an alternative to hexavalent chromium in certain applications and thicknesses (e.g. decorative plating).|$|E
50|$|It {{can occur}} as a dull brown or dark grey solid in two {{different}} crystalline forms: face centred cubic with formula CrH~2 or a close packed hexagonal solid with formula CrH~1.

40|$|Metallic {{coatings}} {{are produced}} for various purposes, and methods employed for testing their quality vary accordingly. Many tests {{have been developed}} {{in the past to}} determine the various properties of the coatings. Wear-resistance tests are commonly carried out on metallic deposits, plated specifically as a protection for the metal substrate against wear and erosion. A typical example is <b>chromium</b> <b>plated</b> on steel substrates...|$|R
50|$|The Mark 1 {{guns were}} {{upgraded}} to Marks 5 and 8 {{in the late}} 1930s. The Mark 5's have a larger chamber to permit larger charges and a new liner with a heavier taper carbon steel along with a liner locking ring and locking collar. The Mark 8, similar to the Mark 5, had a uniform rifling with a <b>chromium</b> <b>plated</b> bore for increased life.|$|R
50|$|The metal saws and files, in {{addition}} to the special case hardening, are also subjected to a hard <b>chromium</b> <b>plating</b> process so that iron and steel can also be filed and cut.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{mechanical}} strength of chromium base (electrolytic and plasma sprayed) coatings is studied for friction and wear applications in nuclear environment. Indentation, scratch, and wear testing results are compared. In particular intrinsic coating brittleness is investigated {{as a mechanism}} responsible for impact wear. Electrolytic, hard <b>chromium</b> <b>plate</b> has a wear resistance well below that of the spray coated specimens studied.

50|$|Despite {{the failure}} of the Mamod Meteor and Conqueror boats (1949-52) Malins Engineers {{introduced}} the ME1 (similar to the pre-war ME1 but with a vapourising spirit lamp) and the ME2 in 1958.These marine engines were supplied for fitment into model boats of about 24 in long. The manufacturer claimed about fifteen minutes of fast steaming per filling. The engines were finished in polished brass, <b>chromium</b> <b>plate</b> and red and green paint. A methylated spirit vapourising spirit lamp provided the heat source.|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of space environmental effects on LDEF thermal control coatings by the Materials Special Investigation Group is continuing. Analyses of chromic acid anodize, A 276 white paint, and Z 306 black paint were conducted, assessing performance as functions of environmental exposure.

50|$|Chrome plating (less {{commonly}} <b>chromium</b> <b>plating),</b> {{often referred}} to simply as chrome, is a technique of electroplating {{a thin layer of}} chromium onto a metal object. The chromed layer can be decorative, provide corrosion resistance, ease cleaning procedures, or increase surface hardness.

Test panels were exposed to these environments for 60, 36, and 13 months, respectively. The {{results of this study}} showed that no significant optical degradation occurred from exposure to either of these environments, although a considerable amount of corrosion occurred on the panels exposed to the seacoast environment. The rural and industrial atmosphere produced only a slight amount of corrosion on test panels...|$|R

40|$|A High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) {{separation}} {{method was}} developed to study and analyze a fluorinated polyether fluid which is promising liquid lubricant for future applications. This HPLC separation method was used in a preliminary study investigating the catalytic effect of various metal, metal alloy, and ceramic engineering materials {{on the degradation of}} this fluid in a dry air atmosphere at 345 C. Using a 440 C stainless steel as a reference catalytic material it was found that a titanium alloy and a <b>chromium</b> <b>plated</b> material degraded the fluorinated polyether fluid substantially more than the reference material...|$|R
50|$|One {{functional}} {{disadvantage of}} hexavalent <b>chromium</b> <b>plating</b> is low cathode efficiency, {{which results in}} bad throwing power. This means it leaves a non-uniform coating, with more on edges and less in inside corners and holes. To overcome this problem the part may be over-plated and ground to size, or auxiliary anodes may be used around the hard-to-plate areas.|$|E
50|$|The two World Wars and {{the growing}} {{aviation}} industry gave impetus to further developments and refinements including such processes as hard <b>chromium</b> <b>plating,</b> bronze alloy plating, sulfamate nickel plating, along with numerous other plating processes.

40|$|Chemical {{stripping}} is realised on <b>chromium</b> <b>plated</b> polymeric (ABS, for instance) or passivatable metallic (e. g. Al,Ti) substrates. The {{components of}} the plating are copper, nickel and chromium. Stripping is performed with an inorganic acid (preferably sulphuric) and hydrogen peroxide composition, and involves the oxidation and dissolution of copper and nickel, but not of chromium. Chromium is recovered as fine little metallic sheets whereas copper and nickel are recovered from the solution by chemical and/or electrochemical methods.
