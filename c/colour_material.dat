40|$|Economic {{systems and}} social {{relationships}} gain an increasing complexity in prehistoric periods. Despite their symbolic value and their informative potential in these issues, <b>colouring</b> <b>materials</b> (“ochre”, iron oxi(hydrxi) des, cinnabar, etc.) had received scant attention compare to obsidian, flint, metals or igneous rocks. Since the 2000 ’s, trace elemental analysis (PIXE, XRF, INAA, ICP-MS) and petrographic studies give keys to collect gitological and sourcing data.

The first step of the processing sequence, {{that is to say}} the acquisition of raw <b>colouring</b> <b>material,</b> is not well described and understood. Physico-chemical (SEM-EDS, XRD, TEM-EDX, µPIXE-µPIGE) and petrological analysis were carried out on the <b>colouring</b> <b>materials</b> excavated in the châtelperronian layers (40000 - 35000 B. P.) of the French site the Grotte du Renne in Arcy-sur-Cure. The Châtelperronian is one of the transitional techno-complexes, basically one of the last cultures made by Neanderthals in Europe. The physico-chemical data were related to the location of the <b>colouring</b> <b>materials</b> on the site, in association with exceptionally well preserved “hut” structures. It was thus possible to demonstrate that none of these materials, either red or black, was heated before being used, contrary to what had been assumed so far. The supply in <b>colouring</b> <b>materials</b> was as carefully organized as for mineral materials such as flint, for example; they were collected in different geological formations occasionally showing on the surface, close to the cave and at more than 30 km from the cave. The exploitation of these geological sites did not vary during the whole Châtelperronian period, and privileged materials which can easily be ground to powder. The set of colouring minerals from the Grotte du Renne reveals Neanderthals’ in-depth knowledge of mineral materials; they understood perfectly well their properties and qualities, and used them extensively, so that the raw <b>colouring</b> <b>material</b> was part of the livelihood and the Châtelperronian site must have been a literally dazzling sight, all red and black.

50|$|As a result, {{a special}} programme, Zoo Quest in Colour, was {{screened}} on BBC Four on 17 May 2016. 90 minutes in duration, the programme uses footage {{from the first}} three episodes, featuring the best footage from Zoo Quest trips to West Africa and South America. It also includes the best scenes from Zoo Quest for a Dragon, in which a komodo dragon was filmed in the wild for the first time. A few shots are in black and white, due to being filmed in low-light conditions on more sensitive black and white stock, and the programme also includes some of the framing black and white studio footage.

50|$|Signature {{elements}} are {{a series of}} toolkits used in creating and translating visual brand language. This includes <b>colour,</b> <b>material</b> and finish, logo, light, and sound. Research shows that elements of logo such as its shape, color, size, and design can profoundly affect how consumers interpret the brand. Even the angularity of a logo—whether the logo is visually angular or circular—can affect consumers interpretation and loyalty toward a brand. The way that colour communicates to audiences is known as colour psychology or Colour symbolism. Businesses utilise how colour communicates in order to both further establish brand personality and connect with the customer. For example, Starbucks uses the colours green and white in their logo. Green is a colour that is secure, natural, easygoing and relaxing. White is a colour that symbolizes goodness, purity, and sophistication. The Starbucks logo itself has {{stood the test of time}} by evolving with the company in direct relationship to their corporate identity. The center piece of their logo, the Siren, helps tie Starbucks to its traditional coffee roots in both Europe and Seattle. Another way Starbucks translates their visual brand language is through their stores atmosphere that is not only utilized by store design, but through music. Timothy Jones was the first to recognize that music could be used not only to highlight the Starbucks experience but to also further the brand image of Starbucks by supporting artists through Starbucks record label Hear Music.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Th is paper {{discusses}} {{design process}} as a creative activity along with conceptual correlations of the semiotics developed by Charles Sanders Peirce. Th e central aim {{of this paper is}} to examine one of the most important concepts in Peirce’s theory related to design praxis: the concept of abduction. Abduction is the driving force behind creation and a way of producing new ideas. Peirce’s original concept is fundamental in order to maintain constant commitment to innovation required by design. To transmit messages in a creative way it is more effi cient to intensely work with associations by similarity in order to obtain signs rich in information and analogies. Design communicates by all its constituent elements: shape, function, <b>colour,</b> <b>material,</b> technique, technology, etc. Th erefore, signs of design share peculiar values of artistic signs as well as those of communicative ones. Th e associated information is as much aesthetic (shape) as it is semantic (content). Th e appropriation of Peircean concepts contributes to the understanding of the creative process, which in turn is crucial for understanding new possibilities by means of design...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{and visual}} qualities of products, such as shape, <b>colour,</b> <b>material</b> and texture, are common outputs of an {{industrial}} designer's work. Among these, shape {{is perhaps the}} most influential characteristic in the user's perception of products. It is not surprising, therefore, that designers often focus on shape early in the process of product design. While various forms of 2 D and 3 D representations might be exploited, sketching forms a key technique in the generation and development of product shape. It allows ideas of shape to externalised and communicated. Perhaps more importantly, sketching can operate to assist individuals in the creative generation and development of shape. Central to this function is the capacity for sketches to display ambiguity. Design sketches of shape and form are a particularly interesting category of visual representations because perception and interpretation are bound together with creation and evaluation in the shape sketching process. This paper reviews the exploitation of ambiguity in design sketches. It also outlines a recent study at the Open University of the sketches of industrial designers. It suggests ambiguity has a vital role to play in the transformation of ideas and reveals how sketches present an ideal form of representational technique that is well matched to the cognitive processes of creative designing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the N. W. ‑Mediterranean area, {{exchange}} {{networks and}} social relationships gain an increasing complexity {{in the course}} of the Neolithic: varied goods diffuse in considerable quantities and distances. In particular, obsidian, Bedoulian and Oligocene flints, jadeite and eclogite are known to have been exchanged over long distances as shown by research that began thirty years ago. Surprisingly, the place of <b>colouring</b> <b>materials</b> (" ochre ", bauxite, cinnabar), naturally abundant in the Mediterranean Franco‑Italian area, has received scant attention despite their technical and symbolic value; very few is thus known on the ways of their procurement and on their geographic and geological origin. With this purpose, the study of <b>colouring</b> <b>materials</b> from both archaeological sites and putative sources was under‑ taken in the Liguro‑Provençal arch. Geological surveys were carried out in order to establish a reference collection of <b>colouring</b> <b>materials.</b> Their geological nature has been determined by a combination of complementary imaging, elemen‑ tary and structural techniques (petrography, SEM‑EDS, X‑ray diffraction). By this way, a wide range of raw materials was determined: Permian sandstones, Middle Cretaceous bauxites, Toar‑ cian or Hauterivian oolithic ironstone, Cretaceous oxidized marcasite and ferruginous rocks derived from weathered glauconitic limestones (in the same diagenesis conditions as Roussillon ochre). In addition, two archaeological series, from Early and Middle Neolithic, were investigated by same methods: those of Pendimoun (Castellar, France), a rock‑shelter site occupied by Impressa and Cardial groups (Early Neolithic: 5750 ‑ 5200 cal. BCE) and those of the open‑air site of Giribaldi (Nice, France) that belongs to Pre‑Chassey and formative stages of Chassey culture (Middle Neolithic: 4700 ‑ 4050 cal. BCE). The results compared to the frame of reference highlight two contrasting economic systems: one based on the procurement of local resources (Pendimoun) and the second one that shows a more complex acquisition network (Giribaldi). At Pendimoun which represents the colonization stages of the Early Neolithic, the <b>colouring</b> <b>materials</b> imported are varied and heterogeneous, but widespread in the rock‑shelter itself or in the close environment (less than 5 km) : oxidized marcasites, oolithic ironstone, goethitic calcareous rocks derived from glauconite. The sources are thus local and these results have to be considered in the context of an occupation assigned to specific functions (agriculture, pottery, sheep pen), as previously shown by other data. At Giribaldi, <b>colouring</b> <b>materials</b> assemblage consists of close geological materials (ferruginous rocks derived from glauconite) but also of two types of exogenous rocks: yellow Permian sandstones and orange kaolinitic bauxites, respec‑ tively 60 ‑ 70 and 70 ‑ 90 km away. This Middle Neolithic settlement is known to be well inserted in complex exchange networks including western Provence (Bedoulian and Oligocene flint), French and Italian Alps (quartz, jadeite, eclogite), Liguria (jadeite, eclogite) and Lipari island (obsidian). The presence of these three types of rocks all along the occupation shows the permanence of exploitation of these <b>colouring</b> <b>materials,</b> which gives evidence of procurement regularity, the stability of exchange networks and the durability of relationships and technical practices...|$|R
