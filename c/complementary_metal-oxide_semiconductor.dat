40|$|Mach–Zehnder optical {{modulators}} {{are the key}} {{devices for}} high-speed electrical-to-optical conversion in Si photonics. Si rib waveguides with a p–n diode structure operated in the carrier depletion mode have mainly been developed as their phase shifters. Their length is usually longer than millimeters due to the limited change in the refractive index due to the carrier depletion in a Si p–n diode. This length is shorter than commercial LiNbO 3 modulators, but still much shorter devices are desired for large-scale integration and for simplifying the high-speed RF modulation. A promising solution is to use slow light in photonic crystal waveguides, which enhances the modulation efficiency {{in proportion to the}} group-velocity refractive index n g. In particular, dispersion-engineered slow light allows more than five-fold enhancement, maintaining a wide working spectrum as well as large temperature tolerance.

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{features}} {{that led to the}} success of <b>complementary</b> <b>metal-oxide</b> <b>semiconductor,</b> or CMOS, technology was its intrinsic low-power consumption. This meant that circuit designers and electronic design automation (EDA) tools could afford to concentrate on maximizing circuit performance and minimizing circuit area. Another interesting feature of CMOS technology is its nice scaling properties, which has permitted a steady decrease in the feature size (see Moore's law), allowing for more and more complex systems on a single chip, working at higher clock frequencies.Power consumption concerns came into play with the appearance of the first portable electronic systems in the late 1980s. In this market, battery lifetime is a decisive factor for the commercial success of the product. Another fact that became apparent {{at about the same time}} was that the increasing integration of more active elements per die area would lead to prohibitively large-energy consumption of an integrated circuit. A high absolute level of power is not only undesirable for economic and environmentalreasons, but it also creates the problem of heat dissipation.
