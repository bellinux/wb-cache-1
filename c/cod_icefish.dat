C. amphitreta is coloured purple-gold with black linings on the mouth, gills cavities and peritoneum.|$|R

50|$|Antarctic fish is {{a common}} name {{for a variety of}} fish that inhabit the Southern Ocean. They {{originate}} from the five different families that belong to the suborder Notothenioidei of the order Perciformes. They are from families Artedidraconidae (barbeled plunderfishes), Bathydraconidae (Antarctic dragonfishes), Channichthyidae (crocodile icefishes or white-blooded fishes), Harpagiferidae (spiny plunderfish), and Nototheniidae (<b>cod</b> <b>icefishes).</b> They are also called notothenioids, but this name is also used to describe the other three, non-Antarctic families and some of the non-Antarctic genera in the mainly Antarctic families belonging to the suborder.|$|R
50|$|Like all cormorants, {{the rock}} shag feeds by diving for {{underwater}} prey. It feeds close to shore, often diving {{at the edge}} of kelp beds and apparently finding small fish (predominantly <b>cod</b> <b>icefishes,</b> Patagonotothen species) sheltering among the weed. Studies with depth gauges suggest that it is a fairly shallow diver, typically going about 5 m below the surface with few individuals diving deeper than 10 m, although its prey mainly comes from the sea floor. Dive times are typically around 30 seconds. Its breeding range overlaps markedly with that of the imperial shag Leucocarbo atriceps, but the two species' foraging ranges are different since the imperial shag tends to dive in deeper water, further out from shore.|$|R
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} is {{an active}} predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and sauries, and forages near the bottom for groundfishes such as <b>cod,</b> hake, <b>icefish,</b> dories, sand lances, lumpsuckers, and flatfish. Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form {{an important component of}} its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and tope sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.|$|R
50|$|Fishing {{takes place}} around South Georgia and in {{adjacent}} waters in some {{months of the}} year, with fishing licences sold by the territory for Patagonian toothfish, <b>cod</b> <b>icefish</b> and krill. Fishing licences bring in millions of pounds a year, most of which is spent on fishery protection and research. All fisheries are regulated and managed {{in accordance with the}} Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) system.|$|E
5000|$|The Maori cod (Paranotothenia magellanica), {{also known}} as Magellanic rockcod, blue notothenia or orange throat notothen, is a species of <b>cod</b> <b>icefish</b> native to the Southern Ocean. [...] "Maori chief" [...] and [...] "black cod", {{sometimes}} used for this species, usually refer to fishes from the related genus Notothenia. It occurs at depths of from near the surface to 255 m, though it is usually found at less than 20 m This species can reach a length of 38 cm SL. Being a perciform fish it is unrelated to the true cods of the order Gadiformes. This species is commercially important as a food fish.|$|E
50|$|Pagothenia borchgrevinki, {{the bald}} notothen or bald rockcod is {{a species of}} <b>cod</b> <b>icefish</b> native to the Southern Ocean where it {{is found in the}} Weddell Sea, the Ross Sea, the Davis Sea, in Vincennes Bay, and around the Budd Coast, the Antarctic Peninsula, South Orkneys and South Shetland Islands. It can be found at depths of from the surface to 550 m though it is much rarer below 30 m. This species is often found along the under {{surfaces}} of ice foraging for prey such as sympagic copepods and krill. In turn, it is known to be preyed upon by the ploughfish, Gymnodraco acuticeps and the Antarctic toothfish, Dissostichus mawsoni. Antifreeze proteins in its blood prevent it freezing in the subzero water temperatures of Antarctica.|$|E
5000|$|Dissostichus mawsoni, the Antarctic toothfish, is {{a species}} of <b>cod</b> <b>icefish</b> native to the Southern Ocean. It is often mistakenly {{referred}} to as an Antarctic cod, consistent with the misnaming of other notothenioid Antarctic fish as rock cods. However, notothenioid fishes are unrelated to cods, which are in another taxonomic order, the Gadiformes. The generic name Dissostichus is from the Greek dissos (twofold) and stichus (line) and refers {{to the presence of}} two long lateral lines, which are very important to the species’ ecology. The common name [...] "toothfish" [...] refers to the presence of biserial dentition in the upper jaw, thought to give it a shark-like appearance. The habitat of the Antarctic toothfish is in subzero degree water below latitude 60°S.|$|E
