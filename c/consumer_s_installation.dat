40|$|This paper {{provides}} an alternative theory of price adjustment resting on consumer loss aversion {{in the price}} dimension. In line with prospect theory the perceived losses from price increases are weighted stronger in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> utility function than the perceived gains resulting from price decreases of equal magnitude. Prices are evaluated relative to a certain reference price which is endogenous, sluggish and depends to the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> recent rational price expectations. Two key modeling implications arise: First, demand responses are more elastic for price increases than for price decreases and thus firms face a downward-sloping demand curve that is kinked at the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> reference price. Second, changes in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> recent rational price expectations and hence in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> reference price can alter demand through {{what we call the}} reference-price-updating effect. We incorporate this into an otherwise standard dynamic neoclassical model of monopolistic competition and analyze price and quantity reactions to various demand shocks. We find that although firms may change their prices flexibly, {{depending on the size of}} the shock the prices adjust more or less pronounced than in the standard monopoly model and that prices can even be rigid. Additionally, we find that the price adjustment is asymmetric with respect to shock size and sign and the current state of the business cycle, i. e. pricing is state-dependent...|$|R

40|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} {{whether the}} implementation of traceability systems can contribute towards restoring consumer confidence in food quality and safety, {{one of the goals}} of the European Food Law. To date, little is known about how consumers perceive the role and potential impact of traceability within the supply chain. This paper aims to provide insight into how traceability information can offer guarantees of food quality and safety, and contribute towards increased consumer confidence. Data, collected in four EU countries, examines salient cognitions and attitudes that underpin consumer beliefs about product traceability that will influence their decision making. It will link traceability- related food attributes to perceived benefits (in terms of quality and safety) and important consumer values. Furthermore, variations between different <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> are examined to illustrate how the concepts of food safety and food quality may have different meanings and consequences in the various European countries.

In the slow process of shifting from a "niche" to a broader consumption in the organic products market deep differences between conventional and organic production, distribution and consumption became evident. In such a context, the consumer's behaviour about organic products analysis transpires to be complex as it involves either social - economic and psychographic characteristics. In order to address this issue a research has been carried out in two steps: in the first one, a qualitative analysis step, 45 <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> of organic products were interviewed by phone using laddering techniques; then, in the second quantitative step, data from a 203 <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> sample, representative of a region of South of Italy, was analysed by means of a multinomial logit.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers and evaluates how {{the implementation}} of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA) and more specifically Part G thereof influences the common law in relation to contract law and the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> rights to fair just and reasonable contract terms, together with considering the pit falls of the CPA in its current form and the sections which require amendment. It will be illustrated that the CPA has been drafted with the clear intention of protecting and benefiting the consumer by codifying the common law provisions in order to strengthen the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> position within <b>consumer</b> markets. Many terms and principles introduced by the CPA are foreign to the South African legal system. It can be expected with any entirely new piece of legislation implemented within an existing legal system that there will be conflicts and uncertainties in the application thereof. Ultimately this dissertation has found two sets of conclusions. Firstly the general effect that Part G of the CPA has on consumer markets, namely strengthening consumer rights thereby enabling consumers, more particularly historically disadvantaged consumers to actively partake in consumer markets as a whole. Secondly this dissertation unfortunately has also found that the CPA has failed to use essential mechanisms as used in the United Kingdom and European Union unfair terms legislation to curb unfair unjust and unreasonable contract terms.

40|$|The National Credit Act 34 of 2005 {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} reckless lending into the South African credit market. It set out a regulatory framework in chapter 4 part D that provided for the credit provider s assessment of certain aspects relating to the consumer prior to the lending of credit. This assessment, inter alia, meant assessing the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> financial means and prospects, debt repayment history and general understanding of the risks and obligations. The obligation placed on credit providers to conduct an assessment originally stated that such credit provider must take reasonable steps when assessing the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> ability to afford the credit requested. However, it did not state what constituted a reasonable step. More specifically, the provision provided that guidelines would be published to assist a credit provider in creating a suitable assessment mechanism, model or procedure. However, until {{the first quarter of}} 2013, no guidelines had been issued. This led to an uncertainty in the credit market and consequently interpretational issues thereof arose. Eventually, after conducting a policy review, the National Credit Regulator published draft guidelines in May 2013 followed up by more comprehensive guidelines in September that year. The National Credit Amendment Act followed shortly thereafter altering the pre-agreement assessment provisions to state that a credit provider may determine for itself the evaluative mechanisms, models and procedures used to assess a consumer but that such mechanism, model or procedure must not be inconsistent with the regulations published by the Minister. Subsequently the Affordability Assessment Regulations were published, setting out a standard to which all credit providers have to base their assessment mechanism, model or procedure around. The main focus of this dissertation is therefore to investigate the new pre-agreement assessment dispensation, benchmarked against previous interpretational issues.

40|$|This Article {{provides}} an overview of United States consumer protection law in the growing number cases with an international dimension that arise with economic globalization, expanding transnational corporations, worldwide production chains, manufacturing outsourcing and more efficient international communication. U. <b>S.</b> <b>consumer</b> protection law remains primarily state law, including tort and product liability law, contract and warranty law, and general and product-specific consumer protection statutes. (This refers to the private law remedies for consumer goods which are the substantive laws addressed in this article.) There is little treaty-based, constitutional or federal law except for federal regulatory law that largely adopts state law standards, requires disclosure or encourages disclosure, monitoring and attention to consumer safety. Parties have extensive discretion to choose fora and governing law. Where parties do not so choose (as in non-contractual relations), plaintiffs have significant but limited discretion to select fora, and ordinary U. S. choice of law rules apply for substantive law, possibly with a greater tendency to choose U. S. law. Requirements for personal jurisdiction are similar to those in domestic litigation. Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments depends partly on compliance with treaty obligations and application of relatively uniform state laws 2 ̆ 7 procedural and substantive standards. Class action litigation and alternative dispute resolution are available. In recent years, U. S. authorities increasingly have pursued international agreements and cooperative arrangements to increase regulatory capacity, enforcement and harmonized standards. The impact of intergovernmental cooperation has been limited, and U. <b>S.</b> <b>consumers</b> face formidable hurdles in seeking remedies against foreign defendants. Defective exports from China illustrate these limits and the increasing likelihood of foreign-based dangers to U. <b>S.</b> <b>consumers.</b> U. <b>S.</b> litigation against U. S.
