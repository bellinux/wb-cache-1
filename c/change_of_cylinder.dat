50|$|The M4+2 engines {{have much}} in common with the Beare-head engines, {{combining}} two opposed pistons in the same cylinder. One piston works at half the cyclical rate of the other, but while the main function of the second piston in a Beare-head engine is to replace the valve mechanism of a conventional four-stroke engine, the M4+2 takes the principle one step further. The double-piston combustion engine's work is based on the cooperation of both modules. The air load change takes place in the two-stroke section of the engine. The piston of the four-stroke section is an air load exchange aiding system, working as a system of valves. The cylinder is filled with air or with an air-fuel mixture. The filling process takes place at overpressure by the slide inlet system. The exhaust gases are removed as in the classical two-stroke engine, by exhaust windows in the cylinder. The fuel is supplied into the cylinder by a fuel-injection system. Ignition is realized by two spark plugs. The effective power output of the double-piston engine is transferred by two crankshafts. The characteristic feature of this engine is an opportunity of continuous <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinder</b> capacity and compression rate during engine work by changing the piston's location. The mechanical and thermodynamical models were meant for double-piston engines, which enable to draw up new theoretical thermodynamic cycle for internal combustion double-pistons engine.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{influence of}} the crankshaft offset of spark ignition engine regarding the engine friction, torque and power. It is known from the literature that crankshaft offset has a potential to reduce normal piston force during the expansion stroke at lower engine speeds. The results of lower normal force are reduced mechanical losses due to friction between the piston and liner <b>of</b> the <b>cylinder.</b> The crankshaft offset can significantly change the piston kinematics because the piston moves slower around TDC and BDC. If spark timing is referenced to the piston position from the TDC, the crankshaft offset increase in-cylinder pressure during the combustion as a result <b>of</b> lower <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cylinder</b> volume close to the TDC and engine performances can be improved. Two operating points of spark ignition engine were analyzed and optimization of crankshaft offset was performed by the NSGA-II genetic algorithm.

The minimization of friction losses that occur between piston and cylinder liner as well as minimization of difference between peak values of resultant force of the piston in the normal direction were the main objectives of the optimization.

Cryoballoon ablation is an effective therapy for PV isolation for AF with minimal side effects and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) several years ago.

A lower balloon temperature has been associated with long-term success in isolation of PVs. Case presentation: At the start of the procedure, the cryoconsole displayed "low refrigerant level".
