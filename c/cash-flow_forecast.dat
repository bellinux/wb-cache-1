40|$|This paper proposes {{and tests}} {{a variant of}} the {{standard}} discounted cash-flow model for enterprise valuation. The cash-flow (C/F) stream to be discounted is projected as the product of the sales and the free C/F to the enterprise (FCFE) -to-sales ratio and their respective rates of change. The C/F timespan is divided into three intervals. In the first, sales and ratio change according to the company's track record. On the assumption that both industry and firm abnormal earnings disappear at a certain point, marking the beginning of the third interval, the ratio evolves over the second interval to reach the Industry's average and thereafter remains constant. On the same basis, sales grow in the third interval in accordance with the economy's long-term trend, i. e. at the long-term nominal GDP growth rate, and within the second at an average of the latter and the track-record year-on-year growth rate. The proposed variant is tested for the four largest telecommunications companies in continental Europe over a 2. 5 -year period. The results, together with those of the standard model, are then compared with enterprise market values to test relative performance. Examination of their respective bias (signed valuation errors) and inaccuracy (ditto unsigned) seems to indicate that the proposed variant outperforms the standard model from which it is derived, even for different assumptions about the valuation horizon and for alternative ways to estimate the values of the variables. company valuation, discounted cash flow, <b>cash-flow</b> <b>forecasting,</b> ratios, relative valuation,...|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} cost expressed accounting model, became obsolete {{and the need}} {{of a change in}} paradigm is in order. The importance of the tangible assets regarding to value, gradually tends to be replaced by the value of the intangible assets and of that of the financial assets. The design of certain accounting and financial models in terms of flows is not free of abstractions with subjective connotations. We believe that such an approach, in terms of cindynique, is susceptible to be appreciated such as a new management of treasury flows, because neither the <b>forecasted</b> <b>cash-flow,</b> nor the <b>forecasted</b> result, procure the necessary pertinence and viability, {{if they are to be}} considered separately. In our research, we intend to take into consideration the contributions of the cindynique theory to the approach of the combining financial and cognitive risks. An emphasized management of the cash flows through cindynique becomes increasingly important through a practical achievement. Cash flows and risk management refers to the same approach of the ensemble of the dimensions, representing the hyper space of danger, identifying absent similarities or conflicts between the different participants. To take account of the opportunity and threat of risk is in fact the true paradigm, but the structural flexibility can be expressed through the ability of the company to obtain the necessary capitals for the forecasted strategic or organizational actions...|$|R
40|$|Even though {{performance}} measurement {{has gained a}} lot of attention in accounting research, it is still a quite scarcely researched topic in the SMEs context. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has been the best-known {{performance measurement}} framework during the last two decades, but its feasibility for small companies has been doubtful. Simultaneously, technological development has increased the supply of different performance measurement applications and also accounting service providers' SaaS -based financial accounting platforms have started to include more features for performance measurement. It is expected that the technological development and accelerating digitalization are having a substantial effect on the whole accounting industry, which will shift accounting service providers' focus from traditional bookkeeping to business advisory. Based on this background, the purpose of this thesis is to: (1) investigate how SMEs are currently measuring their performance, discover the main obstacles to performance measurement and compare the findings with the previous literature, and (2) offer practical information to the accounting service providers how financial accounting systems and service could be developed in the light of performance measurement. The empirical part of the study is based on the 14 semi-structured interviews with the management of Finnish SMEs. The empirical part shows that the interviewees have a good knowledge of the BSC but it is not in use in any of the companies. The company representatives' attitudes towards the BSC can be classified into three groups: (1) companies, which found it too heavy and unnecessary for their business, (2) companies, which consider it as a potential development area when their business grows; and (3) companies, which have implemented their own and customized performance measurement frameworks that best fit in their organization. Cash-flow and other monetary based indicators are the most important measures in all the companies. The main barriers to performance measurement have been the lack of time and resources and also IT-related problems. All the respondents find dashboard feature, which combines financial and non-financial indicators, as a good idea, but have different opinions about its properties and implementation method. The most desired features are <b>cash-flow</b> <b>forecasting</b> and budgeting tools while the respondents have mixed opinions about the separate mobile application. The interviewees have open and positive attitudes towards different controller services offered by the accounting service provider, but the majority see that the scope and quality of the services will restrict to ad hoc based advisory concerning financial accounting and taxation...|$|R

Through the nature of the subject, the research is based on simulating variations of the <b>forecasted</b> <b>cash-flows</b> of the companies included in the sample. The study employs 391 <b>forecasted</b> yearly <b>cash-flows</b> statements collected from 50 companies from Timis County (Romania), as well as the detailed hypotheses of the forecasts. The results of the study facilitate the determination and classification of the main sensitivity factors for the payment capacity at sample level, the establishment of general benchmarks for the payment capacity (as no such benchmarks currently exist in the Romanian literature) and the identification of the mechanisms through which the variation of different factors impacts the payment capacity...|$|R
40|$|OrgPlan is a {{computer}} package designed to support farmers and consultants in planning a conversion to organic farming. It consists of two main elements: the basic planning module and a database with data for organic, in-conversion and conventional data. It was developed with DEFRA funding (OF 0159) by a partnership between the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, the University of Hertfordshire, Elm Farm Research Centre and SAC. The objective of this work was to obtain feedback before its general release on the suitability of OrgPlan in supporting the process of planning a conversion to organic farming. Given the risks of the organic conversion process and the sensitive nature of the financial reports that OrgPlan can generate, further testing with consultants experienced in organic conversion planning was carried out. The work was broken down in four objectives. Independent of this, OrgPlan {{has been used by}} the contractor in the context of research work, in particular the Modelling of Strategies of Organic Milk Production (OF 0146). Objective 1 : Update of standard data The contractor updated the OrgPlan database with data from the 2002 / 03 Organic Farm Management Handbook and other sources. Objective 2 : Workshops and Field testing of the software Three workshops with a total 22 consultants were held during which they were given a basic introduction to the use of OrgPlan and had a first opportunity to use the software on their own computer or appropriate workstations. OrgPlan can effectively support several aspects of a first broad brush planning of an organic conversion (rotation planning, cropping and livestock enterprises, feasibility of a proposed organic scenario in terms of financial output, nutrient and forage budgets) and can assist with more detailed financial planning of investments, leading to Profit and Loss and <b>Cash-Flow</b> <b>forecasts.</b> OrgPlan could have a wider application in whole farm planning, but this would require extending the database to cover a wider range of enterprises common on conventional farms. Key strengths identified by the consultants (not in order of importance) • Financial planning • Availability of basic enterprise data set • Rotation planning and nutrient budgets • Combination of financial and nutrient data in one package • Create different scenarios giving instant access for reassessment of options • Possibility to ‘tweak' a scenario • Library, navigation around the collection is excellent • Help topics clear and straightforward • Broad brush planning, particularly for farms planning new enterprises Key weaknesses (not in order of importance) • Limited range of enterprises in the database, particularly for horticultural crops • Problems with set-up, use of database and understanding all functions • Need for regular updates of the dataset • P and K Fertilisers routinely included in organic enterprises • Data entry in some sections is long-winded Objective 3 : Essential corrections to the software and update of advisory section • A list of problems and suggestions was compiled. All essential changes will be implemented before a release of the software. Other suggestions, which entail more complicated programming work, are included in a as ideas for future development of OrgPlan. Objective 4 : Final report This is the final report submitted to DEFRA. The contractor will also submit to DEFRA a concept outlining the steps to be taken for the release of the software, which is planned for autumn 2003...|$|R
40|$|The {{methods of}} patrimonial {{evaluation}} are recognised {{on a large}} scale by the specialists in the Continental Europe, while the specialists in the North America almost ignore them, they consider as a realistic economic value the one that results from the update of the <b>forecast</b> <b>cash-flows.</b> The Romanian financial school does not mention at present a basic orientation related to the continental or American opinion. In general, it can be found out that the attitude of the Romanian authors, specialised in the accounting domain, is for the patrimonial methods, and those in financial professional domain, is for the financial and stock methods. According to the International Standards for business evaluation, the “asset based approach is the way to estimate the value of a business and /or the participations to it, using methods based on the market value of the individual assets of the business, decreasing its debts”. The entities can proceed to the re-evaluation of the tangible assets that exist {{at the end of the}} financial exercise, so that they are presented to their true value in accounting, reflecting the results of this re-evaluation in the financial reports made for that exercise. In this context, the present paper proposes the analysis of the accounting and tax treatmentforeseen by the accounting regulations, according to the European directives, and to the procedures of evaluation and re-evaluation of the tangible assets...|$|R
40|$|Historically, many mining {{investments}} {{have demonstrated}} inability to meet projected cash-flows despite detailed and costly project evaluations. The risk in mining projects {{can be attributed}} to the fact that decisions are made in situations involving high levels of uncertainty. The cash-flow uncertainty is driven by commodity price fluctuations and by the uncertainty of the geometries and grades of ore deposits. Accurately predicting future prices can be very difficult, however, better knowledge of the orebody will allow for improved strategic planning and an ability to build in flexibility into the design of the operation to deal with veiled uncertainty, orebody variability and operational constraints. Geometallurgy provides a platform for cross-functional collaboration between geology and metallurgy, providing better inputs to mine planning and strategic decision making. Understanding variability in the orebody enables optimum operational designs and extraction methods that maximize value recovery. Geometallurgical programs allow for material characterization that is based on metallurgical responses instead of just geological zones, enabling informed design decisions and building in flexibility to handle variability. On the other hand, metallurgical design decisions made without full appreciation of the resource can limit ability to deal with variability, constraining the process right from design. Geometallurgical risk exists as a result of uncertainty in metallurgical characteristics of the ore resulting in treatability challenges. Projects such as the Cawse Nickel Project in Western Australia and the Voorspoed Diamond Mine in South Africa are given as illustrations of geometallurgical risk at various phases of projects. Canahuire Project in Peru and the Kemi Chromite and Ferrochrome mine in Finland exemplify how successful geometallurgical programs have and can be implemented. This report demonstrates a case for geometallurgy at the Orapa A/K 1 deposit. Two rock types comprising the kimberlite, SVK_M and NPK_GG, previously not apparent in geological models, have introduced a constraint in the Orapa 2 treatment plant. This treatability challenge is due to the generation of non-settling slurries from the rock types. A metallurgical design decision in the selection of the thickeners has limited the plant’s ability to deal with the changes in the ore blend. The Orapa case proves how design decisions can limit flexibility to deal with orebody variability, constraining the process from achieving the design capacity and limiting <b>forecast</b> <b>cash-flows.</b> The case demonstrates existence of geometallurgical risk and illustrates the consequences of this risk in operational and financial terms...|$|R
