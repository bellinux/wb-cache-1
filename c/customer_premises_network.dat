40|$|The {{developments}} in compressed digital video technology are {{paving the way}} for video-based services. Provision of such services requires a broadband communications network, which should extend into the customers' premises up to the terminals. This indicates a growing need for a <b>customer</b> <b>premises</b> <b>network.</b> This paper presents an infrastructure for an evolutionary and future-proof <b>customer</b> <b>premises</b> <b>network.</b> Such an infrastructure allows for early deployment and gradual upgrades associated with service demand. A key element in the concept is the use of the graded index polymer optical fibre (GIPOF) which combines an intrinsically high bandwidth with easy and therefore low-cost handling. There are two opposite approaches for the choice of network topology. In one approach, all applications are forced onto a single topology. In the other approach, the topology best suited for each application type is used. This paper considers the ‘best-suited topology’ approach and presents a network infrastructure that can support many topologies simultaneously as independent overlay networks. The proposed infrastructure consists of bundles of fibres, which can be interconnected and accessed by terminals in any required manner...|$|E

The aim of this new proposal is to guarantee the internal communication in the <b>customer</b> <b>premises</b> <b>network,</b> allowing the support of all services envisaged for the residential and small business environments. These environments have specific characteristics with impact on the architecture mainly in what concerns its simplicity, flexibility, availability, performance and cost. The proposed solution consists in a distributed architecture with two hierarchical levels and it is based on a shared medium with an access mechanism characterized by a More Loaded First Served (MLFS) discipline. The resolution of critical situations where certain terminals may have delay thresholds is embedded in the global solution through a modification of the basic priority of each terminal (MMLFS). This discipline suits quite well the quick variations on the sources traffic patterns, typical of ATM, keeping on the other hand, the level of simplicity required by the target environments. In more complex applications, the traffic concentration in each network node is achieved by ATM multiplexers. The proposed ATM multiplexer is characterized by a modular and flexible architecture. It uses a decentralized contention mechanism that allows the evaluation of which input has the highest priority just before each cell transmissionAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Numbering and {{addressing}} issues arising in the Integrated Broadband Communication Network (IBCN) {{for the support}} of the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Personal Telecommunication Service (PTS) are dealt with in this paper. Mobile communications services will allow a user to roam within a network. Thus there will be a need to identify several types of objects (terminals, network points of attachment, users, Customer Premises Networks, etc.). The mobility properties of these objects will necessitate dynamic bindings between their addresses and names. Moreover, the situation is further complicated since the mobility may be embedded. A mobile user may employ a mobile terminal in a mobile <b>Customer</b> <b>Premises</b> <b>Network</b> (CPN). Therefore, in UMTS and PTS {{there is a need for}} dynamic binding of various identifiers with location information data.

That is, PTN's will be used (during dialing) for making calls to mobile terminals, mobile users, as well as fixed subscribers. When the personal communication service is not provided, the DN corresponds to the terminal number of the equipment (fixed or mobile) of the called subscriber.

The real-time communication ability of the smart grid will enable utilities to optimize and modernize the power grid in order to realize its full potential [4]. The communication network takes charge of the collection and analysis of real-time data, along with the control of electrical loads for energy reduction and demand response [5]. Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is the technology of automatically collecting data from energy metering devices and transferring that data to a central database by communication technology for remote control and analyzing. It is the totality of systems and networks for measuring, collecting, storing, analyzing, and using energy usage data. AMI will link consumers and power utilities together and provide foundation for future distribution automation and other smart grid functionalities [6]. Based on these functions, the nodes in AMI are always irregularly distributed and the communication is low data rate and short range.

40|$|One of {{the major}} trends in the {{evolution}} of current corporate networking is an increasing need for high performance long distance communications. Provided as an alternative to leased lines networks, virtual private networks (VPNs) are gaining increasing acceptance among customers and network providers by providing corporate networking between geographically dispersed <b>customer</b> <b>premises</b> based on a shared public switched network infrastructure. As a contribution towards this evolution, the present thesis proposes a generic object-oriented architecture for open distributed VPN services integrating service and management issues all along the modeling process. The aim of this VPN architecture is not only to provide a descriptive model of VPNs but also to illustrate possible ways of operating on that model to solve VPN related service or management issues. The architecture proposed is generic in the sense that, firstly, it is network technology independent and, secondly, that it captures the fundamental characteristics common to all VPNs. This latter aspect is very important as, {{due to the lack of}} standardization in this area, current VPNs are more marketable products than well-defined telecommunications services. The notion of distribution is also very important as telecommunications systems in general, and VPNs in particular, are intrinsically distributed. Indeed, a VPN can be seen as a distributed application running on the multiple nodes of telecommunications networks. To effectively deal with this de facto distribution and to exploit at best the benefits it can provide the VPN service and management services have been conceived from the very beginning as distributed applications. For this purpose, and due to the lack of satisfactory existing solutions in this area, an object-oriented method for the specification and design of open distributed telecommunications and management services has been developed. The proposed method combines the ODP (Open Distributed Processing) concepts and stucturing rules with the systematic development process advocated by an object-oriented software engineering method called Fusion. This method provides an architectural framework and a seamless thread from problem definition to the realization of the distributed telecommunications system, based on hierarchically related abstraction levels. Mapping rules, guidelines and notations are proposed on how and when enterprise, information and computational models should be built, in particular based on models performed at a higher abstraction level. The method has then been applied to the specification of the generic VPN architecture itself. In the enterprise viewpoint the scope of the VPN service has been refined and limited to the provision, within the public domain boundary, of internetworking services between <b>customer</b> <b>premises</b> <b>networks.</b> The main actors involved in using, providing and managing the VPN service have been described as well as interactions between them. Based on their requirements, fundamental VPN characteristics have been identified, among which the notions of virtual resource and of closed user group are the most relevant. In the information viewpoint, a generic object-oriented network information model has been developed based on standard network resources. This model has been recursively applied to specify the object models pertaining to the different layers of the VPN architecture. Based on this architecture, a management service allowing customers to dynamically configure the logical connectivity of their VPN has been specified down to the network elements level. The realization of this functionality in terms of application components suitable for distribution and interactions between them has been the purpose of the computational viewpoint. Finally, the generic VPN architecture has been refined and applied to the particular context of ATM-based VPNs. In addition to describing how VPNs can be built on ATM networks this case study addresses a very important issue in such an environment, narnely bandwidth management. In this respect, an open distributed VPN bandwidth management service has been specified that allows VPN customers to dynamically modify the bandwidth allocated to the virtual path connections connecting the different sites of their organization. The final outcome of this specification process is the definition of a computational architecture for VPN bandwidth management extending from VPN level down to the physical network elements.
