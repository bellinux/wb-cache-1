40|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} {{is partly a}} product of colonialism. Colonialism {{resulted}} in the imposition of extraneous legal values in the territory. In addition to those <b>values,</b> <b>customary</b> law and human rights are also recognized. Cameroon's legal system thus consists of a mosaic of rules. Among those rules, customary law and human rights have a problematic relationship because many of their <b>values</b> conflict. Some <b>customary</b> <b>values</b> offend human rights and adversely affect the status of women. Although {{attempts have been made}} through the legislative process to eradicate discriminatory <b>customary</b> <b>values,</b> in practical terms, little or no success has been achieved. Consequently, the courts have assumed the role of ensuring that customary law responds to the dictates of human rights through the adoption of an egalitarian jurisprudence in the application of customary law. The courts rarely expressly use the language of human rights in the determination of cases; however, by applying the repugnancy test, the courts have at least inadvertently introduced the language of human rights into their jurisprudence. The courts' gender-sensitive approach in the enforcement of customary law has an impact on women's rights. This article suggests that the work of the courts should be complemented by other gender-based initiatives...|$|R

It usesItaly’s emigrant associations abroad as a proxy of transnational social capital and measures its effects on Italy’s bilateral FDI. Our results are that the associative activity of emigrants, which partly dates far back into the past, positively and strongly affects the Italian bilateral FDI, especially concerning the countries hosting the older associations and the FDI into Italy...|$|R

A threshold can also be specified, either by a statistical criterion (number of standard deviation to be summed to the average) or by a <b>customary</b> <b>value.</b> In the case a threshold is set, i.cva gives as output also a map of the final change, given by the classified pixels whose value exceeds the threshold for the magnitude.|$|R
50|$|To Norwegians Soria Moria Castle is {{probably}} among the best-known Norwegian folktales. The search for Soria Moria castle might {{be thought of}} as a progression, the symbol for perfect happiness. According to legend, the path to the castle is not clearly marked, and the journey is solitary because all people are different and therefore cannot reach the goal in the same manner. It is characteristic of most Norwegian folktales in that it contains a unique undertone of realism and folk humor. These folktales express many <b>customary</b> <b>values,</b> ideas, and characters. One of the most common values expressed is the idea of a common person rising above the circumstances of his birth and becoming successful.|$|R

The Gītā describes a unique and concrete situation, a never-to-be-repeated in reality. The dialogue gives rise to a phenomenology of conscience where different modes of thinking are laid out. The text makes use of myths and <b>customary</b> <b>values</b> to reveal the different aspects of the human psyche that play themselves out in the field of moral philosophy. The Gītā’s abstract discussions take place in the field of values, Dharmakṣetra. There śraddhā emerges as the truly central category of a heart-philosophy, and reconciles the two distinct types of human activities, defined by the conceptual pair pravṛtti (engagement in the affairs of the world) and nivṛtti (disengagement from the affairs of the world).|$|R
