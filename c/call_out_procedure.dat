40|$|Few {{laboratory}} experiments {{have been conducted}} in loneliness research in the past. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} article is to review, partially investigate and discuss loneliness induction procedures in order to facilitate future {{laboratory experiments}} in loneliness research (e. g. to examine the link between loneliness and social cognition). Previous studies have found both unconscious (i. e. professional hypnosis) and conscious (i. e. recalling and <b>calling</b> <b>out</b> lonely experiences) <b>procedures</b> to be successful in inducing loneliness. Another conscious procedure (i. e. recalling and writing down lonely experiences) that has been described in recent literature has not yet been examined. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine this procedure using a one-group before-after design. However, this procedure, in which the participants had to recall and write down two lonely situations, was not found to significantly induce loneliness. Of 16 participants, only three reported at least some higher feelings of loneliness following this procedure...|$|R
