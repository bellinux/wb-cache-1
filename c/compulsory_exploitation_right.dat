50|$|According to its {{personal}} scope of application, § 31a UrhG affects solely contracts between the author or their legal successor {{and the right}} holder. As a future economic success is not measurable, the granting of <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> by using yet unknown types of use is reserved to the author, {{even if they have}} already granted <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> concerning known types of use.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{collecting}} societies {{receive their}} legitimacy from German author's rights (Urheberrecht), which is legally regulated in all European states. German author's rights law (Urheberrechtsgesetze) grants authors {{a range of}} <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> (Verwertungsrechte) that the individual author would find difficult to exercise without {{the assistance of a}} collecting society, which is why the author transfers them. Transferred <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> become usage rights (Nutzungsrechte) in the form of licenses.|$|R
50|$|The {{copyright}} law protects an author regarding their intellectual and personal {{relationship to the}} work {{and the types of}} its utilisation, § 11 UrhG. According to § 11 UrhG the author shall participate in all kinds of utilisation of their work. The author’s economic interests in their work shall be protected by the exploitation rights.A (not final) list of <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> is presented in § 15 UrhG. The <b>exploitation</b> <b>right</b> must be distinguished from the right of use. The non-transferability of the authorship means {{that there is no way}} to transfer the <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> on the whole. However, there is the possibility of granting certain rights of use to someone else, according to the § 31 UrhG. It is up to the author if they want to grant e. g. a publisher the right to reproduce and distribute their work.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the case}} of mineral {{resources}} being exploited by many running units, {{the right of the}} mineral resources is shared by them all. Since no agreement on allocation of <b>exploitation</b> <b>right</b> is done, they are in a non-cooperative competition situation. This paper first puts forth a multi-stage dynamic decision-making model of mineral resources corresponding to different technology levels of the running units, and then gives the optimal decision-making on exploitation and the ideal allocation of <b>exploitation</b> <b>right</b> by a special case of this model, which can lead to the maximum profit over the exploitation term of the mine resources...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{rights in}} {{copyright}} The {{theme of this}} thesis are economic rights in copyright. They are one of two categories which compose the content of copyright. The second category is called copyrights related to personality. These two categories of copyright {{can not be separated}} by exact borderline - economic rights in copyright include economic component, and vice versa. Economic rights in copyright are rights which have economic importance for their right holder. Economic rights in copyright can be divided into two main categories: <b>exploitation</b> <b>right</b> (in wide sense) and other economic <b>rights</b> in copyright. <b>Exploitation</b> <b>right</b> in wide sense include <b>exploitation</b> <b>right</b> and right of granting licence to other person. The aim of my thesis is to analyse and summarize contemporary situation of a legislation regulating economic rights in copyright and institutes relating to them. The thesis is composed of six chapters. The purpose of Chapter One is to explain what is a content of copyright and to briefly describe economic rights in copyright and copyrights related to personality in two parts of this Chapter. Chapter Two of the thesis is called economic rights in copyright. This chapter is subdivided into five parts. First part deals with influence of a definition of concept,,thing" in New Civil Code upon [...] ...|$|R

50|$|As {{regards the}} {{management}} of patrimonial rights, the difference between copyright and droit d'auteur is not so clear as in both system the producer controls the exploiting of the work. It can be stated that the droit d’auteur favours the author while copyright favours the <b>right</b> to copy (<b>exploitation</b> <b>right)</b> linked to the work itself.|$|R
50|$|According {{to the law}} {{superficial}} {{ownership and}} <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> are distinct. Concession rights are divided into exploration and exploitation ones, and the general geometry of concessions are established.

40|$|We analyze {{a dynamic}} two-country trade model between a {{technological}} leading {{country and a}} natural resource dependent economy. The main goal of the paper is to analyze how the ownership and distribution of the <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> upon the natural resource may affect the sustainable growth rate for the two trading economies, the resource conservation and the consumers welfare. The two trading economies are not symmetric. One country is a technological leader whereas its counterpart is a technological follower. In contrast to the leading country, the output production in the follower economy needs a renewable natural resource as an essential input. We analyze different property rights regimes {{depending on whether the}} resource is managed by a central authority (a monopoly firm in the leading economy or the government in the follower country) or the <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> are equally distributed among many harvesters in the follower country...|$|R
50|$|<b>Exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> of the author, {{as well as}} {{neighbouring}} rights, may be acquired, sold, or transferred, if {{the transfer}} is set out in writing (Arts. 107, 110). However, publishing contracts may not set out the transfer of indeterminate future rights (Art. 119). In other words, an author cannot contract for the transfer of rights that do not yet exist in law.|$|R

Due to frequent incoherent court and municipality decisions, the lake was at threat of disappearing at a moment, because the mining company required {{to be back in}} possession, and the lake was deemed unsafe due to possible water breakthrough. The rumours in 2006 that the rights for the continuing use of quarry were sold to a certain Austrian firm were repudiated by the National park of Fruška Gora management, saying that Assembly of Vojvodina already adopted a plan to keep the lake. Ultimatively, the disputes ended in favor of retaining the lake, which presents one of pearls of the National park, and making it a touristic resort.|$|R

50|$|With {{respect to}} {{computer}} programs, databases, and industrial designs that {{are created by}} an employee {{in the course of}} her duties, the employer is exclusively entitled to exercise economic rights in the work (Arts. 12-bis, 12-ter). Likewise, where a photograph is taken in the course of duties, economic rights belong to the employer, or to the person who commissioned the portrait (Art. 88). Certain categories of works are subject to special <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights.</b> For dramatico-musical works, profit is shared among authors in proportion to the deemed value of the contribution. For example, in the case of operas, the author of the music is afforded 3/4 of the total, while the author of the lyrics is afforded 1/4 (Art. 34). In a film work, the authors of the subject matter, scenario, and music, along with the artistic director, are considered joint authors. While the <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> over the whole work belong to the producer, certain uses require the consent of the joint authors (Arts. 44-46). Broadcasting services may broadcast works that are performed in public places without the author's consent, but only if the work is not being performed for the first time. The author will in any case receive remuneration for these broadcasts (Arts. 52, 56, 57).|$|R
