50|$|Early <b>center</b> <b>caps</b> {{were usually}} either very small, or very large. They started on cartwheels and wagons and slowly evolved into {{what we know}} them as today. Many of the centercaps from the 1950s to the 1970s were made of {{stainless}} steel. The rest of the wheel was originally of wood or many fitted metal parts. In modern times, <b>center</b> <b>caps</b> are both metal and plastic, and are typically used with aluminum alloy or styled steel wheels. Some full wheel covers use removable <b>center</b> <b>caps,</b> typically those retained by lug nuts, with the <b>center</b> <b>cap's</b> purpose to hide the lug nuts that are securing the wheel to the vehicle's hub.|$|R

50|$|A <b>center</b> <b>cap,</b> or centercap is a {{decorative}} disk on an automobile wheel that covers a central {{portion of the}} wheel. Early center caps for automobiles were small and primarily served the purpose of keeping dirt away from the spindle nut and wheel bearings of vehicles. Center caps are often found on new cars to hide the lug nuts, and/or the bearing. Center caps are a type of hubcap, the other primary type being wheel covers. Some modern center caps are retained to the wheel using spring clips, while others are retained by the wheel lugs or other threaded fasteners.|$|E

50|$|The {{residual}} southern ice cap is misplaced. That is, {{it is not}} {{centered on}} the south pole. However, the south seasonal cap is centered near the geographic pole. Studies {{have shown that the}} off <b>center</b> <b>cap</b> is caused by much more snow falling on one side than the other. On the western hemisphere side of the south pole a low pressure system forms because the winds are changed by the Hellas Basin. This system produces more snow. On the other side, there is less snow and more frost. Snow tends to reflect more sunlight in the summer, so not much melts or sublimates (Mars climate causes snow to go directly from a solid to a gas). Frost, on the other hand has a rougher surface and tends to trap more sunlight, resulting in more sublimation. In other words, areas with more of the rougher frost are warmer.|$|E
