5|$|Australian <b>Crawl</b> (often called Aussie <b>Crawl</b> or The <b>Crawl</b> by fans) were an Australian {{rock band}} founded by James Reyne (lead vocals/piano), Brad Robinson (rhythm guitar), Paul Williams (bass), Simon Binks (lead guitar) and David Reyne (drums) in 1978. David Reyne soon left and was {{replaced}} by Bill McDonough (drums, percussion). They were later joined by his brother Guy McDonough (vocals, rhythm guitar). The band was named after the front <b>crawl</b> swimming style also known as the Australian <b>crawl.</b>|$|E
5|$|Australian <b>Crawl</b> was an Australian surf / pop rock band. The band {{released}} four studio albums, two live albums, six compilations, seventeen singles, one extended play, {{and three}} video albums. These include releases credited to Australian <b>Crawl,</b> Australian <b>Crawl</b> and James Reyne (but not his solo material), and 'Members of Australian Crawl'.|$|E
5|$|US label Geffen Records signed Australian <b>Crawl</b> {{and issued}} Semantics (1984) as an album (with the four {{songs from the}} EP and re-recordings of tracks from past Australian records) for the American market. In April 1984 Australian <b>Crawl</b> became the first Australian band to sponsor an ASP surfing competition. The Rip Curl/Australian <b>Crawl</b> Bell's Beach Surfing Festival was won by Australian surfer, Cheyne Horan.|$|E
40|$|In this article, I {{investigated}} the reliability, {{in the social}} science sense, of collecting informetric data about the World Wide Web by Web <b>crawling.</b> The investigation includes a critical examination {{of the practice of}} Web <b>crawling</b> and contrasts the results of content <b>crawling</b> with the results of link <b>crawling.</b> It is shown that Web <b>crawling</b> by search engines is intentionally biased and selective. I also report the results of a large-scale experimental simulation of Web <b>crawling</b> that illustrates the effects of different <b>crawling</b> policies on data collection. It is concluded that the reliability of Web <b>crawling</b> as a data collection technique is improved by fuller reporting of relevant <b>crawling</b> policies...|$|R
40|$|A {{collaborative}} crawler is a {{group of}} <b>crawling</b> nodes, in which each <b>crawling</b> node is responsible for a specific portion of the web. We study the problem of collecting geographically-aware pages using collaborative <b>crawling</b> strategies. We first propose several collaborative <b>crawling</b> strategies for the geographically focused <b>crawling,</b> whose goal is to collect web pages about specified geographic locations, by considering features like URL address of page, content of page, extended anchor text of link, and others. Later, we propose various evaluation criteria to qualify the performance of such <b>crawling</b> strategies. Finally, we experimentally study our <b>crawling</b> strategies by <b>crawling</b> the real web data showing that some of our <b>crawling</b> strategies greatly outperform the simple URL-hash based partition collaborative <b>crawling,</b> in which the <b>crawling</b> assignments are determined according to the hash-value computation over URLs. More precisely, features like URL address of page and extended anchor text of link are shown to yield the best overall performance for the geographically focused <b>crawling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Distributed <b>crawling</b> {{is able to}} {{overcome}} important limitations of the traditional single-sourced web <b>crawling</b> systems. However, the optimal benefit of distributed <b>crawling</b> is usually limited to the sites hosting the crawlers, {{the rest of the}} URLs are by large randomly distributed to the various crawlers. In this work, we propose a location-aware method, called IPMicra, that utilizes an IP address hierarchy, and allows <b>crawling</b> of links in a near optimal location aware manner. Our proposal outperforms earlier distributed <b>crawling</b> schemes by requiring one order of magnitude less time for <b>crawling</b> of the same set of sites...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} <b>crawling</b> and {{drilling}} microrobot actuated by an external precessional magnetic field (EPMF) to effectively unclog obstructed blood vessels. Conventional <b>crawling</b> microrobots can only generate <b>crawling</b> motions using an external oscillating magnetic field. The proposed microrobot can generate navigating (<b>crawling)</b> and drilling motions selectively or simultaneously by controlling the EPMFs. We prototyped the proposed microrobot, and conducted several experiments {{to verify the}} efficacy of the <b>crawling</b> and drilling ability of the microrobot in a tubular environment...|$|R
30|$|We {{developed}} a two-stage <b>crawling</b> process {{that includes a}} cotagging topic discovery stage and a profile-based focused <b>crawling</b> stage. Both of these stages use the page classifier extensively to avoid unnecessary <b>crawling</b> of undesired types of pages and to correctly extract the right information from the right page. The details of <b>crawling</b> are explained in Sections 7.1 and 7.2.|$|R
5|$|By early 1978 Spiff Rouch had {{separated}} into two groups: The Flatheads (including the McDonough brothers and Walker, along with Sean Higgins and Nigel Spencer) and Australian <b>Crawl.</b> The original lineup {{for the latter}} was Reyne as vocalist, Binks on lead guitar, Williams on bass guitar, along with Reyne's younger brother David Reyne on drums and schoolmate Brad Robinson on rhythm guitar. Australian <b>Crawl</b> performed their first live gig in October 1978 and toured the pub circuit.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses have {{a closed}} circulatory system, where the blood remains inside blood vessels. Octopuses have three hearts; a {{systemic}} heart that circulates blood round {{the body and}} two branchial hearts that pump it through {{each of the two}} gills. The systemic heart is inactive when the animal is swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers to <b>crawl.</b>|$|E
40|$|Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) {{have been}} widely used in the web over the last decade as they were found to be {{responsive}} and user-friendly compared to traditional web applications. RIAs use client-side scripting such as JavaScript which allows for asynchronous updates on the server-side using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). Due to the large size of RIAs and therefore the long time required for <b>crawling,</b> distributed RIA <b>crawling</b> has been introduced with the aim to decrease the <b>crawling</b> time. However, the current RIA <b>crawling</b> systems are not scalable, i. e. they are limited to a relatively low number of crawlers. Furthermore, they do not allow for fault tolerance in case that a failure occurs in one of their components. In this research, we address the scalability and resilience problems when <b>crawling</b> RIAs in a distributed environment and we explore the possibilities of designing an efficient RIA <b>crawling</b> system that is scalable and fault-tolerant. Our approach is to partition the search space among several storage devices (distributed databases) over a peer-to-peer (P 2 P) network where each database is responsible for storing only a portion of the RIA graph. This makes the distributed data structure invulnerable to a single point of failure. However, accessing the distributed data required by crawlers makes the <b>crawling</b> task challenging when the number of crawlers becomes high. We show by simulation results and analytical reasoning that our system is scalable and fault-tolerant. Furthermore, simulation results show that the <b>crawling</b> time using the P 2 P <b>crawling</b> system is significantly faster than the <b>crawling</b> time using both the non-distributed <b>crawling</b> system and the distributed <b>crawling</b> system using a single database...|$|R

50|$|Sting {{operations}} in which undercover police wait for kerb crawlers to proposition them {{are a common}} method for tackling kerb <b>crawling.</b> Kerb <b>crawling</b> is illegal in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and India. Police may also collect licence-plate numbers of vehicles {{that appear to be}} kerb <b>crawling</b> and may contact their registered owners. In the United Kingdom, kerb <b>crawling</b> was not an arrestable offense until 2001.|$|R

5|$|The {{first major}} groups of {{amphibians}} {{developed in the}} Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish. These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to <b>crawl</b> along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves {{out of the water}} and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite being able to <b>crawl</b> on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.|$|E

25|$|Deep web <b>crawling</b> also multiplies {{the number}} of web links to be <b>crawled.</b> Some {{crawlers}} only {{take some of the}} URLs in <ahref="URL"> form.

5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are {{four types of}} larvae, but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the larvae to move. After {{swimming}} {{for a few days}} the larvae sink and <b>crawl</b> until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.|$|E
5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae <b>crawl</b> into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to <b>crawl</b> and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
40|$|The main {{aim of the}} Service-Finder {{project is}} the {{development}} of a Web Service search engine on Web scale. At the heart of this search engine is the Service-Crawler, a focused crawler build on top of the open-source crawler Heritrix. Within this deliverable we provide a general overview on <b>crawling,</b> introducing the basic <b>crawling</b> steps, explaining state-of-the-art <b>crawling</b> strategies and types and mentioning important issues that appear when <b>crawling</b> the Web. We compare two state-of-the-art <b>crawling</b> frameworks in detail, explain why we use Heritrix as our underlying <b>crawling</b> framework and show how we extend it to fulfill our needs that are targeted to the search of Web Services and related information. The deliverable provides details about our Web Service <b>crawling</b> techniques, i. e. how do we collect seed URLs, how do we identify services on the Web, how do we identify related information to those services and how can we use this information to enable an optimized URL and Queue Scheduling at the crawler.

Old concept art from Combat Evolved was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they <b>crawl</b> and swim faster than females.|$|E
