5|$|Harris {{started off}} 2002 with the U-19 {{national}} {{team at the}} ARCO Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California in late January for a training camp.

In addition, flash flood and mudslide warnings were issued for western Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua starting on October 21.|$|E
5|$|While {{over the}} southwestern Caribbean Sea, Odette dropped heavy rainfall, {{including}} {{prior to its}} formation. For several days, the storm caused rains in Panama, <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> <b>and</b> {{the east coast of}} Nicaragua.

5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> <b>and</b> eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, and so they are often infested with maggots.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Venezuela, Bret first {{affected}} Trinidad and Tobago, causing minor {{flooding and}} power outages. It passed {{just south of}} Curaçao, where the storm damaged the coral reef and the roofs of 17homes. The storm later brushed northern Colombia, killing one person there, before hitting Central America. In Nicaragua, Bret killed 31people and left US$3million in damage, with many coastal towns isolated by floods. There was one death in neighboring <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica</b> <b>and</b> seven in Honduras, all due to flooding. In Central America, damage was compounded by Hurricane Gert moving through the region in early September.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Pulveroboletus ravenelii grow {{on the ground}} singly, scattered, or in groups in woods under conifers. Preferred {{mycorrhizal}} plant hosts include pine, hemlock, and rhododendron. Fruiting occurs from July to October. In North America, it is distributed from eastern Canada extending south to the Gulf of Mexico, and west to Texas, Michigan, and California. The bolete was reported from a Mexican beech (Fagus mexicana) forest in Hidalgo, Mexico in 2010. It has also been recorded from <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica</b> <b>and</b> Colombia. In Asia, {{it has been found}} in Indonesia and China. It has also been recorded from northeast Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} {{wave that}} would become John moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 17. It entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 24, and quickly showed signs of organization. That night, Dvorak classifications were initiated on the system while it was just west of <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> <b>and</b> it moved west-northwestward at 10–15mph (15–25km/h). Conditions appeared favorable for further development, and convection increased late on August 26 over the area of low pressure. Early on August 27, the system became much better organized about 250miles (400km) south-southwest of Guatemala, although convection remained minimal. Early on August 28, banding increased within its organizing convection, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Eleven-E.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Sutorius eximius {{grow in the}} soil singly or {{scattered}} among leaf litter. A mycorrhizal species, the bolete has been recorded growing in association with plants from various genera, including Dicymbe, Dipterocarpus, Fagus, Hopea, Quercus, Shorea, and Tsuga. The species has been recorded from North America, <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> <b>and</b> Indonesia. In Costa Rica, where it usually associates with the endemic oaks Quercus seemannii and Q.copeyensis, the lilac-brown bolete can be locally abundant in the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera de Talamanca. Additional locations with collections {{that have not been}} confirmed by DNA analysis include Guyana, Japan, China. Although S.eximius has been reported from Thailand, molecular analysis of Thai collections suggests that they represent a distinct, as-yet unnamed species.|$|E
