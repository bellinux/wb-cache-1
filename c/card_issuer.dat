25|$|Citi Branded Cards is the world's largest credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> {{issues a}} credit card to a {{customer}} at the time or after an account has {{been approved by the}} credit provider, which need not be the same entity as the <b>card</b> <b>issuer.</b> The cardholders can then use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card. When a purchase is made, the cardholder agrees to pay the <b>card</b> <b>issuer.</b> The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a receipt with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a personal identification number (PIN). Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a card not present transaction (CNP).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fees {{paid by the}} card holder, merchants must also pay interchange fees to the card-issuing bank and the card association. For a typical credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer,</b> interchange fee revenues may represent {{about a quarter of}} total revenues.|$|E
50|$|Rede history {{dates back}} to 1970, when Citibank, who is among the largest {{financial}} institutions and credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> worldwide, along with Banco Itaú and Unibanco (currently Itau Unibanco), who are among the largest financial institutions and credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> in Brazil, gathered to found Credicard. Credicard´s activities included those of a credit <b>card</b> brand, an <b>issuer</b> and a merchant acquirer and payment processor.|$|R

50|$|The {{rule that}} the Federal Reserve issued {{went into effect}} on October 1, 2011 and capped the {{interchange}} rate paid to non-exempt <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> at 0.05 percent plus twenty-one cents. The rule also allowed these non-exempt <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> to earn an additional one-cent fraud prevention adjustment for implementation of fraud prevention policies.|$|R
25|$|In September 2001, Freeh was {{appointed}} {{to the board of directors}} of credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> MBNA; he also served as the bank's general counsel, as well as corporate secretary and ethics officer. Likewise, Bristol-Myers Squibb elected him to its board of directors.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} area is {{the universal}} default feature of many North American credit card contracts. When a cardholder is late paying a particular credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer,</b> that card's interest rate can be raised, often considerably. With universal default, a customer's other credit cards, for which the customer may be current on payments, may also have their rates and credit limit changed. The universal default feature allows creditors to periodically check cardholders' credit portfolios to view trade, allowing these other institutions to decrease the credit limit or increase rates on cardholders who may be late with another credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer.</b> Being late on one credit card will potentially affect all the cardholder's credit cards. Citibank voluntarily stopped this practice in March 2007 and Chase stopped the practice in November 2007.|$|E
25|$|JPMorgan Chase raised $10billion {{in a stock}} sale {{to cover}} writedowns and losses after taking on {{deposits}} and branches of Washington Mutual. Through the acquisition, JPMorgan now owns the former accounts of Providian Financial, a credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> WaMu acquired in 2005. The company announced plans to complete the rebranding of Washington Mutual branches to Chase by late 2009.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an artificial}} payment card market {{in which we}} model the interactions between consumers, merchants and competing <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> {{with the aim of}} determining the optimal pricing structure for <b>card</b> <b>issuers.</b> We allow <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> to charge consumers and merchants fixed fees, provide net benefits from card usage and engage in marketing activities. The demand by consumers and merchants is only affected {{by the size of the}} fixed fees and the optimal pricing structure consists of a sizeable fixed fee to consumers, no fixed fee to merchants, negative net benefits to consumers and merchants as well as a high marketing effort...|$|R
50|$|In 2006 the Office of Fair Trading {{issued a}} {{statement}} which concluded that credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> were levying penalty charges when customers exceeded their maximum spend limit and / or made late payments to their accounts. In the statement, the OFT recommended that credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> set such fees at a maximum of £12.|$|R
50|$|Most {{banks and}} other {{credit-granting}} organisations subscribe {{to one or more}} of these organisations to ensure the quality of their lending. This includes companies who sell goods or services on credit such as credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers,</b> utility companies and store <b>card</b> <b>issuers.</b> Subscribing organisations are expected to provide relevant data to maintain the common data pool.|$|R
25|$|The {{cardholder}} of a {{secured credit}} card is still {{expected to make}} regular payments, as with a regular credit card, but should they default on a payment, the <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> has the option of recovering {{the cost of the}} purchases paid to the merchants out of the deposit. The advantage of the secured card for an individual with negative or no credit history is that most companies report regularly to the major credit bureaus. This allows building a positive credit history.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 2005, Bank of America {{announced}} it would purchase credit card giant MBNA for $35billion in cash and stock. The Federal Reserve Board gave final approval to the merger on December 15, 2005, and the merger closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition of MBNA provided Bank of America a leading domestic and foreign credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer.</b> The combined Bank of America Card Services organization, including the former MBNA, had more than 40 million U.S. accounts and nearly $140billion in outstanding balances. Under Bank of America the operation was renamed FIA Card Services.|$|E
25|$|MBNA Corporation was a bank {{holding company}} and parent company of wholly owned {{subsidiary}} MBNA America Bank, N.A., headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, prior to being acquired by Bank of America in 2006. In December 2016, UK-based Lloyds Banking Group purchased MBNA from Bank of America for £1.9bn. It was the world's largest independent credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer,</b> specializing in affinity cards. MBNA was founded in 1982 as Maryland Bank, N.A., a subsidiary of Maryland National Bank. The letters N.A. stood for National Association. In 1989, Maryland Bank was renamed MBNA America Bank. MBNA Corp. spun off from Maryland National and became an independent company in 1991.|$|E
50|$|To deter {{this type}} of behavior, many credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> have stopped {{offering}} no fee balance transfers. Additionally, under pressure from various Federal agencies, <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> have raised minimum payment requirements to ensure cardholders actually pay off their balances. These changes have made it less attractive to carry debt, despite any promotional APR that may {{be included in the}} offers.|$|R
40|$|Credit lines {{offered by}} credit cards contain an option arising from {{changing}} default probabilities of cardholders. The option value can explain high credit card rates and high profits of <b>card</b> <b>issuers.</b> The <b>card</b> rate producing zero profit for <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> {{is higher than}} interest rates on most other loans because rational cardholders borrow more money when they become riskier. Furthermore, cardholders borrowing when the option {{is out of the}} money may be less responsive to credit cared rates due to higher switching costs and carelessness. <b>Card</b> <b>issuers,</b> therefore, keep <b>card</b> rates at high levels that do not fully reflect the effect of out-of-the-money borrowing and make above-normal profits.

50|$|Currently, the Interchange Fee paid to debit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> {{corresponds}} to 50% of the merchant discount rate.|$|R
25|$|In September 2003 HSBC bought Polski Kredyt Bank SA of Poland for $7.8m. In June 2004 HSBC {{expanded}} into China buying 19.9% of the Bank of Communications of Shanghai. In the United Kingdom HSBC acquired Marks & Spencer Retail Financial Services Holdings Ltd for £763m in December 2004. Acquisitions in 2005 included Metris Inc, a US credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> for $1.6bn in August and 70.1% of Dar es Salaam Investment Bank of Iraq in October. In April 2006, HSBC bought the 90 branches in Argentina of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro for $155m. In December 2007 HSBC acquired the Chinese Bank in Taiwan. In May 2008, HSBC acquired IL Investment, an Indian retail broking firm.|$|E
25|$|Many banks {{now also}} offer {{the option of}} {{electronic}} statements, either in lieu of or in addition to physical statements, which can be viewed at any time by the cardholder via the issuer's online banking website. Notification {{of the availability of}} a new statement is generally sent to the cardholder's email address. If the <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> has chosen to allow it, the cardholder may have other options for payment besides a physical check, such as an electronic transfer of funds from a checking account. Depending on the issuer, the cardholder may also be able to make multiple payments during a single statement period, possibly enabling him or her to utilize the credit limit on the card several times.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the deposit}} {{is in the}} hands of the credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> as {{security}} in the event of default by the consumer, the deposit will not be debited simply for missing one or two payments. Usually the deposit is only used as an offset when the account is closed, either at the request of the customer or due to severe delinquency (150 to 180 days). This means that an account which is less than 150 days delinquent will continue to accrue interest and fees, and could result in a balance which is much higher than the actual credit limit on the card. In these cases the total debt may far exceed the original deposit and the cardholder not only forfeits their deposit but is left with an additional debt.|$|E

5000|$|Credit card {{redlining}} is a spatially {{discriminatory practice}} among credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers,</b> of providing different amounts {{of credit to}} different areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition, rather than on economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. Scholars assess certain policies, such as credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> reducing credit lines of individuals {{with a record of}} purchases at retailers frequented by so-called [...] "high-risk" [...] customers, to be akin to redlining.|$|R
50|$|The new {{platform}} allows Microsoft {{to coordinate}} directly with {{financial institutions and}} credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> to make contactless payments on Windows-based smartphones, beginning in the United States.|$|R
25|$|Many {{credit cards}} {{can also be}} used in an ATM to {{withdraw}} money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the <b>card</b> <b>issuer.</b> Merchants do not offer cashback on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a cash advance.|$|E
25|$|Discount brands {{are often}} smaller, {{regional}} chains or independent stations, offering lower prices on gasoline. Most purchase wholesale commodity gasoline from independent suppliers {{or from the}} major petroleum companies. Lower-priced gas stations are also found at some supermarkets (Albertsons, Kroger, Ingles, Lowes Foods, Giant, Weis Markets, Safeway, Vons, Meijer, Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore, and Giant Eagle), convenience stores (7-Eleven, Circle K, Cumberland Farms, Quick Chek, Road Ranger, Sheetz and Wawa), discount stores (Walmart, Canadian Tire) and warehouse clubs (Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Wholesale Club). At some stations (such as Vons, Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club, or Sam's Club), consumers are required to hold a special membership card {{in order to be}} eligible for the discounted price, or pay only with the chain's cash card, debt card or a credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> exclusive to that chain. In some areas, such as Oregon and New Jersey, this practice is illegal, and stations are required to sell to all at the same price. Some convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K, have co-branded their stations with one of the premium brands. After the Gulf Oil company was sold to Chevron, northeastern retail units were sold off as a chain, with Cumberland Farms controlling the remaining Gulf Oil outlets in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|HSBC {{has issued}} credit cards {{processed}} through the Discover Network, and branded with the Discover logo, since its acquisition of <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> Metris in late 2005. [...] Metris had originally {{signed an agreement}} with Discover in September 2005, three months prior to the HSBC acquisition.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, in {{the event}} of fraud, the {{cardholder}} is liable for a maximum of $50 worth of fraudulent charges. Many <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> will waive this fee.|$|R
5000|$|Most credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> {{name the}} American Arbitration Association (AAA) and/or JAMS as an {{arbitration}} administrator. Before the National Arbitration Forum ceased administering new consumer arbitrations in 2009, many credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> also included it. A 2014 {{article in the}} San Francisco Chronicle stated that about 95% of consumer arbitrations in California are administered by AAA, JAMS, or [...] "Kaiser's independent administrator", according to [...] "a lobbyist for the California arbitration industry". [...] AAA and JAMS primarily hear disputes between businesses and employment disputes. [...] Consumer cases make up less than 1% of the AAA's overall caseload.|$|R
5000|$|Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography - a {{coalition}} of credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> and Internet services companies that seeks to eliminate commercial child pornography by taking action on the payment systems that fund these operations ...|$|R
2500|$|Interest charges {{vary widely}} from <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> to <b>card</b> <b>issuer.</b> Often, there are [...] "teaser" [...] rates {{in effect for}} initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can {{be as high as}} 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the {{interest}} or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as South Dakota, having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example Delaware, have very weak usury laws. The teaser rate no longer applies if the customer does not pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.|$|E
2500|$|A {{credit card}} is a payment card issued to users ({{cardholder}}s) {{to enable the}} cardholder to pay a merchant {{for goods and services}} based on the cardholder's promise to the <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> to pay them for the amounts so paid plus the other agreed charges. The <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance. [...] In other words, credit cards combine payment services with extensions of credit. [...] Complex fee structures in the credit card industry may limit customers' ability to comparison shop, help ensure that the industry is not price-competitive and help maximize industry profits. [...] Because of this, legislatures have regulated credit card fees.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2002, HSBC {{expanded}} {{further in}} the United States. Under the chairmanship of Sir John Bond, it spent £9 billion (US$15.5 billion) to acquire Household Finance Corporation (HFC), a US credit <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> and subprime lender. In a 2003 cover story, The Banker noted [...] "when banking historians look back, they may conclude that [...] was the deal of {{the first decade of}} the 21st century". Under the new name of HSBC Finance, the division was the second largest subprime lender in the US.|$|E
5000|$|Bankard (...) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> in the Philippines, issuing VISA, MasterCard, JCB and CUP credit cards. It also issued its own line of credit and debit cards in the 1990s.|$|R
25|$|MasterCard {{operates}} Banknet, {{a global}} telecommunications network linking all MasterCard <b>card</b> <b>issuers,</b> acquirers, and data processing centers {{into a single}} financial network. The operations hub is located in St. Louis, Missouri. Banknet uses the ISO 8583 protocol.|$|R
