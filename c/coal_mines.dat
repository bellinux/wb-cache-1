40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} {{inclined}} to introduce a renovated fuzzy overall evaluation model specially purposed for safety culture of <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise, which was established by us authors based on our own years’ experience in this area. The index system of <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise safety assessment here mentioned has been founded, as well as analyzing safety culture on-spot along with the duty consultants. And, then, all the fuzzy membership indexes and their degrees were to be weighed, calculated with the final evaluation results presented {{in accordance with the}} analytic hierarchy process. Furthermore, all the safety culture statuses of T <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise, S <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise and X <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise were then put into detailed analysis. The results of our application prove that the order of the safety cultural level can be as follows: X <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise <T <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise <S <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise. The safety cultural grade of T <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise and S <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise were both “qualified”, which indicate that the production could be continued. But the assessment results of X <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise is “not qualified”, and therefore its production has to be forbidden. This also shows that the fuzzy overall evaluation model is qualified for making evaluations of the safety degree of the given <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise...|$|R
