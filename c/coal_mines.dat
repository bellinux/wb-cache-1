40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} {{inclined}} to introduce a renovated fuzzy overall evaluation model specially purposed for safety culture of <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise, which was established by us authors based on our own yearsâ experience in this area. The index system of <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise safety assessment here mentioned has been founded, as well as analyzing safety culture on-spot along with the duty consultants. And, then, all the fuzzy membership indexes and their degrees were to be weighed, calculated with the final evaluation results presented {{in accordance with the}} analytic hierarchy process. Furthermore, all the safety culture statuses of T <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise, S <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise and X <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise were then put into detailed analysis. The results of our application prove that the order of the safety cultural level can be as follows: X <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise <T <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise <S <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise. The safety cultural grade of T <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise and S <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise were both âqualifiedâ, which indicate that the production could be continued. But the assessment results of X <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise is ânot qualifiedâ, and therefore its production has to be forbidden. This also shows that the fuzzy overall evaluation model is qualified for making evaluations of the safety degree of the given <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> enterprise...|$|R
