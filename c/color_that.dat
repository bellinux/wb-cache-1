5|$|By 1945, {{a divided}} highway {{designated}} Alternate US24 (US24A) was opened {{from the state}} line north to Erie. After World War II, the MSHD planned to convert several highways {{in the state to}} freeways. In planning maps from 1947, the modern I-75 corridor was included in the system that later became the Interstate Highway System. It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover <b>color,</b> <b>that</b> was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink <b>color</b> <b>that</b> fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E

5|$|Following hatching, larvae {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body <b>color</b> <b>that</b> is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E

They are Albiorix, Bebhionn, Erriapus, and Tarvos. Tarvos, as of 2009, is the most distant of Saturn's moons with a prograde orbit. The largest among these moons is Albiorix with an estimated size of about 32km.|$|E

All participants saw the same baseline color set, selected using the baseline merit function.

5|$|The tulip was {{different}} from every other flower known to Europe at that time, with a saturated intense petal <b>color</b> <b>that</b> no other plant had. The appearance of the nonpareil tulip as a status symbol at this time coincides {{with the rise of}} newly independent Holland's trade fortunes. No longer the Spanish Netherlands, its economic resources could now be channeled into commerce and the country embarked on its Golden Age. Amsterdam merchants were {{at the center of the}} lucrative East Indies trade, where one voyage could yield profits of 400%.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{characterized}} by its very small peridia (dimensions 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth x 2–4mm tall) with a <b>color</b> <b>that</b> may range from white to grey to pale buff, but never yellow – helping distinguish it from C. laeve. The peridia are , thin-walled (150–180µm at the lip, approximately 300µm thick {{at the edge of}} the lip), tomentose on the outer side and smooth on the inner side, and taper to a narrow base. The peridioles range in width between 0.5–1.25mm broad. Basidiospores have dimensions of 4–5 by 7–8µm.|$|E

5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each <b>color</b> <b>that</b> do not close up.|$|E
5|$|Iridion 3D {{features}} five {{types of}} weapons, with {{three levels of}} power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups of the <b>color</b> <b>that</b> matches the current weapon. Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one. Each weapon has advantages and disadvantages. The player starts with the red weapon, which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green weapons are inaccurate but fill the screen with shots. Purple weapons spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow torpedo-like weapons are very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly. Blue weapons, a more powerful version of Yellow weapons, are found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.|$|E
5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool <b>color</b> <b>that</b> helps during the hot summer months.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} common {{irradiation}} methods are neutron and electron bombardment.

Annealing of these stones (from 500–900°C for neutron-bombarded stones and from 500–1200°C for electron-bombarded stones) produces orange, yellow, brown, or pink. Blue to blue-green stones that are not annealed are separated from natural stones {{in the same manner}} as gamma ray-treated stones.|$|E
