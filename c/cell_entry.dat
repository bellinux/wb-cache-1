40|$|Assessing the {{statistical}} significance of an observed 2 x 2 contingency table {{can easily be}} accomplished using Fisher's exact test (FET). However, if the <b>cell</b> <b>entries</b> are continuous or represent values inferred from a continuous parametric model, then FET cannot be applied. Such tables arise frequently in areas of biostatistical research including population genetics and evolutionary genomics, where <b>cell</b> <b>entries</b> are estimated by computational methods and result in <b>cell</b> <b>entries</b> drawn from the non-negative real line R+. Simply rounding <b>cell</b> <b>entries</b> {{to conform to the}} assumptions of FET is an ill-suited approach that we show creates problems related to both type-I and type-II errors. Pearson's chi^ 2 test for independence, while technically applicable, is not often effective for these tables, as the test has several limiting assumptions that make application of this method inadvisable in many common instances (particularly with small <b>cell</b> <b>entries).</b> Here we develop a novel method for tables with continuous entries, which we term continuous Fisher's Exact Test (cFET). Through simulations, we show that cFET has a close-to-uniform distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis of independence, and more power when applied to tables where the null hypothesis is false (compared to FET applied to rounded <b>cell</b> <b>entries).</b> We apply cFET to an example from comparative genomics to confirm an overall increased evolutionary rate among primates compared to rodents, and identify several genes that show particularly elevated evolutionary rates in primates. Some of these genes exhibit signatures of continued positive selection along the human lineage since our divergence with chimpanzee 5 - 7 million years ago, as well as ongoing selection in modern humans.

This region on the open reading frame ORF contains a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon. This leads to the loss of the HIV-coreceptor function in vitro. CCR5-1 is considered the wild type and CCR5-2 is considered to be the mutant allele. Those with a heterozygous mutation for the CCR5 were less susceptible to the development of HIV.

An in-depth {{understanding of these}} interactions requires an integrated approach to the investigation of biological systems. This task can benefit {{from a combination of}} mathematical modeling and experimental validations, which is becoming increasingly indispensable for basic and applied biological research. Utilizing a combination of modeling and experimentation, we investigate mammalian <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry.</b> We begin our investigation by making predictions with a mathematical model, which is constructed based on the current knowledge of biology. To test these predictions, we develop experimental platforms for validations, which in turn can be used to further refine the model. Such iteration of model predictions and experimental validations has allowed us to gain an in-depth understanding of the <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry</b> dynamics. In this dissertation, we have focused on the Myc-Rb-E 2 F signaling pathway and its associated pathways, dysregulation of which is associated with virtually all cancers. Our analyses of these signaling pathways provide insights into three questions in biology: 1) regulation of the restriction point (R-point) in <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry,</b> 2) regulation of the temporal dynamics in <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry,</b> and 3) post-translational regulation of Myc by its upstream signaling pathways. The well-studied pathways can serve as a foundation for perturbations and tight control of <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry</b> dynamics, which may be useful in developing cancer therapeutics.

25|$|The {{concentration}} of galectin-3 is elevated in {{the circulation of}} patients with some types of cancer including breast cancer. It has also been identified bound to glycans {{on the surface of}} breast cancer cells. In cancer patients whose cancer has metastasised, galectin-3 is higher still, suggesting that this galectin has a crucial role in metastasis. Galectin-3 also binds to MUC-1, a very large transmembrane mucin, which on cancer cells changes expression from long core 2 type O-glycosylation to shorter core 1 type O-glycosylation. Core 2 glycans terminate in galactose or sialic acid, whereas core 1 is branched and has potential for large carbohydrate extensions. High levels of MUC-1 are associated with poor prognosis and increased potential of metastasis. This cancer-associated MUC-1 is a natural ligand for galectin-3. In normal cells, MUC-1 has distinct polarisation and acts as a protective barrier around the cell, reducing cell-cell interactions. In breast cancer cells, it is hypothesised that galectin-3 has high affinity for cancer-associated MUC-1, causing depolarisation and breaking the cell's protective shield. This exposes small adhesion molecules {{on the surface of the}} cell, which interact with adhesion proteins on endothelial cell walls, such as E-selectin, promoting intravastion into the blood stream. Experiments shows that overexpression of MUC-1 alone is not enough to increase metastatic potential, and in fact it inhibits tumour <b>cell</b> <b>entry</b> into the blood stream. It requires the presence of upregulated galectin-3 in addition to MUC-1 to increase invasive and metastatic properties of the cancer. This is supported by other studies showing that inhibition of galectin-3 in human breast cancer cells lose their malignancy in vitro. This may provide a clue towards developing therapeutics for cancer, such as galactin-3 inhibitors.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} {{have demonstrated}} an obligatory requirement for intracellular {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) generation during T lymphocyte activation, and have proposed that ROS may act as signalling agents in the regulation of certain cellular processes, for example, during <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry.</b> In order to test this hypothesis, we have been interested to determine which, if any, <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry</b> events are affected by oxidative signalling. Given the requirement for both oxidative signalling and altered gene expression during the G 0 to G 1 phase transition, we have attempted to establish {{the extent to which}} oxidative signalling affects global gene expression patterns during <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry,</b> and to isolate and characterize mRNAs whose expression patterns are responsive to oxidative signalling during this process.

40|$|Abstract. Contingency tables have {{provided}} a fertile ground {{for the growth of}} algebraic statistics. In this paper we briefly outline some features of this work and point to open research problems. We focus on the problem of maximum likelihood estimation for log-linear models and a related problem of disclosure limitation to protect the confidentiality of individual responses. Risk of disclosure has often been measured either formally or informally in terms of information contained in marginal tables linked to a log-linear model analysis and has focused on disclosure potential of small cell counts, especially those equal to 1 or 2.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{computation}} of Markov bases for contingency tables whose <b>cell</b> <b>entries</b> have an upper bound. In general a Markov basis for unbounded contingency table under a certain model differs from a Markov basis for bounded tables. Rapallo, (2007) applied Lawrence lifting to compute a Markov basis for contingency tables whose <b>cell</b> <b>entries</b> are bounded. However, in the process, {{one has to}} compute the universal Gröbner basis of the ideal associated with the design matrix for a model which is, in general, larger than any reduced Gröbner basis. Thus, this is also infeasible in small- and medium-sized problems. In this paper we focus on bounded two-way contingency tables under independence model and show that if these bounds on cells are positive, i. e., they are not structural zeros, the set of basic moves of all 2 × 2 minors connects all tables with given margins. We end this paper with an open problem that if we know the given margins are positive, {{we want to find}} the necessary and sufficient condition on the set of structural zeros so that the set of basic moves of all 2 × 2 minors connects all incomplete contingency tables with given margins.

We have previously shown that ectopic expression of cyclin E {{is sufficient to}} induce mitogen-independent <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry</b> {{in a variety of}} tumor/immortal cell lines. Here we have investigated the rate-limiting step leading to <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry</b> in quiescent normal human fibroblasts (NHF) ectopically expressing cyclin E. We found that in serum-starved NHF, cyclin E forms inactive complexes with CDK 2 and fails to induce DNA synthesis. Coexpression of SV 40 small t antigen (st), but not other tested oncogenes, efficiently induces mitogen-independent CDK 2 phosphorylation on Thr- 160, CDK 2 activation, and DNA synthesis. Additionally, in contact-inhibited NHF ectopically expressing cyclin E, st induces <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry,</b> continued proliferation, and foci formation. Coexpression of cyclin E and st also bypasses G 0 /G 1 arrests induced by CDK inhibitors. Although CDK 2 is dispensable for G 0 /G 1 <b>cell</b> cycle <b>entry</b> and normal proliferation in mammals, CDK 2 activity is an essential rate-limiting step in NHF with deregulated cyclin E expression and altered PP 2 A activity, which endows primary cells with transformed features. Consequently, CDK 2 could be targeted therapeutically in tumors that involve these alterations. These data also suggest that alterations prior to cyclin E deregulation facilitate proliferation of tumor cells by bypassing mitogenic requirements and negative regulation by adjacent cells...|$|R
