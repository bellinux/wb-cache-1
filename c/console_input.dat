In September 2013, Valve unveiled SteamOS, a custom Linux-based operating system they had developed specifically aimed for running Steam and games, a <b>console</b> <b>input</b> device called the Steam Controller, and the final concept of the Steam Machine hardware. Unlike other consoles, the Steam Machine does not have set hardware; its technology is implemented at the discretion of the manufacturer and is fully customizable, much like a personal computer.|$|E
50|$|In CP/M, 86-DOS, MS-DOS, PC DOS, DR-DOS, {{and their}} various derivatives, the SUB {{character}} {{was also used}} to indicate {{the end of a}} character stream, and thereby used to terminate user input in an interactive command line window (and as such, often used to finish <b>console</b> <b>input</b> redirection, e.g. as instigated by COPY CON: TYPEDTXT.TXT).|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} programming, standard streams are preconnected {{input and}} output communication channels between a computer program and its environment when it begins execution. The three I/O connections are called standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr). Originally I/O happened via a physically connected system <b>console</b> (<b>input</b> via keyboard, output via monitor), but standard streams abstract this. When a command is executed via an interactive shell, the streams are typically connected to the text terminal on which the shell is running, but can be changed with redirection, e.g. via a pipeline. More generally, a child process will inherit the standard streams of its parent process.|$|E

From 2004 to 2006, it was maintained by Linsyssoft Technologies, after which Jason Wessel at Wind River Systems, Inc. {{took over as}} the official maintainer. Ingo Molnar and Jason Wessel created a slimmed-down and cleaned up version of KGDB which was called [...] "kgdb light" [...] (without Ethernet support and many other hacks). This was the one merged into the 2.6.26 kernel.

5000|$|Subtext {{programs}} are declared and manipulated (or mutated) by adding and linking elements {{of various types}} to a syntax tree, and entering in values or names as necessary, as opposed to typing out textual programs. Due {{to the design of}} the Subtext language and environment, there is no distinction between a program's representation and its execution. Like spreadsheets, Subtext {{programs are}} live executions within an environment and runtime, and programming is direct manipulation of these executions via a graphical environment. Unlike typical functional programming languages, Subtext has simple semantics and is easily applicable to reactive systems that require mutable state, I/O, and concurrency, under a model known as [...] "Reactive Programming". <b>Console</b> <b>input</b> ("invocations") can be utilized via data flow within a Subtext program, allowing users to manipulate values interactively.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1989, {{functionality}} {{similar to}} DOSKEY was introduced with DR-DOS 3.40 with its [...] CONFIG.SYS directive. This enabled a user-configurable <b>console</b> <b>input</b> history buffer and recall {{as well as}} pattern search functionality on the console driver level, that is, fully integrated into the operating system and transparent to running applications. In the summer of 1991, DOSKEY was introduced in MS-DOS/PC DOS 5.0 {{in order to provide}} some of the same functionality. DOSKEY also added a macro expansion facility, though special support was required before applications such as command line processors could take advantage of it. Starting with Novell DOS 7 in 1993, the macro capabilities were provided by an external DOSKEY command as well. In order to also emulate DOSKEY's history buffer functionality under DR-DOS, the DR-DOS DOSKEY worked as a front end to the resident history buffer functionality, which remained part of the kernel.|$|E

50|$|The My Vision (lead=yes) is a {{home video}} game console {{developed}} by Nichibutsu and released in Japan on 1983. The system was dedicated solely to playing video versions of popular board games. The console had no controllers; instead, players used a keyboard {{on the front of}} the <b>console</b> to <b>input</b> their actions.|$|R
25|$|The PlayStation 3 version also {{includes}} various VST plugins developed by Sound Forge, adapted to run natively on the <b>console.</b> The <b>input</b> signal undergoes a vocal signal chain which includes high-pass filter, wave hammer compressor and a reverb with a 1.2 second decay.

5000|$|A DI unit is an {{electronic}} device typically used in recording studios and in sound reinforcement systems to connect a high-output impedance, line level, unbalanced output signal to a low-impedance, microphone level, balanced input, usually via an XLR connector and XLR cable. DIs are frequently used to connect an electric guitar or electric bass to a mixing <b>console's</b> microphone <b>input</b> jack. The DI performs level matching, balancing, and either active buffering or passive impedance matching/impedance bridging to minimize unwanted noise, distortion, and ground loops.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not unusual}} to see the term S-VHS {{incorrectly}} {{used to refer to}} S-Video connectors (also called Y/C connectors), even in printed material. This may be due to S-VHS having been one of the more common consumer video products equipped with the S-Video connector. However, S-Video connectors became common on many other video devices: DVD players and recorders, MiniDV and Hi8 camcorders, cable/satellite set-top boxes, TV-compatible video outputs on computers and video game <b>consoles,</b> and <b>inputs</b> on TV sets themselves.

2500|$|The main {{displays}} {{were driven}} by the Coordinated Display Equipment (CDE). Inside the CDE, a [...] telephone stepper switch was used to periodically connect {{to each of the}} displays in turn. Depending on which button was being held down on the <b>input</b> <b>console</b> at that time, the switch connected the trackball to one of 96 pairs of servomotors connected to potentiometers that were used a storage mechanism. The output of the potentiometers was sent back to the <b>input</b> <b>consoles,</b> creating a [...] "blip" [...] on the screen that matched the underlying radar data but did not move, allowing the operators to choose which blips required updating. [...] In the prototype versions, there were only three input stations allowing a total of 24 targets to be tracked, but they could also read up to eight more inputs from external sources, nominally data from other ships. A production version would have more input stations to fully expand the capabilities of the CDE.|$|R
500|$|The game {{underwent}} several {{changes during}} its development.

Urquhart later said that when development began, video games were less protected by freedom of speech laws than other media, restricting the content that could be included in The Stick of Truth. While under THQ's publishing deal, the developers planned that the Xbox 360 version would support the <b>console's</b> <b>input</b> device, Kinect, enabling players to give characters voice commands, taunt enemies, and insult Cartmanto which the character would respond. Exclusive Xbox 360 downloadable content (DLC) including the Mysterion Superhero pack and Good Times with Weapons packs each featuring a unique weapon, outfit, and special attack, and three story-based campaign expansions was announced.

40|$|Automated test {{generation}} for {{object-oriented software}} typically consists of producing sequences of calls aiming at high code cov-erage. In practice, {{the success of}} this process may be inhibited when classes interact with their environment, such as the file sys-tem, network, user-interactions, etc. This leads to two major prob-lems: First, code that depends on the environment can sometimes not be fully covered simply by generating sequences of calls to a class under test, for example when execution of a branch depends on the contents of a file. Second, even if code that is environment-dependent can be covered, the resulting tests may be unstable, i. e., they would pass when first generated, but then may fail when exe-cuted in a different environment. For example, tests on classes that make use of the system time may have failing assertions if the tests are executed at a different time than when they were generated. In this paper, we apply bytecode instrumentation to automati-cally separate code from its environmental dependencies, and ex-tend the EVOSUITE Java test generation tool such that it can ex-plicitly set the state of the environment as part of the sequences of calls it generates. Using a prototype implementation, which han-dles a wide range of environmental interactions such as the file system, <b>console</b> <b>inputs</b> and many non-deterministic functions of the Java virtual machine (JVM), we performed experiments on 100 Java projects randomly selected from SourceForge (the SF 100 cor-pus). The results show significantly improved code coverage — in some cases even in the order of + 80 %/+ 90 %. Furthermore, our techniques reduce the number of unstable tests by more than 50 %...|$|R

40|$|Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) {{is widely}} used in area of {{geologic}} exploration, hidden stationary subject detection and quality inspection on various infrastructures. The pulse generator, which offers very accurate timing information, is the most cardinal component in GPR systems. It is easy to design a pulse generator which produces pulse with pre-settled peak value and pulse width in nanosecond scale. However, since the system is working in complicated environments, various pulses in different pulse widths and amplitudes are needed. In this background, pulse generators in tunability and stability are precious in value and universal in use. Indeed, a few adaptive high voltage pulse signal generators in UWB circuit level have been developed. A pulse generator with tunable pulse width and controllable voltage amplitude is proposed under these demands. The proposed circuit implementation combines System-On-Chip (SOC) design with Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design because we intend to realize modulation separately. We also design an easy <b>input</b> <b>console</b> named Binary <b>Input</b> Array in the research to realize control simplicity. Furthermore, we employ mathematical model to optimize parameters in each component {{in order to have}} an improved performance.

5000|$|Passive direct boxes first {{appeared}} in the United States in the middle 1960s, most notably in Detroit at radio stations and recording studios like [...] "Motown", [...] "United Sound Systems", [...] "Golden World Records", Tera Shirma Studios and the Metro-Audio Capstan Roller remote recording truck. These DIs were custom made by engineers like Ed Wolfrum with his [...] "Wolfbox" [...] and by concert sound companies to solve certain problems associated with amplifying electronic musical instruments, especially electric guitars. These boxes typically contained an audio transformer (like the Triad A11J through 1974) with a turns ratio from approximately 8:1 to 12:1, and thus an impedance ratio of around 144:1. With this kind of transformer, the output voltage of the instrument is stepped down to a range compatible with the typical mixing console's microphone preamp. The typical <b>console</b> preamp <b>input</b> impedance of 1,500 ohms would appear to the electronic instrument as a high input impedance of 216,000 ohms.|$|R
