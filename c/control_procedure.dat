There {{is no need}} to enforce a total order of execution for the sake of achieving convergence. Their approach is generally to first identify and prove sufficient conditions for a few transformation functions, and then design a <b>control</b> <b>procedure</b> to ensure those sufficient conditions. This way the <b>control</b> <b>procedure</b> and transformation functions work synergistically to achieve correctness, i.e., causality and admissibility preservation.

25|$|The above CSM model {{requires}} that a total order of all {{objects in the}} system be specified. Effectively, the specification is reduced to new objects introduced by insert operations. However, specification of the total order entails application-specific policies such as those to break insertion ties (i.e., new objects inserted by two current operations at the same position). Consequently, the total order becomes application specific. Moreover, in the algorithm, the total order must be maintained in the transformation functions and <b>control</b> <b>procedure,</b> which increases time/space complexities of the algorithm.|$|E

However, {{when it comes to}} the quality <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> that they follow, three questions merit our attention: how are these quality <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> developed, are these quality <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> per se valid, and are these quality <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> strictly adhered to in routine testing operations? In other words, we need to move back to the classical question which is often raised when discussing ethics and good practice in language testing: who guards the guardians themselves (see also Boyd and Davies, 2002)? Though we didn’t examine all the documents stipulating these quality <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> in each examination board, we believe the practices that they reported, to a large extent, reflect the nature and validity of their quality <b>control</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|R

This methodology first identifies the research approach, research strategy, timelines and data collection methods. As part of the research process, a quantitative approach has been taken and a survey {{was carried out in}} relation to the collection of quantitative data {{for the purposes of the}} treatise research. The final analysis of the survey results is reflected in the conclusion of the research findings. Budget expenditure <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> provide a company with a method of control for managing actual spending against the budget. Most companies have a refined practice of budget preparation, and in the larger companies, these are implemented across all departments and carried out by respective managers. Once the budget is in place, it is the responsibility of the managers to ensure that those having expenditure authorisation adhere to it. If <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> are well managed, this allows for improved efficiency in operations and can lead to benefits in budget performance. <b>Control</b> <b>procedures</b> that are inefficient and poorly managed will inhibit budget objectives being achieved. The <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> for budget expenditure can be formulated and applied to optimise budget performance and to control budget variance. Formal budget expenditure <b>control</b> <b>procedures,</b> as part of a company’s budget strategy, can provide managers with an effective business tool that improves current budget spending <b>control</b> <b>procedures.</b> This will then result in the identification of potential efficiency gains and improve budget performance...|$|R
25|$|Operation Mongoose {{consisted}} of a program of covert action, including sabotage, psychological warfare, intelligence collection, {{and the creation of}} an internal revolution against the communist government. The U.S. still lacked the capability of effectively getting information to the majority of the Cuban people. They had a trade embargo, denial of bunkering facilities, increased port security, and <b>control</b> <b>procedure</b> on transshipment, technical data, and customs inspection. The U.S. also used diplomatic means to frustrate Cuban trade negotiations in Israel, Jordan, Iran, Greece, and possibly Japan. From the outset, Lansdale and fellow members of the SG-A identified internal support for an anti-Castro movement {{to be the most important}} aspect of the operation. American organization and support for anti-Castro forces in Cuba was seen as key, which expanded American involvement from what had mostly been economic and military assistance of rebel forces. Therefore, Lansdale hoped to organize an effort within the operation, led by the CIA, to covertly build support for a popular movement within Cuba. This was a major challenge. It was difficult to identify anti-Castro forces within Cuba and there lacked a groundswell of popular support that Cuban insurgents could tap into. Within the first few months, an internal review of Operation Mongoose cited the CIA's limited capabilities to gather hard intelligence and conduct covert operations in Cuba. By January 1962, the CIA had failed to recruit suitable Cuban operatives that could infiltrate the Castro regime. The CIA and Lansdale estimated that they required 30 Cuban operatives. Lansdale criticized the CIA effort to ramp up their activities to meet Operation Mongoose's expedient timelines. Robert McCone of the CIA complained that Lansdale's timeline was too accelerated and that it would be difficult to achieve the tasks demanded in such a short timeframe.|$|E
