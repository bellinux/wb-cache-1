5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the final polymers.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|For example, infant {{formulas}} traditionally were {{lacking the}} MFGM because this fraction is lost during regular dairy processing. However, more {{recent advances in}} technology have facilitated the separation of MFGM from the fat globule, allowing bovine MFGM to be added in concentrated form. The MFGM fraction is now commercially available and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> infant formula or other nutritional products.|$|E

Prepared {{hot chocolate}} can be purchased {{from a range of}} establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and cafes. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{features}} a multiplayer mode that supports {{up to four}} players and includes voice chat capability. In it, the player is able to control Samus or one of six other bounty hunters featured in the single-player mode. Each bounty hunter has a unique alternative form, such as Samus's Morph Ball, and a special weapon. The game host can set options for point and time limits, and restrict the use of radar. Computer-controlled players of varying skill levels <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> games if the minimum of four players is not met.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} process, PUREX (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) reprocesses {{spent nuclear fuel}} to extract plutonium and uranium {{which can be used}} to form a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons-grade plutonium <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.|$|E
5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which {{reduces the risk of}} aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted {{as a substitute for}} chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E

5|$|The {{facility}} features architecture {{intended to}} evoke {{a sense of}} calm. It was constructed with a central courtyard {{and a number of}} windows overlooking it, as well as nature-related artwork and architecture. There are also separate hallways for staff and visitors {{in order to make the}} interior appear less crowded. The hospital also features a substantial amount of parking and a shuttle service to the entrance. Miami Valley Hospital South was constructed with future expansion in mind. Two of the five floors in the patient wing are empty and can be filled adding 24 beds each. A third hallway <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the wing which will add 60 beds, and the maternity ward can also be expanded with a second floor to add 12 beds, which means the facility could be expanded to 180 beds.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the manual GTAW torches.|$|E
5|$|Within certain conditions, {{characters}} {{can perform}} Special Moves, customizable powerful moves tied to Jobs: after a Special Move is performed, the entire party is granted buffs {{for a limited}} period. This period is represented with a specific tune that plays over normal battle music. Various elements <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> Special Moves, such as granting elemental properties, launching status ailments at enemies, recovering HP and MP, and temporary status ailment immunity to the party. The customization of Special Moves is directly tied {{to the creation of}} specialist shops during the reconstruction of Norende. Experience points acquired {{at the end of a}} battle enable characters and their assigned Jobs to level up, unlocking new abilities and boosting character stats such as available HP and MP. Bonuses are gained if the party fulfilled certain conditions. Job abilities and levels can also be borrowed from online friends, in a feature called Abilink. Any Job can be borrowed from available players regardless of their current level.|$|E
