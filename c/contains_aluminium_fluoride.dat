40|$|We {{investigated}} the {{mechanism by which}} the G-protein activators <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> and vanadate stimulate arachidonic acid release in pig aortic endothelial cells. Our previous study demonstrated a novel Ca(2 +) -independent pathway of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activation stimulated by <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> in this model. In the present study, we found that sodium metavanadate stimulated a rapid concentration-dependent release of [3 H]arachidonic acid from prelabelled cells. A more than 3 -fold enhancement of arachidonic acid release was achieved in cells treated with 1 mM vanadate for 20 min. Synthesis of prostaglandin products was similarly enhanced. The release of arachidonic acid was not dependent {{on the presence of}} extracellular Ca 2 +, but did require protein synthesis de novo. Both cycloheximide and actinomycin D completely blocked aluminium fluoride- and vanadate-stimulated arachidonic acid release. Because fluoride and vanadate are known protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, it is possible that PLA 2 activation occurred secondarily to changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Both <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> and vanadate stimulated the rapid phosphorylation of 58, 93 and 120 kDa tyrosine-containing protein substrates. However, in contrast with arachidonic acid release, this response was found {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of extracellular Ca 2 + and insensitive to blockers of protein synthesis de novo. Furthermore H 2 O 2 treatment resulted in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the same substrates without a concomitant increase in arachidonic acid release. These results suggest that the effects of <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> and vanadate on PLA 2 are not due to changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, but do require rapid protein synthesis de novo...|$|R

40|$|The ideal {{aluminium}} smelting cell should operate {{at a fixed}} temperature and superheat. However, spatial and temporal operating strategies cause changes in temperature, which usually result in variations in superheat as well. Contrasting, in the long term, for mature cells the <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> consumption is fairly accurately reflected by the soda and calcium oxide contents of the primary alumina. Therefore the poor control of <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> concentration reflects the poor understanding {{of the causes of}} variation in <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> concentration and molten bath mass within the cell. The aims of this thesis were to i. 	Develop {{a better understanding of how}} the dynamics of the {{aluminium smelting}} process impact process conditions  hence bath chemistry ii. 	Subsequently develop and evaluate diagnostic models that may be used to minimise the variations in chemistry in individual operating cells The key control feature to minimise adverse effects is Superheat. The ideal aluminium smelting cell should operate at a fixed temperature and superheat. However, spatial and temporal operating strategies cause changes in temperature, which usually result in variations in superheat as well. In this thesis industrial aluminium reduction cells and their material handling and dry scrubbing operation were analysed in respect to their energy and material balance. A number of experiments were carried out to study the influence of process parameters and operations on the state and path function of a cell. Bath inventory measurements lead to a better understanding of the underlying process behaviour, and it was obvious that energy and mass balance cannot be controlled independently. With regard to the response of bath inventory, bath and liquidus temperature to pot operation, the following interesting phenomena were identified: -	some cells are active or inactive with respect to their response to <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> additions -	positive and negative voltage steps cause non-proportional changes in liquidus and bath temperatures -	the liquidus temperature, bath volume and composition can respond rapidly to changes due to alumina feeding Successful application of the results and understanding developed in this research resulted in an energy requirement reduction of 1 kWh/k...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{globular}} {{domain of}} the membrane-associated F 1 Fo-ATP synthase complex can be detached intact as a water-soluble fragment known as F 1 -ATPase. It consists of five different subunits, α, β, γ, δ and ϵ, assembled with the stoichiometry 3 : 3 : 1 : 1 : 1. In the crystal structure of bovine F 1 -ATPase determined previously at 2. 8 Å resolution, the three catalytic β subunits and the three noncatalytic α subunits are arranged alternately around a central α-helical coiled coil in the γ subunit. In the crystals, the catalytic sites have different nucleotide occupancies. One contains the triphosphate form of the nucleotide, the second contains the diphosphate, {{and the third is}} unoccupied. Fluoroaluminate complexes have been shown to mimic the transition state in several ATP and GTP hydrolases. In order to understand more about its catalytic mechanism, F 1 -ATPase was inhibited with Mg 2 +ADP and <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> and the structure of the inhibited complex was determined by X-ray crystallography. Results: The structure of bovine F 1 -ATPase inhibited with Mg 2 +ADP and <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> determined at 2. 5 Å resolution differs little from the original structure with bound AMP-PNP and ADP. The nucleotide occupancies of the α and β subunits are unchanged except that both aluminium trifluoride and Mg 2 +ADP are bound in the nucleotide-binding site of the βDP subunit. The presence of <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> is accompanied by only minor adjustments in the surrounding protein. Conclusions: The structure appears to mimic a possible transition state. The coordination of the aluminofluoride group has many features in common with other aluminofluoride–NTP hydrolase complexes. Apparently, once nucleotide is bound to the catalytic β subunit, no additional major structural changes are required for catalysis to occur...|$|R
