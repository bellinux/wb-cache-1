40|$|In the {{emergency}} department, <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> occur in clinical handover {{due to the}} urgent, changing and unpredictable nature of care provision. We present a case report of a female patient who was assaulted, and identify how various factors interacted to produce <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> at multiple clinical handovers, leading to a poor patient outcome. Several handovers created many <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> at diverse time points. The bedside medical handover produced misunderstandings during verbal exchange of information between emergency department consultants and junior doctors, and there was miscommunication involving plastic registrars. There was a failure in adequately informing the general practitioner and the patient relating to follow-up care after discharge. Deficiencies of communication occurred with conveying changes in an investigative report. Communication could be improved by dividing the conduct of handover in a quiet room and at the bedside, ensuring multiple sources of information are used and encouraging role-modelling behaviours for junior clinicians...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} {{structured}} team briefings improve operating room communication. Design, Setting, and PARTICIPANTS: This 13 -month prospective study used a preintervention/postintervention design. All staff and trainees {{in the division}} of general surgery at a Canadian academic tertiary care hospital were invited to participate. Participants included 11 general surgeons, 24 surgical trainees, 41 operating room nurses, 28 anesthesiologists, and 24 anesthesia trainees. INTERVENTION: Surgeons, nurses, and anesthesiologists gathered before 302 patient procedures for a short team briefing structured by a checklist. Main Outcome Measure The primary outcome measure {{was the number of}} <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> (late, inaccurate, unresolved, or exclusive communication) per procedure. <b>Communication</b> <b>failures</b> and their consequences were documented by 1 of 4 trained observers using a validated observational scale. Secondary outcomes were the number of checklist briefings that demonstrated 2 ̆ 2 utility 2 ̆ 2 (an effect on the knowledge or actions of the team) and participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the briefing experience. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two procedures were observed (86 preintervention, 86 postintervention). The mean (SD) number of <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> per procedure declined from 3. 95 (3. 20) before the intervention to 1. 31 (1. 53) after the intervention (P 3 ̆c. 001). Thirty-four percent of briefings demonstrated utility, including identification of problems, resolution of critical knowledge gaps, decision-making, and follow-up actions.

2500|$|The {{required}} power line is configured in de-icing mode {{after being separated}} from their AC circuit. Then, a line de-icing circuit is created {{by a set of}} [...] disconnect switches controlled by the DCU which [...] sends all of the commands to the de-icing converter. The DC current is slowly raised to reach the desired level of current. The de-icing disconnect switches are opened, and the DCU then releases the power line back to the AC network. The lines to be de-iced must stay in normal operation during the entire period of DCU development and start-up. The final installation of the SVC/ de-icer requires a de-icing line equipment pre-operational testing before being installed.The lines being de-iced must stay in normal operation during the start-up as well as throughout the whole period of DCU development. This system is rarely used, only for critical conditions as the operators would be under heavy stress and the man-machine interface (MMI) must be on guided mode. For the five lines being de-iced, there are 13 line topologies that have between 40 and 90 actions per line to be performed during the de-icing process. Out of the five lines, four have three de-icing circuit topologies and the other one only has one. The DCU must offer the possibility to manually confirm the equipment’s state to the operator in order to continue the process as there is always a chance of <b>communication</b> <b>failure.</b> Flexible stimulation sequences used for control logic and MMI validation, pre-operational testing and operator training are required for line equipment and SVC. For 735 kV lines, de-icing takes place in three steps while 315 kV double circuit lines only need one. A DCU supervises and coordinates all the actions required for de-icing each line in order to provide network security and ensure the de-icing sequences are reliable.|$|E

Thus, during this time span, both agents have active copies of the message that they will try to deliver.

40|$|SummaryExisting {{evidence}} suggests that <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> are common in the operating room, and that they lead to increased complications, including infections.

A growing body of literature points out that while the physical act of “checking the box” may not necessarily prevent all adverse events, the checklist is a scaffold on which attitudes toward teamwork and communication can be encouraged and improved. Recent evidence reinforces the fact the compliance with the checklist is critical for the effects on patient safety to be realized...|$|R

40|$|Effective Information {{transfer}} and Communication {{is one of}} the key aspects of good medical practice and essential for surgical safety. High reliability organisations such as aviation have highlighted the importance of communication for safety and regularly provide communication skills training to their team members via Crew resource management (CRM) module. This report discusses important aspects of communication research in high-risk environments and confers its application in surgery. It analyses the nature and scope of <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> in surgical field. The thesis has taken bottom-up approach unlike other research in this field, which has taken a top-down approach. First we have mapped and analysed the <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> across the entire surgical pathway. Analysis of full pathway is critical as <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> are not discrete events; information loss in one phase of care can potentially compromise safety in a subsequent phase. After the analysis, user-centred interventions were developed and implemented to enhance the information {{transfer and}} communication in the postoperative handover phase. Results show that information transfer and <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> are ubiquitous and distributed across the continuum of surgical care. These findings indicate that there is a room for improvement for enhancing ITC in surgical care. There is an imminent need for standardizing and structuring communication through use of checklists, proformas, care pathways and information technology. Subsequently we have demonstrated that standardization of ITC process through the implementation of postoperative handover proforma has improved the information transfer and decreased the ITC errors. It is hoped that this thesis provides a first step towards understanding, assessing and improving information transfer and communication through entire surgical care pathway, which in a long run will improve surgical safety.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} leader election in virtual traffic lights. A virtual traffic light (VTL) is a self-organizing traffic control system that allows road vehicles equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication facilities to implement the function of a traffic light {{without the support of}} a roadside installation. Previous research has shown {{that it is impossible to}} construct a leader election protocol that guarantees agreement among the participating vehicles in the presence of massive <b>communication</b> <b>failures.</b> The paper {{addresses the}} problem of calculating the probability of disagreement in situations where a large number of protocol messages are lost due to communication interference, so-called communication greyouts. To this end, we present a probabilistic analysis of a family of simple round-based consensus algorithms that solve the 1 - of-n selection problem. We propose to use these algorithms for the core logic of a VTL leader election protocol (LEP). Our analysis shows that the probability of disagreement depends on: i) the number of vehicles involved in the leader election, ii) the number of rounds of message exchange, iii) the probability of message loss, and iv) the decision criterion used by the LEP. We propose an optimistic and a pessimistic decision criteria for the proposed 1 -of-n selection algorithms. The analysis encompass two probabilistic failure models, one for symmetric <b>communication</b> <b>failures</b> and one for asymmetric <b>communication</b> <b>failures...</b>|$|R
