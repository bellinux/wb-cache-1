5000|$|Nimbostratus is a {{stratiform}} genus formerly {{classified as}} [...] "Family C" [...] low-level, but now {{considered by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to be a middle- or multi-level stratus type.. Although it is usually a low-based cloud, it actually forms most commonly in the middle level of the troposphere and then spreads vertically into the low and high levels. This <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification</b> would once have made it a [...] "Family D" [...] cloud, but this style of nomenclature was discontinued by the WMO in 1956. Nimbostratus usually produces precipitation over a wide area. Nimbo- is from the Latin word nimbus, which denotes precipitation. It has a diffuse cloud base generally found anywhere from near surface in the low levels to about 3000 m in the middle level of the troposphere. Although usually dark at its base, it often appears illuminated from within to a surface observer. [...] Nimbostratus usually has a thickness of about 2000 m. Though found worldwide, nimbostratus occurs more commonly in the middle latitudes. [...] It is coded CM2 on the SYNOP report.|$|E

50|$|Variations in the {{population}} of Tur Langton, although potentially caused by natural birth and death rates, may be a consequence of its <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification.</b> Before 1866, Tur Langton was classified as either a 'township' or 'chapelry' within the Church Langton parish of Leicester County, in the ancient hundred of Gartree, in the southern section of the county. Upon the opening of St Andrews church, Tur Langton was granted a modern civil parish <b>classification.</b> These <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification</b> could have altered the physical boundaries of what was seen to be Tur Langton which, in turn, may have affected population counts; for example, {{the population}} dropping under the 300 mark after the <b>classification</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> 1866. Other peaks or dips in population from this date on are most likely due to either natural variations in birth and death rates or further minor boundary changes.|$|R

5000|$|Domar {{concentrates}} {{the testing}} of his model on historical analysis of serfdom and slavery in Russia, Poland-Lithuania, Western Europe, and the United States. [...] Domar’s analysis of Russia looks at pre-1550, where Russian peasants were free men, and 100 years later, where Russian peasants were serfs. (Domar, 8) Domar states that the relevant factors contributing to this <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification</b> were the number of servants required by {{the military and the}} population density. (Domar, 8) In {{the second half of the}} 15th century, the Russian government began distributing land, depopulating the central areas of the country. By the start of the 17th century, a high land/labor ratio was present in addition to the governmental need to create a large class of servants, which caused a large increase in serfdom levels in Russia into the 19th century. (Domar, 11) In Poland-Lithuania, relevant factors leading to the increase in slavery and serfdom started in the 14th century with a conquering of Ukrainian land, leading to a much higher land/labor ratio in the newly expanded region. (Domar, 11-12) In addition, the immigration out of the central areas and into the more peripheral areas of the state led to a more homogenous land/labor ratio throughout the entire state. (Domar, 12) In his analysis of serfdom in Western Europe, Domar suggests that depopulation of the late Rome Empire created a large increase in the land/labor ratio, creating a situation in which the development of serfdom rose as a subsequent effect of an increasing land/labor ratio due to a decreasing population. (Domar, 13) The end of the 13th century in Western Europe is met by a sharp decline in serfdom, which Domar attributes to overpopulation, a large surplus of labor, and thus a very low land/labor ratio. [...] Additionally, this economic model plays an incredibly important role in the analysis of the causes of slavery in the Colonial American South. Domar states that the American South demonstrated abundant free land and large scale agriculture, but not abundant free labor. In contrast, the American North demonstrated abundant free land and abundant free labor, but not large scale agriculture. The American South during the colonial period was characterized by vast amounts of fertile land that was largely uninhabited previous to colonization, and sparsely populated during colonization. (Domar, 16) Domar attributes the importation of slaves to the American South as an economic need for labor due to such a high land/labor ratio. Domar qualifies the difference in popularity of slavery in the American South relative to the American North to political and social objections, as well as a potential for increased adaptability of slaves to the warmer climate, or the increased productivity that goes along with longer and more fruitful seasons in the south due to the temperature.

40|$|ObjectivePast {{research}} is inconsistent in {{the stability of}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses. The authors therefore sought to examine the proportion of children identified from a population-based surveillance system that had a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification</b> from ASD to non-ASD and factors associated with such changes. MethodsChildren with a documented age of first ASD diagnosis noted in surveillance records by a community professional (n = 1392) were identified from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network. Children were considered to have a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification</b> if an ASD was excluded {{after the age of}} first recorded ASD diagnosis. Child and surveillance factors were entered into a multivariable regression model to determine factors associated with diagnostic change. ResultsOnly 4 % of our sample had a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification</b> from ASD to non-ASD noted in evaluation records. Factors associated with <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification</b> from ASD to non-ASD were timing of first ASD diagnosis at 30 months or younger, onset other than developmental regression, presence of specific developmental delays, and participation in a special needs classroom other than autism at 8 years of age. ConclusionsOur results found that children with ASDs are likely to retain an ASD diagnosis, which underscores the need for continued services. Children diagnosed at 30 months or younger are more likely to experience a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification</b> from ASD to non-ASD than children diagnosed at 31 months or older, suggesting earlier identification of ASD symptoms may be associated with response to intervention efforts or increased likelihood for overdiagnosis.

40|$|SummaryRationaleIn November 2005, the American Thoracic and European Respiratory Societies jointly {{published}} a statement proposing a new interpretation scheme for pulmonary function tests. The practical effect of adoption {{of these new}} guidelines {{has not yet been}} studied. The purpose of the current study was to address the effects of the new interpretation strategy on the relative distribution of obstructive and restrictive diagnoses in patients evaluated at a single academic medical center laboratory. Patients/MethodsPulmonary functions tests from 319 patients were analyzed according to four different interpretation schemes. The number of patients classified according to each as obstructed, restricted, neither, or both were compared, and factors associated with a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification</b> using the different approaches were examined. ResultsAlthough similar proportions of patients were identified as restricted using either the “GOLD” scheme (23 %) or new approaches (22 %), significantly more (P< 0. 005) were defined as obstructed using the newly proposed scheme (44 % versus 33 %). Additionally, 36 % of subjects defined as obstructed using either the traditional or new schemes were classified differently (i. e., either “gained” or “lost” the diagnosis of obstruction) using the new approach. Women were significantly {{more likely than men to}} have a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>classification.</b> ConclusionsThe new interpretation scheme leads to a diagnosis of obstruction in a greater proportion of patients undergoing pulmonary function testing. The clinical significance of this finding has not yet been validated, and its economic impact remains to be assessed...|$|E
