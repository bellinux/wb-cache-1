40|$|Background A {{condition}} to predict unbiased estimated breeding values by best linear unbiased prediction {{is to use}} simultaneously all available data. However, this condition is not often fully met. For example, in dairy cattle, internal (i. e. local) populations lead to evaluations based only on internal records while widely used foreign sires have been selected using internally unavailable external records. In such cases, internal genetic evaluations may be less accurate and biased. Because external records are unavailable, methods were developed to combine external information that summarizes these records, i. e. external estimated breeding values and associated reliabilities, with internal records to improve accuracy of internal genetic evaluations. Two issues of these methods concern double-counting of <b>contributions</b> <b>due</b> to relationships and due to records. These issues could be worse if external information came from several evaluations, at least partially {{based on the same}} records, and combined into a single internal evaluation. Based on a Bayesian approach, the aim of this research was to develop a unified method to integrate and blend simultaneously several sources of information into an internal genetic evaluation by avoiding double-counting of <b>contributions</b> <b>due</b> to relationships and due to records. Results This research resulted in equations that integrate and blend simultaneously several sources of information and avoid double-counting of <b>contributions</b> <b>due</b> to relationships and due to records. The performance of the developed equations was evaluated using simulated and real datasets. The results showed that the developed equations integrated and blended several sources of information well into a genetic evaluation. The developed equations also avoided double-counting of <b>contributions</b> <b>due</b> to relationships and due to records. Furthermore, because all available external sources of information were correctly propagated, relatives of external animals benefited from the integrated information and, therefore, more reliable estimated breeding values were obtained. Conclusions The proposed unified method integrated and blended several sources of information well into a genetic evaluation by avoiding double-counting of <b>contributions</b> <b>due</b> to relationships and due to records. The unified method can also be extended to other types of situations such as single-step genomic or multi-trait evaluations, combining information across different traits. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|Using {{data from}} the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database, a group has found the radial {{acceleration}} traced by rotation curves could be predicted just from the observed baryon distribution (that is, including stars and gas but not dark matter).

40|$|We have {{obtained}} nonperturbative one-loop expressions for the mean energy-momentum tensor and current density of Dirac’s field on a constant electric-like background. One {{of the goals}} of this calculation is to give a consistent description of back-reaction in such a theory. Two cases of initial states are considered: the vacuum state and the thermal equilibrium state. First, we perform calculations for the vacuum initial state. In the obtained expressions, we separate the <b>contributions</b> <b>due</b> to particle creation and vacuum polarization. The latter contributions are related to the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian. Then, we study the case of the thermal initial state. Here, we separate the <b>contributions</b> <b>due</b> to particle creation, vacuum polarization, and the <b>contributions</b> <b>due</b> to the work of the external field on the particles at the initial state. All these contributions are studied in detail, in different regimes of weak and strong fields and low and high temperatures. The obtained results allow us to establish restrictions on the electric field and its duration under which QED with a strong constant electric field is consistent. Under such restrictions, one can neglect the back-reaction of particles created by the electric field. Some of the obtained results generalize the calculations of Heisenberg-Euler for energy density to the case of arbitrary strong electric fields. PACS numbers: 12. 20. Ds, 11. 15. Tk, 11. 10.
