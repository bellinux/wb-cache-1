40|$|The {{protection}} of grouper spawning aggregations {{is a global}} conservation issue: populations of many grouper species are threatened with collapse due to exploitation of this critical life history behaviour by fisheries. Effective {{protection of}} spawning aggregations requires information on spawning site fidelity, residence time and timing of arrivals at, and departures from, the site. To estimate these parameters at a spawning aggregation site at Farquhar Atoll, southern Seychelles, 12 brown-marbled groupers Epinephelus fuscoguttatus and 20 <b>camouflage</b> <b>groupers</b> E. polyphekadion were tagged with acoustic transmitters, and their presence and absence was monitored by an array of acoustic receivers positioned at the site over 2 spawning seasons (2010 / 2011 and 2011 / 2012). Spawning aggregations formed during 3 consecutive spawning months each season and overlapped spatially and temporally in the 2 species. Intra- and inter-season site fidelity was high, with 91. 7 % of tagged E. fuscoguttatus and 89. 5 % of tagged E. polyphekadion detected at the site 1 yr after tagging. The majority (2010 / 2011 : 82. 4 %, 2011 / 2012 : 80. 0 %) of fish detected in a spawning season visited the site during at least 2 spawning months. Residence time at the fish spawning aggregation site was influenced by sex (E. fuscoguttatus only) and spawning month (both species). Distinct periodicity in lunar timing of arrivals and departures was observed in both species. This study highlights the spatio-temporal scales involved during spawning aggregations of 2 long-lived, slow-growing coral reef fishes, which {{need to be considered}} for their effective management...|$|R

40|$|The aims of this {{investigation}} were to document the temporal and spatial dynamics of aggregated <b>camouflage</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus polyphekadion in Pohnpei, Micronesia, and to assess seasonal and daily patterns of spawning and reproductive behavior. <b>Camouflage</b> <b>grouper</b> aggregated and spawned adjacent to the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary (KMS), Pohnpei, Micronesia, during two consecutive months in 1998 and 1999. A combination of gonadosomatic indices, oocyte diameter analysis, and histological evidence confirmed that <b>camouflage</b> <b>grouper</b> spawned 1 - 2 days prior to full moon over an 8 - 9 h period after dusk {{in each of the}} four study months. Males entered the site approximately 7 days prior to females and color variations were frequently observed. Significant differences were detected in mean size between the sexes. A series of management initiatives was initiated by the government in the 1980 s to reduce fishing during aggregation periods, such as a March-April grouper sales ban, but these were largely ineffective. Following the 1998 - 1999 survey, several recommendations were made to halt aggregation fishing, including a commercial and subsistence catch and sales ban during spawning months, and the extension of the KMS to incorporate two additional grouper aggregations directly adjacent to it. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the population genetic structure of the commercially important <b>camouflage</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus polyphekadion (Bleeker, 1849), in the western and central Pacific Ocean to improve existing management. <b>Camouflage</b> <b>grouper</b> are widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific and form brief, seasonal, spawning aggregations that are often heavily fished. The present study examined populations sampled in 1997 - 1998 at five sites in the western central Pacific spanning a geographic distance of ∼ 5, 000 km: New Caledonia, Great Barrier Reef, Palau, Marshall Islands, and Pohnpei (Micronesia). Primer pairs were developed to examine genetic variation at three polymorphic microsatellite loci. Cluster analysis, using genetic distance, revealed three regional groupings: (1) Palau, (2) Pohnpei and the Marshall Islands, and (3) the Great Barrier Reef and New Caledonia. Highly significant allele frequency differences were observed among sites. At Pohnpei, significant allele frequency differences in successive years were also apparent, possibly related to genetic variation among cohorts or between local spawning groups. The inter-annual differences at Pohnpei suggest that there may be further genetic structuring over relatively modest distances, a finding relative to determining management units for this commercially valuable species and suggests that future studies need to incorporate possible smallscale temporal or spatial components into study design. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|To date, {{there are}} over ten hybrid {{groupers}} that have been produced, among which are crossbreeding in between orange spotted grouper (E. coioides), coral grouper (E. corallicola), mouse grouper (Cromileptes altivelis), <b>camouflage</b> <b>grouper</b> (E. polyphekadion), and red spotted grouper (E. akaara), among others (Liufu et al. 2007; Addin and Senoo 2011; Huang et al. 2014; Koh et al. 2010). TGGG are widely cited as the most successful hybrid combination, as {{it is able to}} grow quickly (Ch’ng and Senoo 2008), has a higher survival and better feeding performance (Othman et al. 2015), and is able to tolerate a wide range of rearing parameters (Shapawi et al. 2018; De et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} Great Barrier Reef {{populations of the}} long-lived grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus (brown-marbled grouper or flowery cod) was investigated using histological analyses. Evidence provided by gonad morphology and age-based demographics suggested monandric protogynous hermaphroditism. Younger age groups contained only immature and mature females, and all males were above the size and age of 100 % female maturity, consistent with secondary males derived from mature females by adult sex change. Fishing records confirmed that spawning aggregations of this species and the co-occurring Epinephelus polyphekadion (<b>camouflage</b> <b>grouper)</b> are sometimes targeted on the Great Barrier Reef. Sampling data revealed strong spawning seasonality for E. fuscoguttatus, with a relatively narrow annual spawning period (November to January). The temporal pattern of reproductive activity within the spawning period, based on occurrence of near spawning ovaries (containing hydrated oocytes), indicated spawning events may occur {{throughout much of the}} lunar cycle and only partly coincide with seasonal fishing closure periods on the Great Barrier Reef. The results indicate that protection would be enhanced by a longer seasonal closure...|$|E
40|$|Reproduction in the <b>camouflage</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus polyphekadion (Bleeker, 1849) was {{determined}} from 1073 individuals collected during a July 1997 pilot study and a 14 -mo period in 1998 - 99 in Pohnpei, Micronesia, {{with a view}} to understanding sexual pattern and reproductive seasonality and to inform fisheries management. Gonadosomatic indices, combined with histological analyses of gonads, show that fish spawn during a two consecutive month period between February and April, and that gonad maturation occurs 1 - 2 mo prior to spawning. Sexual pattern was unresolved: histological examination of 677 individuals revealed no fish undergoing transition from functional female to functional male, although direct development of some males from juveniles is suggested and males were significantly larger than females. Mean relative fecundity was estimated to be 1350 oocytes g- 1 gonad-free body weight, actual fecundity increased linearly as a function of body weight and fecundity is determinate within each aggregation period. Females spawned an average of 83 ± 17 % of their vitellogenic oocytes per month, with repeat spawning by individual females during a single aggregation period. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{the biology of}} some commercially exploited reef fishes {{with a view to}} better understanding their life histories and potential vulnerability to fishing or other threats. The focus of this research was comparative age-based demographics of tropical epinepheline serranids (or groupers) from two geographic areas: Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in the western Pacific; and the Seychelles Islands in the western Indian Ocean. The overall aim was to investigate age-based demographics and assemblage structure of tropical epinepheline serranids at multiple scales. The epinepheline fauna in the study areas was partitioned for some analyses into three behavioural groupings based on foraging pattern, crypticity and body size. The behavioural groups are cryptic serranids, roving serranids, and large mobile serranids (Chapter 1). Less is known about cryptic and large mobile serranids than roving serranids in the study areas, so candidate species from those two groups were the focus of the detailed age-based demographic analyses. A comprehensive account of epinepheline assemblages from the GBR and the Seychelles was presented (Chapter 3) using a modified visual survey technique tailored to epinepheline serranids (Chapter 2). I described and compared characteristics of epinepheline serranid faunas at a range of spatial scales from < 1 to 1000 ’s km along natural environmental and geographic gradients on the GBR and the Seychelles Islands, and provided abundance estimates for all three behavioural groups and for the almost 40 species they represent. The typical shallow-water, tropical epinepheline assemblages comprised a handful of abundant species from the cryptic or roving serranid behavioural groups, plus numerous species found only in low densities locally (i. e. rare species, less than 1 fish per 1000 m 2) from each behavioural group. All five characteristics used to describe assemblage structure (i. e. total density of epinepheline serranids; density of each behavioural group; species richness; size structure; and species distribution and abundance) varied at broad spatial scales (100 ’s to 1000 ’s km) and some at finer spatial scales (1 to 100 km). Three approaches were used to explore possible effects of fishing on densities: 1) incorporating the CRC Reef Research Centre’s Effects of Line Fishing Experiment treatments, manipulating fishing level and Marine Park zone status for GBR reefs, into the GBR regional comparison; 2) comparing reefs open and closed to fishing for Lizard outer shelf reefs; and 3) exploring abundance patterns in relation to presumed gradients of historical fishing pressure. Each approach indicated some effects of fishing on epinepheline serranids, but patterns were complex. Comparative demographic analyses were conducted for three species of cryptic serranids, E. fasciatus (blacktip grouper), E. polyphekadion (<b>camouflage</b> <b>grouper)</b> and C. argus (peacock grouper), from the GBR and the Seychelles based on age estimates derived from thin sectioned otoliths (Chapter 4). I described size and age characteristics, longevity, and patterns of growth for each species, and explored broad-scale spatial patterns in demography and the nature of size-age-density relationships for each species in the GBR and the Seychelles. Comparative analyses revealed substantial spatial variation in demographics within and among species. Hence, our ability to generalise about the demography of the cryptic serranids appears to be limited. Linking information on abundance and demography revealed that different combinations of processes may influence local populations of the three species, with the possibility of broad-scale compensatory demographic trade-offs dependent on density noted for two of the three species. Further, lifespans tended to be shorter in the Seychelles than the GBR, suggesting higher recruitment levels and predictability of environmental conditions and resources in the Seychelles than the GBR. I investigated age-specific demographic and reproductive characteristics of E. fuscoguttatus from the GBR and examined implications for resource management (Chapters 5 & 6). Epinephelus fuscoguttatus (brown-marbled grouper or flowery cod) {{is an example of a}} large mobile serranid that is widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific and features strongly in the live reef food fish trade and other reef fisheries. E. fuscoguttatus had an extended lifespan (42 yrs) and unusual reproductive ecology, such as large old females with a reproductive lifespan that may exceed 30 yrs and limited spawning in smaller, younger females until about 9 yrs and 566 mm FL. The spawning period of E. fuscoguttatus in the GBR was relatively narrow (November, December and January). Combined evidence from histological analyses and age-based demographics suggested monandric protogynous hermaphroditism, although confirmation awaits direct evidence of sex change, such as identification of transitional individuals. The two biogeographic-scale studies (Chapters 3 & 4) provided support for the idea that there are fundamental differences in the ecology and population dynamics of reef fish assemblages over biogeographic scales. The contribution of fishing to the observed patterns could not, however, be resolved categorically. While the four aged serranids shared some characteristics associated with high vulnerability to fishing, e. g. relatively slow growth and moderate to long lifespans (20 – 40 yrs), differences among them in abundance, demography and body size, and perhaps in population dynamics, suggested vulnerabilities to fishing may vary. We still lack information on many Indo-Pacific species of epinepheline serranids, and this thesis indicates at least some of these, particularly larger bodied species, may be highly vulnerable to over-fishing or other threat...|$|E
