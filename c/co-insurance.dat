25|$|Part B – After {{beneficiaries}} {{meet the}} yearly deductible of $183.00 for 2017, {{they will be}} required to pay a <b>co-insurance</b> of 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for all services covered by Part B with the exception of most lab services, which are covered at 100%—and outpatient mental health, which is currently (2010–2011) covered at 55% (45% copay). The copay for outpatient mental health, which started at 50%, is gradually decreasing over several years until it matches the 20% required for other services. They are also required to pay an excess charge of 15% for services rendered by physicians who do not accept assignment.|$|E

2500|$|The Canada Health Act {{covers the}} {{services}} of psychiatrists, who are medical doctors with additional training in psychiatry but does not cover treatment by a psychologist [...] or psychotherapist unless the practitioner is also a medical doctor. Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax (depending on the province) applies to {{the services of}} psychotherapists. Some provincial or territorial programs and some private insurance plans may cover the services of psychologists and psychotherapists, {{but there is no}} federal mandate for such services in Canada. In the U.S., the Affordable Care Act includes prevention, early intervention, and treatment of mental and/or substance use disorders as an “essential health benefit” (EHB) that must be covered by health plans that are offered through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Under the Affordable Care Act, most health plans must also cover certain preventive services without a copayment, <b>co-insurance,</b> or deductible. In addition, the U.S. Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008 mandates “parity” between mental health and/or substance use disorder (MH/SUD) benefits and medical/surgical benefits covered by a health plan. Under that law, if a health care plan offers mental health and/or substance use disorder benefits, it must offer the benefits on par with the other medical/surgical benefits it covers.|$|E

50|$|The maximum annual benefit {{limit for}} Basic Health Plans under the reform is AED150,000, {{excluding}} <b>co-insurance</b> and deductible payments. Furthermore, <b>co-insurance</b> payments {{on the part}} of the insured can be as high as 20%, and a General Practitioner will need to be seen, and a referral given, before the insured may consult with specialists.|$|E
50|$|A <b>co-insurance,</b> which {{typically}} governs non-proportional treaty reinsurance, is an excess {{expressed as a}} proportion of a claim in percentage terms and applied to the entirety of a claim. <b>Co-insurance</b> is a penalty imposed on the insured by the insurance carrier for under reporting/declaring/insuring the value of tangible property or business income. The penalty is based on a percentage stated within the policy and the amount under reported. As an example: a vessel actually valued at $1,000,000 has an 80% <b>co-insurance</b> clause but is insured for only $750,000. Since its insured value is less than 80% of its actual value, when it suffers a loss, the insurance payout will be subject to the under-reporting penalty, the insured will receive 750000/1000000th (75%) of the claim made less the deductible.|$|E

50|$|Direct {{primary care}} has been {{promoted}} by certain groups of physicians {{as a means for}} patients to save money on their primary care services, as well as other ancillary-performed services such as laboratory testing, etc. Often, there are no insurance co-pays, deductibles or <b>co-insurance</b> fees thus avoiding the overhead and complexity of maintaining relationships with insurers.|$|E
5000|$|While {{political}} risk insurance policies are sometimes manuscripted for specific situations, the major {{political risk}} insurers have standard forms for the coverages that they issue. For [...] "complex" [...] or larger investments manuscripted policies {{are the norm}} {{and there may be}} several insurers providing cover {{in the form of a}} syndication, through <b>co-insurance,</b> or perhaps with the participation of a reinsurer on a facultative basis.|$|E
50|$|DPC {{practices}} remove one of {{the financial}} barriers to accessing care whenever it is needed: the DPC annual fee often includes most or all physician services. This model does not rely on insurance co-pays, deductibles, or <b>co-insurance</b> fees, in contrast to models such as MDVIP and 1 on 1 MD, where the annual fee is structured to cover a wellness plan so that doctors may charge insurance or Medicare for most other services.|$|E

50|$|To {{supplement}} insurance reimbursements, MDVIP physicians charge patients {{an annual}} fee between $1,500 and $1,800 per year. In {{addition to this}} annual fee, patients are responsible for applicable co-pays and <b>co-insurance,</b> and maintain primary-care insurance coverage including Medicare. In contrast to the direct-care model, this revenue format, often referenced as concierge medicine, {{runs the risk of}} audit or penalty as Medicare and other private-insurance carriers cover a comprehensive wellness exam currently listed as part of the MDVIP package.|$|E
50|$|Insurance {{policies}} may {{be purchased}} utilizing several different valuation methods. These include: Replacement Cost Value (RCV), Fixed Value (Guaranteed Replacement Cost) and Actual Cash Value (ACV). Some policies will use different valuation methods {{depending upon the}} item. For example, the building may be insured at Replacement Cost Value, {{the most of the}} contents insured at Actual Cash Value and a few specific items at a Fixed Value (antiques). Policies may also include <b>co-insurance</b> clause or deductibles provisions which will impact the actual cash paid out by the insurance company.|$|E
50|$|Policy {{actions and}} {{provision}} of preventive services do not guarantee utilization.   Reimbursement {{has remained a}} significant barrier to adoption due to variances in payer and state level reimbursement policies and guidelines through government and commercial payers.  Americans use preventive services at about half the recommended rate and cost-sharing, such as deductibles, <b>co-insurance,</b> or copayments, also reduce the likelihood that preventive services will be used. Further, despite the ACA’s enhancement of Medicare benefits and preventive services, there were no effects on preventive service utilization, calling {{out the fact that}} other fundamental barriers exist.|$|E
5000|$|Coinsurance: Instead of, or in {{addition}} to, paying {{a fixed amount}} up front (a co-payment), the <b>co-insurance</b> is {{a percentage of the}} total cost that insured person may also pay. For example, the member might have to pay 20% of the cost of a surgery over and above a co-payment, while the insurance company pays the other 80%. If there is an upper limit on coinsurance, the policy-holder could end up owing very little, or a great deal, depending on the actual costs of the services they obtain.|$|E
50|$|According to a January 2006 {{article by}} Trudy Lieberman of Consumers Union, {{consumers}} can {{have up to}} 50 choices, in hundreds of combinations of deductibles, <b>co-insurance</b> (the percentage consumers pay for each drug); drug utilization techniques (trying cheaper drugs first); and drug tiers, each with their own co-payments (the flat amount consumers pay for each drug). Co-payments differ on whether people buy generic drugs, preferred brands, non-preferred brands or specialty drugs, and whether they buy from an in-network or out-of-network pharmacy. There is no standard nomenclature, so sellers can call the plan anything they want. They can also cover whatever drugs they want.|$|E
50|$|In January 2008, Freelancers Union {{was criticized}} by both {{its members and}} the press when its new Freelancers Insurance Company became the entity {{providing}} coverage to members. At that time, the Union dropped Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield {{in favor of a}} range of new options, mostly more expensive, with Anthem BC/BS remaining only as claims processing agent. Members then faced the complexity inherent in comparing the limits, exclusions, co-payments, <b>co-insurance</b> percentages, and annual and other deductibles of the various new options with those of the old plans. Throughout this process, some members were even inadvertently dropped altogether.|$|E
50|$|Part B - After {{beneficiaries}} {{meet the}} yearly deductible of $183.00 for 2017, {{they will be}} required to pay a <b>co-insurance</b> of 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for all services covered by Part B with the exception of most lab services, which are covered at 100%—and outpatient mental health, which is currently (2010-2011) covered at 55% (45% copay). The copay for outpatient mental health, which started at 50%, is gradually decreasing over several years until it matches the 20% required for other services. They are also required to pay an excess charge of 15% for services rendered by physicians who do not accept assignment.|$|E
50|$|In {{industrial}} risks it is {{also common}} for the deductible to be expressed {{as a percentage of}} the loss, often though not always, with a minimum and maximum amount. This is similar to <b>co-insurance,</b> where the company pays a certain percentage of the losses, coupled with minimum and maximum payment thresholds. For example, with a deductible of 10% with a minimum of $1,500 and maximum of $5,000, a claim of $25,000 would incur a deductible of $2,500 (i.e. 10% of the loss) and the resulting payment would be $22,500. A claim below $15,000 would incur the minimum deductible of $1,500 and a claim above $50,000 would incur the maximum deductible of $5,000.|$|E
5000|$|Medishield is a {{low cost}} {{insurance}} scheme intended for those whose savings are insufficient to meet their medical expenses. Premiums can be paid out of Medisave accounts. A new scheme, Medishield Life, was agreed by parliament in January 2015. <b>Co-insurance</b> payment rates are to be reduced from 10-20% to 3-10% and the lifetime claim limit is to be removed. Eldershield {{is part of the}} Central Provident Fund which insures against the cost of private nursing homes and related expenses. It already has more than a million policy holders. Medifund is a safety net for those who are unable to meet their assessed contribution. Risks are not pooled, so an individual may be exposed to catastrophic expenses.|$|E
5000|$|If {{insufficient}} {{coverage is}} purchased {{to rebuild the}} home, the claim's payout {{may be subject to}} a <b>co-insurance</b> penalty. In this scenario, the insured will be subject to an out of pocket fee as a penalty. Insurers use vendors to estimate the costs, including CoreLogic subsidiary Marshall Swift-Boeckh, Verisk PropertyProfile, and E2Value, but leave the responsibility ultimately up to the consumer. In 2013, a survey found that about 60% of homes are undervalued by an estimated 17 percent. In some cases, estimates can be too low because of [...] "demand surge" [...] after a catastrophe. As a safeguard against a wrong estimate, some insurers offer [...] "extended replacement cost" [...] add-ons ("endorsements") which provide extra coverage if the limit is reached.|$|E
50|$|Replacement cost {{coverage}} is designed so the policy holder {{will not have}} to spend more money to get a similar new item and that the insurance company does not pay for intangibles. For example: when a television is covered by a replacement cost value policy, the cost of a similar television which can be purchased today determines the compensation amount for that item. This kind of policy is more expensive than an Actual Cash Value policy, where the policyholder will not be compensated for the depreciation of an item that was destroyed. The total amount paid by an insurance company on a claim may also involve other factors such as <b>co-insurance</b> or deductibles. One of the champions of the replacement cost method was the Dutch professor in Business economics Théodore Limperg.|$|E
5000|$|Medigap (also Medicare {{supplement}} {{insurance or}} Medicare supplemental insurance) refers to various {{private health insurance}} plans sold to supplement Medicare in the United States. Medigap insurance provides coverage {{for many of the}} co-pays and some of the <b>co-insurance</b> related to Medicare-covered hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health care, ambulance, durable medical equipment, and doctor charges. Medigap's name is derived from the notion that it exists to cover the difference or [...] "gap" [...] between the expenses reimbursed to providers by Medicare Parts A and B for the preceding named services and the total amount allowed to be charged for those services by the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). As of 2006, 18% of Medicare beneficiaries were covered by a Medigap policy. Public-option Part C Medicare Advantage health plans and private employee retiree insurance provides a similar supplemental role for almost all other Medicare beneficiaries not dual eligible for Medicaid.|$|E
5000|$|Under recent rules (the coordinated {{consultation}} procedure, in French: [...] "parcours de soins coordonné"), general practitioners ("médecin généraliste" [...] or [...] "docteur") {{are expected}} to act as [...] "gate keepers" [...] who refer patients to a specialist or a hospital when necessary. However the system offers free choice of the reference doctor, which is not restricted to only general practitioner and may still be a specialist or a doctor in a public or private hospital. The goal is {{to limit the number}} of consultations for the same illness. The incentive is financial in that expenses are reimbursed at much lower rates for patients who go directly to another doctor (except for dentists, ophthalmologists, gynaecologists and psychiatrists); vital emergencies are still exempt from requiring the advice from the reference doctor, which will be informed later. As costs are borne by the patient and then reimbursed (most of the time on the spot as all doctors and drugstores can read the [...] "Carte Vitale", a smart card with all information on the patient and the <b>co-insurance</b> company) , patients have freedom of choice of where to receive health care services.|$|E
5000|$|The Canada Health Act {{covers the}} {{services}} of psychiatrists, who are medical doctors with additional training in psychiatry but does not cover treatment by a psychologist [...] or psychotherapist unless the practitioner is also a medical doctor.

Under the Affordable Care Act, most health plans must also cover certain preventive services without a copayment, <b>co-insurance,</b> or deductible. In addition, the U.S. Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008 mandates “parity” between mental health and/or substance use disorder (MH/SUD) benefits and medical/surgical benefits covered by a health plan. Under that law, if a health care plan offers mental health and/or substance use disorder benefits, it must offer the benefits on par with the other medical/surgical benefits it covers.|$|E
5000|$|The MHPA {{applies to}} group health plans for plan years {{beginning}} on or after January 1, 1998. [...] The original sunset provision {{provided that the}} parity requirements would not apply to benefits for services furnished on or after September 30, 2001. It was extended six times, with the final extension running through December 31, 2007. Insurers promptly were able to [...] "circumvent" [...] the consumer protections arguably intended in the legislation by imposing maximum numbers of provider visits and/or caps {{on the number of}} days an insurer would cover for inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations. In essence, the law had little or no effect on mental health coverage by group insurance plans. The rider on TARP prohibits all group health plans that offer mental health coverage from imposing any greater limit on co-pays, <b>co-insurance,</b> numbers of visits, and/or number of days covered for hospital stays due to mental health conditions. The rider legislation was the culmination of a long campaign fought by Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-MN) and his successors to enact mental health parity at the federal level. The new law's requirements will be phased in over several years. Still unsure is whether non-"biologically-based" [...] mental illnesses such as PTSD and eating disorders are mandated to be covered by the new law.|$|E

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{result in}} the medical insurance literature is that zero <b>co-insurance</b> is never second-best for insurance contracts subject to moral hazard. We replace the usual expected utility assumption with {{a version of the}} rank-dependent utility (RDU) model that has greater experimental support. When consumers exhibit such preferences, we show that zero <b>co-insurance</b> may in fact be optimal, especially for low-risk consumers. Indeed, it is even possible that the first-best and second-best contracts are identical. In this case, there is no “market failure”, despite the informational asymmetry. We argue that these RDU results are in better accord with the empirical evidence from US health insurance markets.
