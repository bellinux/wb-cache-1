50|$|Under {{the rule}} of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin, the area was {{developed}} into a deepwater port {{to assist in the}} development of the country. Since 1973, Muara Port has undergone extensive improvements. These include extensions to the wharf bringing the total length to 948 meters including 250 meters dedicated <b>container</b> <b>wharf</b> and 87 metres aggregate wharf. The overall storage space in the form of covered storage is 16,950 square meters, long storage warehouses 16,630 square meters and open storage space 5 hectares. Facilities for the dedicated <b>container</b> <b>wharf</b> covers an area of 92,034 square meters including 8,034 square metres covered areas.|$|E
50|$|The Balmain {{plant was}} wound {{down from the}} 1970s, having lost its {{waterfront}} and glycerine plant to the <b>container</b> <b>wharf</b> development at White Bay. Production eventually ceased in 1988. Together with the adjoining Ampol site, the area was sold in 1996 {{for the development of}} the Watervale, Dockside and Somerset Mews apartment complexes. Like many of the other Balmain industries such as the former Balmain Power Station, the Colgate-Palmolive Factory, and the many shipyards, boilermakers and docks scattered about the Balmain foreshores, the Lever Brothers Factory lost out to the ever-increasing property values in the area.|$|E
40|$|Playing an {{important}} role in local and national seaport activities, <b>container</b> <b>wharves</b> are susceptible to structural failure and damage during earthquake events. Therefore, factors that affect the seismic response of crane–wharf structures under different types of earthquake ground motions should be elucidated. In this paper, 3 D finite element models were established to investigate the differences of natural vibration characteristics between the wharf and crane–wharf structures. The dynamic response of a typical pile-supported wharf structure and the interaction behavior of a crane and wharf structural system under seismic actions of near-field and far-field ground motions were studied by performing numerical simulation and time-history response analysis. Axial force–moment relation curves were adopted to analyze the elastic–plastic limit state of the wharf structure under different ground motions. Results showed that the consideration of the container crane increased the natural vibration period of the pile-supported wharf structure and affected the dynamic characteristics of the structure. Compared with the far-field earthquake ground motion, the nearfield earthquake exerted a more significant impact on the structural dynamic response that controlled the elastic–plastic limit state. With the presence of a crane, the moment and shear force of the pile-top decreased and the location of the extreme value moved down obviously. The findings demonstrated that considering the crane changed the failure mechanism of the wharf structure, and the eccentric effect of the crane may amplify the dynamic response as the peak ground acceleration increases. The results provide reference for the seismic design and the evaluation of the seismic response of <b>container</b> <b>wharves...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} an overview of current seismic ground motion criteria for transportation infrastructures in USA. This is to facilitate an understanding of current seismic performance levels and design practices in USA for transportation professionals world-wide, especially those in Asian and Pacific regions. Seismic vulnerability of a transportation infrastructure is determined by the risk associated with the seismic ground motion and specified performance criteria. Determining an acceptable seismic risk is a very complex task that must consider both social and economic aspects. Obviously, the amount of risk that a railway bridge can accept may be different from that of a highway bridge. The economic tolerance in one country may be different from that in another country for the same type of infrastructure. In this paper, seismic performance levels and design criteria of ground motion for highway bridges, railway bridges and ports’ <b>container</b> <b>wharves</b> in USA are reviewed, and design examples are presented to demonstrate how to develop the code-based and site-specific design acceleration response spectra and time histories...|$|R

40|$|Serving as {{critical}} gateways for international trade, seaports are pivotal elements in transportation networks. Any disruption {{in the activities}} of port infrastructures may lead to significant losses from secondary economic effects, and can hamper the response and recovery efforts following a natural disaster. Particularly poignant examples which revealed the significance of port operations were the 1995 Kobe earthquake and 2010 Haiti earthquake in which liquefaction and lateral spreading of embankments imposed severe damage to both structural and non-structural components of ports. Since <b>container</b> <b>wharf</b> structures are responsible for loading and unloading of cargo, it is essential to understand the performance of these structures during earthquakes. Although previous studies have provided insight into some aspects of the seismic response of wharves, limitations in the modeling of wharf structures and the surrounding soil media have constrained the understanding of various features of the wharf response. This research provides new insights into the seismic behavior of wharves by using new and advanced structure and soil modeling procedures to carry out two and three-dimensional seismic analyses of a pile-supported marginal wharf structure in liquefiable soils. Furthermore, this research investigates the interaction between cranes and wharves and closely assesses the role of wharf-crane interaction on the response of each of these systems. For this purpose, the specific effect of wharf-crane interaction is studied by incorporating advanced models of the crane with sliding/uplift base conditions. To reduce the computational time required for three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic analysis of the wharf in order to be applicable for probabilistic seismic demand analysis, a simplified wharf model and an analysis technique are introduced and verified. In the next step probabilistic seismic demand models (PSDMs) are generated by imposing the wharf models to a suit of ground deformations of the soil embankment and pore water pressure generated for this study through free-field analysis. Convolving PSDMs and the limit states, a set of fragility curves are developed for critical wharf components whose damage induces a disruption in the normal operation of ports. The developed fragility curves provide decision makers with essential tools for maximizing investment in wharf retrofit and fill a major gap in seismic risk assessment of seaports which can be used to assess the regional impact of the damage to wharves during a natural hazard event.

50|$|Rokkō Island (Rokkō Airando) is {{the second}} major {{artificial}} island in Higashinada-ku, Kobe, Japan located in the southeast region at Port of Kobe. The island was constructed from reclaimed land between 1973 and 1992. It has a 3.4 km by 2 km rectangular shape, and covers 5.80 km². The island {{was one of the}} hardest hit areas in Kobe during the Great Hanshin earthquake. Rokkō Island contains hotels, sports and conventions facilities, markets, a water amusement park, sea view apartment buildings, the Kobe Fashion Museum, two international schools, <b>container</b> yards, <b>wharves,</b> and port facilities. The Rokko Liner connects the island to JR Sumiyoshi Station, stopping at several points along the way.|$|R

50|$|Adding to the {{existing}} silt deposits, Ashbridges Bay was filled in and the Port Lands area (Cherry Street to Leslie Street) {{was created in the}} early 1900s. The bay was filled in partly due to concerns about public health - locals had disposed of sewage, farm animal carcasses and household waste in the bay for years. During this period the Don River, which used to flow into the bay to the south-west, was diverted (straightened) toward the harbour, first directly southward and later westward through the current configuration of the Keating Channel. Currently there are proposals to restore the original natural watercourse of the Don, which would bring it closer to the downtown core. The modern harbour area was mostly formed through landfill in the years around the First World War, to allow for deeper <b>container</b> vessel <b>wharf</b> access. The central waterfront functioned as an important industrial area for many years, providing shipping access to communities from Port Union in the east to Mimico in the west.|$|R
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} to shipping in Halifax Harbour. A visiting recreational schooner named Larinda was sunk at the wharf beside the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and a harbour tour ketch Mar was driven ashore in Eastern Passage {{on the opposite}} side of Halifax Harbour. Another harbour tour vessel, the tern schooner Silva, broke from her moorings and caused extensive damage to the Cable Wharf on the Halifax Waterfront. Dozens of smaller yachts were also driven ashore; extensive damage occurred to yacht clubs in the Bedford Basin and Northwest Arm. Dozens of containers were knocked off two container ships at the South End <b>Container</b> Terminal. <b>Wharves</b> on the Halifax and Dartmouth waterfront suffered large amounts of damage and several railcars were washed into the harbour at the Dartmouth railway yard; one of the tracks for the double-track main line was washed out in several places along the Bedford Basin near Millview. Coastal flooding was also reported around Halifax Harbour as a result of the storm surge, although inland flooding was minor as rainfall was not heavy due to Juan's fast forward movement.|$|R
50|$|Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring {{relocated}} from Maine to Salem in the 1980s to {{be closer}} to the source of products they export and utilize the newly established port facilities. In 1990, they opened the Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring Wharf, a small wharf terminal that is also utilized by several other shipping companies and located approximately 1.6 mi above the entrance of the Salem River at 128 Tilbury Road {{on the east side of}} Barber's Basin marina, to handle bulk and break bulk cargo, and shipping containers. It has 350 ft of berthing space with 16 ft water depth. It includes 7 acre of open storage space and utility connections for refrigerated <b>containers.</b> While the <b>wharf</b> is currently owned by Bermuda International Terminals, it is operated by Mid-Atlantic.|$|R
