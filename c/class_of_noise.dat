40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} of parallel applications running on large clusters {{is known to}} degrade due to the interference of kernel and dae-mon activities on individual nodes, {{often referred to as}} noise.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} uncertainty <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> distributions {{defined by}} a bound on the divergence {{with respect to a}} nominal noise distribution. The noise that maximizes the minimum error probability for binary-input channels is found. The effect of the reduction in uncertainty brought about by knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio is also studied. The particular <b>class</b> <b>of</b> Gaussian nominal distributions provides an analysis tool for near-Gaussian channels. Asymptotic behavior of the least favorable noise distribution and resulting error probability are studied in a variety of scenarios, namely: asymptotically small divergence with and without power constraint; asymptotically large divergence with and without power constraint; and asymptotically large signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of a system of free fermions in one dimension under the simultaneous effects of coherent tunneling and stochastic Markovian noise. We identify a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> terms where a hierarchy of decoupled equations for the correlation functions emerges. In the special case of incoherent, nearest-neighbour hopping the equation for the two-point functions is solved explicitly. The Green's function for the particle density is obtained analytically and a timescale is identified where a crossover from ballistic to diffusive behaviour takes place. The result can be interpreted as a competition between the two types of conduction channels where diffusion dominates on large timescales. Comment: 20 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of a marginally stable predator‐prey system, the LOTKA‐VOLTERRA {{model is}} analyzed {{under the influence}} of parameter fluctuations. The cases of white and real noise are studied separately. It is shown that for white noise no stationary solution exists, but even for time tending to infinity explosion occurs only with zero probability. In the case of real noise the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> processes that permit a stationary solution is characterized by their spectral density. It turns out that this class consists of all stationary processes that do not contain the eigenfrequencies of the LOTKA‐VOLTERRA system. It is shown that for all other real noise processes a resonance phenomenon occurs and the solutions grow unboundedly. Copyright © 1979 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|We {{investigate}} noise {{effects on}} the performance of entanglement distribution by separable state. We consider a realistic situation in which the mediating particle between two distant nodes of the network goes through a noisy channel. For a large <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> models we show that the average value of distributed entanglement between two parties is equal to entanglement between particular bipartite partitions of target qubits and exchange qubit in intermediate steps of the protocol. This result is valid for distributing two qubit/qudit and three qubit entangled states. In explicit examples of the noise family, we show that there exists a critical value of noise parameter beyond which distribution of distillable entanglement is not possible. Furthermore, we determine how this critical value increases in terms of Hilbert space dimension, when distributing $d$-dimensional Bell states...|$|E

40|$|Automated or semiautomated pattern {{recognition}} in multidimensional NMR spectroscopy is strongly {{hampered by the}} large number of noise and artifact peaks occurring under practical conditions. A general Bayesian method which is able to assign probabilities that observed peaks are members of given signal classes (e. g., the class of true resonance peaks or the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> and artifact peaks) was proposed previously. The discriminative power of this approach is dependent on the choice of the properties characterizing the peaks. The automated class recognition is improved by the addition of a nonlocal feature, the similarities of peak shapes in symmetry-related positions. It turns out that this additional property strongly decreases the overlap of the multivariate probability distributions for true signals and noise and hence largely increases the discrimination of true resonance peaks from noise and artifact...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the design of}} identical one-bit probabilistic quantizers for distributed estimation in sensor networks. We assume the parameter-range to be finite and known and use the maximum Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRB) over the parameter-range as our performance metric. We restrict our theoretical analysis to the class of antisymmetric quantizers and determine a set of conditions for which the probabilistic quantizer function is greatly simplified. We identify a broad <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> distributions, which includes Gaussian noise in the low-SNR regime, for which the often used threshold-quantizer {{is found to be}} minimax-optimal. Aided with theoretical results, we formulate an optimization problem to obtain the optimum minimax-CRB quantizer. For a wide range of noise distributions, we demonstrate the superior performance of the new quantizer- particularly in the moderate to high-SNR regime.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel effective method for denoising of images corrupted by signal-dependent noise. Denoising is performed by coefÞcient shrinkage in the shape-adaptive DCT (SA-DCT) transform-domain. The Anisotropic Local Polynomial Approximation (LPA) - Intersection of ConÞdence Intervals (ICI) technique {{is used to}} deÞne {{the shape of the}} transform’s support in a pointwise adaptive manner. The use of such an adaptive transform support enables both a simpler modelling of the noise in the transform domain and a sparser decomposition of the signal. Consequently, coefÞcient shrinkage is very effective and the reconstructed estimate’s quality is high, in terms of both numerical error-criteria and visual appearance, with sharp detail preservation and clean edges. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm for a wide <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> models with a signaldependent variance, including Poissonian (photon-limited imaging), Þlm-grain, and speckle noise. 1...|$|E
