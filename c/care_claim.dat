40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This report discusses the briefing presented to congressional staff on June 30, 2011 regarding the James Zadroga 9 / 11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Zadroga Act). The Zadroga Act requires GAO to report by July 1, 2011, on whether the Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCE) under contract with the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) Administrator have financial systems that allow for the timely submission of health <b>care</b> <b>claims</b> data as envisioned by the act. Beginning on July 1, 2011, the WTCHP is to provide medical services to responders and survivors of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks through contracted medical facilities known as CCEs in the New York City/New Jersey metropolitan area and a nationwide network of providers. In addition to providing medical services, the WTCHP is required to collect, report, and analyze data, including health <b>care</b> <b>claims</b> data; perform research on World Trade Center-related health conditions; and establish an outreach program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services designated the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as the WTCHP Administrator. The Administrator is responsible, as specified by the Zadroga Act, for all provisions of the act not related to payments for eligible health <b>care</b> <b>claims.</b> As discussed with the committees, our objective was to describe the WTCHP Administrator's plans and processes for determining whether the CCEs' financial systems can provide timely and accurate health <b>care</b> <b>claims</b> data {{as required by the}} Zadroga Act. Accordingly, the briefing focused on the (1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) /NIOSH schedule for awarding contracts to CCEs, (2) health <b>care</b> <b>claims</b> data requirements for the CCEs and planned procedures, and (3) Administrator's plans for evaluating each CCE system's health <b>care</b> <b>claims</b> data capabilities during and after the award of the contracts. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Asthma {{comorbidity}} {{has been}} correlated with poor asthma control, increased health services use, and decreased quality of life. Managing it improves these outcomes. Little {{is known about}} the amount of different types of comorbidity associated with asthma and how they vary by age. Methodology/Principal Findings: The authors conducted a population study using health administrative data on all individuals living in Ontario, Canada (population 12 million). Types of asthma comorbidity were quantified by comparing physician health <b>care</b> <b>claims</b> between individuals with and without asthma in each of 14 major disease categories; results were adjusted for demographic factors and other comorbidity and stratified by age. Compared to those without asthma, individuals with asthma had higher rates of comorbidity in most major disease categories.

40|$|Background: Sleep apnea (SA) {{has been}} {{associated}} with cognitive impairment. However, no data regarding the risk of dementia in patients with SA has been reported in the general population. This retrospective matched-control cohort study was designed to estimate and compare the risk of dementia in SA and non-SA patients among persons aged 40 and above over a 5 -year period follow-up. Methods: We conducted a nationwide 5 -year population-based study using data retrieved from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID 2005) in Taiwan. The study cohort comprised 1414 patients with SA aged 40 years who had at least 1 inpatient service claim or 1 ambulatory <b>care</b> <b>claim.</b> The comparison cohort comprised 7070 randomly selected patients who were matched with the study group according to sex, age, and index year. We performed Cox proportional-hazards regressions to compute the 5 -year dementia-free survival rates after adjusting for potentially confounding factors. Results: The SA patients in this study had a 1. 70 -times greater risk of developing dementia within 5 years of diagnosis compared to non-SA age- and sex-matched patients, after adjusting for other risk factors (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 26 - 2. 31; P <. 01). For the gender-dependent effect, only females with SA were more likely to develop dementia (adjust HR: 2. 38, 95 % CI = 1. 51 â 3. 74; P <. 001).

40|$|IntroductionCare {{pathways}} {{are quickly}} developing involving hospital and out-of hospital cares {{for patients with}} heart failure (HF). To improve the clinical managment and optimize the insurance economics, we aimed at decribing the care pathways and the consistency with clinical status and care access. MethodsA retrospective cohort of patients living in the French region Languedoc-Roussillon was built. Inclusion criteria were mainly: first admission for HF in 2012; follow-up more than 1 year. The database we used (the SNIIRAM) include outpatient <b>care</b> <b>claim</b> data and hospitalization data. Patients were classified by a hierarchical ascending classification on principal components, using variables describing clinical status, use of specialized and non-specialized care, and main clinical outcomes (hospitalization, death). Results 2751 patients were included and followed during a median of 22 months. Mean age was 78, 484 (18 %) died, 818 (30 %) were readmitted at least once for heart failure. The cluster analysis revealed three different significant groups: 1 / group 1 (N= 734) {{is characterized by a}} younger age, more cares with cardiologists and less main clinical outcomes. Groups 2 and 3 are not different as regards age and comorbidities. 2 /group 2 (N= 1060) differs from the group 3 (N= 957) : less cares out-of the hospital contrasting with more cares at hospital, especially at emergencies. ConclusionThis cohort enables to evaluate consistency and adequation between cares and clinical status, following mail clinical outcomes. As this cohort is built in a heterogeneous region in terms of medical density or health organization, it should be a powerful tool for the study of spatial determinants...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundCritical limb {{ischemia}} (CLI) {{represents the}} most severe clinical manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and is the major cause of ischemic amputation in the United States. Risk factors and the associated incidence and prevalence of CLI have not been well described in the general population. This study describes the risk factors for PAD progression to CLI and estimates the annual incidence and prevalence of CLI in a representative United States patient cohort. MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort analysis of adults with commercial, Medicare supplemental, or Medicaid health insurance who {{had at least one}} PAD or CLI health <b>care</b> <b>claim</b> from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2008, and 12 Â months of continuous coverage. Two subgroups of CLI presentation were identified: primary CLI (patients without any prior PAD or subsequent PAD diagnostic code > 30 Â days after CLI diagnostic code) and secondary CLI (patients with prior PAD or subsequent PAD diagnostic codes â¤ 30 Â days of a CLI diagnostic code). Patterns of presentation, annual incidence, and prevalence of CLI were stratified by health care plan. Risk factors for progression to CLI were compared by presentation type. ResultsFrom 2003 to 2008, the mean annual incidence of PAD was 2. 35 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 34 %- 2. 36 %) and the incidence of CLI was 0. 35 % (95 % CI, 0. 34 %- 0. 35 %) of the eligible study population, with primary and secondary presentations occurring at similar rates. The mean annualized prevalence of PAD was 10. 69 % (95 % CI, 10. 67 % 10. 70 %) and the mean annualized prevalence of CLI was 1. 33 % (95 % CI, 1. 32 %- 1. 34 %) of the eligible study population, and two-thirds of the cases presented as secondary CLI. CLI developed in 11. 08 % (95 % CI, 11. 30 %- 11. 13 %) of patients with PAD. A multivariable model demonstrated that diabetes, heart failure, stroke, and renal failure were stronger predictors of primary rather than secondary CLI presentation. ConclusionsThese data establish new national estimates of the incidence and prevalence of CLI and define key risk factors that contribute to primary or secondary presentations of CLI within a very large contemporary insured population cohort in the United States...|$|E
