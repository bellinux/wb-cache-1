5000|$|Gastric {{adenocarcinoma}} is {{a malignant}} epithelial tumour, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are overwhelmingly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, {{there are two}} major <b>types</b> of gastric <b>adenocarcinoma</b> (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse <b>type.</b> <b>Adenocarcinomas</b> tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa and then the muscularis propria. Intestinal <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> tumour cells describe irregular tubular structures, harbouring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma ("back to back" [...] aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighbouring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiated. Diffuse <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica or leather-bottle stomach) tumour cells are discohesive and secrete mucus, which is delivered in the interstitium, producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically [...] "empty" [...] spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumour cell, it pushes the nucleus to the periphery: [...] "signet-ring cell".|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that α-catenin is frequently lost in diffuse <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinomas.</b> We have isolated α-catenin-deficient mouse teratocarcinoma F 9 cells by gene targeting. Wild-type F 9 cell aggregates cultured {{in the presence of}} retinoic acid differentiated into embryoid bodies with an outer layer of epithelial cells. In contrast, cell aggregates of α-catenin-deficient cells did not develop outer layers under the same conditions. The outer surface cells of α-catenin-deficient cell aggregates, however, differentiated into epithelial cells as determined by their expression of epithelial marker proteins. These differentiated cells scattered from aggregates and showed signet ring cell morphology, which is frequently observed in diffuse <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinomas.</b> We have provided clear evidence that a single mutation in the α-catenin gene may be a direct cause not only of the scattered properties of cells but also of signet ring cell formation in diffuse <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma...</b>|$|R
40|$|Microsatellite {{instability}} (MSI) is {{an important}} factor in the development of various cancers as an identifier of a defective DNA mismatch repair system. The objective of our study was to define the association between microsatellite instability status and traditional clinicopathologic characteristics of endometrioid <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma.</b> Material and methods: MSI status of endometrial cancer was examined by employing the Promega MSI Analysis System. This system uses 5 mononucleotide markers to identify MSI in tumour and normal tissue DNA (BAT- 25, BAT- 26, NR- 21, NR- 24, and MONO- 27), and 2 pentanucleotide markers (Penta C and Penta D) for specimen identification. In this study, we investigated MSI status in 109 endometrial carcinomas. Results and conclusions: One hundred (92 %) of 109 endometrial cancers showed endometrioid type histology and only 9 (8 %) non-endometrioid type. MSI-high was found in 17 % (17 / 100) of endometrioid <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinomas,</b> in 0 % (0 / 9) of non-endometrioid carcinomas. Selected clinicopathologic parameters for endometrioid <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinomas</b> were compared to the MSI status which was separated into two groups – MSI-high and MSI stable. The results showed that MSI-high status was related to clinicopathologic parameters such as deep myometrial invasion and higher histologic grade in endometrioid <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinomas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aim: Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the role of Bax and Bcl- 2 apoptosis- related proteins in the carcinogenesis of the stomach. Materials and Methods: 80 biopsy specimens and 50 surgical specimens of chronic gastritis, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, gastric dysplasia and gastric cancer were studied. Routine hematoxyline and eosin sections were evaluated and classified {{according to the latest}} diagnostic criteria. Immunohistochemical methods were used for detection of Bax and Bcl- 2. Results: The expression of Bax in precancerous lesions and in gastric cancer was distributed as follows: chronic gastritis 100 % (80 / 80 cases), atrophic gastritis 60 % (39 / 65 cases), intestinal metaplasia 55 % (28 / 50 cases), dysplasia 25 % (10 / 40 cases), intestinal <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> 40 % (12 / 30 cases), and diffuse <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> 15 % (3 / 20 cases). Bcl- 2 expression was as follows: chronic gastritis 0 %, atrophic gastritis 35 % (23 / 65 cases), intestinal metaplasia 90 % (45 / 50 cases), dysplasia 100 % (40 / 40 cases), intestinal <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> 83. 3 % (25 / 30 cases), and diffuse <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> 70 % (14 / 20 cases). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the high expression of Bcl- 2 in precancerous lesions (intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia) and in gastric cancer; {{at the same time the}} suppression of Bax in these diseases is evident. This highlights the major role of Bcl- 2 and the contradicting role of Bax in early carcinogenesis. Key Words: apoptosis, gastric carcinogenesis, Bax, Bcl-...|$|R
30|$|In the new {{pathologic}} {{classification of}} lung adenocarcinoma proposed by IASLC/ATS/ERS in 2011, lepidic <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinomas</b> are constituted by three subtypes; adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and lepidic predominant invasive adenocarcinoma (LPIA). Although these subtypes are speculated to show sequential progression from preinvasive lesion to invasive lung cancer, changes of protein expressions during these processes {{have not been}} fully studied yet.

40|$|Nine human mucin genes {{have been}} described, which express glycoproteins MUCJ, 2, 3, 4, 5 AC, 5 B, 6, 7, and 8 in various tissues. It {{has been shown}} that {{different}} mucins are expressed in various gastric disease states as compared to the normal. In this study histochemical and immunohistochemical methods were used to determine the type of mucin and the pattern of staining in 54 patients with a variety of gastric conditions [i. e. normal controls, foetal stomachs, chronic active gastritis, low grade dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia (associated with gastritis, benign ulcers, dysplasia and cancer), early and advanced intestinal <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma,</b> and diffuse adenocarcinoma]. MUCJ- 7 antibodies were used in the study, this being the first study to all assess seven MUC antibodies in the various conditions. It is also the first study to assess the pattern of mucin staining in foetal stomachs. Normal controls were immunoreactive for MUC 4, 5 and 6, and gastritis specimens showed similar results, although the latter showed more MUCJ immunoreactivity. Whereas early foetal stomach showed no MUC immunoreactivity, MUC 4, 5 and 6 were present from the early second trimester onwards. There {{was no significant difference between}} dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia, both categories showing expression of MUC 2 and 3 predominantly. Early intestinal <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinomas</b> did not show any mucins in the majority of cases. Advanced intestinal <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinomas</b> showed immunoreactivity predominantly for MUCJ, 5 and 6, as well as MUC 2 in some cases. Diffuse adenocarcinomas showed strong positive MUC 2 and MUC 6 staining, and in some cases MUC 5 and 7. In conclusion this study has shown different patterns of mucin immunoreactivity in various gastric disease states. Specimens with dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia, late intestinal <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> and diffuse gastric cancer were characterized by increased diversity of mucin gene expression, whereas early intestinal cancer showed loss of mucin immunoreactivity...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of HER- 2 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma and its correlation with Helicobacter pylori. Method: 50 gastric cancer biopsies {{were included in the}} study. Sections were stained with H&E for morphological details and classified into intestinal and diffuse <b>type</b> gastric <b>adenocarcinoma.</b> Loeffler’s methylene blue was used for identification and grading of Helicobacter pylori. Immunohistochemistry for expression of HER 2 protein was done. Pattern of staining was noted and scoring was done. Monoclonal mouse Anti-HER 2 /neu (c-erbB 2) clone CB 11 was used. Statistical analysis was done using chi square test and spearman rank correlation coefficient. P ≤ 0. 05 was taken as critical level of significance. Result: Out of 50 cases 9 (18 %) were intestinal and 41 (82 %) were diffuse <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma.</b> Helicobacter pylori were seen in 8 / 9 (88. 89 %) and 35 / 41 (85. 36 %) cases of intestinal and diffuse <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> respectively. HER 2 positivity was recorded as membranous, membranous + cytoplasmic and cytoplasmic. 55. 56 % of cases in intestinal and 73. 14 % in diffuse <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> showed cytoplasmic ± membranous staining. Expression of HER 2 scoring was compared with increasing grades of Helicobacter pylori infection, a significant association (P< 0. 05) but weak correlation was found between Helicobacter pylori and HER 2 expression. Conclusion: HER 2 overexpression is significantly associated with Helicobacter pylori however correlation is weak. Predominant cytoplasmic pattern of expression of HER 2 in diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma is unusual and needs further investigation...|$|R

40|$|A {{morphological}} {{range of}} 67 hyperplastic polyps was studied. They included polyps removed endoscopically and polyps found incidentally in resected stomachs with gastric ulcers and cancer. The hyperplastic polyps were essentially composed of cystic foveolae and pyloric type glands, lined by cells {{identical to those}} of the normal gastric mucosa. Thirty one polyps contained other cytological elements. In 18, intestinal metaplasia was seen; the tubules were mostly composed of columnar and goblet cells and lacked Paneth cells. In 11 polyps, nine cases of gastric dysplasia and two cases of intestinal dysplasia, dysplastic changes were found. The former consisted of a proliferation of irregularly shaped pits with pleomorphic cuboidal/columnar cells with relatively basophilic cytoplasm. They contained mucigen granules of a gastric type. The latter consisted of atypical pits composed of closely packed, tall columnar and small goblet cells, both resembling adenomatous cells of the colon. In three polyps carcinomas were seen, one of which was an intestinal <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma.</b> In the other two, the cancer cells closely resembled the normal foveolar cells, containing gastric type mucigen granules. They were gastric <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinomas...</b>|$|R

Endoscopic biopsies of normal squamous epithelium (NSE) (n= 20), columnar-lined oesophagus (CLO) (n= 15), CLO with intestinal metaplasia (n= 20), dysplasia (n= 17) and Barrett's <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> (n= 20) were obtained. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the paraffin-embedded tissue. A score was calculated for each marker (range 0 − 300) by multiplying intensity (none 0, weak 1, moderate 2, strong 3) by percentage of expression (range 0 – 100). Significant increases in the expression of HIF- 2 α (P= 0. 014), VEGF (P< 0. 0001), Epo-R (P< 0. 0001) and Ki 67 (P< 0. 0001) were found as tissue progressed from NSE to adenocarcinoma.

40|$|Microsatellite {{instability}} (MSI) {{has been}} reported in 25 % to 45 % of sporadic endometrial carcinoma. The clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of MSI-high phenotype in colorectal and gastric carcinomas have been widely investigated; however, the clinicopathologic impact of MSI on endometrial carcinomas remained unclear. This study was performed to determine the clinicopathologic and molecular significance of MSI in endometrial carcinomas. We analyzed the MSI status using National Cancer Institute-recommended 5 microsatellite markers, and the immunohistochemical profiles of various regulatory proteins of cell cycle and apoptosis using tissue microarray in 100 endometrial carcinomas. The results were compared between MSI-high and MSI(-) groups as for the traditional clinicopathologic prognostic parameters and the immunoreactivities of various regulatory proteins. We especially focused on the endometrioid <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma</b> to exclude the bias from nonendometrioid <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinomas</b> with more aggressiveness and a close association with MSI(-) phenotype. The incidence of MSI-high phenotype was significantly higher in endometrioid type than in nonendometrioid serous type (20 % vs. 0 %, P< 0. 001). It showed orderly increase in the frequencies of MSI-high phenotype in higher histologic grade (13 % vs. 21 % vs. 50 % in histologic grade I, II, and III, P= 3 D 0. 039). The MSI-high phenotype was related with the presence of lymphovascular invasion (P= 3 D 0. 008), deep myometrial invasion (P= 3 D 0. 040), and the higher clinical stages (P= 3 D 0. 018) independent of tumor grade. We also found a correlation between MSI-high phenotype and higher cyclin A and skp 2 immunoreactivity (P= 3 D 0. 03 and 0. 05, respectively), known to be the poor prognostic molecular indicators. According to these results, the MSI may represent the poor prognostic impact on the endometrioid <b>type</b> endometrial <b>adenocarcinoma...</b>|$|R

40|$|Adenocarcinomas of the pancreatobiliary {{system are}} {{currently}} classified by their primary anatomical location. In particular, the pathological diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma {{is still considered}} as a diagnosis of exclusion of metastatic adenocarcinoma. Periampullary cancers have been previously classified according to the histological type of differentiation (pancreatobiliary, intestinal), but overlapping morphological features hinder their differential diagnosis. We performed an integrative immunohistochemical analysis of pancreato-biliary tumors to improve their diagnosis and prediction of outcome. This was a retrospective observational cohort study on patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreatobiliary system who underwent diagnostic core needle biopsy or surgical resection at a tertiary referral center. 409 tumor samples were analyzed with up to 27 conventional antibodies used in diagnostic pathology. Immunohistochemical scoring system was the percentage of stained tumor cells. Bioinformatic analysis, internal validation, and survival analysis were performed. Hierarchical clustering and differential expression analysis identified three immunohistochemical tumor types (extrahepatic pancreatobiliary, intestinal, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) and the discriminant markers between them. Among patients who underwent surgical resection of their primary tumor with curative intent, the intestinal type showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 0. 19 for overall survival (95 % confidence interval 0. 05 - 0. 72; p value = 0. 014) compared to the extrahepatic pancreatobiliary type. Integrative immunohistochemical classification of adenocarcinomas of the pancreatobiliary system results in a characteristic immunohistochemical profile for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and intestinal <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma,</b> which helps in distinguishing them from metastatic and pancreatobiliary <b>type</b> <b>adenocarcinoma,</b> respectively.
