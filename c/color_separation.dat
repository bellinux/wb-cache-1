25|$|A {{drawback}} of SECAM {{for production}} is that, unlike PAL or NTSC, certain post-production operations of encoded SECAM signals {{are not really}} possible without a significant drop in quality. As an example, a simple fade to black is trivial in NTSC and PAL: you just reduce the signal level until it is zero. However, in SECAM the color difference signals, which are frequency modulated, need first to be decoded to e.g. RGB, then the fade-to-black is applied, and finally the resulting signal is re-encoded into SECAM. Because of this, much SECAM video editing was actually done using PAL equipment, then the resultant signal was converted to SECAM. Another drawback of SECAM is that comb filtering, allowing better <b>color</b> <b>separation,</b> is not possible in TV receivers. This was not, however, much of a drawback {{in the early days}} of SECAM as such filters did not become readily available in high-end TV sets before the 1990s.|$|E

6000|$|... § III. But why, {{it will be}} asked, {{should the}} lines which mark the {{division}} of the stones be wrong when they are chiselled, and right when they are marked by color? First, because the <b>color</b> <b>separation</b> is a natural one. You build with different kinds of stone, of which, probably, one is more costly than another; which latter, as you cannot construct your building of it entirely, you arrange in conspicuous bars. But the chiselling of the stones is a wilful throwing away of time and labor in defacing the building: it costs much to hew one of those monstrous blocks into shape; and, when it is done, the building is weaker than it was before, by just as much stone as has been cut away from its joints. And, secondly, because, as I have repeatedly urged, straight lines are ugly things as lines, but admirable as limits of colored spaces; and the joints of the stones, which are painful in proportion to their regularity, if drawn as lines, are perfectly agreeable when marked by variations of hue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Mathematical {{model for}} moiré in {{screened}} two-color overprinting process was established, {{and the formation}} rules in multicolor overprinting processes were investigated by computer simulating experiments. Results showed that the formation of moiré depends on the screen rulings of <b>color</b> <b>separations</b> and the screen angles at which <b>color</b> <b>separations</b> were positioned to each other. The visible moiré patterns would severely interfere the structure of printing images, however, {{it was impossible to}} entirely avoid these visual disturbances, and good measurements should be taken to control the moiré effects. Optimal solutions for multicolor overprinting processes and effective measurements for special originals were put forward to reduce the interference effects of moiré. The results of this paper can help for improving the printing quality and promoting the anti-counterfeiting technology using Moiré...|$|R

50|$|Typically <b>color</b> <b>separation</b> is the {{responsibility}} of the color separator. This includes cleaning up the file to make it print ready and creating a proof for the prepress approval process. The process of <b>color</b> <b>separation</b> starts by separating the original artwork into red, green, and blue components (for example by a digital scanner). Before digital imaging was developed, the traditional method of doing this was to photograph the image three times, using a filter for each color. However this is achieved, the desired result is three grayscale images, which represent the red, green, and blue (RGB) components of the original image.|$|E
