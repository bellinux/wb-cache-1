5|$|In September, a poll {{conducted}} by the Goldwater campaign revealed that Johnson had a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> over him. Indeed, Goldwater's campaign was an uphill battle against an incumbent administration during a prosperous economy. In {{the wake of the}} death of John Kennedy, who had been leading in polls for reelection in 1964, there lingered the possibility that Johnson had the sympathy of the media and voters.|$|E
5|$|Sanford's {{opponent}} in the 1992 election was Lauch Faircloth, a former Democrat turned Republican who had served as state Highway Commissioner in Sanford's gubernatorial administration. Enjoying substantial backing from Sanford's Senate colleague, Jesse Helms, Faircloth accused Sanford of being a tax-and-spend liberal bound to special interests. While initial polls showed that Sanford had a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> over his rival, he lost supporters after an operation for an infected heart valve kept him from campaigning for much of October and raised doubts {{as to whether he}} was capable of serving another term. On November 3, 1992, Faircloth won the election by a 100,000-vote margin.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher, the {{eventual}} Drivers' Champion, led the Championship {{going into the}} race and started from fourth position alongside Barrichello. At the first corner BAR's Ricardo Zonta ran into the rear of Michael Schumacher. The incident forced the German to retire and caused a safety car deployment. After the safety car pulled in after one lap Häkkinen and Coulthard extended a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> {{over the rest of}} the field. When Häkkinen made his pit stop on lap 38, he rejoined behind Coulthard, but ahead of Barrichello. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 41, allowing Häkkinen back into the lead which he held to clinch his second victory of the 2000 season.|$|E
50|$|Cloughen had a <b>comfortable</b> six-yard <b>lead</b> when {{he crossed}} the finish line.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} time in history, sample counts were {{released}} by the Elections Department to prevent speculation and misinformation from unofficial sources while counting is underway. All sample counts were released by 10PM - two hours after polling ended. With the exception of Aljunied and Punggol East, where counts were within a 4% error margin, all other figures showed that PAP had <b>comfortable</b> <b>leads</b> in 26 electoral divisions, while WP led in 1 electoral division.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the run-up}} to the general election, Clinton {{maintained}} <b>comfortable</b> <b>leads</b> in the polls over Dole and Perot. The televised debates featured only Dole and Clinton, locking out Perot and the other minor candidates from the discussion. Perot, who had been allowed to participate in the 1992 debates, would eventually take his case to court, seeking damages from not being in the debate, as well as citing unfair coverage from the major media outlets.|$|R
5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car, {{and when the}} car {{returned}} to the pit lane Häkkinen built a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> over Jarno Trulli. As the track dried and his rivals made pit stops, Häkkinen maintained his lead until a lap-13 spin gave Michael Schumacher the lead {{for most of the}} remainder of the race. By the 34th lap Schumacher's tyres began to degrade; he drove off the racing line to cool them, which allowed Häkkinen to close the gap. On lap 41 Häkkinen overtook Michael Schumacher for the lead, lapping BAR driver Ricardo Zonta and maintaining the lead to win. Although Rubens Barrichello set the fastest lap time in the other Ferrari, he was hampered by a poor qualifying performance and retired with a fuel-pressure problem thirteen laps from the finish.|$|E
5|$|By lap 13, Häkkinen's gap to Coulthard was two seconds, who in {{turn was}} a further ten seconds in front of de la Rosa. Barrichello, who had damage to his car, was a further six seconds behind de la Rosa, but was drawing ahead of Salo in fifth. Verstappen {{suffered}} an gearbox failure and became the fifth retirement of the race on lap 14. On lap 17, Diniz and Zonta were given ten-second stop-go penalties, both for their roles in the lap one accidents. They took their penalties immediately. Ralf Schumacher emerged from his garage to rejoin the race on the same lap. Häkkinen had extended his already <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> over Coulthard to 10 seconds by lap 24. Alesi, who was on a two-stop strategy, became the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and exited in thirteenth place. On lap 25, Zonta was involved in another collision when he attempted to overtake Minardi driver Gastón Mazzacane at turn 1 which allowed Diniz to move into fourteenth position.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Brooklyn Dodgers, winning 55–7. The Browns scored three touchdowns {{in five minutes}} during the first quarter. Cleveland added five more touchdowns {{in the second half}} and held a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> to the end. Fullback Marion Motley ran for 111 yards on five carries and scored two touchdowns, {{including}} a 50-yard run {{at the beginning of the}} second half. Tommy Colella scored a touchdown on an 82-yard punt return, and Bill Lund ran back an interception 28 yards for another. It was in this game that the Draw play was accidentally invented when Otto Graham tripped while dropping back for a pass. As he went down, sensing blitzers about to wallop him, he stuck the ball in Motley's stomach who scampered for a sizable gain. Liking the effect, Brown added it to the playbook during halftime. By the next game the play became a staple of the offense with several versions for different situations. As Cleveland's lead increased in the second half, Brown put in second-string players. Quarterback Otto Graham was replaced by Ermal Allen, who threw for two of the Browns' touchdowns and intercepted a pass while playing on defense. Cliff Lewis, Graham's primary backup, also played in the game. Brooklyn's only score came in the second quarter on a Bob Hoernschemeyer rush. The Dodgers were hurt by short punts from Mickey Colmer and a poor passing game. The team was held to 39 yards of passing. Edgar Jones, Cleveland's primary halfback suffered an elbow injury during the game.|$|E
50|$|Pre-election polls {{had been}} {{consistently}} showing the LDP's solid lead, especially among independent voters {{in urban areas}} like Tokyo and other big cities nationwide where its main opposition the DPJ had had a main support base. Newspaper surveys predicted a big victory for the LDP, which could lead the DPJ, young and short on unity, to disintegrate. Election analysts, however, warned that few LDP candidates were enjoying <b>comfortable</b> <b>leads,</b> {{and there was still}} a large number of undecided voters who went for the DPJ in the last election, thus the election results were far from being set.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} season, controversy abounded in Columbus {{over which}} player {{should be the}} starting quarterback. Zwick started the season opener against Miami (OH), because Smith was still suspended, and the following game against Texas. Many fans feel that Ohio State lost that game because of their indecisiveness at the quarterback position, with Zwick and Smith subbing in and out {{for most of the}} game. [...] After the loss against Texas, Smith was named the team's full-time starter. Zwick would appear in four more games that season, after the Buckeyes had <b>comfortable</b> <b>leads</b> and the games were well in hand.|$|R
50|$|The Vikings scored {{their fifth}} try {{of the half}} on 31 minutes when Dave Houghton went over the line. Shane Grady kicked the {{conversion}} to give the Vikings a <b>comfortable</b> 26-6 <b>lead</b> at half time.|$|R
5|$|In June 1999, Roma's then-president Franco Sensi sacked Zeman {{and signed}} Fabio Capello as a replacement, {{with the aim}} of winning the league title. By the 2000–01 {{campaign}} under the new coach, Roma were building a competitive team around Totti, who was by now being utilised as a creative attacking midfielder by Capello in a 3–4–1–2 formation, due to his passing skills and playmaking abilities. Totti scored in a 2–0 home win over Bologna on his season debut on 1 October 2000. On 10 December, Totti scored the match-winning goal in a 2–1 home win against Udinese with a powerful left-footed volley to help Roma to their fifth home win of the season. He continued his goalscoring form by scoring against Napoli at home in a 3–0 victory on 28 January 2001, as Roma finished {{the first half of the}} league season in first place. Totti continued to play an important role in keeping the club at the top of the table throughout the remainder of the season, gaining a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> over rivals Juventus. On 17 June 2001, at the Stadio Olimpico, Roma beat Parma 3–1, with their three main attackers, Totti, Vincenzo Montella and Gabriel Batistuta scoring one goal each, as Roma were crowned champions of Italy for the third time in their history. Totti finished the league season with 13 goals, equalling what was at the time his personal goalscoring record in a single Serie A season.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{ended their}} regular {{season with a}} win over the Dodgers and an undefeated record. The Browns began the game by scoring 31 {{unanswered}} points. The first score came on a short Dub Jones run that followed an 80-yard drive in the first quarter. The next score came on a 76-yard drive in the second quarter. After a pair of passes and a 14-yard run by Edgar Jones, Graham completed a long touchdown pass to Lavelli, who sped away from defender Monk Gafford on the right sideline. Graham engineered another long drive just {{before the end of}} the first half, completing 18- and 20-yard passes to Speedie. The 90-yard march ended with a short touchdown run by Graham, giving Cleveland a 21–0 advantage at the half. Groza kicked a field goal at the beginning of the third quarter, and a fumble by Gafford on the ensuing kickoff led to a touchdown pass from Graham to Gillom, putting the Browns up by 31 points. With a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead,</b> Brown took out his starters and substituted third-string players. The Dodgers proceeded to score three touchdowns, two of which came on long passes from Bob Chappuis, but the Browns won the game 31–21. The win left the Browns on top of the standings in the AAFC's Western Division ahead of San Francisco, which had lost only two games, both to the Browns. The perfect regular season record was the first in professional football since 1942, when the National Football League's Chicago Bears won all of their games. Chicago, however, lost the NFL championship that year.|$|E
25|$|White won the Democratic primary for {{governor}} on March 2, 2010 and faced off against Perry, the Republican nominee. Polls showed Perry with a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead.</b> However White did show strong support among Independent voters, young voters under 35, and minorities.|$|E
50|$|The Nebraska {{reserves}} were on {{the field}} in the 4th quarter, working under a <b>comfortable</b> 34-0 <b>lead,</b> when a fumbled punt allowed Oregon to put in a late score to avoid the shutout with 3 minutes to play.|$|R
50|$|Until the ninth, Boston starter Ernie Shore was in control. Holding a <b>comfortable</b> 6-1 <b>lead,</b> a walk, hit batter, {{error and}} bases-full walk to Fred Merkle finally forced the Red Sox {{to call on}} Carl Mays from the bullpen to {{preserve}} a 6-5 win.|$|R
50|$|Missouri {{successfully}} {{fought off}} the Cornhuskers {{for quite some}} time, putting on a good game of defense with Nebraska. Finally, however, the Cornhuskers managed to put the ball over the goal line for a single touchdown, which was enough to carry the game. Nebraska's <b>comfortable</b> series <b>lead</b> was improved to 10-3.|$|R
25|$|In December 2007, Chambliss had an {{approval}} rating of 53% and a dis{{approval rating}} of 34% according to Strategic Vision, a Republican polling firm. For {{most of the}} campaign, Chambliss maintained a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> in most polls. However, in {{the weeks leading up}} to the 2008 general election, polls showed the race tightening, reflecting a general nationwide trend.|$|E
25|$|Lithuania {{started the}} tournament against New Zealand. After a tough first quarter, Lithuanians {{took control of}} the game and kept ahead by a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead,</b> {{finishing}} 92–79. The second game was against Canada. After reducing a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter, Lithuanians finally gained a small lead {{towards the end of the}} game. Canada had a chance to win the game, but Jermaine Anderson's game winning three rimmed out at the last second and Lithuania celebrated their second victory 70–68. The next match was against the defending champion Spain, and after another comeback from an 18-point deficit, the Lithuanians won the upsetting game 76–73, Linas Kleiza's free-throws sealing the victory.|$|E
25|$|D'Aste {{started on}} pole {{position}} for the reverse grid race, he established a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> over second placed Oriola to take his second win of the season. Tarquini had jumped up to third place to complete the podium. Behind them, the Chevrolet trio found passing difficult and the Proteam Racing BMW of Bennani held them back {{for much of the}} race. Huff and Menu passed on the penultimate lap, while Muller passed Bennani on the final lap. Independent trophy contender Michelisz spun out of the race on the first lap, allowing trophy rival Oriola to close the points gap to 12. The overall championship was once again a tie between Huff and Muller.|$|E
50|$|Nebraska put up Coach Devaney's 100th career win as the Cornhuskers easily trampled Kansas State in Lincoln and had {{reserves}} in the game for playing time while cruising behind a <b>comfortable</b> 38-0 <b>lead</b> even prior to the half. The Wildcats finally put up a touchdown with just over 6 minutes remaining to play.|$|R
50|$|The Samford scoring barrage {{continued}} into the second quarter, {{thanks in part to}} four first-half Keydet turnovers. All three second quarter touchdowns came courtesy of Eubank on the ground, including one with four seconds remaining in the half, putting the game out of reach before the intermission, with Samford holding a <b>comfortable</b> 49-0 <b>lead.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Division 1 {{preliminary}} final, Sandringham held a <b>comfortable</b> 57-point <b>lead</b> {{during the}} third quarter, 13.20 (98) vs 6.5 (41) before Coburg mounted a strong comeback in the final quarter. Coburg closed the margin to four points with ten of the next eleven goals, but Sandringham kicked the final goal and held on for a 11-point win.|$|R
25|$|Danny White threw {{touchdown}} passes on Dallas' first three drives {{of the second}} half. His 37-yard completion to tight end Jay Saldi set up a score on a 10-yard pass to Dorsett, who caught the ball at the 7 and dragged Rams defenders Johnnie Johnson and Rod Perry {{all the way into}} the end zone. Then Cowboys defensive back Aaron Mitchell picked off a pass from Ferragamo and returned it 12 yards, setting off a 70-yard Dallas drive that ended with White's 35-yard touchdown completion to Butch Johnson. Now with a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead,</b> Dallas put the game away early in the fourth quarter, driving 95 yards, including a 23-yard burst by Dorsett, to go up 34-13 on White's 11-yard touchdown pass to Drew Pearson.|$|E
25|$|Elliott pitted on lap 314. He had {{a quicker}} pit stop since {{he still had}} use of first gear. He came out ahead of Kulwicki on the track. Terry Labonte led lap 315, then he pitted. Elliott re-assumed the lead on lap 316, and led the final 13 laps. Elliott's laps led total came to 102 – one lap fewer than Kulwicki's 103. With Elliott leading, Kulwicki tucked into a {{comfortable}} second, conserved fuel, and did not mount a challenge for the lead. Kulwicki and his crew had already figured out that if Elliott led {{the rest of the}} way, Kulwicki would still clinch the five bonus points. Furthermore, Kulwicki had a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> over third place, and was not being challenged.|$|E
25|$|With every Essex batsman except number 11 Steyn (run out for 0) scoring {{in double}} figures, Essex showed a real team effort, with in-form opener William Jefferson top-scoring with 93 as Essex {{got into a}} {{relatively}} <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> of 142. Leicestershire fought back well on the third day, though, having lost Maddy before stumps {{on the second day}} to be 57 for 1. Robinson, Dinesh Mongia, Aftab Habib and HD Ackerman all passed 30, and Claude Henderson chipped in with a fine 55 from number 9, as Leicestershire made their way to a lead of 190. Only Gough showed consistent threat, taking four wickets for 60, while Steyn again became too inconsistent - he conceded 102 runs in his 21-over effort, although he did get the wickets of Robinson and Ottis Gibson.|$|E
5000|$|Tom Kristensen (born 7 July 1967) is {{a former}} Danish {{professional}} racing driver. He holds {{the record for the}} most wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with nine, six of which were consecutive (from 2000 to 2005). In 1997, he won the race with the Joest Racing team, driving a Tom Walkinshaw Racing-designed and Porsche-powered WSC95, after being a late inclusion in the team following Davy Jones' accident that eventually ruled him out of the race. All of his wins since then have come driving an Audi prototype, except in 2003, when he drove a Bentley prototype. In both 1999 and 2007 Kristensen's team crashed out of <b>comfortable</b> <b>leads</b> in the closing hours of the race. He is {{considered by many to be}} the greatest driver ever to have raced in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, earning the nickname [...] "Mr Le Mans". Elsewhere Kristensen also holds the record for most wins at the 12 Hours of Sebring with a total of six.|$|R
5|$|By 1987, {{unemployment}} was falling, {{the economy}} was stable and strong and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a <b>comfortable</b> Conservative <b>lead,</b> and local council election results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to call a general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The election saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter-final, Sweden faced Denmark. This was Denmark's first {{appearance}} in the playoff round. After Sweden established a <b>comfortable</b> 3–0 <b>lead,</b> the Danes scored a goal in the second period. Seven minutes before the end Linus Omark scored a goal which restored the three-goal lead for Sweden. A late power play goal by Dane Morten Madsen was to no avail and Sweden won 4–2.|$|R
25|$|McGovern ran on a {{platform}} of immediately ending the Vietnam War and instituting guaranteed minimum incomes for the nation’s poor. His campaign was harmed by his views during the primaries (which alienated many powerful Democrats), the perception that his foreign policy was too extreme, and the Eagleton debacle. With McGovern’s campaign weakened by these factors, the Republicans successfully portrayed him as a radical left-wing extremist incompetent to serve as president. Nixon led in the polls by large margins throughout the entire campaign. With an enormous fundraising advantage and a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> in the polls, Nixon concentrated on large rallies and focused speeches to closed, select audiences, leaving much of the retail campaigning to surrogates like Vice President Agnew. Nixon did not, by design, try to extend his coattails to Republican congressional or gubernatorial candidates, preferring to pad his own margin of victory.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1986, at 18, {{right after}} signing for KK Partizan, Divac debuted for the senior Yugoslavia {{national}} basketball {{team at the}} 1986 FIBA World Championship in Madrid, on invitation by the head coach Krešimir Ćosić. However, the excellent rookie's performance was spoiled by the event in the semi-finals against the Soviet Union. Forty-five seconds before the end, Yugoslavia had a <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> of 9 points, but the Soviets scored two three-pointers within a few seconds and cut the difference to 3 points. Yugoslavia tried to hold the ball for the remaining time, opting to continue the play with throw-ins instead of free throws following fouls, but with only 14 seconds left, Divac committed a double dribble, the Soviets were awarded the ball, and tied the score with another three-pointer. In the overtime, the Soviets easily prevailed against the shocked Yugoslavs, {{who had to be}} content with the bronze.|$|E
25|$|However, in sunny {{conditions}} {{and on a}} good batting track, India found the going very easy. Admittedly Dabengwa dropped a hard catch off Virender Sehwag on 5, and Sehwag made the Zimbabweans pay, pounding six fours and one six in a 44 before Mahwire found a way through his defences at the stroke of lunch. India had added 88 for the first wicket, however, and although Gautam Gambhir departed for 46 shortly after lunch, the foundation was laid down. Rahul Dravid was back to his form from before the one-day series, and VVS Laxman also survived a tricky period to hit his eighth Test century. Mahwire added yet another wicket to his tally, as he lured Dravid into an edge that fell into Brendan Taylor's hands, but Laxman pounded Zimbabwe's bowlers in the evening session, giving them a relatively <b>comfortable</b> <b>lead</b> of 46 runs at stumps on day two.|$|E
