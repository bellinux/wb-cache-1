40|$|Calcium and {{magnesium}} {{are essential for}} survival but it is unknown how animals detect and consume enough of these minerals to meet their needs. To investigate this, we exploited the PWK/PhJ (PWK) strain of mice, which, {{in contrast to the}} C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) and other inbred strains, displays strong preferences for calcium solutions. We found that the PWK strain also has strong preferences for MgCl 2 and saccharin solutions but not representative salty, sour, bitter, or umami taste compounds. A genome scan of B 6 Ã— PWK F 2 mice linked a component of the strain difference in calcium {{and magnesium}} preference to distal chromosome 4. The taste receptor gene, Tas 1 r 3, was implicated by studies with 129. B 6 ByJ-Tas 1 r 3 congenic and Tas 1 r 3 knockout mice. Most notably, calcium and magnesium solutions that were avoided by wild-type B 6 mice were preferred (relative to water) by B 6 mice null for the Tas 1 r 3 gene. Oral calcium elicited less electrophysiological activity in the chorda tympani nerve of Tas 1 r 3 knockout than wild-type mice. Comparison of the sequence of Tas 1 r 3 with <b>calcium</b> and <b>saccharin</b> preferences in inbred mouse strains found 1) an inverse correlation between <b>calcium</b> and <b>saccharin</b> preference scores across primarily domesticus strains, which was associated with an I 60 T substitution in T 1 R 3, and 2) a V 689 A substitution in T 1 R 3 that was unique to the PWK strain and thus may be responsible for its strong calcium and magnesium preference. Our results imply that, in addition to its established roles in the detection of sweet and umami compounds, T 1 R 3 functions as a gustatory calcium-magnesium receptor...|$|R
25|$|However, in 2000, {{the warning}} labels were removed because {{scientists}} learned that rodents, unlike humans, {{have a unique}} combination of high pH, high calcium phosphate, and high protein levels in their urine. One {{or more of the}} proteins that are more prevalent in male rats combine with <b>calcium</b> phosphate and <b>saccharin</b> to produce microcrystals that damage the lining of the bladder. Over time, the rat's bladder responds to this damage by overproducing cells to repair the damage, which leads to tumor formation. Since this does not occur in humans, there is no elevated risk of bladder cancer.|$|R
