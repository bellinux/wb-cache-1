5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a <b>cost</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>way</b> to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E

Despite the best efforts of networking researchers and practitioners, an ideal Internet experience is inaccessible to an overwhelming majority of people the world over, mainly due to the lack of <b>cost</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>ways</b> of provisioning high-performance global Internet. In this paper, we argue that instead of an exclusive focus on a utopian goal of universally accessible "ideal networking" (in which we have high throughput and quality of service as well as low latency and congestion), we should consider providing "approximate networking" through the adoption of context-appropriate tradeoffs. Approximate networking can be used to implement a pragmatic tiered global access to the Internet for all (GAIA) system in which different users the world over have different context-appropriate (but still contextually functional) Internet experience.

Efficient road {{networks are}} increasingly seen by governments across Europe as being the key to supporting and sustaining economic growth as they enable the movement of goods and services around the country.

This has led to an emphasis in many European countries being placed on better use of existing infrastructure and IM capabilities rather than investing in more costly systems, equipment and working methods. The Conference of European Directors of Roads (CEDR) investigates how countries, can develop their IM capabilities to support policy goals and the needs of road users. The purpose of this study is to facilitate the cooperation, on a European level, by exchanging experience and information.

This study aimed to develop and investigate the efficacy of a parent led home-based intervention for increasing children's acceptance of a disliked vegetable. A total of 115 children aged 2 - 4 years were allocated to one of four intervention groups or to a no-treatment control. The four intervention conditions were: repeated exposure; modelling and repeated exposure; rewards and repeated exposure; or modelling, rewards and repeated exposure. Children in all of the intervention conditions were exposed by a parent to daily offerings of a disliked vegetable for 14 days. Liking and consumption of the vegetable were measured pre and post-intervention. Significant increases in post-intervention consumption were seen in the modelling, rewards and repeated exposure condition and the rewards and repeated exposure condition, compared to the control group. Significant post-intervention differences in liking were also found between the experimental groups. Liking was highest (> 60 %) in the modelling, rewards and repeated exposure group and the rewards and repeated exposure group, intermediate (> 26 %) in the modelling and repeated exposure and repeated exposure groups, and lowest in the control group (10 %).

5000|$|Zone {{control is}} the {{favorite}} of most environments because it is simple to install and easy to expand. [...] Zone control uses a wireless transmitter to transmit a signal in a fixed area. Each AGV contains a sensing device to receive this signal and transmit back to the transmitter. If the area is clear the signal is set at “clear” allowing any AGV to enter and pass through the area. When an AGV is in the area the “stop” signal is sent and all AGV attempting to enter the area stop and wait for their turn. Once the AGV in the zone has moved out beyond the zone the “clear” signal is sent {{to one of the}} waiting AGVs. Another way to set up zone control traffic management is to equip each individual robot with its own small transmitter/receiver. The individual AGV then sends its own “do not enter” message to all the AGVs getting to close to its zone in the area. A problem with this method is if one zone goes down all the AGV’s are at risk to collide with any other AGV.

50|$|Pipelines {{are used}} to {{transport}} oil from the wells to refineries and storage facilities. Pipelines are viewed as the most <b>cost</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>way</b> to move oil on land. First the oil is collected at the wellhead, or some area where the oil is stored. From the wellhead it is pumped across the land through a pipe, and is discharged at its destination which typically is a refinery. However, pipelines can be used the same way to deliver already refined fuels such as gasoline, diesel and even jet fuel from the refinery to distribution facilities or a consumer. These pipelines are not just a solid line of straight pipe, but have various components on the pipeline. These pipelines will have booster pumps to keep the fuel moving along a long distance, inspection areas {{to make sure that}} the fuel is not getting any contaminants, and even other collection and delivery points along the way. Though it costs a lot of money and time to set up these pipelines, the operation cost is significantly less than using any other type of transportation. Also the amount of manpower needed to move this oil is not that much. Pipelines offer the most efficient mode of transporting this oil across a land mass. Even though these pipes are extremely cost effective there are some circumstances where this is not true and it is more logical to use another method. An example of this is how it is cheaper and more logical to use a ship to move the oil across the Atlantic Ocean than a pipeline.|$|E

They are being introduced as alternatives to fixed wavelength sources {{to provide a}} greater degree of flexibility and to reduce large inventory [1]. The SGDBR laser is an ideal candidate due to its large tuning range (40 nm), high output power (10 dBm), large Side Mode Suppression Ratio (> 30 dB) and its ability to be monolithically integrated with other semiconductor devices. Such integration could comprise of a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA), allowing for extended reach tunable operation, in a very compact and low cost footprint [2]. Thus far, external modulation has been the most popular modulation technique used with TLs. However, the addition of the modulator introduces loss to the transmitted signal due to high insertion and coupling losses. Addressing these short comings would result in increased cost and complexity of the transmitter. Alternatively, direct modulation is one of the simplest and <b>cost</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>ways</b> to modulate the lightwave signal. Hence, it is rational to investigate the performance of a directly modulated SGDBR laser in order to verify its usefulness in a WDM based access network scenario.
