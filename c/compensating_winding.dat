5000|$|A metadyne is {{a direct}} current {{electrical}} machine with two pairs of brushes. It {{can be used as}} an amplifier or rotary transformer. It is similar to a third brush dynamo but has additional regulator or [...] "variator" [...] windings. It is also similar to an amplidyne except that the latter has a <b>compensating</b> <b>winding</b> which fully counteracts the effect of the flux produced by the load current. The technical description is [...] "a cross-field direct current machine designed to utilize armature reaction". A metadyne can convert a constant-voltage input into a constant-current, variable-voltage output.|$|E
5000|$|Not all series wound motors operate well on AC current.If an {{ordinary}} series wound DC motor {{were connected to}} an AC supply, it would run very poorly. The universal motor is modified in several ways to allow for proper AC supply operation. There is a <b>compensating</b> <b>winding</b> typically added, along with laminated pole pieces, {{as opposed to the}} solid pole pieces found in DC motors. [...] A universal motor's armature typically has far more coils and plates than a DC motor, and hence fewer windings per coil. This reduces the inductance.|$|E
50|$|Pestarini also {{visited the}} United States in 1930, {{although}} there is no record of the system being used there. The General Electric engineers, led by Ernst Alexanderson, were interested, but modified the design by the addition of a <b>compensating</b> <b>winding,</b> which counteracted the effect of the flux produced by the load current. This turned the machine from a voltage-to-current amplifier into a voltage-to-voltage amplifier, and they called the new variant an Amplidyne. The development costs were largely funded by US naval contracts for the development of vertical stabilisers, which were used to improve the aiming and firing of guns on ships. During the same period, the Macfarlane Engineering Company, who were based in Glasgow, developed a variant of the cross field machine quite independently, which they named the Magnicon.|$|E

5000|$|A {{compensation}} winding in a DC shunt motor is a winding {{in the field}} pole face plate that carries armature current to reduce stator field distortion. Its purpose is to reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors. When flux from the armature current is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the field pole plate is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of armature flux to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the pole face plate. The result is arcing of the brushes. By adding a <b>compensating</b> <b>winding</b> in the pole face plate that carries armature current {{in the opposite direction}} of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the pole face plate can be restored to the position it would have with zero armature current. The main drawback of a {{compensation winding}} is the expense.|$|E

30|$|Growing {{penetration}} of wind power challenges to power system security, since the conventional generators {{may not have}} sufficient capacity to <b>compensate</b> <b>wind</b> power fluctuation plus the reverse peak regulation. In this paper, the high-capacity pumped-storage and fast-response battery-storage are coordinated to compensate the variation of both wind power and load, aiming at shifting peak load, responding to wind power ramping, reducing the curtailment of wind and stabilizing the output of thermal units. A practical framework is designed for optimizing {{the operation of the}} hybrid system consisting of the wind, pumped-storage, and battery storage, which can take full advantages of pumped-storage and battery-storage. The detailed mathematical formulations of the pumped-storage and battery-storage are built. Three cases are studied to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed coordination method.|$|R
40|$|A {{current-carrying}} conductor {{is surrounded by}} a pair of ring cores. A sense winding on one core provides flux rate feedback to a power amplifier which drives the ampere-turn compensating current through a common <b>compensating</b> <b>winding.</b> The other core serves as a second- harmonic modulator to establish zero-flux operation and thus to ensure a perfect, temperature-independent current balance. A specially- developed burden resistor converts the compensating current into a voltage signal, which is amplified to give an 10 V output signal at the nominal value of the current to be measured. A substantial number of devices, ranging from 50 to 25000 Amperes is now operational in the beam transfer and extraction power supplies to the CERN SPS. (4 refs) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{closed loop}} hall effect current sensor {{is a popular}} current sensor because of its high bandwidth, ac and dc measurement, isolation.

In this paper, a novel closed loop hall effect current sensor involving a Class D Amplifier as power amplifier is proposed to reduce the sensor power consumption and make the sensor more compact. This paper discusses the development of such a current sensor, it's stability issues, noise floor, procedures to overcome those problems, the tradeoff between noise and bandwidth. Finally a prototype current sensor is shown and it's performance is compared to a similar range commercially available current sensor.

40|$|M. Ing. In this {{investigation}} charge balancing will be investigated from an Electro-Magnetic- Compatibility perspective. The primary sources of common mode Electro-Magnetic- Interference in switching converters are the switching nodes. This is mainly {{due to the}} parasitic capacitance between the switching node and the reference earth. Filtering components that are currently used take {{up a lot of}} valuable space resulting in the products overall size and cost to increase. Combating common mode current at the source will drastically reduce the size or the need for these large filters. This investigation will focus on a simple method of reducing common mode noise (produced by the switching node), of a two wire system, at the source by making use of a <b>compensating</b> <b>winding</b> which requires very little or no additional space; a buck converter will be used to illustrate the concept.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the world}} is encountering severe {{challenges}} in the energy generation sector. Environmental issues like climate change, global warming and Green House Gases (GHGs) and also social issues like dramatic increase in global population and increasing energy demand are the main causes of global concerns about energy resource management. In this regard, Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) are the suitable substitution to replace the conventional generating units that emit GHGs due {{to the use of}} fossil fuels. Among all RESs, wind energy seems to be promising for generating emission-free electrical energy. However, it is naturally unpredictable due to its intermittency which leads to s ome technical problems such as generation imbalance as well as optimal reserve allocation.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a comprehensive STATCOM controller for load compensation, voltage regulation and voltage balancing in electric power distribution and transmission networks. The behavior of this controller is first validated with published results. Subsequently, the performance of this STATCOM controller is examined in a realistic Hydro One distribution feeder for accomplishing the compensation of both mildly and grossly unbalanced loads, and balancing of network voltages using PSCAD/EMTDC software.

40|$|The {{renewable}} energy sources wind, solar etc. have become very essential and important in the generation mix {{as a result of}} rising energy demand and environmental reasons. In addition tax is being imposed on high carbon emission. But the uncertainty and variability associated with renewable such as wind may result in economical andtechnical problems in the power system. In order to <b>compensate</b> <b>wind</b> intermittency, generation resources such as gas plant, pumped storage unit etc. are employed due to their lesser start up time, lower operating cost and good ramping capabilities.

The optimal size of the pumped storage unit to be used has been obtained after putting the system to different operating conditions such as varying wind power and load demand, imposing tax on carbon emission and varying ramping limits etc. The model has been applied on IEEE- 30 bus test data and satisfactory results have been obtained for optimal hybrid systemoperation...|$|R

40|$|The {{participation}} of wind energy in electricity markets requires providing a forecast for future energy {{production of a}} wind generator, whose value will be its scheduled energy. Deviations from this schedule because of prediction errors could imply the payment of imbalance costs. In order to decrease these costs, a joint operation between a wind farm and a hydro-pump plant is proposed; the hydro-pump plant changes its production to <b>compensate</b> <b>wind</b> power prediction errors. In order to optimize this operation, {{the uncertainty of the}} wind power forecast is modeled and quantified. This uncertainty is included in an optimization problem that shifts the production of the hydro-pump plant in an optimal way, aiming at reducing the imbalance costs. The result of such a method is profitable for both participants, the wind farm and the hydro-pump plant. A realistic test case is used to evaluate the proposed method.
