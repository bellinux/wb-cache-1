25|$|A {{countersink}} is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the <b>countersunk</b> hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.|$|E
500|$|New Ironsides had a {{complete}} waterline belt of wrought iron that was [...] thick. Below the waterline it {{was reduced to}} [...] It reached [...] above the waterline and [...] below. Above the belt the [...] battery was protected by 4.5-inch armor, but the bow and stern were left unprotected. Although not initially part of the design, transverse bulkheads were added during construction to protect {{the ends of the}} battery. They consisted of [...] of wrought iron backed by [...] of white oak. The deck was three inches of yellow pine beneath [...] of wrought iron. Mirroring French practice, the armor plates were secured to the ship's hull and deck by <b>countersunk</b> screws. The armor plates were cut with a groove on each side and an iron bar was inserted between each plate to better distribute the shock of impact. The side armor was backed by [...] of wood. A conning tower with three-inch sides was also added during construction. It was placed behind the funnel and the mainmast, and had no visibility directly forward. It was small and could only fit three people.|$|E
50|$|Good chatter-free {{results can}} usually be had by <b>countersinking</b> by hand (as opposed to running the tool in a powered spindle). The slow speed and {{sensitive}} feed tend to prevent chatter. With a quarter-inch-hex shank, the <b>countersink</b> cutter can be held with a screwdriver handle of the indexable - bit type.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{people find}} good vision {{correction}} and comfort with a [...] "piggyback" [...] lens combination, in which RGP lenses are worn over soft lenses, both providing {{a degree of}} vision correction. One form of piggyback lens makes use of a soft lens with a <b>countersunk</b> central area to accept the rigid lens.

2500|$|In the December 1938 designs, {{aircraft}} installations {{were intended}} to be fitted at the ship's center, with trainable catapults between the fore tower and the funnel, with a hangar at the aft tower's base. Problems with positioning the [...] AA battery too near the main and secondary batteries resulted, in February 1939, in repositioning the aircraft installations at the ship's stern. A single axial catapult would have had its pedestal <b>countersunk</b> in the quarterdeck, with an internal hangar in a recess under the first deck and a lift to hoist the seaplanes to the first deck level to avoid the blast effects of the rear [...] turret firing, which also would have required raising the aft [...] turret up one deck, on the Vittorio Veneto-class battleships. The hull seaplanes would have been of a new twin-motored type, the Farman/NCAC NC 420, with an increased endurance ( [...] km at 240km/h, versus [...] km at 150km/h for the Loire 130). Its prototype was almost complete in June 1940 but never flew. Two seaplanes would have been stowed in the hangar in line, and a third one would have been parked on rails on the quarterdeck, to the aviation hangar's starboard.|$|E

5000|$|Small (c. 1/4" [...] diameter) {{threaded}} {{drill bits}} and <b>countersinks</b> {{are common in}} aircraft metal work. Threaded drill bits may be held in drills meant to reach into very tight spaces, and threaded <b>countersink</b> cutters are widely used (along with finely adjustable depth stops) to create holes which put a matching rivet directly flush with the surface.|$|R
50|$|Form <b>countersinking,</b> {{also known}} as dimpling, is a <b>countersink</b> that is formed into sheet metal to {{increase}} {{the strength of a}} structure as the <b>countersinks</b> of multiple pieces nest together. There are two processes for producing formed countersinks: coin dimpling and modified radius dimpling. Such dimples in fairly thick sheet can even be tapped to yield a threaded hardpoint on the sheet without the bother and expense of welding a nut to the sheet. This style of construction is often seen in modern household appliance design, because it allows the product to be lower-priced, and the quality can still be good as long as the sheet is thick enough.|$|R

60|$|Presently {{the door}} {{commenced}} to recede before me {{until it had}} sunk into the wall fifty feet, then it stopped and slid easily to the left, exposing a short, narrow corridor of concrete, at the further end of which was another door, similar in every respect to the one I had just passed. No one was in sight, yet immediately we passed the first door it slid gently into place behind us and receded rapidly to its original position in the front wall of the building. As the door had slipped aside I had noted its great thickness, fully twenty feet, and as it reached its place once more after closing behind us, great cylinders of steel had dropped from the ceiling behind it and fitted their lower ends into apertures <b>countersunk</b> in the floor.|$|E
60|$|The {{central body}} {{of it is}} hidden in the snowy {{sparkling}} mist enveloping it; {{and how can you}} certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, {{how do you know that}} they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is <b>countersunk</b> into the summit of the whale's head? For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.|$|E
60|$|Some {{idea of the}} {{magnitude}} and weight of the vessel may be formed {{from the fact that}} each iron plate weighs about the third of a ton, and is fastened with a hundred iron rivets. About thirty thousand of these plates were used in her construction, and three million rivets. The fastening of these rivets was one among the many curious operations performed in course of building. The riveting men were arranged in gangs, each gang consisting of two riveters, one holder-up, and three boys. Two boys were stationed at the fire or portable forge, and one with the holder-up. This boy's duty was to receive the red-hot rivet with his pincers from the boy at the forge, and insert it in the hole destined for its reception, the point protruding about an inch. The holder-up immediately placed his heavy hammer against the head of the rivet, and held it firmly there, while the two riveters assailed it in front with alternate blows, until the <b>countersunk</b> part of the hole was filled up, after which the protruding head was cut off smooth with the plate, the whole operation scarce occupying a minute. In riveting the double part of the ship the holder-up and his boy were necessarily in the interior part of the tubes, and passed the whole day in the narrow space between, (of two feet ten inches wide), in comparative darkness, having only the glimmer afforded by a single dip candle, and being immediately under the deafening blows of the riveters.|$|E

50|$|A {{flush rivet}} is used {{primarily}} on external metal surfaces where good appearance and {{the elimination of}} unnecessary aerodynamic drag are important. A flush rivet takes advantage of a countersink hole; they are also commonly referred to as <b>countersunk</b> rivets. <b>Countersunk</b> or flush rivets are used extensively on the exterior of aircraft for aerodynamic reasons as it not allow to raise the drag while installed. Additional post-installation machining may be performed to perfect the airflow.|$|E

5000|$|A back <b>countersink,</b> {{also known}} as an {{inserted}} <b>countersink,</b> is a two piece <b>countersink</b> used on tough to reach areas. One component is a rod that is inserted into the existing hole in the workpieces; the other component is the cutter, which {{is attached to the}} rod, or extends out of it, after it is in position. This is comparable to other types of [...] "back-" [...] machining, such as back-spotfacing, back-boring, back-counterboring, back-milling, and back-deburring. The common theme is accomplishing machining operations {{on the far side of}} the workpiece from the spindle face, which obviates a [...] "second operation" [...] setup. This reduces setup time and frustration in several ways. Not only does it obviate the flipping over, cleaning, reclamping, etc., but it also can allow effortless high concentricity, parallelism, and squareness with the first setup's datum without the hassle of reestablishing it on another setup (via indicating painstakingly).|$|R
