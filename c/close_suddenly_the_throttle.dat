50|$|Carbureted engines' {{exhaust raw}} fuel content tends to spike when <b>the</b> driver <b>suddenly</b> {{releases}} <b>the</b> <b>throttle.</b> To prevent <b>the</b> startling and potentially damaging {{effects of the}} explosive combustion of this raw fuel, a diverter valve is used. This valve senses the sharp increase in intake manifold vacuum resulting from the sudden closure of <b>the</b> <b>throttle,</b> and diverts <b>the</b> air pump's outlet to atmosphere. Usually this diverted air is routed to the engine air cleaner or to a separate silencer to muffle objectionable pump noise.|$|R

50|$|Humphrey's pump {{consists}} of a large U-shaped tube, filled with water. One end is sealed by a heavy cast iron 'combustion head'. The combustion head contains the inlet and exhaust valves, the ignition source and withstands {{the pressure of the}} combustion chamber. Water enters the pump through sprung inlet valves below the combustion chamber. A distinctive feature of the Humphrey pump, compared to others, is that the water only has to flow through this single set of valves: there are no non-return outlet valves, only the inertia of the delivered water within the outlet pipe is used to control its flow. As there are no delivery valves opening and <b>closing</b> <b>suddenly,</b> <b>the</b> water flow changes smoothly, avoiding water hammer and the usual problems for this type of pump.|$|R
50|$|The second festival again ran {{for seven}} days {{starting}} 24 July, and the team attempted to host 24 plays that year, though minor setbacks resulted in 21 shows planned across five venues: The Midland Hotel, Life Cafe, Baby Grand and Late Room (all on Peter Street, Manchester), and The King’s Arms in Salford. However, Baby Grand was <b>closed</b> <b>suddenly</b> and <b>The</b> King's Arms proved unavailable, forcing venue changes to Bedlam and a second space at The Midland Hotel.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} about Shingū Elementary School which is beset {{by a lot of}} problems. Seichiro Naruse, a {{construction}} worker whose company <b>closed</b> down, <b>suddenly</b> becomes <b>the</b> principal of his old school. He must save the school from closing down.|$|R

50|$|Etsuo Matsuki and {{his team}} {{developed}} another interesting feature to increase TDM engine torque and power: A variable intake duct effectively brings out the full potential of the new injection system. The air cleaner box will automatically adjust the air intake volume in accordance with engine rpm. Below 4000rpm the duct closes down {{about one-third of the}} intake area. The result is amazing: when <b>suddenly</b> opening <b>the</b> <b>throttle,</b> <b>the</b> new 900 twin pulls stronger than ever without any hesitation. And {{with the help of the}} injection system even on high mountain roads (up to 3000 meter!) the fuel mixture is always adjusted properly. Riders who use their bike often on higher altitude, will fully understand and appreciate these benefits. A 3-way catalytic converter is standard and reduces emissions effectively in the background.|$|R
50|$|The village used {{to contain}} a Butchers, Far Shop, Freezer Shop, post office and Master Saddler's which have all shut down in recent years. In 2016, the Village pub <b>closed</b> down <b>suddenly</b> leaving <b>the</b> village folk to trek to Alconbury {{to search for a}} pint.|$|R
50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when <b>suddenly</b> opening <b>the</b> <b>throttle.</b> This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> butterfly. <b>The</b> fuel metering orifice was controlled in immediate proportion to <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle slide carburettor. Between the float chamber and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> spindle. This arm has an inlet hole at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> arm moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect of a vane pump and acts as an accelerator pump to force additional fuel into the jet when <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> is first opened.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{locomotives}} {{are also}} {{fitted with a}} blower, which is a device that releases steam directly into the smokebox for use when a greater draught is needed without a greater volume of steam passing through the cylinders. An example of such situation is when <b>the</b> regulator is <b>closed</b> <b>suddenly,</b> or <b>the</b> train passes through a tunnel. If a single line tunnel is poorly ventilated, a locomotive entering at high speed can cause a rapid compression of the air within the tunnel. This compressed air may enter the chimney with substantial force. This can be extremely dangerous if the firebox door is open at the time. For this reason the blower is often turned on in these situations, to counteract the compression effect.|$|R

I thank you." [...] Even Big Jule declares: [...] "I used to be bad when I was a kid. But ever since then I've gone straight, as I can prove by my record—33 arrests and no convictions." [...] Nicely-Nicely Johnson (Stubby Kaye) however, recalling a dream he had the night before, seems to have an {{authentic}} connection to the Mission's aim, and this satisfies everyone.|$|R
50|$|The steam blast {{is largely}} self-regulating: an {{increase}} in the rate of steam consumption by the cylinders increases the blast, which increases the draught and hence the temperature of the fire. Modern locomotives are also fitted with a blower, which is a device that releases steam directly into the smokebox for use when a greater draught is needed without a greater volume of steam passing through the cylinders. An example of such situation is when <b>the</b> regulator is <b>closed</b> <b>suddenly,</b> or <b>the</b> train passes through a tunnel.

5000|$|On 21 May 1918, Wakiva II steamed in convoy with a {{group of}} eight ships on the port flank, heading eastward from the French coast. As fog set in shortly after sunset, speed was reduced. The ships crept along with Wakiva II taking station on the {{freighter}} [...] Zigzagging ceased with the onset of the murky weather, and Noma sent a message to the convoy commodore, in the U.S. Army transport , to this effect. By 03:00 hours on the 22 May, visibility improved — but only briefly — before the convoy slipped into another fog bank. The sounds of whistles from the loosely assembled shipping could be heard aboard Wakiva II and, at 03:10 hours, those on watch in Wakiva II distinctly heard Wabashs whistle but could not see the ship. As another blast from the cargo vessel sounded even closer soon thereafter, Lieutenant Commander E. G. Allen, commanding the yacht, ordered the helm put over to port one point (11.25 degrees), and the whistle sounded. Ten seconds later, Wabash loosed another blast, even <b>closer.</b> <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>the</b> shape of the cargo vessel loomed out of the mist and bore down on Wakiva II. Ringing down full speed ahead, Allen ordered a turn to port, but before the helm could be put over, Wabashs bow tore into the yacht's starboard quarter, just abaft the mainmast and forward of the after guns, and ripped a mortal gash in the Wakiva IIs side from the main deck down to the propeller shaft. On board Wakiva II, there had been barely enough time to reach the general alarm. The collision threw both ships briefly on parallel courses, carrying away Wabashs starboard boats. Both ships also hung together briefly before parting, with the cargo vessel slowly going astern.|$|R
5000|$|On February 8, 2007, seven {{current and}} former workers at a call-center in Roseburg, Oregon sued the computer-maker, saying the company worked its sales reps [...] "off the clock", failed to provide proper rest-breaks and {{improperly}} recorded their lunch-periods. Moves have begun to turn the case into a class action. Dell <b>suddenly</b> <b>closed</b> down <b>the</b> facility at Roseburg, Oregon on August 2, 2007. The facility had consisted of computer and electronics sales-agents and of customer-service representatives.|$|R
50|$|In July 2011 <b>the</b> state <b>suddenly</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> school, {{stating that}} it will conduct an {{investigation}}. This was in light of {{an investigation by the}} New Orleans Times-Picayune and allegations of a bribery attempt. Some parents believed that the school would be closed, but the RSD stated that it would remain open. As a result of the allegations of misconduct, by August 2011, the state revoked Pelican's contract shortly before {{the beginning of the school}} year. The RSD stated that it would begin directly operating Abramson until it could find another charter operator.|$|R
5000|$|A {{notification}} service provides means {{to send a}} notice to many persons at once. For example, if a flood were likely, residents of a community could be warned it time to evacuate. If a school were <b>suddenly</b> <b>closed</b> for <b>the</b> day, students or parents could be told not come to school, or told to report to an alternate location. American Airlines can notify passengers by cellphone two hours before a flight's departure with information on the flight's status and gate number.|$|R
50|$|When a pipe is <b>suddenly</b> <b>closed</b> at <b>the</b> outlet (downstream), {{the mass}} of water before the closure is still moving, thereby {{building}} up high pressure and a resulting shock wave. In domestic plumbing this is experienced as a loud banging resembling a hammering noise. Water hammer can cause pipelines to break if the pressure is high enough. Air traps or stand pipes (open at the top) are sometimes added as dampers to water systems to absorb the potentially damaging forces caused by the moving water.|$|R

50|$|The first post-war {{rules for}} the top level of motor racing allowed 1.5-litre {{supercharged}} or 4.5-litre normally aspirated engines. BRM's first engine design was an extremely ambitious 1.5-litre supercharged V16. Rolls-Royce was contracted to produce centrifugal superchargers, rather than the more commonly used Roots type. The design concept of the V16 had not been used extensively on automobiles before so that design problems were many and the engine did not fire {{for the first time}} until June 1949. It proved to be outstandingly powerful but its output was produced over a very limited range of engine speed, coming on <b>suddenly</b> if <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> was applied carelessly, resulting in wheelspin as the narrow tyres proved unable to transfer the power to the road. This made the car very touchy to drive. Engineer Tony Rudd was seconded to BRM from Rolls-Royce to develop the supercharging system and remained involved with BRM for nearly twenty years. The Type 15, which was the designation for the V16 car, won the first two races it actually started, the Formula Libre and Formula One events at Goodwood in September 1950, driven by Reg Parnell. However, it was never to be so successful again. The engine proved unreliable and difficult to develop, and the team were not up to the task of improving the situation. A string of failures caused much embarrassment, and the problems were still unsolved when the Commission Sportive Internationale announced in 1952 that for 1954, a new engine formula of 2.5 litres naturally aspirated or 750 cc supercharged would take effect.|$|R
500|$|Tesla claimed {{never to}} sleep {{more than two}} hours per night. However, he did admit to [...] "dozing" [...] from time to time [...] "to {{recharge}} his batteries." [...] During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table. On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without rest. Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: [...] "I was sleeping in my room like one dead... <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>the</b> telephone ring awakened me... spoke animatedly, with pauses, ... work out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at <b>the</b> solution, he <b>suddenly</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> telephone." ...|$|R
5000|$|Every time {{a vehicle}} turns, the vehicle resists {{the change of}} {{direction}} due to inertia. This resistance results in a phenomenon known as understeer, which a driver experiences as {{the front of the}} vehicle running wide towards the outside of the turn. This is due to reduced grip between the front (steering) wheels and the road surface. This is particularly noticeable in Front Wheel Drive vehicle, as the drive to the wheels for a given <b>throttle</b> input overcomes <b>the</b> traction of the tire to the road surface (more power to the driven wheels creates more loss of traction, hence powerful Front Wheel Drive vehicles suffer with understeer). This is partially neutralized by the friction between the tires and the road, so the vehicle rather tilts than slides, but ultimately the front wheels will break traction in a corner. In some rear wheel driven vehicles, the suspension geometry is set up to create [...] "push on" [...] understeer, as this is easier to deal with for the driver than un-predictable and harder to address oversteer). As you abruptly flick the steering wheel in the opposite direction, the inertia of the vehicle that has been trying to slide in the opposite way is added to the force applied by the engine and the friction of the front wheels, thus exceeding the force necessary to break traction between the tires and the tarmac. Since most cars have their engines in the front, the load on the rear tires is less, so they break traction first, effectively causing the rear to slide out. <b>Suddenly</b> lifting <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> causes additional weight transfer to the front, making the load on the rear wheels even less.|$|R

5000|$|On many cars, the {{accelerator}} pedal motion is communicated via <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> cable, to activate <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> linkages, which move <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> plate. In cars with {{electronic throttle control}} (also known as [...] "drive-by-wire"), an electric motor controls <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> linkages and <b>the</b> accelerator pedal connects not to <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> body, but to a sensor, which sends the pedal position to the Engine Control Unit (ECU). The ECU determines <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> opening based on accelerator pedal position and inputs from other engine sensors.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> {{is opened}} up {{slightly}} from the fully closed position, <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> plate uncovers additional fuel delivery holes behind <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> plate {{where there is a}} low pressure area created by <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> plate/Valve blocking air flow; these allow more fuel to flow as well as compensating for the reduced vacuum that occurs when <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> is opened, thus smoothing the transition to metering fuel flow through <b>the</b> regular open <b>throttle</b> circuit.|$|R
25|$|For two years, 1997 and 1998, Adelaide was {{represented}} in Australia's top level rugby league, after the New South Wales Rugby League {{had played a}} single game per season at the Adelaide Oval for five years starting in 1991.

6000|$|... "It {{is hardly}} {{necessary}} {{to say that}} every precaution was taken. Photographs of the cabinet were made before the sittings and afterward, in order that all displacements might be recorded. Provision was made for registering the action of 'John King's' spectral hands. Some of these devices were concealed in an adjoining room and watched by other attendants. One little touch early in Bottazzi's account impressed me deeply. A little electric motor was used to furnish power for the lamps and other apparatus, and Bottazzi, in speaking of it, says: 'At {{the moment when the}} phenomena to be registered began to manifest, the circuit was <b>closed,</b> and <b>suddenly</b> in <b>the</b> complete silence of the night the feeble murmur of the motor was heard.' I thrill to the action of that faithful little material watch-dog. Ghosts and hobgoblins could not silence or affright it. After all, matter is both persistent and bold." ...|$|R
50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} pedal, <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> plate rotates within <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> body, opening <b>the</b> <b>throttle</b> passage to allow more air into the intake manifold.
