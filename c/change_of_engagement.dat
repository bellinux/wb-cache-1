60|$|When Ernest {{received}} {{the letter in}} which Dr. Greatrex informed him {{that he might have}} the third mastership, he hardly knew how to contain his joy. He kissed Edie a dozen times over in his excitement, and sat up late making plans with her which would have been delightful but for poor Edie's lasting sorrow. In a short time it was all duly arranged, and Ernest began to think that he must go back to London for a day or two, to let Lady Le Breton hear of his change of plans, and got everything in order for their quiet wedding. He grudged the journey sadly, for he was beginning to understand now that he must take care of the pence for Edie's sake as well as for humanity's--his abstraction was individualising itself in concrete form--but he felt so much at least was demanded of him by filial duty, and, besides, he had one or two little matters to settle at Epsilon Terrace which could not so well be managed in his absence even by his trusty deputy, Ronald. So he ran up to town once more in a hurry, and dropped in as if nothing had happened, at his mother's house. It was no unusual matter for him to pass a fortnight at Wilton Place without finding time to call round at Epsilon Terrace to see Ronald, and his mother had not heard at all as yet of his recent <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement.</b>|$|E

Fundamentally, we strongly assert that engagement research needs to adopt a more critical stance that provides students with opportunities to examine and to critique the educational system in which they participate (or sometimes refuse to participate).

40|$|Background: Poor parental {{engagement}} in parent training programmes is problematic as it wastes resources, affects prevention research, and prevent parents {{from engaging in}} programming that may benefit them. Understanding predictors <b>of</b> <b>engagement,</b> and how it relates to programme outcomes, is central to developing efficient interventions. There has been very little research into these relationships in low- and middle-income countries, like South Africa, and so this study sought to investigate them in the Sinovuyo Caring Families Programme (SCFP) when it was evaluated via randomised controlled trial (N = 296 parent-child dyads) in South Africa. Methods: Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to explore baseline predictors of enrolment, attendance, and level of home practice completion among intervention group participants. Additionally, qualitative data on the barriers and facilitators <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> was collected via semi-structured interviews with 32 of these participants. This data was analysed thematically. Finally, generalised linear mixed methods were used to investigate whether there was an association between attendance and programme outcomes. Results: Lower levels of parenting stress, greater use of physical discipline and lower use of psychological discipline significantly predicted the odds of enrolling. There were no significant predictors of attendance, while there was an effect of facilitation pair {{on the extent of}} home practice completion. According to qualitative findings, structural, programmatic, and personal factors all affected {{engagement in}} the SCFP. Commonly mentioned barriers included alcohol abuse, financial constraints, and a lack <b>of</b> readiness to <b>change.</b> Facilitators <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> included a greater sense of motivation and family buy-in. Conclusion: Since higher attendance was associated with greater programme benefits, more effort is needed to support enrolment and retention. Parent training interventions should consider parents' readiness for change. Motivational interviewing approaches at the start may help to increase engagement. Programme implementers should also minimise financial barriers to access, such as by providing transport money before the first session or situating programme venues close to participants' homes. Programmes cannot be viewed in isolation of other community problems, such as alcohol abuse, that may affect participants...|$|R
40|$|Many {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that level of automation in an adaptive system should be coupled to mental workload, which would ideally create {{a system in which}} mental workload experienced by the operator remains stable. Traditionally, mental workload has been defined as a ratio between resources required and resource available.

However, as this is not always the case, a measure parallel to the traditional workload measure, but which conceptually includes motivational aspects is suggested. Mental engagement, defined as the amount of resources actually mobilized for task perfromance, reflects effort an operator is willing to exert for task performance at a given moment. We further suggest that, within a participant, the resources one actually puts into a task and Task Complexity can explain Task Performance. Combining <b>changes</b> in Level <b>of</b> <b>Engagement,</b> Task Complexity and Task Performance could be used in an adaptive system in which Level <b>of</b> <b>Engagement</b> and Task Complexity determine type and moment of task allocations and Task Performance is used as a control variable...|$|R

40|$|Graffiti {{artists and}} guerrilla gardeners {{challenge}} our perceptions and {{conceptions of the}} relationship between people and things, and in particular {{the ways in which the}} law frames property rights. But these ‘outlaws’ are evidence of a wider movement that is questioning the boundaries between public and private, between proprietorial claims and personal claims, and between what falls within the legal framework and what falls outside it. New and evolving relationships between people and the natural and built environment pose questions for the normative and regulative context in which property rights have traditionally operated and suggest that there is a wealth of interaction with land which is liminal to, or beyond, the limits of the legal. This chapter looks first at different forms <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> with physical space exploring ways in which this engagement manifests itself, the legal or illegal milieu in which the activity takes place and the extent to which, if at all, the law provides an enabling or restrictive environment. The paper then considers if these forms <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> reflect contemporary <b>changes</b> in values and concerns, for example, about the environment; public rights of access and use versus private rights of exclusivity, preservation or reclamation of heritage; community empowerment versus corporate or institutional might; local autonomy versus state ubiquity; and more broadly a reaction against prevailing property values. In combination these elements may suggest that the landscape is being changed and that the lawscape too may have to <b>change.</b> These forms <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> may also mark a reaction against the commoditization of things and a reassertion of place as identity going beyond the physical, thereby suggesting a counter-revolution to the process taking place in the developing world where traditional forms of land tenure in which identity and place are closely linked, are imperilled by the drive to commoditize property in the interests of development...|$|R

We focus on two web sites: www. barficulture. com and www. britishbornchinese. org. uk, drawing on interviews with site editors, content analysis of the discussion forums, and E-mail exchanges with site users. Our analysis of these two web sites shows how collective identities still matter, being redefined rather than erased by online interaction. We understand the site content through the notion of reflexive racialisation. We use this term to modify the stress given to individualisation in accounts of reflexive modernisation. In addition we question the allocation of racialised meaning from above implied by the concept of racialisation. Internet discussion forums can act as witnesses to social inequalities and through sharing experiences of racism and marginalisation, an oppositional social perspective may develop.

Cultural perspectives suggest different ways. Just as artistic traditions and practices vary from culture to culture, cultural orientations to artistic development and pedagogy manifest different paths. While research on artistic development and creativity generally tends to focus on children’s development and capacity in the West, cultural perspectives urge us to look at them as maturing further during adulthood.

40|$|The EU has, {{for a long}} time, portrayed {{itself as}} an {{international}} leader on climate change. Previous studies have {{tended to focus on}} the characteristics of EU leadership, but have failed to examine the extent to which EU leadership generates “followership”. Going beyond these existing approaches, this dissertation analyzes not just EU attempts at leadership but also the response of two potential followers: China and India. Based on extensive fieldwork, the dissertation explains the pattern <b>of</b> EU <b>engagement</b> and the response to engagement in each case, and makes three key arguments. First, EU engagement was driven by a desire to build the international role of the EU, but also from 2000 onwards in particular by growing normative concern and material interest within the EU regarding combating climate <b>change.</b> The development <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> was also conditioned by the broader development of EU relations with China and India. Second, EU engagement took the form of institutionalized dialogue and capacity-building projects. These were generally more extensive in the EU-China case; the EU-India relationship was significantly more limited. Both cases were characterized by a lack of EU capacity—particularly the EU-India case—and to some extent by inconsistency and incoherence. Third, the Chinese Government responded through limited normative emulation and limited but growing lesson-drawing through bilateral cooperation in specific sectors. While the Indian Government also responded through limited normative emulation, the principal Indian response was resistance. Moreover, both the Chinese and Indian Governments resisted the EU approach to the international climate change negotiations. This pattern <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> and significant resistance stemmed partly from the EU’s failure to develop sufficient capacity for effective engagement, but also partly due to significant differences in the way each side has framed the issue <b>of</b> climate <b>change.</b> Based on these findings, the dissertation concludes that while the EU was not entirely a leader without followers, it has acted as a highly restricted leader in its relations with China and India on climate change.
