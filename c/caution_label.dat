40|$|This guide {{helps you}} manage your {{peroxide}} forming chemicals. It also outlines the {{procedures for the}} required stabilization of peroxide forming chemicals and destruction of peroxides prior to disposal. Peroxides formed in organic compounds can cause serious accidents. In some circumstances, peroxides become low power explosives. In other circumstances, they are sensitive to shock, sparks, and flames. The danger is increased when a peroxide forming chemical is concentrated by distillation or evaporation. If you use peroxide forming chemicals, you must understand the {{factors that contribute to}} peroxide formation. You must also manage your chemicals correctly and periodically test for peroxides. Management Manage your peroxide forming chemicals wisely and diligently to avoid having to test and stabilize peroxide forming chemicals in the first place. Follow these steps: 1. Keep chemical containers tightly closed. Chemicals packaged in tightly sealed, unopened containers and stabilized with an added chemical or packed under inert gas will not form dangerous concentrations of peroxides, since oxygen is necessary for formation of peroxides. 2. Keep containers in opaque containers away from light sources. Exposure to light accelerates peroxide formation. Airtight amber glass containers are best. Amber glass protects the chemical from light exposure while allowing you to view the chemical without opening the container. 3. Keep a careful inventory of your peroxide forming chemicals.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{asks whether}} it is {{possible}} to identify, using purely statistical criteria on widely available quantitative data, a set of developing countries that can be classified as poor performers. We restrict attention to two performance indicators, economic growth and infant mortality, over two periods 1980 – 90 and 1990 – 2000, and use four different statistical criteria to identify poor performance. The main finding is that very few countries consistently appear as poor performers: those that perform poorly on one indicator, or in one period, typically do not perform poorly on/in the other. A similar result is obtained in the context of identifying, on statistical grounds, good performers.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{analysis}} looks at four communities in Rift Valley, Kenya including Matisi, Moi’s Bridge, Sirende and Waitaluk. The {{research focuses on}} the role of markets in achieving food and livelihood security for the smallholders in these communities and smallholders’ perceptions of the roles of the Government of Kenya and other institutions in facilitating market access. The largest challenges to market participation, as reported by the smallholders in the studied communities, include low yields, weather inconsistencies, and lack of land. In terms of the Government of Kenya, many smallholders noted the benefits of participating in groups as they are subsequently offered training or field days and subsidies. A significant group of respondents did comment on their lack of interest in joining similar groups as they were seen as unstable or corrupt. The potential roles of formal and informal markets to increase food security were also analyzed. All smallholders wished to be participating in informal markets, but twenty-five percent were constrained by the lack of surplus produce. Similarly, although many reported their desire to be participants in formal markets lack of surplus produce, price fluctuations, inconsistent weather patterns, transportation costs and post- harvest losses or food waster were recognized as significant barriers. In order to mitigate these constraints, most smallholders recommended subsidies on inputs and the overall restructuring of markets. It is recommended that organizations and governments implement a livelihood diversification policy program or initiative to diversify and intensify agricultural activities and other non-agricultural activities. This case study analysis demonstrates the need to recognize the importance of local contexts, specifically Rift Valley as much of the research done in Kenya is found in Nairobi and surrounding areas and <b>cautions</b> <b>labeling</b> communities as food secure based on favorable conditions...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION A {{specific}} {{objective of the}} study was to look for correlations between myopia and optic disc measurements obtained by Primus SD-OCT. Retinal nerve fibre layer thickness was measured by Primus SD-OCT in both normal and myopic eyes. MATERIAL & METHODS This is a cross-sectional case control study conducted over a period of 18 months from July, 2014 to December, 2015 at DR. B. R. Ambedkar Medical College and Hospital, Bangalore, India on analysis of optic disc and peripapillary area using Primus spectral domain OCT in young Indian adult myopic eyes. A total of 108 eyes were studied in which 40 were normal (emmetropia), 27 were mild myopia (≤ 3 D) and 41 were moderate to severe myopia (> 3 D). Patients in all three groups were age matched. All patients were of young age between 20 to 40 years. All images were acquired by Primus SD-OCT. Measurements of the ONH parameters and the peripapillary RNFLT were noted by OCT. The data was then analysed after dividing the patients into three groups: the normal group and the myopic group. The myopic group was further sub-divided into mild myopia (≤ 3 D) and moderate to severe myopia (> 3 D). The mean disc area of eyes in the control (emmetrope) group was 2. 3 ± 0. 4 mm. 2 The mean disc area in the mild myopia group was 2. 07 ± 0. 32 mm 2 while that of the eyes in the moderate to severe myopia group was 1. 8 ± 0. 4 mm. 2 The difference between the groups was statistically significant, suggesting that as myopia increases disc area decreases. The other parameters were analysed statistically in a similar fashion and the results were tabulated and explained. Myopic patients review periodically for their refractive error correction. Myopic disc findings may mimic optic disc changes suggestive of optic neuropathy. The data and results obtained in the current study suggest that optic disc parameters vary in myopic eyes compared to emmetropic eyes by SD-OCT. Therefore, in myopic eyes, OCT parameters should be interpreted with <b>caution</b> before <b>labelling</b> them as glaucomatous or any other disease causing RNFL thinning and variation in ONH values. Clinical correlation along with OCT parameters are essential before formulating a definitive diagnosis. CONCLUSION OCT is a non-contact, non-invasive imaging modality that is used to take high resolution, in-vivo, and cross-sectional pictures of the optic nerve head. OCT, thus, helps to quantify the structural damage that an eye has suffered due to glaucoma. While performing OCT studies in normal (emmetrope) and myopic eyes in the current investigation, it was found that there was thinning in the retinal nerve fibre layer in superior, inferior, nasal and average thickness values in myopic eyes which was more marked in moderate to high myopia than in mild myopia. The disc area was smaller in high myopes compared to the normal eyes. The cup volume was smaller in high myopes which correlated with the smaller disc area. There was no significant correlation between spherical equivalent and RNFLT. Myopic patients review periodically for their refractive error correction. Myopic disc findings may mimic optic disc changes suggestive of optic neuropathy. The data obtained in the current investigation suggests that optic disc parameters vary in myopic eyes compared to emmetropic eyes by spectral domain OCT. therefore, in myopic eyes, OCT parameters should be interpreted with <b>caution</b> before <b>labelling</b> them as glaucomatous or any other disease causing RNFL thinning and variation in ONH values.

40|$|Understanding the {{efficacy}} of passive (reduction or cessation of environmental stress) and active (typically involving planting or seeding) restoration strategies {{is important for the}} design of successful revegetation of degraded riparian habitat, but studies explicitly comparing restoration outcomes are uncommon. We sampled the understory herbaceous plant community of 103 riparian sites varying in age since restoration (0 to 39 years) and revegetation technique (active, passive, or none) to compare the utility of different approaches on restoration success across sites. We found that landform type, percent shade, and summer flow helped explain differences in the understory functional community across all sites. In passively restored sites, grass and forb cover and richness were inversely related to site age, but in actively restored sites forb cover and richness were inversely related to site age. Native cover and richness were lower with passive restoration compared to active restoration. Invasive species cover and richness were not significantly different across sites. Although some of our results suggest that active restoration would best enhance native species in degraded riparian areas, this work also highlights some of the context-dependency that has been found to mediate restoration outcomes. For example, since the effects of passive restoration can be quite rapid, this approach might be more useful than active restoration in situations where rapid dominance of pioneer species is required to arrest major soil loss through erosion. As a result, we <b>caution</b> against <b>labeling</b> one restoration technique as better than another. Managers should identify ideal restoration outcomes in the context of historic and current site characteristics (as well as a range of acceptable alternative states) and choose restoration approaches that best facilitate the achievement of revegetation goals...|$|R

40|$|Signaling {{through the}} IGF-I {{receptor}} by locally produced IGF-I or -II {{is critical for}} normal skeletal muscle development and repair after injury. In most tissues, IGF action is modulated by IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFBP- 5 is produced by muscle cells, and previous {{studies have suggested that}} when overexpressed it may either facilitate or inhibit IGF actions, and thus potentially enhance or diminish IGF-mediated myoblast differentiation or survival. To resolve these contradictory observations and discern the mechanisms of action of IGFBP- 5, we studied its effects in cultured muscle cells. Purified wild-type (WT) mouse IGFBP- 5 or a variant with diminished extracellular matrix binding (C domain mutant) each prevented differentiation at final concentrations as low as 3. 5 nm, whereas analogs with reduced IGF binding (N domain mutant) were ineffective even at 100 nm. None of the IGFBP- 5 variants altered cell number. An IGF-I analog (R 3 IGF-I) with diminished affinity for IGFBPs promoted full muscle differentiation in the presence of IGFBP- 5 WT, showing that IGFBP- 5 interferes with IGF-dependent signaling pathways in myoblasts. When IGFBP- 5 WT or variants were overexpressed by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, concentrations in muscle culture medium reached 500 nm, and differentiation was inhibited, even by IGFBP- 5 N. As 200 nm of purified IGFBP- 5 N prevented activation of the IGF-I receptor by 10 nm IGF-II as effectively as 2 nm of IGFBP- 5 WT, our results not only demonstrate that IGFBP- 5 variants with reduced IGF binding affinity impair muscle differentiation by blocking IGF actions, but underscore the need for <b>caution</b> when <b>labeling</b> effects of IGFBPs as IGF independent because even low-affinity analogs may potently inhibit IGF-I or -II if present at high enough concentrations in biological fluids...|$|R

History revealed that the child had progressively worsening breathlessness and persistent dry cough not associated with fever but accompanied by weight loss. On physical examination, there was growth failure, respiratory distress, clubbing, hepatosplenomegaly, and occasional rhonchi. Blood gas revealed hypoxemia which improved with oxygen administration. Plain X-rays and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed perihilar alveolar infiltrates and patchy consolidation. The clinicoradiological features did not support a diagnosis of asthma but favored interstitial lung disease (ILD). Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed as a first-tier investigation. It showed periodic acid–Schiff-negative foamy macrophages. The clues of consanguinity, visceromegaly, ILD, and foamy macrophages in the bronchoalveolar fluid prompted consideration of lysosomal storage disorders as the likely etiology.

Results: Using the NHANES III reference intervals, medians of weight (+ 0. 46), height (+ 0. 29) and BMI z-scores (+ 0. 46) were significantly non-zero. The WHO (2007) growth charts yielded medians of + 2. 05, + 0. 32, + 0. 53 for weight, height and BMI z-scores respectively, all significantly non-zero. When comparing both growth charts, Canadian children had significantly different weight and BMI z-scores (p 95 th percentile) doubled from 8. 6 % to 16. 0 %. A significant age dependency was observed with higher WHO (2007) weight z-scores (> 7 years) and higher BMI z-scores (7 to 13 years) and no significant difference was observed for height z-scores across all age groups.
