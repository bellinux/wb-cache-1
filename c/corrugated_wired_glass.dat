40|$|Abstract — <b>Corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> mesh {{laminates}} (CWML) are a {{class of}} engineered open cell structures that have potential for applications in many areas including aerospace and biomedical engineering. Two different methods of fabricating <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> mesh laminates from stainless steel, one using a high temperature Lithobraze alloy and the other using a low temperature Eutectic solder for joining the <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> meshes are described herein. Their implementation is demonstrated by manufacturing CWML samples of 304 and 316 stainless steel (SST). It is seen that due to the facility of employing wire meshes of different densities and wire diameters, {{it is possible to}} create CWML laminates {{with a wide range of}} effective densities. The fabricated laminates are tested under uniaxial compression. The variation of the compressive yield strength with relative density of the CWML is compared to the theory developed by Gibson and Ashby for open cell structures [22]. It is shown that the compressive strength of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> mesh laminates can be described using the same equations by using an appropriate value for the linear coefficient in the Gibson-Ashby model...|$|R
50|$|<b>Wire</b> mesh <b>glass</b> (also {{known as}} Georgian <b>Wired</b> <b>Glass)</b> has a grid or mesh of thin metal wire {{embedded}} within the <b>glass.</b> <b>Wired</b> <b>glass,</b> {{as it is}} typically described, does not perform the function most individuals associate with it. The presence of the wire mesh {{appears to be a}} strengthening component, as it is metallic, and conjures up the idea of rebar in reinforced concrete or other such examples. Despite this belief, <b>wired</b> <b>glass</b> is actually weaker than unwired glass due to the incursions of the wire into the structure of the <b>glass.</b> <b>Wired</b> <b>glass</b> often may cause heightened injury in comparison to unwired <b>glass,</b> as the <b>wire</b> amplifies the irregularity of any fractures.This has led to a decline in its use institutionally, particularly in schools.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide greater meaning and {{significance}} to <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> {{so that it}} may be preserved by exploring the historical origins and complexity of manufacture of the medium. The Industrial Revolution was a period of amazing evolution in the history of glass manufacture. Plate glass technology allowed for new design and building construction concepts, including the Crystal Palace, but this was an imperfect technology. As the brilliant minds of the Revolution struggled to grapple with the obstacles posed by plate <b>glass,</b> <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> was eventually born. This new glass type spread across the United States in subsequent years, fueled by uniform manufacture standards on the city and state levels and the American mass media’s coverage of conflagrations, which led to the public’s association of <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> with safety given its fire retardant and shatterproof qualities. <b>Wire</b> <b>glass</b> was technically incredibly difficult to produce, especially in mass production, and although inventors experimented with various treatments and patterns, <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> remained and was comparatively expensive (though people generally believed the safety benefits outweighed the costs). <b>Wire</b> <b>glass</b> fell into disfavor during the World Wars as it was replaced by newer types of glass that were more economical, but recent trends have sparked renewed interest in the use and hence preservation of <b>wire</b> <b>glass.</b> Original methods of <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> manufacture using early wire netting patterns no longer exist, and so current methods of preservation and conservation involving replication through glass lamination methods using imported wire nettings and salvage are discussed. Possible conservation treatments for repair are debated and further research is concluded...|$|R

40|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>Wire</b> Mesh Laminates (CWML) {{are open}} cell type {{cellular}} structures manufactured by bonding {{several layers of}} metallic <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> meshes {{on top of each}} other. Due to their open cell structure and the mechanical properties of the parent material, CWML can offer high stiffness and strength per unit weight. Therefore, they have many potential applications where lightweight and high rigidity and strength are required, such as in sandwich constructions in mechanical and aerospace engineering, and orthopaedic implants in biomedical engineering. The main loading in such applications is transverse compression, occasionally accompanied by in-plane shear. This thesis presents an attempt to understand and characterise the behaviour of <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> mesh laminates under transverse compression loading. First, a theoretical model is developed for the CWML using a truss structure to approximate the <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire.</b> Although simplistic, this model is useful in establishing expressions for the relative density, effective transverse stiffness and transverse compressive strength of the CWML. The influences of wire diameter, opening width, and the corrugation angle on these parameters are established. A new method is developed for the fabrication of CWML at a relatively low temperature of 225 degrees Celsius making it significantly simpler and cost effective compared to existing methods. For the first time, a finite element model is developed to numerically simulate the deformation behaviour of CWML under transverse compression and shear loading. The numerical model investigates the effects of nonlinearities such as material nonlinearity, large deformation behaviour, curvature {{at the tip of the}} corrugations and friction. Experimental testing is conducted on several samples of single layer, two layer, and four layer wire mesh laminates under transverse compression and separately under shear loading. The test results show considerable scatter probably due to variations in the quality of the bonding in the manufacturing process. The load deflection behaviours of the single and multi layer laminates observed in the tests are compared to those analytically determined by the numerical simulations. Unfortunately, the agreement between the numerical analysis and the experimental results is rather poor; this is attributed to the bends in the wires as they cross over each other in the mesh, which were not modelled in the simulation. The finite element (FE) model, therefore, requires further improvement; nevertheless, it does provide significant insight into aspects that influence the deformation behaviour of CWML...|$|R

Development of such a model will facilitate numerical simulation of the mechanical behaviour of the wire mesh structure under various types of loading as well as the variation of the CWML configuration parameters to tailor its mechanical properties to suit the intended application. Starting with a single strand truss model consisting of four waves with a bilinear stress-strain model to represent the plastic behaviour of stainless steel, the finite element model is gradually built up to study single-layer structures with 18 strands of <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> meshes consistency and double- and quadruple-layered laminates with alternating crossply orientations. The compressive behaviour of the CWML model is simulated using contact elements to model friction and is compared to the load-deflection behaviour determined experimentally in uniaxial compression tests. The numerical model of the CWML is then employed to conduct the aim of establishing the upper and lower bounds of stiffness and load capacity achievable by such structures...|$|R

Due to their open structure and the mechanical properties of the parent material, CWML can offer high stiffness and strength per unit weight.

The main loading in such applications is transverse compression, occasionally accompanied by in-plane shear. The strength of CWML depends on the several geometrical parameters involved in the configuration of structure. The objective {{of this paper is to}} determine the effect of geometrical parameters like corrugation angle, laminates structure and number of corrugated layers on the strength of CWML. For this purpose, samples of CWML are produced in the combinations of three different levels of corrugation angle, laminates structure and number of corrugated layers. The strength of each structure is recorded by subjecting them to compression test. By applying design of experimentation technique, using Taguchi methodology results have analyzed and optimum levels of each controlling parameters are determined for maximum strength of CWML. The maximum strength of CWML per unit weight is found with corrugation angle of 45 °, sandwich laminates structure and three corrugated layers.
