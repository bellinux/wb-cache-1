The Otlachimalli was used as a battle shield. The reverse was reinforced by horizontal and vertical wooden struts. A leather cover was used to protect the <b>carrying</b> <b>arm.</b> In some shields tortoise shell was used to manufacture decorations. [...] The Cuauhchimalli was made of wood and decorated in the same manner as the Otlachimalli. On the cuauhchimalli also mosaics from stone chips were sometimes applied. The reverse was equipped with two leather straps which were used for carrying the shield. In both types a leather pad was attached to the front as the basis for the ornaments, and they had a curtain of leather [...] "straps" [...] attached to the bottom portion of the shield which served as extra protection from arrows.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, some {{considerations}} {{about the}} state of the art and the current trends in the design and control of “robot hands ” are reported and discussed. The authors, on the basis of a long research activity for the development of robotic end-effectors and related technologies, address what they consider key-points for the development of “dextrous hands”, being related this term not only to kinematics properties or aesthetic appearance, but also to sensory system, control strategies, integration with the <b>carrying</b> <b>arm</b> and so on [...] In particular, some indices are defined as an attempt to present a clear comparison of the different “robot hands ” presented in the literature. The indices refer to the degree of anthropomorphism, that is the resemblance with the human hand concerning aspect and mechanical structure, and to the level of dexterity, resultant from the kinematic configuration, the sensory apparatus and the control system. ...|$|E
