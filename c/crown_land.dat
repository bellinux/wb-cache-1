5|$|The Diet of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, {{and of the}} Grand Duchy of Cracow was the {{regional}} assembly of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a <b>crown</b> <b>land</b> of the Austrian Empire, and later Austria-Hungary. In {{the history of the}} Polish parliaments, it is considered the successor of the former sejm walny, or general sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and also of the sejmik, or local councils, in the territories of the Austrian Partition. It existed from 1861 until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918.|$|E
5|$|The county number, {{extent and}} {{authority}} have varied significantly, reflecting: {{changes in the}} monarchial and noble relative influences; Ottoman conquest and Croatian recapture of various territories; and societal and political changes through several centuries. In the 13th and 14th century, the Croatian nobility grew stronger and the counties defined by the king were reduced to a legislative framework, while military and financial power was concentrated in the feudal lords. Other forms of administration that overlapped with county administration in this period included the Roman Catholic Church and the free royal cities, and separately the cities of Dalmatia. After Croatia became a <b>crown</b> <b>land</b> of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1527, the importance of counties faded even further, but was gradually restored after 1760.|$|E
5|$|The government's income {{came from}} five {{principal}} sources: regular taxes, occasional taxes, fines, income taxes, miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories. An emergency tax was imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, {{such as when}} it faced natural calamities, or was preparing for war or overcoming war's ravages. Income tax included taxes on <b>crown</b> <b>land,</b> wasteland, specific types of trees considered valuable to the economy, mines, salt, treasures unearthed by prospectors. Additionally, customary presents {{were given to the}} king or royal officers on such festive occasions as marriage or the birth of a son.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Crown</b> <b>Lands</b> Acts 1829 to 1936 is the {{collective}} title of Part II of the <b>Crown</b> <b>Lands</b> Act 1936 (26 Geo 5 & 1 Edw 8 c 47) and the <b>Crown</b> <b>Lands</b> Acts 1829 to 1936.|$|R
50|$|The {{colonies of}} the Western Galicia {{were located in}} three {{concentrated}} areas, around Nowy Sącz (Stary Sącz <b>crown</b> <b>lands),</b> around Bochnia (Niepołomice <b>crown</b> <b>lands),</b> and the third in the fork of the rivers Vistula and San (<b>crown</b> <b>lands</b> of Sandomierz and Leżajsk).|$|R
5|$|The Sejm, until 1573 {{summoned by}} the king at his {{discretion}} (for example when he needed funds to wage a war), composed of the two chambers presided over by the monarch, became {{in the course of}} the 16th century the main organ of the state power. The reform-minded execution movement had its chance to take on the magnates and the church hierarchy (and take steps to restrain their abuse of power and wealth) when Sigismund Augustus switched sides and lent them his support at the sejm of 1562. During this and several more sessions of parliament, within the next decade or so, the Reformation inspired szlachta was able to push through a variety of reforms, which resulted in a fiscally more sound, better governed, more centralized and territorially unified Polish state. Some of the changes were too modest, other had never become completely implemented (e. g. recovery of the usurped <b>Crown</b> <b>land),</b> but nevertheless for the time being the middle szlachta movement was victorious.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Howe Island Board is a NSW Statutory Authority {{established}} {{under the}} Lord Howe Island Act 1953, {{to administer the}} island {{as part of the}} state of New South Wales. It reports directly to the state's Minister for Environment and Heritage, and is responsible for the care, control and management of the island. Its duties include: the protection of World Heritage values; the control of development; the administration of <b>Crown</b> <b>Land,</b> including the island's protected area; provision of community services and infrastructure; and regulating sustainable tourism. In 1981 the Lord Howe Island Amendment Act gave islanders the administrative power of three members on a five-member Board. The Board also manages the Lord Howe Island Kentia Palm Nursery which, together with tourism, provides the island's only sources of external income. Under an amendment bill in 2004 the Board now comprises seven members, four of whom are elected from the islander community, thus giving about 350 permanent residents a high level of autonomy. The remaining three members are appointed by the Minister to represent the interests of business, tourism and conservation. The full Board meets on the island every three months while the day-to-day affairs of the island are managed by the Board's administration, with a permanent staff that had increased to 22 people by 1988.|$|E

25|$|The {{area has}} been {{inhabited}} by the Wathaurong people for at least 25,000 years. The first European to settle in the area was Dr. Alexander Thomson, later mayor of Geelong, who took up a pastoral run in 1836, and subsequent purchases of <b>crown</b> <b>land</b> were managed from his homestead 'Kardinia'.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, {{the various}} church {{authorities}} relinquished {{control of the}} individual grants and the entire site was then re-vested as <b>Crown</b> <b>land</b> and declared a disused burial ground. From the mid-1930s, control and responsibility for the grounds moved between various government departments and numerous projects were undertaken to refurbish the historic site.|$|E
25|$|Warwick was {{established}} as an administrative {{centre of the}} emerging Darling Downs regions in 1847, with a post office being established in the town in 1848.

50|$|A cause célèbre in the 1950s {{caused the}} {{management}} of <b>Crown</b> <b>lands</b> to be scrutinised. Land at Crichel Down in Dorset requisitioned for military purposes {{was transferred to the}} Commissioners of <b>Crown</b> <b>Lands</b> when it was no longer required by the army. The previous owners wanted their land back, but the Minister of Agriculture, Thomas Dugdale, was adamant that it should not be returned. A series of reports led to the reconstitution of {{the management of}} <b>Crown</b> <b>lands</b> under the <b>Crown</b> Estate Acts of 1956 and 1961, removing the involvement of politicians in their management.|$|R
25|$|The park is {{situated}} on a {{parcel of land}} sandwiched between Enoggera and Latrobe Terraces on Cooks Hill. It was, and remains <b>crown</b> <b>land</b> designated for road purposes, but by 1922 the cutting along Latrobe Terrace negated future road use. The road survives only in the asphalted walkway beside the park, linking Enoggera and Latrobe Terraces.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Crown Land's Alienation Act of 1868, which {{required}} that public notice be given of <b>Crown</b> <b>Land</b> which was to be permanently reserved from public, four Reserves were set aside in Warwick in 1869.

50|$|Vladislas II of the Jagiellon dynasty, {{son of the}} Polish king Casimir IV, was {{designated}} King of Bohemia in 1471, while the <b>crown</b> <b>lands</b> of Moravia, Silesia, and the Lusatias were occupied by rivaling King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. In 1479 both kings signed the Treaty of Olomouc, whereby {{the unity of the}} Bohemian <b>crown</b> <b>lands</b> was officially retained unchanged and the monarchs appointed each other as sole heir. Upon the death of King Matthias in 1490, Vladislas ruled the Bohemian <b>crown</b> <b>lands</b> and the Kingdom of Hungary in personal union.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} the <b>Crown</b> <b>lands</b> in England and Wales begins with the Norman conquest. When William I died, the land he had {{acquired}} by right of conquest was still largely intact. His successors, however, granted large estates to the nobles and barons who supplied them with men and arms. [...] The monarch's remaining land was divided into royal manors, each managed separately by a seneschal. The period between the reigns of William I and Queen Anne was one of continuous alienation of <b>lands.</b> The <b>Crown</b> <b>lands</b> were augmented as well as depleted over the centuries: Edward I extended his possessions into Wales, and James VI & I had his own <b>Crown</b> <b>lands</b> in Scotland which were ultimately combined with the <b>Crown</b> <b>lands</b> of England and Wales. However, the disposals outweighed the acquisitions: {{at the time of}} the Restoration in 1660, the total revenue arising from <b>Crown</b> <b>lands</b> was estimated to be £263,598 (equal to £ today). By the end of the reign of William III (1689-1702), however, it was reduced to some £6,000 (equal to £ today).|$|R

25|$|From about 1815 the colony, {{under the}} {{governorship}} of Lachlan Macquarie, {{began to grow}} rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming.

25|$|The sharing {{agreement}} between the cricket and footy clubs was not all rosy, and by the late 1890s the two entities ended up in court over a dispute {{about the use of}} the cricket pavilion by a visiting football team.
