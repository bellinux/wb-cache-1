40|$|CD-ROM Included; A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering for the degree of Master of Science in Sustainable Process Development. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum Zeylanicum) is an endemic plant popularly known as “Kurundu” in Sri Lanka. Cinnamon yields mainly cinnamon leaf oil and cinnamon bark oil. Cinnamon bark oil produces by processing dried cinnamon chips. Composition of cinnamon bark oil varies due to many factors including the type and quality of cinnamon chips. Good quality cinnamon chips can be produced by uniform drying. Present study examines the effect of air drying temperature during pre processing of cinnamon chips on the volatile organic compounds of cinnamon bark oil extracted by the method of hydro-distillation of cinnamon chips. Laboratory scale tunnel dryer fitted with an electrical heater was used to dry cinnamon chips at five different air drying temperatures; ambient temperature, 35 °C, 40 °C, 45 °C and 50 °C. The extracted cinnamon bark oil was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 16 compounds were identified, cinnamaldehyde-E, <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> linalool and eugenol, in that order, being the main volatile organic compounds. Results indicated that air drying temperature of cinnamon chips significantly altered the composition of cinnamon bark oil.

40|$|Phenylpropenes, a {{large group}} of plant {{volatile}} compounds that serve in multiple roles in defense and pollinator attraction, contain a propenyl side chain. Eugenol synthase (EGS) catalyzes the reductive displacement of acetate from the propenyl side chain of the substrate coniferyl acetate to produce the allyl-phenylpropene eugenol. We report here the structure determination of EGS from basil (Ocimum basilicum) by protein x-ray crystallography. EGS is structurally related to the shortchain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs), and in particular, enzymes in the isoflavone-reductase-like subfamily. The structure of a ternary complex of EGS bound to the cofactor NADP(H) and a mixed competitive inhibitor EMDF ((7 S, 8 S) -ethyl (7, 8 methylene) -dihydroferulate) provides a detailed view of the binding interactions within the EGS active site and a starting point for mutagenic examination of the unusual reductive mechanism of EGS. The key interactions between EMDF and the EGSholoenzyme include stacking of the phenyl ring of EMDF against the cofactor’s nicotinamide ring and a water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interaction between the EMDF 4 -hydroxy group and the side-chain amino moiety of a conserved lysine residue, Lys 132. The C 4 carbon of nicotinamide resides immediately adjacent to the site of hydride addition, the C 7 carbon of <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>acetate</b> substrates. The inhibitor-bound EGS structure suggests a two-step reaction mechanism involving the formation of a quinone-methide prior to reduction.

Protecting group manipulation provides an orthogonal route to enantioenriched para-quinone and ortho-quinone spirocycles. This novel technology provides access to the spirocyclic core that is prevalent in many natural products. Part III. Palladium has been identified as a suitable catalyst for the chemoselective activation of C(sp 3) -H bond over C(sp 2) -H bond of toluene and tolyl analogs. This technology has been combined with the C(sp 3) -H activation of acidic C-H bonds to form new C-C bonds. High-throughput experimentation was used for identifying conditions that reduced toluene loading and engendered catalyst turnover via a suitable oxidant. The parent reaction has been extended to include the Pd catalyzed alkylation of phenylglycine azlactones with ethylbenzene, 2 -ethylnaphthalene, propylbenzene and butylbenzene. Mechanistic studies were initiated to determine whether the process occurs via free radicals or via Pd mediated C(sp 3) -H activation. Our studies support a Pd mediated process in which the C(sp 3) -H activation of the tolyl analog is the rate determining step.

Complexes 1 - 3 and OsCl 2 (Î· 6 -p-cymene) {P(OPh) 3 } (4) are {{efficient}} catalyst precursors for the alkylation of 1 -phenylallyl methylcarbonate (5 a), 1 -phenylallyl acetate (5 b), cinnamyl methylcarbonate (6 a), and <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (6 b) with sodium dimethylmalonate to afford 1 -phenylallyl dimethylmalonate (7) and cinnamyl dimethylmalonate (8) with branchedrlinear molar ratios between 97 : 3 and 67 : 33. In {{the absence of}} sodium dimethylmalonate, the reaction of 1 with 5 a leads initially to {OsCl(Î· 6 -p-cymene) } 2 (Î¿-OMe) 2 (9) and subsequently to [{Os(Î· 6 -p-cymene) } 2 (Î¿-OMe) 3][O 2 COMe] (10). In the absence of 5 a, the reaction of 1 with sodium dimethylmalonate gives Os{k 1 -C 3 -[CH(CO 2 Me) 2]}{k 2 -O,O-[CH(CO 2 Me) 2]}(Î· 6 -p-cymene) (11). Complexes 9 - 11 are also efficient catalyst precursors for the alkylation of 5 a with sodium dimethylmalonate. The activity of 9 and 10 {{is the same as}} that of 1. However, complex 11 is significantly less efficient than 1. In contrast to the latter, complexes 2 and 3 do not react with 5 a in the absence of sodium dimethylmalonate. In the absence of the substrate, the reactions of 2 and 3 with sodium dimethylmalonate lead to OS{k 1 -C 3 -[CH(CO 2 Me) 2]}Cl(Î· 6 -p-cymene) L (L = L 1 (12), L 2 (13)), which further react with excess sodium dimethylmalonate to give 11. The catalytic behavior of 12 and 13 has been also studied. Their activities are the same as those of 2 and 3 and intermediate between those of 10 and 11. Complexes 3, 9, 11, and 12 have been characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Â© 2008 American Chemical Society.

40|$|M. Tech. There {{are over}} 250 {{cinnamon}} species existing worldwide, and amongst them, 2 species Cinnamomum cassia and Cinnamomum zeylanicum, {{are commonly used}} {{all over the world}} as spices, fragrances in perfumes and as medicines. These two species are distinguished from each other by the presence and absence of certain compounds depending on the origin and distribution of the plant. Nevertheless, all cinnamon species contain essential oils and water soluble components and the composition of these components found in each species depends on the type of species involved. These components are made up of phenyl propanoids, terpenes, flavonoids and saponins. In general, the essential oil component contains the following compounds: cinnamaldehyde as a major constituent with its derivatives cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, ethyl cinnamate, <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and 2 -methoxy cinnamaldehyde; eugenol; linalool; coumarin; carvone; carvacrol and β-caryophyllene. Most of these compounds are abundantly found in the bark except in the case of eugenol which is found in either leaves or bark depending on the species involved. The other water soluble component is composed of a group of compounds such as tannin, chalcone, catechins and anthocyanidins. These compounds polymerize to form methyl hydroxy chalcone polymers (MHCP) which has been shown {{to play an important role}} in lowering blood sugar levels in Type ll diabetic individuals. It is said that MHCP has an ability to promote the phosphorylation process which in turn activates the beta-cells and thereby creating insulin activity that will then convert glucose into glycogen. Besides all health benefits of cinnamon, the plant contains a toxic compound, coumarin which impacts badly on animals resulting in death, and little information on its toxicity to human beings has been documented. Concerns arose about the possible presence of coumarin in these formulations, since these formulations are made from the cinnamon and the plant contains coumarin. This work has investigated the potential toxicity of coumarin from cinnamon powder and cinnamon formulation. The components from both cinnamon samples were extracted using various solvents according to their polarities and these compounds were screened on thin layer chromatography (TLC). The essential oil components were separated by column chromatography, and quantified by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), all components (essential oil and water soluble) were identified by HPLC, and finally the characterization of the essential oil components was done with infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) whereas those of the water soluble were characterized by using liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (LC-MS) ...|$|E
