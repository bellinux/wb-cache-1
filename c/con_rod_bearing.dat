50|$|The Waste Heat Engine's design {{requires}} {{the use of}} water to lubricate the moving parts because exhaust steam goes into the engine crankcase.

50|$|From these {{holes in}} the main journals, the oil moves through passageways inside the {{crankshaft}} to exit {{holes in the}} rod journals to lubricate the <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> and connecting <b>rods.</b> Some simpler designs relied on these rapidly moving parts to splash and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. However, in modern designs, there are also passageways through the rods which carry oil from the <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> to the rod-piston connections and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. This oil film {{also serves as a}} seal between the piston rings and cylinder walls to separate the combustion chamber in the cylinder head from the crankcase. The oil then drips back down into the oil pan.|$|R
