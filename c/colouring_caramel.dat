40|$|This EFSA {{statement}} is a refined exposure assessment of <b>caramel</b> <b>colours</b> (E 150 a, E 150 c and E 150 d) {{taking into account}} additional information on its use in foods as consumed. The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of <b>caramel</b> <b>colours</b> (E 150 a, E 150 b, E 150 c, E 150 d) used as food additives in 2011. In that opinion, the Panel concluded that the anticipated dietary exposure of child and adult populations may exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for <b>caramel</b> <b>colours</b> E 150 a, E 150 c and E 150 d, but exposure estimates to E 150 b were below the ADI. Following this conclusion, new data from industry were submitted to EFSA providing updated use levels of <b>caramel</b> <b>colours</b> in foods ready to be consumed. A refined exposure assessment was performed for <b>caramel</b> <b>colours</b> that were exceeding the ADI in ANS Panel opinion (EFSA, 2011 a) i. e. E 150 a, E 150 c and E 150 d {{and concluded that the}} anticipated dietary exposure are considerably lower than in the previous exposure assessment. However, toddlers and adults have a higher exposure to <b>caramel</b> <b>colour</b> E 150 c and could still exceed the ADI of 100 mg/kg bw/day for this <b>caramel</b> <b>colour.</b> The estimated combined exposure to the four <b>caramel</b> <b>colours</b> (E 150 a, E 150 b, E 150 c, E 150 d) are considerably lower and the group ADI of 300 mg/kg bw/day is not exceeded for any population group in the current review...|$|R
50|$|They {{range from}} deep amber to brown in <b>colour.</b> <b>Caramel</b> and {{chocolate}} flavours are evident. Brown ales from northeastern England {{tend to be}} strong and malty, often nutty, while those from southern England are usually darker, sweeter and lower in alcohol. North American brown ales are usually drier than their English counterparts, with a slight citrus accent and an aroma, bitterness, and medium body due to American hop varieties. Fruitiness from esters are subdued. When chilled to cold temperatures, some haziness may be noticed.|$|R

40|$|Lobster analogues were {{prepared}} with lobster base flavour (paste),h lobster cook water (whole lobster omogenate:water, 1 : 1 and 1 : 0. 5) and lobster meat mince. In another experiment, {{different combinations of}} ginger-garlic paste and lobster base flavour, i. e., 1 : 3, 1 : 4, 1 : 6, 3 : 3, 3 : 4, 3 : 6, 5 : 3, 5 : 4 and 5 : 6 {{were added to the}} lobster analogue paste. It was observed that lobster analogues prepared with lobster base flavour (paste) are suitable organoleptically. The combination of ginger garlic paste and lobster base flavour in the ratio of 3 : 4 was found to be suitable organoleptically. Lobster analogues coloured with annatto seed colour at 1 : 2 (annatto seed:water) concentration had high values for the colour attribute as compared to orange-red synthetic <b>colour,</b> beetroot <b>colour,</b> <b>caramel</b> <b>colour</b> and paprika colour. It was observed that come-up-time to achieve a temperature of 850 °C was 28 minutes with a processing period of 11 minutes...|$|R

Some people buy julmust in December only to store it a year before drinking it. In 2013 a rumour occurred that the EU would ban julmust due to a directive banning the selling of malt beverages containing <b>caramel</b> <b>colouring.</b> The rumour however {{turned out to be}} false since julmust is not a fermented beverage and hence not affected by the directive.|$|R

As with all Irish whiskeys, it must be matured {{for at least three}} years in wooden casks (which may have been previously used), and must contain a minimum of 40% alcohol by volume, with the only additive permissible being <b>caramel</b> <b>colouring</b> (E150a).|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} {{forms an}} alternative for high-energy concentration techniques. A waste stream originating from the <b>caramel</b> <b>colour</b> processing industry is concentrated. Only water (vapour) and ammonia {{should be able}} to permeate through the PTFE membrane, although a considerable amount of organic carbon is observed in the permeate. These compounds were determined to be methylpyrazines coming from the Maillard reaction. The feed was concentrated by a factor of 1. 8 without a significant decrease in flux, meaning that even higher factors are reachable. status: publishe...|$|R

[...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{stated that the}} track [...] "couldn’t be any less auspicious as an opening song, {{little more than a}} delicate, yearning falsetto vocal over vaporous keyboards and a muffled rhythm track."

25|$|After distillation, the unaged brandy {{is placed}} into oak barrels to mature. Usually, brandies {{with a natural}} golden or brown colour are aged in oak casks (single-barrel aging). Some brandies, {{particularly}} those from Spain, are aged using the solera system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have <b>caramel</b> <b>colour</b> and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel aging.|$|R
2500|$|E150A <b>caramel</b> <b>colouring</b> may {{be added}} to single malt Scotch whisky prior to bottling, to give the whisky a more rich and well-aged appearance.

50|$|The {{recipes and}} {{flavours}} differ between brands, but caraway is typically the dominant flavour.Akvavit usually has a yellowish hue, but this {{can vary from}} clear to light brown, depending on how long it has been aged in oak casks (Norway) or the amount of colorant used. Normally, a darker colour suggests a higher age {{or the use of}} young casks, though artificial <b>caramel</b> <b>colouring</b> is permitted. Clear akvavit is called taffel; it is typically aged in old casks that do not colour the finished spirit or not aged at all.|$|R

25|$|Italian Stravecchio {{has been}} {{produced}} since the 1700s in the North of Italy, especially in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, using grapes popular in winemaking such as Sangiovese and Grignolino.

Northern Italy is also noted since the Middle Ages for another type of wine spirit, Grappa, which is generally colourless but has some top-shelf varieties called barrique which are aged in oak casks and achieve the same <b>caramel</b> <b>colour</b> as regular brandies. There is a vast production of Stravecchios and Grappas in Italy, with more than 600 large, medium or small distilleries in operation.
