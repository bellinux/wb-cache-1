There have been numerous exemption requests motivated {{by a desire to}} reduce transaction costs. Mutual funds are permitted to <b>cross</b> <b>trade</b> under Rule 17 a- 7. Opportunities for <b>cross</b> <b>trades</b> arise when some funds within a group have cash inflows and others have cash outflows and due to differences of opinion among managers for a given mutual fund group about the desirability of holding particular assets. <b>Cross</b> <b>trades</b> represent an economically significant source of savings for mutual funds. With a view toward identifying insights relevant to cross-trading, this study reviews the academic literature dealing with the way financial markets are organized and how this organization affects transaction costs, dealer quotes and prices, and other market characteristics. Transaction costs include direct costs such as commissions and indirect costs such as the bid-ask spread, which covers order processing costs (the normal expenses of providing liquidity) and asymmetric information costs (dealer losses to informed traders). Additional indirect costs are market impact costs, delay costs, and th...|$|R

The connection of networks could alternatively be used for <b>cross</b> boarder <b>trade</b> between neighboured water utilities. We show that competition by common carriage leads to production incentives for the inefficient supplier. This implies that the retail prices tend to be lower than with <b>cross</b> border <b>trade.</b> However, the efficiency effect dominates and resulting welfare is higher in case of trade.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{informal}} <b>cross</b> border <b>trading</b> on poverty reduction in Zimbabwe. In {{the context of this}} study, the term Informal <b>Cross</b> Border <b>Trade</b> (ICBT), is used to describe the activities of small entrepreneurs who are involved in buying and selling across national borders. The study focuses on whether the stated activities are lifting those participating out of poverty. The research problem is examined through an assessment of the income levels, assets acquirement, expenditures patterns, food security and family relations. The hypotheses tested in the research are that, “The extent of ICBT is significant in Zimbabwe; ICBT in the Southern Africa region is mainly dominated by women; and that ICBT contributes positively to poverty reduction”. In this context, poverty reduction is said to have occurred when informal <b>cross</b> border <b>trading</b> would have resulted in an improvement in the socio-economic wellbeing of traders‟ households. The Poverty Datum Line (PDL) is used as the measure of households‟ well-being. To assess {{the impact of}} ICBT on well-being, a survey was conducted whereby in-depth interviews using the questionnaire method were used to collect primary data. Secondary information was obtained from documentary searches at institutions and also using internet searches. From this study it has been found that ICBT has both positive and negative impacts with regard to social welfare. With regard to economic welfare, based on poverty indicator measures used in the study, ICBT contributes positively to Poverty Reduction. Thus the analysis revealed that informal <b>cross</b> border <b>trade</b> {{plays an important role in}} alleviating economic hardships, reducing poverty and enhancing welfare and human development in Zimbabwe...|$|R
