5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} {{common to all}} versions. This had bench seats, one for the driver and his assistant, and another for the crew. The rear portion of the upper body was adapted for the vehicle's intended role. The artillery model had two extra bench seats for the gun's crew and space for its ammunition. The cargo version had just two storage compartments mounted {{in the front of}} the cargo compartment, one on each side, that opened to the outside. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible <b>canvas</b> <b>top</b> was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E

50|$|Improvements in <b>canvas</b> <b>tops</b> have {{rendered}} the detachable hardtop less common in recent years, {{in part because}} the top cannot be stored in the vehicle when not in use, requiring a garage or other storage facility. Some open cars continue to offer it as an option. For example, some Mazda MX-5s are believed to have been delivered with an accessory hardtop, which is compulsory for some auto racing series.|$|R
5000|$|The Trekka was {{launched}} on 2 December 1966 as an agricultural vehicle although it eventually became popular with both rural buyers and urban tradesmen. The first Trekkas {{were sold in}} New Zealand in 1967, by which time Motor Lines had become Motor Holdings. The first model sold was the [...] "2-10", which cost less than a Morris 1100 at just £899. The 2-10s were all painted green with <b>canvas</b> <b>tops</b> and were offered with a tow bar as the only option.|$|R
5|$|The current New Zealand {{jersey is}} entirely black (currently {{referred}} to as the 'blackest' jersey ever created) except the Adidas logo, the NZRU silver fern on the front and the AIG logo in the lower center (all of which are darkened from previously). The 1884 New Zealand tour to Australia was the first overseas New Zealand rugby tour, and featured clothing very different from today's jersey. Back then, the team donned a dark blue jersey, with gold fern on the left of the jumper. In 1893 the NZRU stipulated at its annual general meeting that the uniform would be black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. However historic photographs suggest white shorts may have been used instead during these early years. Sometime between 1897 and 1901 there was a change; by 1901 the team met NSW in a black jersey, a <b>canvas</b> <b>top</b> with no collar, and a silver fern.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of police cars were made by adding a special body with a <b>canvas</b> <b>top,</b> 4 canvas doors and a fold down front window for the Japanese Police Reserve Force {{but they were not}} popular.|$|E
25|$|A 9,378-car run of two-door XJ coupés with a pillarless hardtop body {{called the}} XJ-C was built between 1975 and 1978. The car was {{actually}} launched at the London Motor Show in October 1973, but it subsequently {{became clear that}} it was not ready for production, and the economic troubles unfolding in the western world at this time seem to have reduced further any sense of urgency about producing and selling the cars: it was reported that problems with window sealing delayed production. XJ coupés finally started to emerge from Jaguar show-rooms only some two years later. The coupé was based on the short-wheelbase version of the XJ. The coupé's elongated doors were made out of a lengthened standard XJ front door (the weld seams are clearly visible under the interior panels where two front door shells were grafted together with a single outer skin). A few XJ-Cs were modified by Lynx Cars and Avon into convertibles with a retractable <b>canvas</b> <b>top,</b> but this was not a factory product. Lynx conversions (16 in total) did benefit of powered tops. Both six and twelve-cylinder models were offered, 6,505 of the former and 1,873 of the latter. Even with the delay, these cars suffered from water leaks and wind noise. The delayed introduction, the labour-intensive work required by the modified saloon body, the higher price than the four-door car, and the early demise promulgated by the new XJ-S, all ensured a small production run.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1966, after {{numerous}} {{widely reported}} incidents of foot injuries to U.S. forces caused by punji stake traps, issue Jungle boots were {{fitted with a}} stainless steel plate inside the boot's sole to protect the wearer from punji stake traps. [...] Later Jungle boots were given nylon <b>canvas</b> <b>tops</b> in place of cotton duck. The boot was also fitted with other improvements, including the Panama mud-clearing outsole and nylon webbing reinforcement on the uppers. [...] However, Vibram-soled jungle boots continued to be issued to troops into 1969.|$|R
5000|$|Initially Essex marketed {{a line of}} touring cars (open four-door {{cars with}} <b>canvas</b> <b>tops),</b> which {{was the most popular}} body style of cars in {{production}} at the time. While Essex added an enclosed sedan in 1920, it was the introduction of the 1922 closed coach, priced at $1,495 (which in early 2015 would be between $15,917 and $21,015, depending on the inflation calculator used), $300 above that of the touring car. By 1925 the coach was priced below that of the touring car. While Henry Ford is credited with inventing the affordable car, it was Essex that made the enclosed car affordable.|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{spectacle}} that inspired Pan as never before. The wagons {{were lined up}} near the lake, their big white <b>canvas</b> <b>tops</b> shining in the afternoon sun, and higher on a bench stood the [...] "hoodelum" [...] or bed wagon, so stocked with bedrolls that it resembled a haystack. Beyond {{the margin of the}} lake, four hundred fine saddle horses grazed and kicked and bit at one another. Beyond the saddle horses grazed the day herd of cattle. And over on the other side dinned the melee over the main herd, the incessant riding, yelling of the cowboys and the bawling of the cows.|$|R
2500|$|It {{featured}} two fuel tanks, one of [...] {{under the}} floor, one of [...] beneath the passenger's seat. All civilian models {{also had to}} meet Army requirements, in case of wartime requisitioning. (This is also why a hardtop version was not available until 1993) The basic variant GAZ-69 has a pair of doors and usually has standard <b>canvas</b> <b>top</b> and upper sides; there are two seats in front and two folding benches for three passengers each on sides. The further variant GAZ-69A (UAZ-69A) has four doors, folding <b>canvas</b> <b>top</b> and two rows of seats.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time, {{development}} of the cabriolet version of the 997 led the design and engineering effort at Porsche with the coupé following. Porsche applied the logic that if you started with the more difficult cabriolet challenges (for chassis stiffness) the coupé version would simply be more rigid. Despite additional weight, the cabriolet versions attain nearly the same performance figures as their coupé counterparts. Even the rear tail comes up slightly higher on the cabriolets to compensate for differences in drag over the <b>canvas</b> <b>top</b> vs. the smoother coupé shape. [...] Optional for the 997 Cabriolet models is a hardtop that encapsulated the vehicle {{in place of the}} <b>canvas</b> <b>top.</b> [...] It is interchangeable with that available on the late 996 cabriolet models. [...] The hardtop provides a winter option to cabriolet owners.|$|E
2500|$|Wanting a fuel tanker {{larger than}} the CCKW, the Army ordered 25 from White. The body had 4 {{self-sealing}} tank compartments {{for a total of}} [...] A bow and <b>canvas</b> <b>top</b> was fitted, so the truck could be disguised as a common cargo truck. Early trucks had a hard cab and a front-mounted pintle hitch, later trucks had an open cab and a [...] front winch. A [...] gallon trailer could be towed. No follow up orders were made.|$|E
50|$|The popular 300 series {{combinations}} of cars with trailers and boats {{as well as}} semi-articulated trucks dated from the mid-1970s (Ragan 2000, p. 37, 81). One clever example was the handsome Volkswagen beetle towing kayaks on a trailer, the Renault Michelin <b>canvas</b> <b>topped</b> tractor trailer in blue and yellow from the 1980s, or the Chevy pickup truck hauling a luxurious yacht (Ragan 2000, p. 82; Rixon 2005, p. 96). Buses like the 'Londonlink' were also produced in the 300 series in the mid-1980s. These were promotionals advertising the new bus service, but though the labeling was true-to-life, the toy Majorettes decorated bore {{little resemblance to the}} real Londonlink buses (Rixon 2005, p. 103).|$|R

2500|$|Unlike {{almost all}} {{traditional}} convertibles {{of the era}} that used frame-free side windows, the Rambler retained the fixed profile including the car's doors and rear-side window frames. This metal structure served as the side guides or rails for the retractable waterproof <b>canvas</b> <b>top.</b> This design allowed Nash to utilize its unibody construction on its new compact. It made the body very rigid for an open-top car, without additional bracing. The convertible top was cable-driven and electrically operated. The design is similar to other fixed-profile convertibles including the 1936 Fiat 500 [...] "Topolino", Nissan Figaro (1991), Citroën 2CV (1948–1990) and the 1957 Fiat 500 (1957) {{as well as its}} 2007 Fiat 500 successor.|$|E
2500|$|A {{supercharged}} {{version with}} an intercooler and {{electronic fuel injection}} {{was added to the}} options list March 1988 {{as a response to the}} success of the Alto Works and Mira TR-XX. The output of the engine increased to [...] A supercharger meant less lag than for a turbo, although specific output tended to be somewhat lower than the competition. This was available for both the 3- and 5-door versions. May 1988 saw an available electrically deployed <b>canvas</b> <b>top</b> added to the 3-door. The turbo and later supercharger were installed in Japan to improve tailpipe emissions, with an added benefit of increased horsepower, as Japanese drivers are taxed on the emissions their car produces as of emission legislation passed by the Japanese Government in 1975.|$|E
2500|$|British-made Mokes were {{fitted with}} a low-end 848cc {{transverse}} inline-four engine, detuned to use low-octane fuel. They used the same suspension, gearbox and 10inch wheels as the standard Mini. In the initial offering, passenger seats, grab handles, heater, windscreen washer and a removable <b>canvas</b> <b>top</b> were all optional equipment delivered separately from the vehicle. Owners had to bolt these optional extras onto the vehicle themselves. The base price was GB£ 405. The [...] "Mk I" [...] Mokes had a single windscreen wiper and a floor-mounted headlight dip switch, and the only colour available was [...] "Spruce Green". In 1967, the [...] "Mk II" [...] Moke added a passenger-side wiper. Horn and headlight controls were moved onto the indicator stalk. These later British Mokes were also available in white.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{commercial}} {{use of the}} panels were for lining and insides of railroad cars. In 1915, the company won a contract to use the panels as automobile tops. From 1915 to 1925 they supplied board for the tops of Ford Motor Company, Buick, Nash Motors, Studebaker, and Dodge. They also manufactured a larger panel, sold as [...] "vehisote" [...] for truck panels. The panels {{were used for the}} exterior of field hospitals and military housing in France during World War I. By 1925 car manufacturers switched to <b>canvas</b> <b>tops</b> and Agasote lost sales, so the company heavily promoted Homasote for its versatility and insulation properties. The company then changed its name to Homasote after its now largest product. The company makes a version called [...] "440 SoundBarrier".|$|R

5000|$|... 500 Commemorative Edition 900T {{convertibles}} {{were delivered}} to the U.S. market in 1994. They were the last 500 classic 900 convertibles to be built. They had the same performance modifications as the 1993 Commemorative Edition vehicles {{with the exception of}} the lower SPG suspension. They all had the 5-speed manual transmission, and came with the same uniquely styled wheels, walnut dash facia, and leather gear knob and gaiter. The tan leather interior was further enhanced with black piping, which was exclusive to this model. The cars were all painted Nova Black Metallic (another feature exclusive to the 1994 Commemorative Edition) and had tan <b>canvas</b> <b>tops.</b> 500 identically equipped cars were shipped to Canada but have metric instruments. The 1994 CE vehicles did not have a plaque designating or celebrating the series. The VIN numbers do however run sequentially, the only Saab special edition series to do so.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the British Army had {{acquired}} around 9,000 Series III models, which were mainly a special 'Heavy Duty' {{version of the}} [...] Soft Top. These models had improved suspension components and a different chassis cross-member design. These were produced in 12-volt 'GS' models and 24-volt 'FFR' versions. A small number were [...] GS and FFR models, but in general the Army used the Air-Portable 1/2 ton, [...] "Lightweight" [...] version. The Lightweight was in service by many armies all over the world. In Europe even the Dutch Landmacht and the Danish Army used the Land-Rover Lightweight. Instead of the petrol engine the Dutch and Danish Lightweights had diesel engines. Instead of the <b>canvas</b> <b>top</b> the Dutch ones had PVC tops like the modern Land Rover 'Wolf'.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the parish}} needed funds {{to build a}} new church in the 1920s, the movie industry, which often used the church as a {{shooting}} location, again offered its help. The movie studios including Universal and [...] Keystone helped the parish raise funds for the new church, providing actors and equipment for the church's fundraising events. [...] In October 1926, the Los Angeles Times reported that Blessed Sacrament was holding the [...] "biggest bazaar ever held in cinema town, with the co-operation of practically the entire motion-picture industry" [...] to raise funds for the new church. [...] The Times noted that the bazaar was housed under a <b>canvas</b> <b>top,</b> [...] "with gaily decorated booths, gorgeous articles donated by the motion-picture stars, and by wealth persons engaged in other industries." ...|$|E

50|$|As {{an interim}} solution, {{it was decided}} to use {{captured}} French vehicles, such as the Lorraine (Marder I), obsolete tanks in surplus, such as the German Panzer II (Marder II), and Czech-supplied Panzer 38(t) (Marder III) as the base for the production of makeshift tank destroyers. The result was the Marder series, which were armed with either captured Soviet 76.2mm F-22 Model 1936 divisional field guns, or German 7.5 cm PaK 40 anti-tank guns mounted in later versions. Due to weight, space and time constraints, the Marder series had relatively thin armor when compared to other armored velicles of the era. This thin upper armor formed a gunshield, only protecting the crew from shrapnel and small arms fire on the front and sides. All Marder series had open tops although some were issued with <b>canvas</b> <b>tops</b> to protect the crew from the elements. In this regard, the Marder was more of a gun carriage than a proper Panzerjäger that could exchange fire with enemy tanks.|$|R
50|$|Taiwan hosts {{numerous}} night {{markets in}} each of its major cities. The larger and more formal of these markets might take place in purpose-built marketplaces while smaller or more informal ones tend to occupy streets or roads that are normal thoroughfares by day. The temporal night markets (ones that are not housed in any permanent structure) are actually consistent in their location; in most large cities, {{they are on a}} smaller street parallel and close (a block or two away) to the primary street of that city. Though the temporal night market stalls appear at night and then vanish by day, the vendors usually return to the same location the next evening. Night markets do not close, but the individual stalls may randomly take days off due to holidays, family illness, etc. Most temporal stalls within a night market have white <b>canvas</b> <b>tops</b> and bright lights. This gives the temporary night markets a fantastical, carnival-like atmosphere.|$|R

6000|$|When {{he had his}} cry out he felt {{a little}} better, and {{he got up and}} went to the pond in the hollow, and washed his hands and face, and wiped them on the {{handkerchief}} his mother had ironed for him to use at the minister's; it was still in the folds she had given it. As he shook it out, rising up, he saw that people were asleep on all the benches round the pond; he looked hopelessly at them to see if any of them were those fellows, but he could not find them. He seemed to be the only person awake on the Common, and wandered out of it and down through the empty streets, filled at times with the moony light of the waning electrics, and at times merely with the grey dawn. A man came along putting out the gas, and some milk-carts rattled over the pavement. By and by a market-wagon, with the leaves and roots of cabbages sticking out from the edges of the canvas that covered it, came by, and Lemuel followed it; he did not know what else to do, and it went so slow that he could keep up, though the famine that gnawed within him was so sharp sometimes that he felt as if he must fall down. He was going to drop into a doorway and rest, but when he came to it he found on an upper step a man folded forward like a limp bundle, snoring in a fetid, sodden sleep, and, shocked into new strength, he hurried on. At last the wagon came to a place that he saw was a market. There were no buyers yet, but men were flitting round under the long arcades of the market-houses, with lanterns under their arms, among boxes and barrels of melons, apples, potatoes, onions, beans, carrots, and other vegetables, which the country carts as they arrived continually unloaded. The smell of peaches and cantaloupes filled the air, and made Lemuel giddy as he stood and looked at the abundance. The men were not saying much; now and then one of them priced something, the owner pretended to figure on it, and then they fell into a playful scuffle, but all silently. A black cat lay luxuriously asleep on the <b>canvas</b> <b>top</b> of a barrel of melons, and the man who priced the melons asked if the owner would throw the cat in. There was a butcher's cart laden with carcasses of sheep, and one of the men asked the butcher if he called that stuff mutton. [...] "No; imitation," [...] said the butcher. They all seemed to be very good-natured. Lemuel thought he would ask for an apple; but he could not.|$|E

2500|$|The fierce engagements at {{the turn}} of the month were the last major battles of the {{campaign}} in northern Russia. [...] The Allies temporarily checked Soviet forces, defending their road positions, but did not succeed in budging them from their defenses at Bolshie Ozerki. [...] Both sides suffered heavily from exposure despite sunny days and nighttime temperatures that did not fall below -20°C (-4°F). [...] Sunshine melted snow which soaked through the <b>canvas</b> <b>tops</b> of Allied Shackleton boots, causing more cases of frostbite than even the coldest days of winter and conditions below -40°C (-40°F). [...] A Soviet source acknowledged 500 frostbite casualties in the Kamyshin brigade alone, which was recklessly committed from the milder climate of the southern Volga region before receiving proper winter clothing, such as felt boots and sheepskin coats. [...] The deployment of thousands of Soviet troops in the open for days on end condemned many to frostbite or death by freezing. [...] In light of these facts, the Allied estimates of 2,000 Bolshevik casualties from all causes may have conservatively erred.|$|R
