40|$|Business {{incubators}} {{have become}} {{more important for the}} economic development in countries. Business incubators promote the rise of entrepreneurial innovations and support the growth of starting companies (Grimaldi, R., & Grandi, A., 2005). For starting companies, acquiring entrepreneurial knowledge is often critical for the development of their business. Therefore the management of a business incubator also works as the knowledge coordinator to facilitate knowledge-sharing (Hongli, L., & Chigao, Z., 2010). However in scientific research there is little known about how to support knowledge-sharing between companies within a business incubator. This research investigates how knowledge-sharing within business incubators can be supported by conducting two exploratory case studies involving twelve interviews with <b>incubator</b> <b>companies</b> and people from the incubator management. The cases were selected based on their models as university business <b>incubators</b> where <b>incubator</b> <b>companies</b> are extensively supported by knowledge transfers through different partners. The outcome of these case studies described how <b>incubator</b> <b>companies</b> share knowledge, the main problems with knowledge-sharing within a business incubator, and solutions to support knowledge-sharing within a business incubator.

40|$|This paper reviews {{literature}} on incubator models in Europe and the Middle East. We focus on four dimensions: 1) incubators graduate firms, 2) incubators goals, 3) incubators services, and 4) incubators client firms. The methodologies adopted {{in this study}} are literature reviews and case studies. The paper concludes four results. First, the total number of graduate firms that have emerged from incubator models in Europe (832) and the Middle East (43). This difference reflects a high rate of start-up <b>companies</b> inside the <b>incubators</b> that graduate a high number of <b>companies.</b> Second, <b>incubators</b> goals focus on fostering entrepreneurship, jobs creation and technology commercialization. Third, incubators services, tangible and intangible, are stronger in Europe than in Middle East models (medium). Finally, in Europe, the total number of incubators client firms is 391, whereas in the Middle East it is 68. We attributed this to the differences in years in which they were founded...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge {{transfer}} {{takes place}} whenever the discoveries or expertise of academics are disseminated more widely. Knowledge transfer from universities {{to the wider}} public is an extremely important factor, however ideas and knowledge do not benefit the society, before they are shared. Knowledge transfer {{can be done in}} many ways and in this paper a very practical approach is introduced by one efficient way of establishing a university business incubator. The university incubator will ensure diffusion of the knowledge transfer to the society. The incubator helps to induce entrepreneurship and commercialization in the community {{to such an extent that}} results are so convincing that more and more universities are becoming engines of economic development for their surroundings. Small business incubation provides assistance to companies which results in higher success rates for survival than nonincubated <b>companies.</b> <b>Incubators</b> can play a significant role as a catalyst for economic development by ongoing knowledge transfer.
