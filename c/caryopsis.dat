2500|$|Unlike animals, {{plants are}} limited {{in their ability to}} seek out {{favorable}} conditions for life and growth. As a result, plants have evolved many ways to disperse their offspring by dispersing their seeds (see also vegetative reproduction). A seed must somehow [...] "arrive" [...] at a location and be there at a time favorable for germination and growth. When the fruits open and release their seeds in a regular way, it is called dehiscent, which is often distinctive for related groups of plants; these fruits include capsules, follicles, legumes, silicles and siliques. [...] When fruits do not open and release their seeds in a regular fashion, they are called indehiscent, which include the fruits achenes, <b>caryopsis,</b> nuts, samaras, and utricles.|$|E
