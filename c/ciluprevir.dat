50|$|<b>Ciluprevir</b> {{was a drug}} used {{experimentally}} in {{the treatment}} of hepatitis C. It is manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim and developed under the research code of BILN 2061. It was the first-in-class NS3/4A protease inhibitor to enter clinical development and tested in human. <b>Ciluprevir</b> is a potent competitive reversible inhibitor of NS3/4A protease from HCV genotype 1a (Ki = 0.3 nM) and 1b (Ki = 0.66 nM). It shows good selectivity for NS3 protease against representative serine and cysteine proteases, human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin B (IC50 > 30 μM).|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was the impact of non-thermal electromagnetic radiation of superhigh frequencies with waves of millimeter range on threonine amino acid synthesis by bacteria Brevibacterium flavum for ordinary (not mutant) and mutant strains. The frequencies of millimeter range waves were selected according to previous works as 41. 76; 42. 2 and 61. 0 GHz. The exposition was 10 min. The control samples of bacterial suspension in the flasks were kept under the same conditions as the test ones. Irradiated suspensions were used as inoculum for fermentation on molasses wort at t = + 30 ºC with aeration. After cultivation for 3 days the samples irradiated with frequency 42. 2 and 61. 0 GHz gave an increase in colonies forming units, respectively, 1. 4 and 1. 9 times compared to the control for the non-mutant strain. The quantity of synthesized threonine was determined by thin-layer chromatography on the plates of <b>ciluprevir.</b> A significant increase of the threonine content in the culture fluid was observed for the non-mutant strain (70...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) inhibit {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection by targeting viral {{proteins that}} play essential {{roles in the}} replication process. However, selection of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) during DAA therapy has been a cause of therapeutic failure. In this study, we wished to address whether such RAVs could be controlled by the co-administration of host-targeting entry inhibitors that prevent intrahepatic viral spread. Design: We investigated {{the effect of adding}} an entry inhibitor (the anti-scavenger receptor class B type I mAb 1671) to a DAA monotherapy (the protease inhibitor <b>ciluprevir)</b> in human-liver mice chronically infected with HCV of genotype 1 b. Clinically relevant non-laboratory strains were used to achieve viraemia consisting of a cloud of related viral variants (quasispecies) and the emergence of RAVs was monitored at high resolution using next-generation sequencing. Results: HCV-infected human-liver mice receiving DAA monotherapy rapidly experienced on-therapy viral breakthrough. Deep sequencing of the HCV protease domain confirmed the manifestation of drug-resistant mutants upon viral rebound. In contrast, none of the mice treated with a combination of the DAA and the entry inhibitor experienced on-therapy viral breakthrough, despite detection of RAV emergence in some animals. Conclusions: This study provides preclinical in vivo evidence that addition of an entry inhibitor to an anti-HCV DAA regimen restricts the breakthrough of DAA-resistant viruses. Our approach is an excellent strategy to prevent therapeutic failure caused by on-therapy rebound of DAA-RAVs. Inclusion of an entry inhibitor to the newest DAA combination therapies may further increase response rates, especially in difficult-to-treat patient populations...|$|E
