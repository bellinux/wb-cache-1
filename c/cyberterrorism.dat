25|$|<b>Cyberterrorism</b> {{was dealt}} with in various ways. Penalties apply to those who either damage or gain {{unauthorized}} access to a protected computer and then commit a number of offenses. These offenses include causing a person to lose an aggregate amount greater than US$5,000, as well as adversely affecting someone's medical examination, diagnosis or treatment. It also encompasses actions that cause a person to be injured, a threat to public health or safety, or damage to a governmental computer that {{is used as a}} tool to administer justice, national defense or national security. Also prohibited was extortion undertaken via a protected computer. The penalty for attempting to damage protected computers through the use of viruses or other software mechanism was set to imprisonment for up to 10 years, while the penalty for unauthorized access and subsequent damage to a protected computer was increased to more than five years imprisonment. However, should the offense occur a second time, the penalty increases up to 20 years imprisonment.|$|E

After two years without the Internet and online games, a MMORPG called The World is released. It becomes the most popular online game of all time with over 20 million unique players.

50|$|Across these definitions, {{they all}} share {{the view that}} <b>cyberterrorism</b> is {{politically}} and/or ideologically inclined.  One area of debate {{is the difference between}} <b>cyberterrorism</b> and hacktivism. Hacktivism is,” the marriage of hacking with political activism”. Both items are politically driven, and involve using computers, however <b>cyberterrorism</b> is primarily used to cause harm. It becomes an issue because acts of violence on the computer can be labeled either <b>cyberterrorism</b> or hacktivism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyberterrorism</b> is a {{controversial}} term. Some authors choose {{a very narrow}} definition, relating to deployments, by known terrorist organizations, of disruption attacks against information systems for {{the primary purpose of}} creating alarm and panic. Some other authors choose a much too broad definition which tends to falsely include cybercrime when in reality, <b>cyberterrorism</b> and cybercrime are two very different issues and must be defined separately. Terrorism online should be considered <b>cyberterrorism</b> when there has been fear inflicted on a group of people, whereas cybercrime is the act of committing a felony or crime online typically without the use of fear. By these narrow and broad definitions, it is difficult to identify which instances of online terrorism are <b>cyberterrorism</b> or cybercrime.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cyber{{terrorism}}</b> {{in general}} {{can be defined}} as an act of terrorism committed through the use of cyberspace or computer resources (Parker 1983). As such, a simple propaganda piece in the Internet that there will be bomb attacks during the holidays can be considered <b>cyberterrorism.</b> There are also hacking activities directed towards individuals, families, organized by groups within networks, tending to cause fear among people, demonstrate power, collecting information relevant for ruining peoples' lives, robberies, blackmailing etc.|$|E
50|$|The term {{can also}} be used in a variety of {{different}} ways, but is also limited on when it can be used. An attack on an Internet business can be labeled <b>cyberterrorism,</b> however when it is done for economic motivations rather than ideological it is typically regarded as cybercrime. <b>Cyberterrorism</b> is also limited to actions by individuals, independent groups, or organizations. Any form of cyber warfare conducted by governments and states would be regulated and punishable under international law.|$|E
