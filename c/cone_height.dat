These mechanically strong microelectrodes are suitable probes for detecting neurotransmitters in vivo. The simulated {{results show that}} the currents obtained at conical-tip microelectrodes are larger than those at finite conical microelectrodes (e. g. etched carbon fibres protruding from an insulating plane) of comparable dimensions. The currents at conical-tip microelectrodes and finite conical microelectrodes both converge to that of a microdisk electrode at small <b>cone</b> <b>heights</b> and large <b>cone</b> angles, and to that of a cylindrical electrode portion of equal length and half the radius at large <b>cone</b> <b>heights</b> and small <b>cone</b> angles. At short times (scaled by the electrode dimensions), Cottrellian current is achieved at conical-tip microelectrodes and the current densities collapse to the expected chronoamperometric response at a microdisk electrode, subject to some simulation errors. Comparison between a simulated chronoamperogram and an experimental chronoamperogram then allows an estimate of parameters (such as electrode surface area and dimensions) that define the electrode geometry.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if carbon dioxide laser conization of the cervix {{is a risk}} factor for preterm delivery in subsequent gestations and to evaluate whether there is any relationship between <b>cone</b> <b>height</b> and duration of pregnancy. Methods: Patients of fertile age who had carbon dioxide laser conization were followed for reproductive events. Cases were matched one-to- one with controls for known risk factors for preterm delivery. Pregnancy duration, rate of preterm birth, and mode of delivery were studied. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used for statistical analysis. Logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard modeling were used to investigate the relationship between <b>cone</b> <b>height</b> and subsequent preterm delivery. Results: Sixty-four women with singleton pregnancies after carbon dioxide laser conization and 64 controls were included in the study. Overall, no difference was found in the rate of preterm delivery and duration of pregnancy.

40|$|The {{torsional}} {{properties of}} single-walled boron nitride (BN) nanocones at different cone heights, disclination angles and simulation temperatures {{have been investigated}} using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.

For different simulation temperatures, the torsional behavior of BN nanocones at higher simulation temperature is more serious and earlier to reach a failure point, the maximum torque and average potential energy of the system decrease with the increasing simulation temperature. For different loading rates, the failure torsion angle decreases with the increasing loading rate, so the fracture of BN nanocone occurred earlier with higher loading rate.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to investigate stoichiometric biogas-hydrogen mixed fuel flames and the combustion characteristic and heating performance of three biogases enriched with hydrogen were examined. Both similar flame behavior and new finding are reported {{with reference to the}} literature. The dependence of flame stability on the fraction of hydrogen and the CO 2 concentration was analyzed in the aspects of fuel property alteration and flow aerodynamics variation. The experiments showed a favorable effect of hydrogen and detrimental effect of CO 2 on flame stability. Examination of flame <b>cone</b> <b>height</b> showed that under constant Re and Pdbl, the <b>cone</b> <b>height</b> is longer at either higher hydrogen fraction or higher COsubesub concentration. In addition, at higher fraction of hydrogen in the mixed fuel, flame flammability strengthens, flame temperature enhances and CO emission reduces. Further, polyhedral reaction cone was detected for stoichiometric flames under high hydrogen concentration conditions. Great care was paid to the heat transfer behavior of stoichiometric biogas-hydrogen flames. First, when the cone tip touches the copper plate, the stagnation point heat flux is not the maximum peak when compared to heat flux peaks at other nozzle-to-plate distance. Comparison between two flames of identical <b>cone</b> <b>height</b> indicated that higher flame temperature is a dominant factor influencing heat transfer.

40|$|Abstract- Carbon, boron nitride, {{and other}} {{materials}} that form nanotubes are also able to form conical shapes. Even though potential applications of cone arrays as electron emitters and other devices are very promising, understanding of their structure and formation mechanisms is still very limited compared to nanotubes and other carbon structures. Moreover, the cones have only been synthesized in a mixture with other shapes, but never as continuous arrays. It appears, however, that {{we can learn from}} nature how to produce large carbon cone arrays. We here report the first-known natural occurrence of large arrays of conical graphite crystals. These occur on the surfaces of millimeter-sized polycrystalline spheroidal aggregates of graphite. <b>Cone</b> <b>heights</b> range from less then a micron to 40 µm, which are larger than any other carbon cones reported in literature.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between cold-knife conization specimen height, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN II/III) size and endocervical margin involvement by CIN II/II. Study designA cross-sectional study was performed. Cold knife cone specimens with a diagnosis of CIN II/III were selected. Epidemiological data and pathology reports were obtained through a chart review. All samples from each cone specimen showing CIN II/III and the squamocolumnar junction were selected. <b>Cone</b> <b>height</b> (mean±standard deviation), intraepithelial lesion size, and size of endocervical surgical margins were measured. ResultsFour hundred and forty-seven samples were analyzed from 97 cone specimens. Section size ranged from 3. 4 to 29. 7 mm, tumor size from 0. 3 to 17. 5 mm, and tumor distance from the endocervical margin, from 0. 0 to 22. 0 mm. Age and parity were similar in the positive vs. negative margin groups (37. 6 ± 10. 0 years vs. 37. 7 ± 11. 9 years respectively, p= 0. 952, and 2. 2 ± 1. 7 births vs. 2. 6 ± 1. 9 births respectively, p= 0. 804), whereas <b>cone</b> <b>height</b> (22. 4 ± 6. 9 mm vs. 17. 1 ± 5. 6 mm, p= 0. 013) and tumor size (6. 12 ± 3. 25 mm vs. 10. 6 ± 4. 45 mm, p< 0. 001) were significantly different in negative vs. positive margin groups respectively.

30|$|A {{conical form}} of {{nano-sized}} quantum cluster was formed {{on the surface}} of p-type crystalline silicon [111] wafer by anode electrochemical etching in HF-based solution.
