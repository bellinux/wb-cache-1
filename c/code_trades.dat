40|$|Querying {{source code}} interactively for {{information}} {{is a critical}} task in reverse engineering of software. However, current source code query systems succeed in handling only small subsets of {{the wide range of}} queries possible on <b>code,</b> <b>trading</b> generality and expressive power for ease of implementation and practicality. We attribute this to the absence of clean formalisms for modeling and querying source code. In this paper, we present an algebraic framework (Source Code Algebra or SCA) for modeling and querying source code. The framework forms the basis of our query system for C source code. An analogy can be drawn with relational algebra, which forms the basis for relational databases. The benefits of using SCA include the integration of structural and flow information into a single source code data model, the ability to process high-level source code queries (command-line, graphical, relational, or pattern-based) by translating them into SCA expressions which can be evaluated using th [...] ...|$|R
40|$|As {{peer-to-peer}} {{and widely}} distributed storage systems proliferate, {{the need to}} perform efficient erasure coding, instead of replication, is crucial to performance and efficiency. Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes have arisen as alternatives to standard erasure codes, such as Reed-Solomon <b>codes,</b> <b>trading</b> off vastly improved decoding performance for inefficiencies {{in the amount of}} data that must be acquired to perform decoding. The scores of papers written on LDPC codes typically analyze their collective and asymptotic behavior.

This paper attempts to illuminate the practical considerations of LDPC codes for peer-to-peer and distributed storage systems. The three main types of LDPC codes are detailed, and a huge variety of codes are generated, then analyzed using simulation. This analysis focuses on the performance of individual codes for finite systems, and addresses several important heretofore unanswered questions about employing LDPC codes in real-world systems. ...|$|R
