40|$|The present article can {{be placed}} {{within the context of}} an {{analysis}} of the Foreign Relations of the European Union and the Member Countries of the Cartagena Accord or Andean Pact. In {{the first half of the}} article an analysis is carried out of the legal framework within which the foreign relations of both the European Union and Andean Pact countries are developed together with some observations on the whole context of the new Agreement signed on the 15 th April 1993. The evolutionary process in the realm of trade relations is a developed theme as well as the implications of the application of the Generalized System of Preferences as a principal mechanism of cooperation with the Andean region. Finally, this first half concludes presenting an exhaustive analysis of investment flows. The second part of the article consists of the study of development assistance as well as economic cooperation.
