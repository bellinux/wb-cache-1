P., Stamford, CT, USA Background and objective: Hydrocodone bitartrate {{extended}} release (Hysingla® ER, HYD) {{was previously}} studied in a 12 -week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and a 52 -week open-label safety study. Both of these preapproval studies allowed dose titration to efficacy. The {{purpose of the}} present analysis was to compare dosing and utilization patterns in these previous clinical trials with real-world data (RWD) usage in a retrospective <b>claim</b> <b>analysis</b> performed 12 – 14  months post approval in the US. Methods: In the <b>claim</b> <b>analysis</b> (Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Research Database), patients prescribed HYD between January 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016, were followed for up to 6  months of continuous HYD use. Daily average consumption (DACON), initial dose, rescue opioid use and total milligram dose over time were also evaluated. Results: HYD daily dose stabilized at ~ 60  mg dose once daily across all three studies. There was also a reduced need for rescue medication with HYD, resulting in a lower total opioid milligram dose over time. In the <b>claim</b> <b>analysis,</b> the mean monthly HYD dose increased from 49 to 55  mg in month 2 and then remained stable through month 6. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) time on drug was 79. 5  days (61. 42  days), and DACON was 1. 04  pills/day, corresponding to the approved full prescribing information (FPI) and once-daily dosing. Conclusion: In 12 – 14  months post approval, real-world dosing and utilization of HYD mirrored registration and open-label study findings, with stable once-daily dosing of ~ 60  mg and no increase in rescue medicine utilization.

5000|$|By contrast, ROV {{assumes that}} {{management}} is [...] "active" [...] and can [...] "continuously" [...] respond to market changes. Real options consider {{each and every}} scenario and indicate the best corporate action {{in any of these}} contingent events. Because management adapts to each negative outcome by decreasing its exposure and to positive scenarios by scaling up, the firm benefits from uncertainty in the underlying market, achieving a lower variability of profits than under the commitment/NPV stance. The contingent nature of future profits in real option models is captured by employing the techniques developed for financial options in the literature on contingent <b>claims</b> <b>analysis.</b> Here the approach, known as risk-neutral valuation, consists in adjusting the probability distribution for risk consideration, while discounting at the risk-free rate. This technique is also known as the certainty-equivalent or martingale approach, and uses a risk-neutral measure. For technical considerations here, see below.|$|E
50|$|Accidents {{are prone}} to happen in any human undertaking, but {{accidents}} occurring within the healthcare system seem more salient and severe due to their {{profound effect on the}} lives of those involved, sometimes resulting in the death of a patient. In the healthcare system, {{there are a number of}} methods in which specific cases where accidents happened are reviewed by others who already know the outcome of the case. These methods include morbidity and mortality conferences, autopsies, case analysis, medical malpractice <b>claims</b> <b>analysis,</b> staff interviews, and even patient observation. Hindsight bias has been shown to cause difficulties in measuring errors in these cases. Many of these errors are considered preventable after the fact, clearly indicating the presence and importance of a hindsight bias in this field. There are two sides of debate in how these case reviews should be approached to best evaluate past cases: the error elimination strategy and the safety management strategy. The error elimination strategy aims to find the cause of errors, relying heavily on hindsight (therefore more subject to the hindsight bias). The safety management strategy relies less on hindsight (less subject to hindsight bias) and identifies possible constraints during the decision making process of that case. However, it is not immune to error.|$|E

In contrast, under risk aversion, there are severe problems in determining an adequate risk-adjusted discount rate. The application of contingent <b>claims</b> <b>analysis</b> is restricted to cases with a dividend rate unaffected by risk.

In this research, it was focused to identify sources of disruptions, record maintenance and usage of disruption <b>claim</b> <b>analysis</b> methods in {{construction industry}}. Questionnaire survey was carried out to identify status of disruption claim in construction industry during last five years. A five point Likert scale where 1 represents ‘Not significant’ and 5 represents ‘Extremely significant’ was used at questionnaire survey to identify the significance level among three main aspects such as sources of disruption, records maintenance at site and usage of disruption <b>claim</b> <b>analysis</b> methods. Overtime concurrent operation, additional quantities of work, delays, dilution of supervision, joint occupancy, fast track construction, quality of craftsman, quality assurance/quality control practice, labour wages, weather and economic activity in the area were highest significance of causing disruption event in construction industry while stacking of trades, rework of already installed work changes to the plans and specification, management control, site access, and rework/errors were least impact. Further, it was found out that record keeping at site was significantly maintained through payment certificate, labour time sheets and daily report. However, it was identified that there was deficiency record maintenance of records such as correspondence, change order log, separate cost account for specific change orders, and record of change conditions caused by the owner even though those are important materials for substantiation of claim. According to the analysis, submission of disruption claims in construction industry with various types of disruption <b>claim</b> <b>analysis</b> methods was considerably lower level. Documentary evidence widely used methods of measured mile study, baseline productivity analysis and system dynamics modeling were least usage in industry. Mostly used method was total cost method which can be easily prepared at available data.

Eventually, Contractor suffers from disruptions events due to deficiency of contemporary records on hands. Therefore, it is recommended to establish one day before action plan, build specialized teams on particular work, independent team to grab the work norms and head office comments on project in order to answer disruptions early.
