50|$|As a result, evaluability {{can cause}} {{preference}} reversals between joint and separate evaluations. For example, Hsee, George Loewenstein, Blount & Bazerman (1999) looked at how people choose between options {{when they are}} directly compared because they are presented {{at the same time}} or when they cannot be compared because one is only given a single option. The canonical example is a hiring decision made about two candidates being hired for a programming job. Subjects in an experiment were asked to give a starting salary to two candidates, Candidate J and <b>Candidate</b> <b>S.</b> However, some viewed both candidates at the same time (joint evaluation), whereas others only viewed one candidate (separate evaluation). Candidate J had experience of 70 KY programs, and a GPA of 2.5, whereas <b>Candidate</b> <b>S</b> had experience of 10 KY programs and a GPA of 3.9. The results showed that in joint evaluation both candidates received roughly the same starting salary from subjects, who apparently thought a low GPA but high experience was approximately equal to a high GPA but low experience. However, in the separate evaluation, subjects paid <b>Candidate</b> <b>S,</b> the one with the high GPA, substantially more money. The explanation for this is that KY programs is an attribute that is difficult to evaluate and thus people cannot base their judgment on this attribute in separate evaluation.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION HIV-infected {{patients}} require antiretroviral {{treatment for}} life. To improve access to care, CD 4 enumeration and viral load tests have been redesigned {{to be used}} as point-of-care techniques using finger-stick blood. Accurate CD 4 counting in capillary blood requires a free flowing blood drop that is achieved by blade incision. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the attitude of the patients toward blade-based finger-stick blood donation. METHODS Four hundred and ninety-nine patients were included (299 patients from South Africa and 200 from Belgium). They completed a questionnaire to express their preference for finger stick or venipuncture, after undergoing both. The South African patient cohort was divided in two groups, receiving either single or multiple finger stick for CD 4 and other HIV-related tests. The Belgian patients received a single finger stick for CD 4 testing, and were asked to respond directly and again after two days. RESULTS The majority of the patients preferred the finger stick to the venipuncture. The perceived pain using the blade was superior to a small needle, but similar to a large needle. They preferred up to three finger sticks over one venipuncture. Up to 30 % of the patients changed their mind over two days. The main reason for choosing a finger stick was continued bleeding after venipuncture. The most cited objection to finger stick was pain/soreness. CONCLUSION Patient perceptions support the implementation of donating capillary blood with bladebased finger stick during CD 4 point-of-care testing. <b>S</b> 1 <b>File.</b> Questionnaire for group 1 in South Africa.
