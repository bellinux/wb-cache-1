40|$|A Pulse Forming Network (PFN), Helical Electromagnetic Launcher (HEML), Command Module (CM), and Calibration Table (CT) {{were built}} and {{evaluated}} for the combined ability to calibrate an accelerometer. The PFN has a maximum stored energy of 19. 25 kJ bank and is fired by a {{silicon controlled rectifier}} (SCR), with appropriate safety precautions. The HEML is constructed out of G- 10 fiberglass and is designed to accelerate 600 grams to 10 meters per second. The CM is microcontroller based running Arduino Software. The CM has a keypad input and 7 segment outputs of the bank voltage and desired voltage. After entering a desired bank voltage, the CM controls the charge of the PFN. When the two voltages are equal it allows the fire button to send a pulse to the SCR to fire the PFN and in turn, the HEML. The HEML projectile's tip hits a target that is held by the CT. The CT consists of a table to hold the PFN and HEML, a vacuum chuck, air bearing, velocity meter and <b>catch</b> <b>pot.</b> The Target is held with the vacuum chuck awaiting impact. After impact, the air bearing allows the target to fall freely for the velocity meter to get an accurate reading. A known acceleration is determined from the known change in velocity of the target.

The pots, made of steel 1 x 1 cm square-meshed netting, were 105 cm in length and 31 cm in diameter. They were baited using various crushed crustaceans. The pots were placed at depths between 5 and 10 m on rocky bottom with a dense cover of Lamillaria spp. and other macroalgae. A professional fisherman conducted the fishing. Sometimes the pots were hauled once a day, and sometimes twice {{or three times a}} day. This did not influence the catch rates. The <b>catch</b> per <b>pot</b> ranked up to 390. The mean <b>catch</b> per <b>pot</b> was 25. 8, 18. 8, 46. 9, 42. 7, 55. 5 for 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Distribution of <b>catch</b> per <b>pot</b> was highly skewed to the left for the first 2 years, while the distribution became progressively more symmetrical for the later years. In 1997, 10 % of the pots yielded more than 90 fish, and, in 1998, 9 % yielded higher catches. For the other years, this figure ranges from 0. 1 % to 3 %.

40|$|With {{the growing}} grey seal {{population}} in the Baltic Sea, the inshore cod fishery has suffered dramatic increases in both catch losses and damage to fishing gear. To mitigate this situation, cod pots were evaluated {{as an alternative to}} traditional gillnets and longlines. During a 3 -year study, cod pots were used by commercial fishers in two areas off the coast of Sweden. Using the data from this study, we evaluated <b>catches</b> from <b>pots</b> in relation to other gear types and investigated the effects of environmental and fisheries-related variables such as depth and soak time. The comparison of pots with other gear types showed that, {{during the first half of}} the year, the pot fishery generated lower daily catches than the gillnet and longline fisheries at comparable fishing efforts. During the second half of the year, <b>catches</b> in the <b>pot</b> fishery exceeded or were equal to those in the traditional fisheries. Using generalized additive models to evaluate the impact of environmental and fisheries-related variables on <b>pot</b> <b>catches,</b> we showed that, in both areas, the catch per unit effort (cpue) of legal-sized cod was affected by the water depth, the time of year (months), and the soak time. In one of the areas, cpue was also affected by the direction of the water current in relation to the orientation of the string of pots. The cpue of undersized cod was affected by topographic variables such as the slope and the complexity of the bottom, in addition to the water depth, month of the year, and soak time. The results from the study indicate that pots can be a useful alternative gear in the Baltic cod fishery, at least during part of the year. By using our information on how catches are affected by environmental and fisheries-related variables, the pot fishery may be further optimized to increase catches...|$|R

Commercial harvest data (<b>catch</b> per <b>pot)</b> for male crabs larger than 165 mm in carapace width were collected from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) management area, district 114 and a subdivision of district 114, 114 C from 1996 to 2003. Commercial harvests of Dungeness crabs in the management area varied interannually. Commercial harvests decreased until 2000 but increased beginning in 2001. ZI density was obtained from zooplankton samples collected monthly from sampling stations within the same management district from 1997 to 2004. ZI occurred mostly in May and June, but as late as July in 1997 and 2002. ZI densities increased beginning in 1999. Total densities of ZI were significantly correlated with the commercial harvest data of adult male crabs within the management area, 114 C (tens of square kilometers), containing the plankton sampling stations, but were not related to total commercial harvests within the larger geographic management area 114 (hundreds of square kilometers).

After 1955 the fishery declined, the profit {{remained}} low {{and by the}} early 90 ’s the industry was heavily subsidized. A plan for the industry took action when subsidizes were cut and the landings dropped. This, together with an increasing demand, has brought profitability into the trade again.

40|$|The Common Octopus, Octopus vulgaris, is an r-selected mollusk found off {{the coast}} of North Carolina that {{interests}} commercial fishermen because of its market value and the cost-effectiveness of unbaited <b>pots</b> that can <b>catch</b> it. This study sought to: 1) determine those gear and environmental factors that influenced catch rates of octopi, and 2) evaluate the feasibility of small-scale commercial operations for this species. Pots were fished from August 2010 through September 2011 set in strings over hard and sandy bottom in waters from 18 to 30 m deep in Onslow Bay, N. C. Three pot types were fished in each string; octopus pots with- and without lids, and conch <b>pots.</b> Proportional <b>catch</b> was modeled as a function of gear design and environmental factors (location, soak time, bottom type, and sea surface water temperature) using binomially distributed generalized linear models (GLM’s); parsimony of each GLM was assessed with Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). A total of 229 octopi were caught throughout the study. Pots with lids, pots without lids, and conch pots caught an average of 0. 15, 0. 17, and 0. 11 octopi, respectively, with high variability in catch rates for each pot type. The GLM that best fit the data described proportional catch as a function of sea surface temperature, soak time, and station; greatest proportional catches occurred over short soak times, warmest temperatures, and less well known reef areas. Due to operating expenses (fuel, crew time, and maintenance), low catch rates of octopi, and high gear loss, a directed fishery for this species is not economically feasible at the catch rates found in this study. The model fitting to determine factors most influential on catch rates should help fishermen determine seasons and gear soak times that are likely to maximize <b>catch</b> rates. <b>Potting</b> for octopi may be commercially practical as a supplemental activity when targeting demersal fish species that are found in similar habitats and depth ranges in coastal waters off North Carolina...|$|R

40|$|Australia’s western rock lobster {{fishery is}} its most {{valuable}} and hence from a biological perspective most tightly managed major commercial fishery, {{yet it has}} been beset by problems of miniscule recruitment over the past 3 years. This coming year 2010 - 11 is little better. It was the joint first Marine Stewardship Council certified fishery - first in April 2001, recertified in 2006 and again in Jan 2010. Despite this, it has suffered all the well known problems of first, an open access fishery, and even in its current management mode of a total effort controlled fishery – based on total number of pots- is subject to ever shortening seasons and only moderate prices {{as a result of}} “the race to fish”. The paper first presents the results of a bio-economic model on the comparative costs and benefits of an ITQ versus ITE system for this fishery. The results were derived from a purpose built bioeconomic model with three separate bio-geographic zones in the fishery using non linear optimization to produce ten year steady state solutions for alternative management options. Management options included the current pot control system, and several versions of an individual transferable catch quota system. Key outputs for each scenario include: net economic benefits, breeder biomass index, annual <b>catch,</b> annual <b>pot</b> lifts, number of pots and vessel numbers.

The paper illustrates why undiversified fishing in such a situation as ITEs is too risky even for vertically integrated fishing and marketing companies.

40|$|The {{blue crab}} (Callinectes sapidus) {{supports}} North Carolina's most valuable commercial fishery; {{the value of}} hard blue crabs landed in 2000 was over $ 30 million dollars. This lucrative fishery may be adversely affected by loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Crabbers in Core Sound, North Carolina, report that sea turtle damage to crab pots has become an increasingly serious issue. Turtles damage crab pots by overturning them while {{trying to get the}} bait, tearing up the bottoms and sides of the pots; this damage results in higher gear replacement costs and losses in crab catch. Experimental fishing was conducted to test for differences in crab <b>catch</b> and <b>pot</b> damage using three types of crab pots: low-profile, square mesh, and hexagonal mesh. The hexagonal mesh pot is the most common pot type used by crabbers in Core Sound, and the low-profile pot was designed to reduce the sea turtles' ability to overturn the pots. The number and size of all crabs caught in the experimental pots were recorded. An analysis of variance (ANDVA) was used to analyze the relationship between number of crabs caught per pot and the effect of pot type, location, date, the interaction of date and location, and the interaction of pot type and location. Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests were used to determine significant differences among treatments. There {{was no significant difference in}} crab catch between the low-profile and the square mesh pots at any of the three experimental fishing locations. There was a significant difference in catch between the low-profile and hexagonal mesh pots at one location. The lowprofile pots sustained considerably less damage than both the square mesh and hexagonal mesh pot types. In interviews with 19 Core and Pamlico Sound crabbers, crabbers estimated that 62 % of all crab pot damage, and 37 % of lost crab catch, is due to sea turtle damage. The low-profile crab pot has the potential to improve this situation by allowing crabbers to maintain crab catch with a reduction in gear replacement costs...|$|R
40|$|Wrasse species {{went from}} having almost no {{commercial}} value in Norway, {{and not being}} fished, to a landing of 21. 2 million individuals in 2014 with 11. 68 million of these being goldsinny. This explosive growth in fishing might have affected the populations of goldsinny severely. Establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) could be a helpful tool in management and conservation of goldsinny populations. Differences in selection of the two gear types used in the wrasse fishery (fyke nets and pots) could also affect the goldsinny populations. To test for effects of MPAs, I compared catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of goldsinny above the legal size limit in four MPAs along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast to that obtained in four neighboring control areas where fishing is allowed. The CPUE of legal size goldsinny was higher in the MPAs compared to the control areas in all four localities, suggesting that MPAs have impacted the abundance of goldsinny. There was much variation in the size and age distribution of the goldsinny populations in the different localities, and no clear trends {{of changes in the}} size and age distribution of the goldsinny populations inside the MPAs were found. The gear type used in the wrasse fishery might also affect the populations since <b>pots</b> seemed to <b>catch</b> more goldsinny than fyke nets, whereas fyke nets seemed to catch larger sized goldsinny than <b>pots.</b> <b>Catch</b> data in this study compared to data from a study on the Skagerrak coast in the late 1990 s indicates that the increased fishing pressure since then has affected the abundance of goldsinny on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast.

In southern coastal Kenya, bed net use was negligible in 1997 - 1998 when Anopheles funestus and An. gambiae s. s. were the primary malaria vectors, with An. arabiensis and Anopheles merus playing a secondary role. Since 2001, bed net use has increased progressively and reached high levels by 2009 - 2010 with corresponding decline in malaria transmission. Methods To evaluate the impact of the substantial increase in household bed net use within this area on vector density, vector composition, and human-vector contact, indoor and outdoor resting mosquitoes were collected in the same region during 2009 - 2010 using pyrethrum spray <b>catches</b> and clay <b>pots</b> for indoor and outdoor collections respectively. Information on bed net use per sleeping spaces and factors influencing mosquito density were determined in the same houses using Poisson regression analysis. Species distribution was determined, and number of mosquitoes per house, human-biting rates (HBR), and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) were compared to those reported for the same area during 1997 - 1998, when bed net coverage had been minimal. Results Compared to 1997 - 1998, a significant decline in the relative proportion of An. gambiae s. s. among collected mosquitoes was noted, coupled with a proportionate increase of An. arabiensis. Following > 5 years of 60 - 86 % coverage with bed nets, the density, human biting rate and EIR of indoor resting mosquitoes were reduced by more than 92 % for An. funestus and by 75 % for An. gambiae s. l. In addition, the host feeding choice of both vectors shifted more toward non-human vertebrates. Besides bed net use, malaria vector abundance was also influenced by type of house construction and according to whether one sleeps on a bed or a mat (both of these are associated with household wealth). Mosquito density was positively associated with presence of domestic animals. Conclusions These entomological indices indicate a much reduced human biting rate and a diminishing role of An. gambiae s. s. in malaria transmission following high bed net coverage. While increasing bed net coverage beyond the current levels may not significantly reduce the transmission potential of An. arabiensis, it is anticipated that increasing or at least sustaining high bed net coverage will result in a diminished role for An. funestus in malaria transmission. </p...|$|R
