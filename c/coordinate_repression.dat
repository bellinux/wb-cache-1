40|$|The mitotic {{state is}} {{associated}} with a generalized repression of transcription. We show that mitotic repression of RNA polymerase III transcription can be reproduced by using extracts of synchronized HeLa cells. We have used this system to investigate the molecular basis of transcriptional repression during mitosis. We find a specific decrease in the activity of the TATA-binding-protein (TBP) -containing complex TFIIIB. TBP itself is hyperphosphorylated at mitosis, but this does not appear to account for the loss of TFIIIB activity. Instead, one or more TBP-associated components appear to be regulated. The data suggest that changes in the activity of TBP-associated components contribute to the <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> of gene expression that occurs at mitosis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTranscription factor Snail mediates {{epithelial}} to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) by <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> of epithelial markers, facilitating mass cell movement during {{germ layer}} formation. Aberrant reprogramming in its signaling pathways causes metastatic cancer. Snail’s involvement in “fate-changing” decisions is however not understood. Cripto- 1 shares a common temporal expression pattern with Snail during development. While Cripto- 1 {{is required for}} mammary morphogenesis and hematopoietic stem cell renewal, its unregulated expression causes metastatic cancers. Therefore, we suspected that Snail regulates the expression of Cripto- 1 controlling decisions such as motility, transformation and differentiation. We demonstrate that Snail represses Cripto- 1 gene by direct transcriptional interaction and propose a novel mechanism by which it co-ordinately regulates cell fate decisions during development and could be causal of cancers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{opportunistic}} pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{causes a}} variety of acute and chronic infections. We identified a gene whose inactivation results in attenuation of virulence due to premature activation of genes involved in biofilm formation and <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> of genes required for initial colonization. This gene, retS, encodes a hybrid sensor kinase/response regulator with an unconventional arrangement of functional domains. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling indicates that the retS gene is required for expression of the Type III secretion system and other virulence factors and for repression of genes responsible for exopolysaccharide components of the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix. These disparate phenotypes are suppressed by transposon insertions in genes encoding the GacS/GacA/rsmZ signal transduction pathway, a highly conserved system involved in the control of diverse adaptive functions. This study defines RetS as a pleiotropic regulator of multiple virulence phenotypes that orchestrates genes required for acute infection and genes associated with chronic persistence...|$|E
40|$|There are {{groups of}} genes that need <b>coordinated</b> <b>repression</b> in {{multiple}} contexts, {{for example if}} they code for proteins that work together in a pathway or in a protein complex. Redundancy of biological regulatory networks implies that such <b>coordinated</b> <b>repression</b> might occur at both the pre- and post-transcriptional level, though not necessarily simul-taneously or under the same conditions. Here, we propose that such redundancy in the global regula-tory network can be detected by the overlap between the putative targets of a transcriptional repressor, as identified by a ChIP-seq experiment, and predicted targets of a microRNA (miRNA). To test this hypoth-esis, we used publicly available ChIP-seq data of the neural transcriptional repressor RE 1 silencing tran-scription factor (REST) from 15 different cell sam-ples. We found 20 miRNAs, each of which shares {{a significant amount of}} predicted targets with REST. The set of predicted associations between these 20 miRNAs and the overlapping REST targets is en-riched in known miRNA targets. Many of the detected miRNAs have functions related to neural identity and glioblastoma, which could be expected from their overlap in targets with REST. We propose that the in-tegration of experimentally determined transcription factor binding sites with miRNA-target predictions provides functional information on miRNAs...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{differentiation}} of {{embryonic stem cells}} (ESCs) requires <b>coordinated</b> <b>repression</b> of the pluripotency regulatory program and reciprocal activation of the neurogenic regulatory program. Upon neural induction, ESCs rapidly repress expression of pluripotency genes followed by staged activation of neural progenitor and differentiated neuronal and glial genes. The transcriptional factors that underlie maintenance of pluripotency are partially characterized whereas those underlying neural induction are much less explored, and the factors that coordinate these two developmental programs are completely unknown. One transcription factor, REST (repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor), has been linked with terminal {{differentiation of}} neural progenitors and more recently, and controversially, with control of pluripotency. Here, we show that {{in the absence of}} REST, coordination of pluripotency and neural induction is lost and there is a resultant delay in repression of pluripotency genes and a precocious activation of both neural progenitor and differentiated neuronal and glial genes. Furthermore, we show that REST is not required for production of radial glia-like progenitors but is required for their subsequent maintenance and differentiation into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. We propose that REST acts as a regulatory hub that <b>coordinates</b> timely <b>repression</b> of pluripotency with neural induction and neural differentiation...|$|R
40|$|During development, chromatin-modifying enzymes {{regulate}} {{both the}} timely establishment of cell-type-specific gene {{programs and the}} <b>coordinated</b> <b>repression</b> of alternative cell fates. To dissect the role of one such enzyme, the intellectual-disability-linked lysine demethylase 5 C (Kdm 5 c), in the developing and adult brain, we conducted parallel behavioral, transcriptomic, and epigenomic studies in Kdm 5 c-null and forebrain-restricted inducible knockout mice. Together, genomic analyses and functional assays demonstrate that Kdm 5 c plays a critical role as a repressor responsible for the developmental silencing of germline genes during cellular differentiation and in fine-tuning activity-regulated enhancers during neuronal maturation. Although {{the importance of these}} functions declines after birth, Kdm 5 c retains an important genome surveillance role preventing the incorrect activation of non-neuronal and cryptic promoters in adult neurons...|$|R
40|$|The three enzymes in the leucine biosynthetic pathway of yeast do not exhibit <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> and {{derepression}} {{in response}} to the carbon source available in the culture medium. Growth in an acetate medium results in derepression of the first enzyme in the pathway, alpha-isopropylmalate synthase, and repression of the second two enzymes, alpha-isopropylmalate isomerase and beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, relative to the levels found in glucose-grown cells. The role of endogenous leucine pools as a mediator of these differences was investigated. The leucine pools did not differ significantly between acetate-grown and glucose-grown cells. However, an elevated endogenous leucine pool, caused by exogenous leucine in the growth medium, did decrease the rate of decay of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase activity observed when acetate-grown cells were shifted to glucose. Evidence is provided suggesting that an elevated endogenous leucine pool may increase the in vivo stability of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase under several different conditions. Studies on the kinetics of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase decay in vivo and sensitivity to leucine inhibition indicate that there are two classes of the enzyme in acetate-grown yeast cells...|$|E
40|$|The glucose-regulated protein (GRP) {{system in}} {{mammalian}} cells is induced by glucose deprivation, anoxia, the calcium ionophore A 23187, and 2 -deoxyglucose. In Chinese hamster ovary cells the major GRPs are approximately equal to 76, 97, and 170 kDa. Removal {{of each of}} these four GRP-inducing stresses leads to the <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> of GRPs and induction of the major heat shock proteins at 70 and 89 kDa. The application {{of each of these}} four GRP-inducing conditions leads to a significant induction of resistance to the drug doxorubicin. Removal of each GRP-inducing condition results in the rapid disappearance of this resistance in a manner that correlates with the repression of the GRPs. The retention of doxorubicin by GRP-induced cells does not explain the induced drug resistance. When the RIF in vitro/in vivo tumor system is probed with an antibody against the 76 -kDa GRP, a significant increase in this GRP is observed in cells obtained from the central regions of tumors. Since hypoxia and/or nutrient deprivation can occur during tumor development, a GRP-induced state in the tumor may confer resistance to doxorubicin treatment...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{members of}} the let- 7 family of miRNAs are often {{repressed}} in human cancers 1, 2, thereby promoting oncogenesis by derepressing targets such as HMGA 2, K-Ras and c-Myc 3, 4. However, the mechanism by which let- 7 miRNAs are co-ordinately repressed is unclear. The RNA-binding proteins LIN 28 and LIN 28 B block let- 7 precursors from being processed to mature miRNAs 5 – 8, suggesting that their overexpression might promote malignancy through repression of let- 7. Here we show that LIN 28 and LIN 28 B are overexpressed in primary human tumors and human cancer cell lines (overall frequency approx. 15 %), and that overexpression is linked to repression of let- 7 family miRNAs and derepression of let- 7 targets. LIN 28 and LIN 28 b facilitate cellular transformation in vitro, and overexpression is associated with advanced disease across multiple tumor types. Our work provides a mechanism for the <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> of let- 7 miRNAs observed in a subset of human cancers, and associates activation of LIN 28 and LIN 28 B with poor clinical prognosis.

40|$|Desiccation {{tolerance}} is {{the capacity}} to survive complete drying. It is an ancient trait {{that can be found}} in prokaryotes, fungi, primitive animals (often at the larval stages), whole plants, pollens and seeds. In the dry state, metabolism is suspended and the duration that anhydrobiotes can survive ranges from years to centuries. Whereas genes induced by drought stress have been successfully enumerated in tissues that are sensitive to cellular desiccation, we have little knowledge as to the adaptive role of these genes in establishing desiccation tolerance at the cellular level. This paper reviews postgenomic approaches in a variety of desiccation tolerant organisms in which the genetic responses have been investigated when they acquire the capacity of tolerating extremes of dehydration or when they are dry. Accumulation of non-reducing sugars, LEA proteins and a <b>coordinated</b> <b>repression</b> of metabolism appear to be the essential and universal attributes that can confer desiccation tolerance. The protective mechanisms of these attributes are described. Furthermore, it is most likely that other mechanisms have evolved since the function of about 30 % of the genes involved in desiccation tolerance remains to be elucidated. The question of the overlap between desiccation tolerance and drought tolerance is briefly addressed...|$|R
40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) is a highly conserved transcription factor that mediates {{a broad spectrum of}} species-, strain-, sex-, age-, tissue-, and cell-specific responses elicited by structurally diverse ligands including 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Dose-dependent effects on liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression were examined in male and female mice gavaged with TCDD every 4 days for 28 or 92 days. RNA-seq data revealed the <b>coordinated</b> <b>repression</b> of 181 genes predominately expressed in the liver including albumin (3. 7 -fold), α-fibrinogen (14. 5 -fold), and β-fibrinogen (17. 4 -fold) in males with corresponding AhR enrichment at 2 hr. Liver-specific genes exhibiting sexually dimorphic expression also demonstrated diminished divergence between sexes. For example, male-biased Gstp 1 was repressed 3. 0 -fold in males and induced 4. 5 -fold in females, which were confirmed at the protein level. Disrupted regulation is consistent with impaired GHR-JAK 2 -STAT 5 signaling and inhibition of female specific CUX 2 -mediated transcription as well as the repression of other key transcriptional regulators including Ghr, Stat 5 b, Bcl 6, Hnf 4 a, Hnf 6, Foxa 1 / 2 / 3, and Zhx 2. Attenuated liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression was concurrent with the induction of fetal genes such as alpha-fetoprotein. The results suggest AhR activation causes the loss of liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression producing a functionally "de-differentiated" hepatic phenotype...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} whether sequence-specific RNA–protein interaction at the 5 ′-untranslated region (5 ′-UTR) can potently repress translation in mammalian cells, a bicistronic translational repression assay {{was developed to}} permit direct assessment of RNA–protein interaction and translational repression in transiently transfected living mammalian cells. Changes in cap-dependent yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES) -dependent cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) translation were monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Selective repression of YFP or <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> of both YFP and CFP translation occurred, indicating two distinct modes by which RNA-binding proteins repress translation through the 5 ′-UTR. Interestingly, a single-stranded RNA-binding protein from Bacillus subtilis, tryptophan RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP), showed potent translational repression, dependent {{on the level of}} TRAP expression and position of its cognate binding site within the bicistronic reporter transcript. As the first of its class to be examined in mammalian cells, its potency in repression of translation through the 5 ′-UTR may be a general feature for this class of single-stranded RNA-binding proteins. Finally, a one-hybrid screen based on translational repression through the 5 ′-UTR identified linkers supporting full-translational repression as well as a range of partial repression by TRAP {{within the context of a}} fusion protein...|$|E
40|$|The current {{concept of}} {{epigenetic}} repression {{is based on}} one repressor unit corresponding to one silent gene. This notion, however, cannot adequately explain concurrent silencing of multiple loci observed in large chromosome regions. The long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) can be a frequent occurrence throughout the human genome. To comprehensively characterize the influence of estrogen signaling on LRES, we analyzed transcriptome, methylome, and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR 1) -binding datasets from normal breast epithelia and breast cancer cells. This “omics” approach uncovered 11 large repressive zones (range, 0. 35 ∼ 5. 98 megabases), including a 14 -gene cluster located on 16 p 11. 2. In normal cells, estrogen signaling induced transient formation of multiple DNA loops in the 16 p 11. 2 region by bringing 14 distant loci to focal ESR 1 -docking sites for <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression.</b> However, the plasticity of this free DNA movement was reduced in breast cancer cells. Together with the acquisition of DNA methylation and repressive chromatin modifications at the 16 p 11. 2 loci, an inflexible DNA scaffold may be a novel determinant used by breast cancer cells to reinforce estrogen-mediated repression...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of cell surface {{expression of}} class II {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) antigens by interleukin (IL) - 4 and interferon (IFN) -gamma is inhibited by elevation of intracellular cyclic (c) AMP, which is caused by immunomodulatory agents such as E series prostaglandins (PGEs). To investigate the mechanism of this downregulation, we have analyzed the consequences of elevating intracellular cAMP on cell surface expression, mRNA levels, and promoter activity of the murine A alpha and E beta class II MHC genes. Elevation of cAMP resulted in a <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> of both basal and inducible A alpha and E beta expression. 151 and 192 base pairs of A alpha and E beta promoter sequence, respectively, were sufficient for conferring repression by cAMP on a reporter gene. A mutational analysis of the A alpha promoter revealed that cAMP downregulation is mediated by the conserved S and X 1 DNA elements, which are also necessary for induction by cytokines. Downregulation by cAMP was not dependent on an intact X 2 site, which is identical in sequence to the CRE element which mediates the positive regulation of several genes by cAMP. These results identify the DNA elements which mediate repression of class II MHC genes by cAMP and show that the same DNA sequences can mediate {{both positive and negative}} regulation of class II MHC expression...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} from etiolated to green seedlings involves {{a shift from}} hypocotyl growth-promoting conditions to growth restraint. These changes occur through a complex light-driven process involving multiple and tightly coordinated hormonal signaling pathways. Nitric oxide (NO) has been lately characterized as a regulator of plant development interacting with hormone signaling. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) NO-deficient mutant hypocotyls are longer than those from wild-type seedlings under red light but not under blue or far-red light. Accordingly, exogenous treatment with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside and mutant plants with increased endogenous NO levels resulted in reduced hypocotyl length. In addition to increased hypocotyl elongation, NO deficiency led to increased anthocyanin levels and reduced PHYB content under red light, all processes governed by phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs). NO-deficient plants accordingly showed an enhanced expression of PIF 3, PIF 1, and PIF 4. Moreover, exogenous NO increased the levels of the gibberellin (GA) -regulated DELLA proteins and shortened hypocotyls, likely through the negative regulation of the GA Insensitive Dwarf 1 (GID 1) -Sleepy 1 (SLY 1) module. Consequently, NO-deficient seedlings displayed up-regulation of SLY 1, defective DELLA accumulation, and altered GA sensitivity, thus resulting in defective deetiolation under red light. Accumulation of NO in wild-type seedlings undergoing red light-triggered deetiolation and elevated levels of NO in the GA-deficient ga 1 - 3 mutant in darkness suggest a mutual NO-GA antagonism in controlling photomorphogenesis. PHYB-dependent NO production promotes photomorphogenesis by a GID 1 -GA-SLY 1 -mediated mechanism based on the <b>coordinated</b> <b>repression</b> of growth-promoting PIF genes {{and the increase in}} the content of DELLA proteins...|$|R
40|$|The p 53 inhibitor, MDM 4 (MDMX) is a {{cytoplasmic protein}} with p 53 -activating {{function}} under DNA damage conditions. Particularly, MDM 4 promotes phosphorylation of p 53 at Ser 46, a modification that precedes different p 53 activities. We investigated the {{mechanism by which}} MDM 4 promotes this p 53 modification and its consequences in untransformed mammary epithelial cells and tissues. In response to severe DNA damage, MDM 4 stimulates p 53 Ser 46 (P) by binding and stabilizing serine-threonine kinase HIPK 2. Under these conditions, the p 53 -inhibitory complex, MDM 4 /MDM 2, dissociates and this allows MDM 4 to promote p 53 /HIPK 2 functional interaction. Comparative proteomic analysis of DNA damage-treated cells versus -untreated cells evidenced a diffuse downregulation of proteins with anti-apoptotic activity, {{some of which were}} targets of p 53 Ser 46 (P) /HIPK 2 repressive activity. Importantly, MDM 4 depletion abolishes the downregulation of these proteins indicating the requirement of MDM 4 to promote p 53 -mediated transcriptional repression. Consistently, MDM 4 -mediated HIPK 2 /p 53 activation precedes HIPK 2 /p 53 nuclear translocation and activity. Noteworthy, repression of these proteins was evident also in mammary glands of mice subjected to γ-irradiation and was significantly enhanced in transgenic mice overexpressing MDM 4. This study evidences the flexibility of MDM 2 /MDM 4 heterodimer, which allows the development of a positive activity of cytoplasmic MDM 4 towards p 53 -mediated transcriptional function. Noteworthy, this activity uncovers <b>coordinated</b> <b>repression</b> of molecules with shared anti-apoptotic function which precedes active cell apoptosis and that are frequently overexpressed and/or markers of tumour phenotype in human cancer...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesVascular {{smooth muscle}} cells can undergo {{profound}} changes in phenotype, defined by <b>coordinated</b> <b>repression</b> of smooth muscle cell marker genes {{and production of}} matrix metalloproteinases in response to injury. However, little is known {{of the role of}} smooth muscle cells in aortic aneurysms. We hypothesized that smooth muscle cells undergo phenotypic modulation early in the development of aortic aneurysms. MethodsAbdominal aortas from C 57 B 6 mice (n = 79) were perfused with elastase or saline (control) and harvested at 1, 3, 7, or 14 days. Aortas were analyzed by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry for smooth muscle cell marker genes, including SM 22 A, smooth muscle α-actin, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. In complimentary experiments human aneurysms (n = 10) and control aorta (n = 10) were harvested at the time of surgical intervention and analyzed. ResultsBy 14 days, aortic diameter was larger after elastase perfusion compared with control diameter (100 % ± 9. 6 % vs 59. 5 % ± 18. 9 %, P =. 0002). At 7 days, elastase-perfused mice had a 78 % and 85 % reduction in SM 22 α and smooth muscle α-actin expression, respectively, compared with that seen in control animals well before aneurysms were present, and these values remained repressed at 14 days. Immunohistochemistry confirmed less SM 22 α and smooth muscle α-actin in experimental aneurysms at 14 days in concert with increased matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression at 7 and 14 days. Similarly, human aneurysms had less SM 22 α and smooth muscle α-actin and increased matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 staining, compared with control values, as determined by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. ConclusionsAneurysms demonstrate smooth muscle cell phenotypic modulation characterized by downregulation of smooth muscle cell marker genes and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases. These events in experimental models occur before aneurysm formation. Targeting smooth muscle cells to a reparative phenotype might provide a novel therapy in the treatment of aortic aneurysms...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs {{are well}} suited to {{regulate}} tumor metastasis because of their capacity to coordinately repress numerous target genes, thereby potentially enabling their intervention at multiple steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade. We identify a microRNA exemplifying these attributes, miR- 31, whose expression correlates inversely with metastasis in human breast cancer patients. Overexpression of miR- 31 in otherwise-aggressive breast tumor cells suppresses metastasis. We deploy a stable microRNA sponge strategy to inhibit miR- 31 in vivo; this allows otherwise-nonaggressive breast cancer cells to metastasize. These phenotypes do not involve confounding influences on primary tumor development and are specifically attributable to miR- 31 -mediated inhibition of several steps of metastasis, including local invasion, extravasation or initial survival at a distant site, and metastatic colonization. Such pleiotropy is achieved via <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> of a cohort of metastasis-promoting genes, including RhoA.

Two days of nitrogen deprivation led to <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> {{of the majority of}} the genes assigned to photosynthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, plastid protein synthesis, induction of many genes for secondary metabolism, and reprogramming of mitochondrial electron transport.

By 3 h, most genes assigned to amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis and scavenging were induced, while most genes assigned to amino acid and nucleotide breakdown were repressed. There was coordinate induction of many genes assigned to RNA synthesis and processing and most of the genes assigned to amino acid activation and protein synthesis. Although amino acids involved in central metabolism increased, minor amino acids decreased, providing independent evidence for the activation of protein synthesis. Specific genes encoding expansin and tonoplast intrinsic proteins were induced, indicating activation of cell expansion and growth in response to nitrate nutrition.

Studies on lymphocytes at cell cycle exit after growth factor deprivation have predominantly {{focused on the}} initiation of apoptosis. We aimed to study gene expression profile of primary and immortalised IL- 2 -dependent human T cells forced to exit the cell cycle by growth factor withdrawal, before apoptosis could be evidenced. Results By the Affymetrix microarrays HG-U 133 2. 0 Plus, 53 genes were distinguished as differentially expressed before and soon after IL- 2 deprivation. Among those, PIM 1, BCL 2, IL- 8, HBEGF, DUSP 6, OSM, CISH, SOCS 2, SOCS 3, LIF and IL 13 were down-regulated and RPS 24, SQSTM 1, TMEM 1, LRRC 8 D, ECOP, YY 1 AP 1, C 1 orf 63, ASAH 1, SLC 25 A 46 and MIA 3 were up-regulated. Genes linked to transcription, cell cycle, cell growth, proliferation and differentiation, cell adhesion, and immune functions {{were found to be}} overrepresented within the set of the differentially expressed genes. Conclusion Cell cycle exit of the growth factor-deprived T lymphocytes is characterised by a signature of differentially expressed genes. A <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> of a set of genes known to be induced during T cell activation is observed. However, growth arrest following exit from the cell cycle is actively controlled by several up-regulated genes that enforce the non-dividing state.

40|$|SummaryT cell fate is {{associated}} with mutually exclusive expression of CD 4 or CD 8 in helper and cytotoxic T cells, respectively. How expression of one locus is temporally <b>coordinated</b> with <b>repression</b> of the other has been a long-standing enigma, though we know RUNX transcription factors activate the Cd 8 locus, silence the Cd 4 locus, and repress the Zbtb 7 b locus (encoding the transcription factor ThPOK), which is required for CD 4 expression. Here we found that nuclear organization was altered by interplay among members of this transcription factor circuitry: RUNX binding mediated association of Cd 4 and Cd 8 whereas ThPOK binding kept the loci apart. Moreover, targeted deletions within Cd 4 modulated CD 8 expression and pericentromeric repositioning of Cd 8. Communication between Cd 4 and Cd 8 thus appears to enable long-range epigenetic regulation to ensure that expression of one excludes the other in mature CD 4 or CD 8 single-positive (SP) cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) mRNAs is a complex process by which more than 30 different mRNA species are produced by alternative splicing of a single primary RNA transcript. HIV- 1 splice sites are used with significantly different efficiencies, resulting in different levels of mRNA species in infected cells. Splicing of Tat mRNA, which is present at relatively low levels in infected cells, is repressed {{by the presence of}} exonic splicing silencers (ESS) within the two tat coding exons (ESS 2 and ESS 3). These ESS elements contain the consensus sequence PyUAG. Here we show that the efficiency of splicing at 3 ' splice site A 2, which is used to generate Vpr mRNA, is also regulated by the presence of an ESS (ESSV), which has sequence homology to ESS 2 and ESS 3. Mutagenesis of the three PyUAG motifs within ESSV increases splicing at splice site A 2, resulting in increased Vpr mRNA levels and reduced skipping of the noncoding exon flanked by A 2 and D 3. The increase in Vpr mRNA levels and the reduced skipping also occur when splice site D 3 is mutated toward the consensus sequence. By in vitro splicing assays, we show that ESSV represses splicing when placed downstream of a heterologous splice site. A 1, A 1 (B), A 2, and B 1 hnRNPs preferentially bind to ESSV RNA compared to ESSV mutant RNA. Each of these proteins, when added back to HeLa cell nuclear extracts depleted of ESSV-binding factors, is able to restore splicing repression. The results suggest that <b>coordinate</b> <b>repression</b> of HIV- 1 RNA splicing is mediated by members of the hnRNP A/B protein family...|$|E

40|$|In {{a search}} for {{regulatory}} genes of the type III secretion system (TTSS) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, transposon (Tn 5) insertional mutants of the prtR gene were found defective in the TTSS. PrtR is an inhibitor of prtN, which encodes a transcriptional activator for pyocin synthesis genes. In P. aeruginosa, pyocin synthesis is activated when PrtR is degraded during the SOS response. Treatment of a wild-type P. aeruginosa strain with mitomycin C, a DNA-damaging agent, resulted in the inhibition of TTSS activation. A prtR/prtN double mutant had the same TTSS defect as the prtR mutant, and complementation by a prtR gene but not by a prtN gene restored the TTSS function. Also, overexpression of the prtN gene in wild-type PAK {{had no effect on}} the TTSS; thus, PrtN is not involved in the repression of the TTSS. To identify the PrtR-regulated TTSS repressor, another round of Tn mutagenesis was carried out in the background of a prtR/prtN double mutant. Insertion in a small gene, designated ptrB, restored the normal TTSS activity. Expression of ptrB is specifically repressed by PrtR, and mitomycin C-mediated suppression of the TTSS is also abolished in a ptrB mutant strain. Therefore, PtrB is a new TTSS repressor that <b>coordinates</b> TTSS <b>repression</b> and pyocin synthesis under the stress of DNA damage...|$|R

Depending on cell type, these lipid intermediates have been shown to inhibit protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), a key mediator of the metabolic actions of insulin, via two distinct pathways: one involving the action of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms, and the second dependent on protein phosphatase- 2 A (PP 2 A). The main aim {{of this study was to}} explore the mechanisms by which ceramide inhibits PKB/Akt in three different skeletal muscle-derived cell culture models; rat L 6 myotubes, mouse C 2 C 12 myotubes and primary human skeletal muscle cells. Our findings indicate that the mechanism by which ceramide acts to repress PKB/Akt is related to the myocellular abundance of caveolin-enriched domains (CEM) present at the plasma membrane. Here, we show that ceramide-enriched-CEMs are markedly more abundant in L 6 myotubes compared to C 2 C 12 myotubes, consistent with their previously reported role in <b>coordinating</b> aPKC-directed <b>repression</b> of PKB/Akt in L 6 muscle cells. In contrast, a PP 2 A-dependent pathway predominantly mediates ceramide-induced inhibition of PKB/Akt in C 2 C 12 myotubes. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that ceramide engages an aPKC-dependent pathway to suppress insulin-induced PKB/Ak...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 5323 Metastatic spread is {{the main}} cause of colon cancer related death and {{therefore}} a greater understanding of this process is a prerequisite for improved treatment. The acquisition of metastatic properties confers tumour cells with the ability to leave the primary tumour, invade the circulatory system, survive transport and establish at distant sites. This process must involve the <b>coordinate</b> induction and <b>repression</b> of a range of genes involved in processes such as angiogenesis, proteolysis and growth- independence. Efforts to reach a greater understanding of tumour metastasis has involved analysis of gene expression patterns in tumours with different invasive potentials. However, the majority of studies have focused on the comparison of normal and tumour tissue and an analysis of late stage tumourigenesis, i. e. comparison of primary and metastatic tumours, has not been carried out extensively...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation of {{transcription}} {{factors and}} coregulators, {{mediated by the}} poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP- 1, has been emerging as an important epigenetic mechanism that controls transcriptional dynamics in response to diverse intra- and extracellular signals. PARP- 1 activity is also implicated in the regulation of mammalian lifespan. Herein we show that transcriptional down-regulation of androgen receptor (AR) in the aging rat liver and in oxidatively stressed hepatoma cells involves exchange of a PARP- 1 -associated, p/CAF-containing coactivator assembly for a p 53 -interacting, Groucho/TLE 1 -, and mSin 3 A-included corepressor complex at an age- and oxidant-responsive DNA element (age-dependent factor (ADF) element) in the AR promoter. The coregulator switch is mediated by B-Myb and c-Myb, which bind to the ADF element and physically associate with PARP- 1 and the tumor suppressor p 53. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, residing at the ADF element in association with PARP- 1, may serve a platform role in stabilizing the activating complex. PARP- 1 coactivated B-Myb- and c-Myb-mediated transactivation of the AR promoter, and p 53 antagonized the B-Myb/c-Myb-induced AR promoter activation. PARP- 1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, B-Myb, and c-Myb each serves as a positive regulator of cellular AR content, whereas p 53 negatively regulates AR expression. Our results identify a shared, PARP- 1 -regulated sensing mechanism that <b>coordinates</b> transcriptional <b>repression</b> of AR during aging {{and in response to}} oxidative stress. This study may provide insights as to how advancing age and intracellular redox balance might influence androgen-regulated physiology...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus mutans is {{the primary}} causative agent of human dental caries, a {{ubiquitous}} infectious disease for which effective treatment strategies remain elusive. We investigated a 25 -kDa SloR metalloregulatory protein in this oral pathogen, along with its target genes that contribute to cariogenesis. Previous studies have demonstrated manganese- and SloR-dependent repression of the sloABCR metal ion transport operon in S. mutans. In the present study, we demonstrate that S. mutans <b>coordinates</b> this <b>repression</b> with that of certain virulence attributes. Specifically, we noted virulence gene repression in a manganese-containing medium when SloR binds to promoter-proximal sequence palindromes on the S. mutans chromosome. We applied a genome-wide approach to elucidate the sequences to which SloR binds and to reveal additional “class I” genes that are subject to SloR- and manganese-dependent repression. These analyses identified 204 S. mutans genes that are preceded {{by one or more}} conserved palindromic SloR recognition elements (SREs). We cross-referenced these genes with those that we had identified previously as SloR and/or manganese modulated in microarray and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments. From this analysis, we identified a number of S. mutans virulence genes that are subject to transcriptional upregulation by SloR and noted that such “class II”-type regulation is dependent on direct SloR binding to promoter-distal SREs. These observations are consistent with a bifunctional role for the SloR metalloregulator and implicate it as a target for the development of therapies aimed at alleviating S. mutans-induced caries formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} tumor suppressor protein (RB) is activated/dephosphorylated {{to mediate}} cell cycle inhibition {{in response to}} antimitogenic signals. To elucidate the mode of RB action at this critical transition, we utilized cell lines that can be induced to express a constitutively active allele of RB (PSM-RB). As expected, induction of PSM-RB, but not wild-type protein (WT), inhibited progression into S phase. It {{has been well documented}} that active RB inhibits E 2 F reporter activity, and this observation was confirmed upon induction of PSM-RB. Additionally, active RB inhibited E 2 F- 2 -mediated stimulation of cyclin E. By contrast, PSM-RB did not affect the mRNA or protein levels of endogenous cyclin E when mediating cell cycle inhibition. Similarly, there was no observable effect on cyclin E protein levels when p 16 ink 4 a was utilized to activate endogenous RB. CDK 2 /cyclin E complex formation was not disrupted and cyclin E-associated kinase activity was retained in the presence of PSM-RB. Additionally, centrosome duplication, a CDK 2 /cyclin E-dependent event, was not altered in the presence of active RB. Together, these data indicate that active RB does not block the G 1 /S transition through inhibition of cyclin E expression or activity. In contrast, PSM-RB leads to a dramatic reduction in cyclin A protein levels by <b>coordinate</b> transcriptional <b>repression</b> and degradation. This attenuation of cyclin A protein correlates with cell cycle inhibition. These studies indicate that RB inhibits cell cycle progression by targeting CDK 2 /cyclin A-dependent events at the G 1 /S transition to inhibit cell cycle progression...|$|R
40|$|Chromatin adapts and {{responds}} to extrinsic and intrinsic cues. We hypothesize that inheritable aberrant chromatin states in cancer and aging {{are caused by}} genetic/environmental factors. In previous studies we demonstrated that either genetic mutations, or loss, of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), can impair {{the integration of the}} retinoic acid (RA) signal at the chromatin of RA-responsive genes downstream of RARalpha, and can lead to aberrant repressive chromatin states marked by epigenetic modifications. In this study we tested whether the mere interference with the availability of RA signal at RARalpha, in cells with an otherwise functional RARalpha, can also induce epigenetic repression at RA-responsive genes downstream of RARalpha. To hamper the availability of RA at RARalpha in untransformed human mammary epithelial cells, we targeted the cellular RA-binding protein 2 (CRABP 2), which transports RA from the cytoplasm onto the nuclear RARs. Stable ectopic expression of a CRABP 2 mutant unable to enter the nucleus, as well as stable knock down of endogenous CRABP 2, led to the <b>coordinated</b> transcriptional <b>repression</b> of a few RA-responsive genes downstream of RARalpha. The chromatin at these genes acquired an exacerbated repressed state, or state "of no return". This aberrant state is unresponsive to RA, and therefore differs from the physiologically repressed, yet "poised" state, which is responsive to RA. Consistent with development of homozygosis for epigenetically repressed loci, a significant proportion of cells with a defective CRABP 2 -mediated RA transport developed heritable phenotypes indicative of loss of function. Derangement/lack of a critical factor necessary for RARalpha function induces epigenetic repression of a RA-regulated gene network downstream of RARalpha, with major pleiotropic biological outcomes...|$|R

In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that ceramide engages an aPKC-dependent pathway to suppress insulin-induced PKB/Akt activation in palmitate-treated cultured human muscle cells as well as in muscle cells from diabetic patients. Collectively, this work identifies key mechanistic differences, which may be linked to variations in plasma membrane composition, underlying the insulin-desensitising effects of ceramide in different skeletal muscle cell models that are extensively used in signal transduction and metabolic studies...|$|R
30|$|The SWI/SNF complex {{consists}} {{of one or}} two mutually exclusive catalytic ATPases (SMARCA 2 /BRM or SMARCA 4 /BRG 1), a group of conserved core subunits (SMARCB 1 /SNF 5, SMARCC 1 /BAF 155, SMARCC 2 /BAF 170), and other variant subunits (Wilson and Roberts, 2011). Two important SWI/SNF complexes implicated in cancer are the BAF and PBAF complexes, which contain the mutually exclusive ARID 1 A or ARID 1 B subunits and PBRM 1 or BRD 7 subunits, respectively (Reisman et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2013). Collectively, SWI/SNF complexes remodel chromatin through the mobilization of nucleosomes both by sliding and by the ejection/insertion of histone octomers (Saha et al., 2006). Through these mechanisms, the SWI/SNF complexes have powerful effects on transcriptional regulation, serving an important role in development through the <b>coordinate</b> activation and <b>repression</b> of critical gene expression programs. Importantly, specificity is most likely achieved through the unique combinatorial assembly of the SWI/SNF complex, facilitated by the sheer size and diversity of the protein subunit repertoire (Wang et al., 1996).|$|R

Here, we perform a systematic analysis of all let- 7 miRNAs and find that a single let- 7 family member, human let- 7 a- 3 (and its murine ortholog let- 7 c- 2), escapes LIN 28 -mediated regulation. Mechanistically, we find that the pre-let- 7 c- 2 loop precludes LIN 28 A binding and regulation. These findings refine the current model of let- 7 regulation by LIN 28 proteins and have important implications for understanding the LIN 28 /let- 7 axis in development and disease...|$|R
