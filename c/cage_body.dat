40|$|There is {{experimental}} evidence {{indicating that the}} noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK- 801 impairs cognition and produces a series of schizophrenia-like symptoms in rodents (hypermotility, stereotypies, and ataxia). The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the efficacy of the nitric oxide (NO) donor molsidomine in counteracting these MK- 801 -induced behavioral effects in the rat. In a first study, post-training administration of molsidomine (at 4 but not 2 mg/kg) successfully antagonized MK- 801 -induced performance deficits in a recognition memory test. In a subsequent study, molsidomine (2 and 4 mg/kg) was shown to be unable to reverse MK- 801 -induced hypermotility but attenuated stereotypies (continuous movement whole <b>cage,</b> <b>body</b> sway, and head weaving) produced by MK- 801. Moreover, at 4 mg/kg this NO donor counteracted MK- 801 -induced ataxia. Our findings indicate that molsidomine attenuates behavioral effects related to the hypofunction of the NMDA receptor suggesting that NO might be involved in the psychotomimetic effects of non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists.

40|$|Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used non-human primate for research and testing in Europe. Their principal use is in preclinical safety testing of new pharmaceuticals to assess risk of adverse effects, as indicated by changes in a core battery of physiological measures before human exposure. Regulatory studies are strictly controlled through legislation and codes of practices underpinned by the principles of humane science, the 3 Rs; Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. Despite the link between good welfare and good science now universally made in codes of practice, legislation and the literature, there are few studies aimed at systematically examining the link and almost no quantitative data from cynomolgus macaques used for toxicology. The main aim of this thesis was to examine the link between Refinement, animal welfare and scientific output for this important animal model, piggy-backing on regulatory studies conducted by a large contract research organisation. In the laboratory, animal welfare is formally considered in terms of Refinement which has evolved to include both the reduction of negative welfare states and the proactive enhancement of positive welfare over the animal’s lifetime. A multidisciplinary approach to welfare assessment including measures of behaviour, physiology and physical health, and which built upon current unit procedures was undertaken to produce an overall assessment of welfare in cynomolgus macaques. Macaque facial expressions, vocalisations, activity and position in the home <b>cage,</b> <b>body</b> weight change, body condition and alopecia scores were found to be reliable indicators of welfare state and would be most feasible for care staff to monitor. The concept of quality of scientific output was defined in relation to toxicological findings and includes sensitivity, reliability and repeatability of individual measures in the core battery (e. g. heart rate, blood pressure, haematology, clinical chemistry and organ weights). The link between welfare and quality of scientific output was then systematically explored with Refinements to macaque use in regulatory studies. The first, a data mining study, undertaken to quantify the effects on biological data recorded from cynomolgus macaques, used in regulatory studies over an eight-year period as the CASE sponsor transitioned from single to permanent group housing, found the effects to be highly variable on individual parameters in the core battery and in some instances welfare-positive effects of group housing were confounded by concurrent changes in standard operating procedures. A further study of planned Refinements to macaque-care staff interaction through enhanced socialisation was found to help animals cope better with husbandry and scientific procedures and enhance quality of cardiovascular measures recorded at baseline. In light of these findings a number of recommendations are made including a framework of terms useful for measuring quality of scientific output, a welfare assessment framework and Refinements to husbandry and scientific procedures for cynomolgus macaques used in regulatory toxicology. Because of their capacity to suffer it is both ethically and scientifically important that macaque welfare is maximised and their use results in valid and reliable experimental outcomes informing on the safety and efficacy of new pharmaceuticals prior to human exposure...|$|E

Poly lactic acid (PLA) is assumed to be the alternative material which could provide cheaper material and lower production cost. However, these implants often cause subsidence failure at the endplate, resulting in injury risk and mechanical instability during fusion. In this study, the stress behavior of PLIF cage made by two different materials, Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and PLA; was studied using finite element method (FEM). By implementing bilateral cages between vertebral bone L 4 and L 5, and conducting 6 different motion activities onto the model, the stress distribution of L 4 -L 5, and <b>cage</b> <b>bodies</b> was predicted.

To prevent ingestion of stillborn pups some dams were sacrificed at day 22. Other dams were allowed to deliver at term. Fetuses were weighed, measured and examined for soft tissue and skeletal malformations. Sodium chlorite, 20 or 50 mg/kg daily IP or gavaging with 200 mg/kg, caused vaginal and urethral bleeding.

Continuous logging of home cage movement, weekly monitoring of vertical activity in a novel <b>cage,</b> and <b>body</b> weight was recorded during four-week treatment period and for four weeks after discontinuation of the antidepressant; sucrose preference was evaluated at weekly intervals during drug administration. A novel object recognition memory test was performed in mice treated the antidepressants for two weeks.

Imipramine also impaired learning in the object recognition task, but citalopram diminished object exploration sufficiently to invalidate the test. Citalopram-treated animals demonstrated no changes in a sucrose test and had elevated body mass. Thus basic physiological and behavioral outcomes in naive mice were significantly altered by the chronic administration of imipramine and, to a lesser extent, citalopram. As altered variables are crucial for the evaluation of antidepressant-like effects in mice, our data suggest that, at commonly used doses, both drugs must be applied in mouse models of depression with caution...|$|R

They were allotted into three treatment groups in a completely randomized design of nine birds per treatment and three birds per replicate for each treatment groups. The enumeration of fleas on the body of birds was by the visual area count methodology. The percentage efficacy for treatment groups 1 and 2 were: 98. 08; 95. 53 while for the untreated control group 3, percentage efficacy was not applicable. However for the environment count in cages, th geometric mean number of fleas by the 35 day was 53. 28; 14. 46 and 1. 25 for treatment groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. This result showed that in treatment 1, the test group, mean flea count decreased from the body of the animals as the days progressed but increased on the test leaves placed within the cages. This suggest a possible migration of the fleas from the birds to the cages unlike in the flumethrin control group where flea count decreased in both the cages {{as well as in the}} body of birds and increased in both the <b>body</b> and <b>cages</b> in the untreated control groups.

All three expandable cages evaluated in this study are approved for clinical use, but little knowledge about their biomechanical properties exists. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human thoracolumbar spines (T 11 to L 3) (n= 32) were tested in flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending with a nondestructive stiffness method. Three-dimensional displacement was measured using an optical measurement system. All motion segments were tested intact. After L 1 corporectomy, cages were implanted and the following groups (n= 8 each) were tested: (1) meshed titanium cage (nonexpandable cage, DePuy Acromed), (2) X-tenz (expandable cage, DePuy Acromed), (3) Synex (expandable Cage, Synthes), and (4) VBR (expandable cage, Ulrich). Finally, posterior stabilization and posterior-anterior stabilization, both using USS (Synthes), and anterior plating (LCDCP, Synthes) was applied. The mean apparent stiffness values, ranges of motion, and neutral and elastic zones were calculated from the corresponding load/displacement curves. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the in vitro biomechanical properties of expandable and nonexpandable cages. Compared to the intact motion segment, isolated anterior stabilization using cages and anterior plating significantly decreased stiffness and increased range of motion in all directions. Additional posterior stabilization significantly increased stiffness and decreased range of motion in all directions compared to the intact motion segment. Combined anterior-posterior stabilization demonstrated the greatest stiffness results. CONCLUSION: Design variations of expandable <b>cages</b> for vertebral <b>body</b> replacement do not show any significant effect on the biomechanical results. There was no significant difference found, between the biomechanical properties of expandable and non-expandable cages. After corporectomy, isolated implantation of expandable cages plus anterior plating was not able to restore normal stability of the motion segment. As a consequence, isolated anterior stabilization using cages plus LCDCP should not be used for vertebral body replacement in the thoraco-lumbar spine. C. Khodadadyan-Klostermann, J. Schaefer, P. H.

40|$|Purpose: We report our {{experience}} and literature review concerning surgical treatment of neurological burst fractures {{of the fifth}} lumbar vertebra. Materials and methods: Nineteen patients with L 5 neurological burst fractures were consecutively enrolled; 6 patients had complete motor deficits, and 12 had sphincter dysfunction. We performed 18 posterior and one combined approaches. To avoid kyphosis, posterior internal fixation was achieved by positioning patients {{on the operating table}} with hips and knees fully extended. At the latest follow-up (mean 22 months, range 10 - 66), neurological recovery, canal remodeling and L 4 -S 1 angle were evaluated. Results: Vertebral body replacement was difficult, which therefore resulted in an oblique position of the <b>cage.</b> Vertebral <b>bodies</b> still remained deformed, even though fixation allowed for an acceptable profile (22 °, range 20 - 35). We observed three cases of paralysis, five complete, and three incomplete recoveries. In the remaining eight patients, sphincter impairment was the only finding. In 15 patients, pain was absent or occasional; in four individuals, it was continuous but not invalidating. Remodeling was visible by X-ray and/or CT, without significant secondary stenosis. Conclusions: The L 5 burst fractures are rare and mostly due to axial compression. Cauda and/or nerve root injuries are absolute indications for surgery. If an anterior approach is technically difficult, laminectomy can allow for decompression, and it can be easily combined with transpedicular screw fixation. Posterior instrumented fusion, also performed with the aim to restore sagittal profile, when associated with an accurate spinal canal exploration and decompression, may be looked at as an optimal treatment for neurological L 5 burst fractures. © Springer-Verlag 2012...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{stress is}} known to affect {{serotonin}} (5 HT) neurotransmission {{in the brain and}} to alter body temperature. The body temperature is controlled in part, by the medial preoptic area (mPOA) of the hypothalamus. To investigate the effect of chronic stress on 5 HT and how it affects body temperature regulation, we examined whether exposure to a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm produces long-term alterations in thermoregulatory function of the mPOA through decreased 5 HT neurotransmission. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 21 [*]d of CUS. Four days after the last stress exposure, basal body temperature in the home <b>cage</b> and <b>body</b> temperature in a cold room maintained at 10 [*]°C were recorded. The CUS rats had significantly higher subcutaneous basal body temperature at 13 : 00 [*]h compared to unstressed (NoStress) rats. Whereas the NoStress rats were able to significantly elevate body temperature from basal levels at 30 and 60 [*]min of exposure to the cold room, the CUS rats showed a hypothermic response to the cold. Treatment during CUS with metyrapone, a corticosterone synthesis inhibitor, blocked stress-induced decrease in body temperature in response to the cold challenge. CUS also decreased 5 HT transporter protein immunoreactivity in the mPOA and 5 HT 2 A/C agonist injection into the mPOA after CUS exposure caused stressed rats to exhibit a sensitized hyperthermic response to cold. These results indicate that the CUS induced changes to the 5 HTergic system alter mPOA function in thermoregulation. These findings help us to explain the mechanisms underlying chronic stress-induced disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome wherein long lasting thermoregulatory deficits are observed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCrystallographic and {{biochemical}} {{evidence suggests}} that the myosin working stroke that generates force in muscle is accompanied by the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi), but the order and relative speed of these transitions is not firmly established. To address this problem, the theory of A. F. Huxley and R. M. Simmons for the length-step response is averaged over elastic strains imposed by filament structure and extended to include a Pi-release transition. Models of this kind are applied to existing tension-recovery data from length steps at different phosphate concentrations, and from phosphate jumps upon release of <b>caged</b> phosphate. This <b>body</b> of data is simulated by the model in which the force-generating event is followed by Pi release. A version in which the Pi-release transition is slow provides a better fit than a version with rapid Pi release and a slow transition preceding force generation. If Pi is released before force generation, the predicted rate of slow recovery increases with the size of the step, which is not observed. Some implications for theories of muscle contraction are discussed...|$|R
