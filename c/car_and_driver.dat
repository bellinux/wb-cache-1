25|$|The revival was {{prompted}} by former GM North America Chairman Bob Lutz, who had the idea of importing a Holden Commodore-based vehicle after reading a <b>Car</b> <b>and</b> <b>Driver</b> review of the Holden Commodore SS, published circa 2000. <b>Car</b> <b>and</b> <b>Driver</b> praised {{the performance of the}} V8 powered, rear-wheel drive Holden Commodore SS, but noted that even though {{it was one of the}} best vehicles that GM offered at the time, it could not be purchased in the United States. The idea of importing a rear-wheel drive Holden as a GM North American performance offering gradually transformed into importing the Monaro. Lutz, as well as other GM executives, later drove a Holden Monaro while on a business trip in Australia, which convinced them that importing the car could be a profitable venture.|$|E
