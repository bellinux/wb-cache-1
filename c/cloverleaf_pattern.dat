Ulm’s command element was located between the 2d and 1st Platoons. As the company progressed, the jungle thinned somewhat and the primary obstacle to the Americans became the fallen trees and brush-deadfall-which was encountered at 50- to 75-meter intervals. The company employed patrols in a <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>pattern</b> as they. Two of these patterns had been completed by the time Company B progressed a little over one kilometer from its starting point.|$|E

50|$|In {{professional}} rodeo,the only women's {{event is}} barrel racing, {{which is the}} second most popular event in rodeo, after bull riding. Barrel racing is a timed event where horse and rider run a <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>pattern</b> around three preset barrels in the fastest time. The best times are obtained by running around each barrel as close as possible without touching it or knocking it over. There is a penalty of 5 seconds per barrel knocked over. Winning times average between 13 and 15 seconds per round.|$|E
5000|$|A Cloverleaf roll is an American type {{of bread}} roll {{consisting}} of three separate sections. It {{is named after}} the leaf of the clover plant, which has three lobes. They are made by placing three small balls of dough in the cups of a muffin tin; as the dough proofs and bakes, the <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>pattern</b> is formed. After baking, they are easily pulled apart. [...] "Cloverleaf roll" [...] refers to a shape, not a specific recipe: many recipes lend themselves to the cloverleaving process.|$|E

5000|$|In 1929 {{two events}} {{occurred}} which split rodeo down the geographic middle: superstar cowgirl Bonnie McCarroll {{died as a}} result of a bronc riding accident at Pendleton, Oregon. Her death caused many western rodeos to drop women’s contests. That same year, western rodeo producers formed the Rodeo Association of America (RAA) in an attempt to bring order to the chaotic sport. Largely as a result of McCarroll's death, the RAA was organized as an all-male entity. Despite pleas to do so, they refused to include any women’s contests. The RAA hoped to standardize rules and events, and eliminate the unscrupulous promoters who threatened the integrity of the sport. The RAA also set out to determine the [...] "true world's champion cowboys," [...] based on a system of points derived from money won in their sanctioned rodeos. This remains the basic system used today, but the dream of having only one [...] "world's champion" [...] would not be realized for decades. If not for the McCarroll tragedy, the rest of rodeo history might have been very different. It is unlikely there would ever have been a need for the WPRA, and barrel racing would probably not exist. Eastern producers did align themselves with Col. Johnson who ignored the RAA, and continued to include lucrative cowgirl contests at their rodeos. But that was short lived. [...] The cowboys hated Col Johnson, whom they felt distributed prize money unfairly, and mostly to himself, while treating them with disdain. In 1936, they went on strike at his Boston Garden rodeo, demanding a bigger share of the gate as prize money. Garden management finally forced Johnson to relent, and the jubilant cowboys formed the Cowboys Turtle Association (CTA), which is now the powerful PRCA. A defeated Johnson sold his company and retired, never again to be seen or heard from in the rodeo business. Like the RAA, the CTA sanctioned no women's contests. The original board of the CTA included some of the top cowboys in the business: Hugh Bennett, Everett Bowman, Bob Crosby, Herman Linder, and Pete Knight. The CTA and RAA had a long and contentious relationship, but the cowboys ultimately prevailed. Meantime, in 1931, promoters of the Stamford Cowboy Reunion invited all local ranches to send a young woman at least sixteen years old to compete in a Sponsor Contest designed [...] "to add femininity to the all-male rodeo." [...] The women were judged on who had the best horse, the most attractive outfit, and on horsemanship as they rode a <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>pattern</b> around three barrels. The contest was a huge success, and was widely copied. [...] In 1939, Johnson’s replacement at Madison Square Garden, Everett Colburn, invited a group of Texas Sponsor Girls to appear at his rodeo as a publicity stunt. A second group appeared at the 1940 rodeo. It featured Hollywood singing Cowboy Gene Autry, and the women rode while he sang, “Home on the Range.” It was a tradition that continued for decades. [...] Soon thereafter, Autry formed a rodeo company and took over not only Madison Square Garden, but also Boston Garden and most of the other major rodeos from coast-to-coast. One of his first actions was to discontinue the cowgirl bronc riding contest, which had been a highlight of the Madison Square Garden Rodeo since its inception in 1922. There was nothing left for cowgirls but the invitation-only sponsor girl event. Because of Gene Autry, real cowgirl contests disappeared from rodeos nationwide. Sponsor contests are the genesis of barrel racing, which is today the premier women’s rodeo event. [...] However, Autry’s influence was far more vast and long-lasting. His popularity was such that producers nationwide found they could no longer attract a crowd without a western singer to headline their rodeos. Still today, rodeo is the only professional sport in which the athletes are not the featured performers. Autry is also credited with keeping the sport alive during World War II, thanks to his business acumen, and the heavily patriotic themes that permeated his productions.|$|E

The study examines in vivo and in vitro astigmatic effects of venting incisions. Patients and methods: In vivo analysis examined eleven eyes of eleven {{patients who had}} received DSAEK with venting incisions. A chart review of the eleven eyes including assessment of pre and postoperative refraction and topography was performed. In vitro analysis examined three cadaver eyes which received topographic imaging followed by venting incisions at 4 mm, 6 mm, and 7 mm optical zones. Topographic imaging was then performed again after the incisions. Results: Postoperative topographies of eleven eyes demonstrated localized flattening at incision sites and <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>pattern</b> astigmatism. There {{was a significant difference}} in corneal irregularity measurement (P = 0. 03), but no significant difference in shape factor or change of topographic cylinder. The <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>pattern</b> was found in cadaver eyes with incisions placed at 4 mm and 6 mm optical zones but not at the 7 mm zone. Conclusion: DSAEK venting incisions can cause irregular corneal astigmatism that may affect visual outcomes. The authors recommend placement of venting incisions near the 7 mm optical zone.

40|$|Involution of thyroid {{hyperplasia}} was induced in C 3 H mice by discontinuing a goitrogenic treatment (low iodine diet {{supplemented with}} 0. 25 % propylthiouracil) and refeeding a normal iodine diet. Thyroid involution was studied by morphological, histochemical, autoradiographic, and stereological methods. The {{onset of the}} involution was characterized by an early accumulation of colloid, the presence of necrotic cells in the follicular lumina, {{and the appearance of}} homogeneous microcavities in the epithelial layers. The intraepithelial microcavities had the same morphological and functional properties as the follicular lumina. They were limited by a membrane covered with microvilli; polysaccharides and peroxidase activity were detected on their membranes, and 125 I-labeling was marked in their lumina. Thin serial sections demonstrated that the microlumens originated from the intercellular space; plasma membranes differentiated into junctional complexes, and a narrow lumen limited by a membrane covered with short microvilli was formed in the intercellular space between the junctions. Later on, the newly formed microlumens fused to form new follicles with a <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>pattern.</b> As a consequence of the folliculogenesis, the total number of follicles doubled after 8 days of involution. This increase in number was mainly due to the presence of a population of small follicles. The folliculogenesis was associated in the first 4 days of involution with an active cellular multiplication which compensated for the early cell necrosis and led to a doubled number of epithelial cells. The increase in the total number of follicles and cells could partially explain the persistence of a relatively high thyroid weight after involution of hyperplasia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mitochondrial genomes {{are widely}} {{utilized}} for phylogenetic and population genetic analyses among animals. In addition to sequence data the mitochondrial gene order and RNA secondary structure data {{are used in}} phylogenetic analyses. Arachnid phylogeny is still highly debated {{and there is a}} lack of sufficient sequence data for many taxa. Ricinulei (hooded tickspiders) are a morphologically distinct clade of arachnids with uncertain phylogenetic affinities. Results The first complete mitochondrial DNA genome of a member of the Ricinulei, Pseudocellus pearsei (Arachnida: Ricinulei) was sequenced using a PCR-based approach. The mitochondrial genome is a typical circular duplex DNA molecule with a size of 15, 099 bp, showing the complete set of genes usually present in bilaterian mitochondrial genomes. Five tRNA genes (trnW, trnY, trnN, trnL (CUN), trnV) show different relative positions compared to other Chelicerata (e. g. Limulus polyphemus, Ixodes spp.). We propose that two events led to this derived gene order: (1) a tandem duplication followed by random deletion and (2) an independent translocation of trnN. Most of the inferred tRNA secondary structures show the common <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>pattern</b> except tRNA-Glu where the TψC-arm is missing. In phylogenetic analyses (maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, Bayesian inference) using concatenated amino acid and nucleotide sequences of protein-coding genes the basal relationships of arachnid orders remain unresolved. Conclusion Phylogenetic analyses (ML, MP, BI) of arachnid mitochondrial genomes fail to resolve interordinal relationships of Arachnida and remain in a preliminary stage because there is still a lack of mitogenomic data from important taxa such as Opiliones and Pseudoscorpiones. Gene order varies considerably within Arachnida – only eight out of 23 species have retained the putative arthropod ground pattern. Some gene order changes are valuable characters in phylogenetic analysis of intraordinal relationships, e. g. in Acari. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Sequence {{data and}} other {{characters}} from mitochondrial genomes (gene translocations, secondary structure of RNA molecules) {{are useful in}} phylogenetic studies among metazoan animals from population to phylum level. Moreover, the comparison of complete mitochondrial sequences gives valuable information about the evolution of small genomes, e. g. about different mechanisms of gene translocation, gene duplication and gene loss, or concerning nucleotide frequency biases. The Peracarida (gammarids, isopods, etc.) comprise about 21, 000 species of crustaceans, living in many environments from deep sea floor to arid terrestrial habitats. Ligia oceanica is a terrestrial isopod living at rocky seashores of the european North Sea and Atlantic coastlines. Results The study reveals the first complete mitochondrial DNA sequence from a peracarid crustacean. The mitochondrial genome of Ligia oceanica is a circular double-stranded DNA molecule, with a size of 15, 289 bp. It shows several changes in mitochondrial gene order compared to other crustacean species. An overview about mitochondrial gene order of all crustacean taxa yet sequenced is also presented. The largest non-coding part (the putative mitochondrial control region) of the mitochondrial genome of Ligia oceanica is unexpectedly not AT-rich compared to {{the remainder of the}} genome. It bears two repeat regions (4 × 10 bp and 3 × 64 bp), and a GC-rich hairpin-like secondary structure. Some of the transfer RNAs show secondary structures which derive from the usual <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>pattern.</b> While some tRNA genes are putative targets for RNA editing, trnR could not be localized at all. Conclusion Gene order is not conserved among Peracarida, not even among isopods. The two isopod species Ligia oceanica and Idotea baltica show a similarly derived gene order, compared to the arthropod ground pattern and to the amphipod Parhyale hawaiiensis, suggesting that most of the translocation events were already present the last common ancestor of these isopods. Beyond that, the positions of three tRNA genes differ in the two isopod species. Strand bias in nucleotide frequency is reversed in both isopod species compared to other Malacostraca. This is probably due to a reversal of the replication origin, which is further supported {{by the fact that the}} hairpin structure typically found in the control region shows a reversed orientation in the isopod species, compared to other crustaceans. </p...|$|E
