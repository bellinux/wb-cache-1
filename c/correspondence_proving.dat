40|$|We {{consider}} N= 2 SU(2) gauge {{theories in}} four dimensions (pure or mass deformed) {{and discuss the}} properties of the simplest chiral observables {{in the presence of a}} generic Ω-deformation. We compute them by equivariant localization and analyze the structure of the exact instanton corrections to the classical chiral ring relations. We predict exact relations valid at all instanton number among the traces 〈Trφ^n〉, where φ is the scalar field in the gauge multiplet. In the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, such relations may be explained in terms of the available quantized Seiberg-Witten curves. Instead, the full two-parameter deformation enjoys novel features and the ring relations require non trivial additional derivative terms with respect to the modular parameter. Higher rank groups are briefly discussed emphasizing non-factorization of correlators due to the Ω-deformation. Finally, the structure of the deformed ring relations in the N= 2 ^ theory is analyzed from the point of view of the Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa <b>correspondence</b> <b>proving</b> consistency as well as some interesting universality properties.

40|$|Abstract. Let F be {{a locally}} compact field of {{positive}} characteristic. In his thesis, the second author used the Langlands-Shahidi method to define γ-factors for the symmetric square and exterior square {{representations of the}} dual group of GLn(F). We prove here that such γ-factors are characterized by local properties — including a multiplicativity property with respect to parabolic induction — and their role in global functional equations for L-functions. For this, we prove that a given cuspidal representation of GLn(F) is the component at some place of a global automorphic representation, the ramification of which is controlled at other places. In fact, we use an equivalent result for ℓ-adic Galois representations, due to O. Gabber and N. Katz, and transport it via the global Langlands <b>correspondence</b> <b>proved</b> by L. Lafforgue. 1.
