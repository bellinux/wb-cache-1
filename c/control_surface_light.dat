40|$|Because ofa steady {{increase}} in air traffic, the Department ofTransportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has instituted a number ofprograms {{that are designed}} to improve safety, reduce delays, and lessen workload intensity for air traffic controllers. The Airport Surface Traffic Automation (ASTA) program, which represents {{only a small portion of}} the total FAA effort, uses new technologies and advanced automation techniques to enhance the work of tower controllers, pilots, andvehicle operators. These new techniques are based in part on recent improvements in electronic surveillance, communications, and automation. Surveillance ofsurface traffic is improved through the use oftarget data from the new Airport Surface Detection Equipment radar (ASDE- 3), or equivalent surface radar, along with the extension ofthe Mode-S beacon system to the airport surface.

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of pCO 2, O 2 concentration, biological oxygen saturation (Delta O 2 /Ar) and N 2 saturation (Delta N 2) in Southern Ocean surface waters during austral summer, 2010 - 2011. Phytoplankton biomass varied strongly across distinct hydrographic zones, with high chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations in regions of frontal mixing and sea-ice melt. pCO 2 and Delta O 2 /Ar exhibited large spatial gradients (range 90 to 450 µatm and - 10 to 60 %, respectively) and co-varied strongly with Chla. However, {{the ratio of}} biological O 2 accumulation to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) drawdown was significantly lower than expected from photosynthetic stoichiometry, reflecting the differential time-scales of O 2 and CO 2 air-sea equilibration. We measured significant oceanic CO 2 uptake, with a mean air-sea flux (~ - 20 mmol m- 2 d- 1) that significantly exceeded regional climatological values. N 2 was mostly supersaturated in surface waters (mean Delta N 2 of + 2. 5 %), while physical processes resulted in both supersaturation and undersaturation of mixed layer O 2 (mean Delta O 2 phys = 2. 1 %). Box model calculations were able to reproduce much of the spatial variability of Delta N 2 and Delta O 2 phys along the cruise track, demonstrating significant effects of air-sea exchange processes (e. g. atmospheric pressure changes and bubble injection) and mixed layer entrainment on surface gas disequilibria. Net community production (NCP) derived from entrainment-corrected surface Delta O 2 /Ar data, ranged from ~ - 40 to > 300 mmol O 2 m- 2 d- 1 and showed good coherence with independent NCP estimates based on seasonal mixed layer DIC deficits.

As the desired position of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the trim tab acts as a servo tab. [...] Because the center of pressure of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> than the center of pressure of the <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> The position of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> on its axis will change until the torque from the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> and the trim surface balance each other.|$|R

The framework {{is based on a}} partitioned, time-marching approach in which the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> equations of motion are in-tegrated independently and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the two systems at pre-determined time intervals. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form. Equations of motion for both the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> are presented and a formulation for coupling the two systems is outlined which includes iterations within each aeroelastic time step.
