Obtained results reveal that by tuning the Si-environment in a-SiOxNy:H thin dielectric layers, deposited in plasma assisted process, a strong modification of the surface and volume charge conduction can be achieved.

A molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) in the range 500 - 600 and a permeability of 201 h(- 1) m(- 2) bar(- 1) was demonstrated. In order {{to provide information about}} the membrane charge, a detailed study was made of zeta potential and salt retention. Five types of salts were considered: NaCl, KCl, LiCl, Na 2 SO 4, CaCl 2. Experiments with mono-monovalent salts revealed the amphoteric character of the membrane material with an IEP around pH 6. The membrane showed a minimal salt retention at pH 6 and a fairly high retention at alkaline pH (R(NaCl) = 85 %, R(KCl) = 87 %, R(LiCl) = 90 %). For salts containing divalent ions, zeta potential measurements showed the effect of selective SO 42 - or Ca 2 + adsorption on the membrane <b>charge.</b> In <b>retention</b> experiments with these salts, the correlation between experimentally determined zeta potential and retention behaviour is demonstrated.

The skills shortage experienced by knowledge-intense organisations, such as engineering consultancies, is constraining them from meeting their business objectives as they struggle to attract and retain talented individuals. Given this context, this research focuses on understanding retention factors that are important to consulting engineers in an engineering contracting company in South Africa. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 engineers, three line managers and an HR practitioner in <b>charge</b> of <b>retention</b> in a multinational engineering company operating in South Africa to determine the important retention factors that affect engineers. The findings of the research suggest that engineers are retained by four distinct factors.

Additionally, a rankorder questionnaire was completed by the respondents to confirm the findings obtained in the interviews. The correlation between the two sets of results was high. The findings obtained from the HR representative and managers indicate that the people in <b>charge</b> of <b>retention</b> generally understood the factors that retained their engineering staff, but not fully.

In early Xenopus laevis embryos, PDGF-AA provides guidance cues for the migration of anterior mesendoderm cells as they move across a fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix. The long form of PDGF-A includes a positively <b>charged</b> carboxyl-terminal <b>retention</b> motif that can interact with the extracellular matrix and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). In this study we demonstrate that PDGF-AA binds directly to fibronectin and that this association is greatly enhanced by heparin. The PDGF-AA-fibronectin binding occurs across a broad range of pHs (5. 5 – 9), which is significant because the PDGF-guided migration of Xenopus mesendoderm cells occurs under basic extracellular conditions (pH 8. 4).

40|$|Since its {{inception}} {{a quarter of}} a century ago, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) has enabled studying contact potential differences (CPDs) on the nanometre scale. However, current KPFM investigations are limited by the bandwidth of its constituent electronic loops to the millisecond regime. To overcome this limitation, pump-probe-driven Kelvin probe force microscopy (pp-KPFM) is introduced that exploits the non-linear electric interaction between tip and sample. The time resolution surpasses the electronic bandwidth and is limited by the length of the probe pulse. In this work, probe pulse lengths as small as 4. 5 ns have been realized. These probe pulses can be synchronized to any kind of pump pulses. The first system investigated with pp-KPFM is an electrically-driven organic field-effect transistor (OFET). Here, charge carrier propagation in the OFET channel upon switching the drain-source voltage is directly observed and compared to simulations based on a transmission line model. Varying the charge carrier density reveals the impeding influence of Schottky barriers on the maximum switching frequency. The second system is an optically-modulated silicon homojunction. Here, the speed of surface photovoltage (SPV) build-up is accessed and compared to timeaveraged results. Due to slow trap states, the time-averaged method is found to lack comprehensiveness. In contrast, pp-KPFM exposes two intensity-dependent recombination times on the same timescale — high-level Shockley-Read-Hall recombination in the bulk and heat-dominated recombination in the surface layer — and a delay of the SPV decay with rising frequency, which is attributed to <b>charge</b> carrier <b>retention</b> at nanocrystals. The third system is a DCV 5 T-Me:C 60 bulk heterojunction. The SPV dynamics is probed and compared to measurements via open-circuit corrected transient charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage. Both methods reveal an exponential onset of the band bending reduction that is attributed to the charge carrier diffusion time in DCV 5 T-Me, and a double exponential decay, hinting at different recombination paths in the studied organic solar cell. The above-mentioned experiments demonstrate that pp-KPFM surpasses conventional KPFM when it comes to extracting dynamic device parameters such as <b>charge</b> carrier <b>retention</b> and recombination times, and prove that pp-KPFM is a versatile and reliable tool for studying electrodynamics on nanosurfaces...|$|R
