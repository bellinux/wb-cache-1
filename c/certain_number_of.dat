In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until a <b>certain</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates.

The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
