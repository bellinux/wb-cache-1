40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} history {{for the first}} cryogenic pressurized fuel tank <b>coverplates</b> is presented along with a synopsis of {{the development}} strategy and technologies which led to success on this program. <b>Coverplates</b> are the large access panels used to access launch vehicle fuel tanks. These structures incorporate all of the requirements for a pressure vessel {{as well as the}} added requirement to mount all of the miscellaneous access points required for a fuel management system. The first composite <b>coverplates</b> to meet the requirements for flight qualification were developed on the X- 33 program. The X- 33 composite <b>coverplates</b> went from an open requirement to successful finished flight hardware with multiple unique configurations, complete with verification testing, in less than eighteen months. Besides the rapid development schedule, these components introduced several new technologies previously unseen in cryogenic composites including solutions to cryogenic shrinkage, self-supporting sealing surfaces, and highly loaded composite bosses with precision sealing interfaces. These components were proven to seal liquid hydrogen at cryogenic temperatures under maximum loading and pressure conditions...|$|R
40|$|The high {{ballistic}} {{efficiency of}} non-oxide ceramics such as silicon carbide against kinetic energy (KE) threats is {{largely due to}} penetrator dwell (the erosion of the tip of the rod prior to ceramic target penetration). This paper considers the effect of target surface conditions on the dwell characteristics of silicon carbide. This has been investigated using a range of cover plate (CP) designs impacted at normal incidence with a 5 mmdiameter tungsten rod of 20 : 1 aspect ratio, over the velocity range 1100 m/s to 1900 m/s. Significant behavioural transition regions have been identified. In the velocity range 1330 - 1630 m/s the use of <b>coverplates</b> increases the Em significantly. There is a significant stepwise decrement in Em for targets with cover plates when impact velocities exceed a velocity of 1600 m/s. At velocities in excess of 1700 m/s there is a gradual decrease in Em with increasing velocity compared to targets without <b>coverplates</b> {{to the point where the}} use of <b>coverplates</b> is positively detrimental...|$|R

50|$|This {{designation}} {{was given}} to upgraded vehicles of the first batch of Leopard 2s, brought up to the standard of {{the second and third}} batches. This modernisation gradually replaced the original PZB 200 sights in the first batch with thermal sights for the EMES 15 as they became available. Furthermore, the upgrade included the fitting of filler openings and caps to the forward hull fuel tanks to allow separate refuelling, as well as the addition of a deflector plate for the periscope and a large <b>coverplate</b> to protect the existing NBC protection system. Finally, the tank was given new five metre towing cables with a different position. The programme began in 1984 and ended in 1987; the third, fourth and fifth batches were during this period produced with the same features.

Re-examining these results, experiments are carried out for both <b>coverplated</b> (sealed) and uncoverplated material layers and the measurements are analyzed using appropriate models. In this way, a more detailed analysis of the diffraction processes taking place for large-period gratings is provided. These results, combined with those in Part II, provide unambiguous evidence that the monomer diffusion rate in a commonly used acrylamide polyvinyl alcohol-based material is of the order of 10 − 10 cm 2 =s. This value closely agrees with the predictions of the nonlocal polymerization-driven diffusion model...|$|R

40|$|Dual {{fragment}} impacts {{were studied}} using the Eulerian hydrocode CTH. The {{purposes of the}} study were to gain insight into the physical phenomena underlying multiple fragment impacts, and to develop an equation that predicts critical fragment velocity, the velocity at which a fragment must travel to cause a detonation in a covered explosive, for dual fragment impacts. Identical steel fragments were used, and the target <b>coverplate</b> material, <b>coverplate</b> thickness, and the energetic material were held constant. The first analysis studied fragment separation in the dimension parallel to the target surface, with zero time separation. The next analysis was conducted varying the time between fragment impacts, with zero distance separation.

40|$|The report {{submitted}} by Rolls-Royce on “Pegasus Mk. 151 - 32 HPT blade cracking was examined. Study {{revealed that the}} evidences provided in support of forced fitment of the <b>coverplate</b> are consistent. The reason established {{for the failure of}} the blade tangs {{as a result of this}} forced fitment is logical. This has been supported by the observations made during dis-assembly of the HPTR disc and measurements on coating thickness. From the photographs, there appear to be strong factual evidences in justifying the conclusions drawn by Rolls-Royce. But, the failure mechanism established for fractured/cracked tangs does not appear logical. It is likely that the failure of the tangs was by fatigue either due to assembly stresses or due to generation of overload cracks during fitment of the <b>coverplate.</b> However, the conclusions drawn by Rolls-Royce remain valid even if the failure mechanism of the blade tangs was by fatigue.

40|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} dispersions {{of uranium}} alloys and silicides in an aluminum matrix {{have been developed}} by the RERTR program as {{a new generation of}} proliferation-resistant fuels. Testing is done with miniplate-type fuel plates to simulate standard fuel with cladding and matrix in plate-type configurations. In order to seal the dispersion fuel plates, a diffusion bond must exist between the aluminum <b>coverplates</b> surrounding the fuel meat. Four different variations in the standard method for roll-bonding 6061 aluminum were studied. They included mechanical cleaning, addition of a getter material, modifications to the standard chemical etching, and welding methods. Aluminum test pieces were subjected to a bend test after each rolling pass. Results, based on 400 samples, indicate that at least a 70 % reduction in thickness is required to produce a diffusion bond using the standard rollbonding method versus a 60 % reduction using the Type II method in which the assembly was welded 100 % and contained open 9 mm holes at frame corners...|$|R
40|$|The {{improvements}} made in diffusion models simulating phase image recording in photopolymers {{enable the}} optimization {{of a wide}} range of complex diffractive optical elements (DOEs), while the miniaturization of spatial light modulators makes it possible to generate both symmetric and non-symmetric DOEs. In addition, there is increasing interest in the design of new friendly recording materials. In this respect, photopolymers are a promising material due to their optical properties. In this paper, we show a procedure to record diffractive spherical lenses using a nontoxic optimized photopolymer. To achieve this goal, we followed three steps: first, the chemical optimization for DOE recording; second, the recording material characterization to be simulated by a three-dimensional diffusion model; and third, the evaluation of the <b>coverplating</b> for the conservation of the DOE.

40|$|In recent years, {{the optical}} storage and optical {{information}} processing technologies based on holographic and photonic techniques are suffering a huge improvement. On the other hand, Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs) based on LCoS microdisplays (PA-LCoS) open new possibilities to modulate the wavefront {{of a light}} beam. PA-LCoS are high resolution reflective devices which make possible the generation of Diffractive Optical Elements (DOE) with many important applications in photonics, communications of optical information processing, whenever it exists the possibility to have a recording material with the optimum characteristics for each application. Recently it is being explored the incorporation of photopolymers, initially used for holographic recording and data storage applications, to fabricate DOEs. Working with a setup based on a LCoS display as a master, we can store complex DOE, such as blazed gratings or diffractive lenses onto the photopolymers.

40|$|Photopolymers are optical {{recording}} materials appealing for many different {{applications such as}} holography, data storage, interconnectors, solar concentrations, or wave-guides fabrication. Recently the capacity of photopolymers to record diffractive optical elements (DOE’s) has been investigated. Different authors have reported proposes to record DOE like fork gratings, photonics structures, lenses, sinusoidal, blazed or fork gratings. In these experiments there are different experimental set-ups and different photopolymers. In this work due to the improvement in the spatial light modulation technology together with the photopolymer science we propose a recording experimental system of DOE using a Liquid Cristal based on Silicon (LCoS) display as a master to store complex DOE like cylindrical lenses. This technology permits us an accurate control of the phase and the amplitude of the recording beam, with a very small pixel size. The main advantage of this display is that permit us to modify the DOE automatically, we use the software of the LCoS to send the voltage to each pixel In this work we use a photopolymer composed by acrylamide (AA) as polymerizable monomer and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). We use a <b>coverplated</b> and index matched photopolymer to avoid {{the influence of the}} thickness variation on the transmitted light.

40|$|Leaf seals have {{previously}} been proposed as an improved filament seal for gas turbine engines. Recently, a {{phenomenon known as}} negative stiffness has been reported from experimental testing. Good understanding of this phenomenon is required to ensure stable interaction between the seal and the rotor. In negative stiffness the displacement of the seal or rotor into an eccentric position causes a resultant force, which, rather than restoring the rotor to a central position, acts to amplify its displacement. The seal consists of a pack of thin planar leaves arranged around the rotor, with coverplates {{on either side of}} the leaf pack, offset from its surface. It is notable that negative stiffness only occurs when certain geometric configurations of the coverplates are employed. This paper gives insight into the fluid phenomena that contribute to the negative stiffness effect through the creation of a general 2 -D model of the flow upstream of the leaf pack and between the leaves. These show that there is the capacity for the inertia force to be a significant contributor to the overall force acting on individual leaves depending on the <b>coverplate</b> configuration surrounding the leaf pack. The influence of a key parameter, <b>coverplate</b> height, is explored. Results from a test campaign with varying seal geometry are compared to the forces predicted by modeling to justify the proposed mechanisms for negative stiffness. The close agreement between the experimental and predicted data extends the previously published insight on negative stiffness to allow more general considerations for leaf seal design to be inferred...|$|E

The influence of the process pressure, rf and ICP power on the etch rate, surface morphology, and selectivity to the SiO 2 mask was investigated. Smooth anisotropic etch profiles and smooth etch surfaces were obtained {{for a wide range}} of process parameters. It was found that an ICP plasma source employed in the particular system used does not significantly effect the sheath ion density and cathode dc-bias, due to the remote location of it. However, the ICP source generates a large amount of reactive radicals, which facilitate fast and smooth etching of Al-containing layers...|$|E
40|$|Filament seals, such as {{brush seals}} and leaf seals, are {{investigated}} {{as a potential}} improved seal for gas turbine applications. As these seals operate {{in contact with the}} rotor, a good understanding of their stiffness is required in order to minimize seal wear and degradation. This paper demonstrates that the filament and complete seal stiffness is affected in comparable magnitudes by mechanical and aerodynamic forces. In certain cases, the aerodynamic forces can also lead to an overall negative seal stiffness which may affect stable seal operation. In negative stiffness, the displacement of the seal or rotor into an eccentric position causes a resultant force, which, rather than restoring the rotor to a central position, acts to amplify its displacement. Insight into the forces acting on the seal filaments is gained by investigating a leaf seal, which consists of a pack of thin planar leaves arranged around the rotor, with <b>coverplates</b> {{on either side of the}} leaf pack, offset from the pack surfaces. The leaf seal is chosen due to its geometry being more suitable for analysis compared to alternative filament seals such as the brush seal. Data from two experimental campaigns are presented which show a seal exhibiting negative stiffness and a seal exhibiting a stiffness reduction due to aerodynamic effects. An empirical model for the forces acting on leaf filaments is developed based on the experimental data, which allows separation of mechanical and aerodynamic forces. In addition a numerical model is developed to analyze the flow approaching the leaf pack and the interleaf flow, which gives an insight into the causes of the aerodynamic forces. Using the empirical and numerical models together, a full picture of the forces affecting leaf stiffness is created. Validation of the models is achieved by successfully predicting seal stiffness for a further data set across the full range of operating conditions. The understanding of aerodynamic forces and their impact on filament and seal stiffness allows for their consideration in leaf seal design. A qualitative assessment of how they may be used to improve seal operation in filament seals is given...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new microchannel design for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow that maximizes MHD pumping power. An electromagnetic channel (EMC), {{which has a}} rectangular cross-section and electrodes that run {{the full length of}} the channels, is the key design element. EMC fabrication on Si requires a two-mask process. ICP-RIE was employed to open rectangular grooves, and then an insulation layer and a seed layer for electroplating were sputtered into these grooves. Current densities for electroplating were adjusted to obtain as planar surface as possible. However, a polishing process needed to be developed to achieve the required planarity for subsequent bonding. Profilometry showed that the surface roughness after polishing was less than 200 nm, which was adequate for bonding. The conditions for the second ICP-RIE step, which opened a 10 µm wide channel between the electrodes, were adjusted to protect the electrodes. Finally, HF bonding was employed to bond the wafer to an O 211 glass <b>coverplate.</b> Bubble voltage threshold tests indicated 2. 2 V could be applied within the device at 960 Hz before electrolysis created gas bubbles. These voltages are high enough to give the required pumping velocities for open tubular liquid chromatography...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} phase optical recording mediums are photopolymers. In these materials, the use of an index matching component permits a better conservation of the stored information and, additionally, the study of the molecules migration and shrinkage/swelling phenomena separately. In general, the transmitted beam has the information of the thickness and refractive index modulation mixed. Therefore, we propose the introduction of a <b>coverplate</b> besides with an index matching liquid in order to improve the characterization and the conservation. The index matching techniques have been classically used for holographic recording materials. In principle, to obtain an accurate index matching we have to choose a liquid with refractive index very close to the mean of the polymer one. Then, when shrinkage takes place during recording, mainly due to the polymerization, the liquid will fill up the generated grooves minimizing the diffractive effects produced by the relief structure. In fact, in this work we study different index matching components for different photopolymers. The photopolymers analyzed in this work have a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a binder and two different main monomers: one has acrylamide and the other one sodium acrylate. We have recorded very low diffractive gratings and studied their conservation for different index matching components.

40|$|Cyclic {{tests with}} {{different}} loading protocols {{were carried out}} on full-strength welded ribstiffened and cover-plate beam-to-column joints to study their seismic performance. Composite columns were used to increase the robustness of the applied strong column/weak beam design concept. Hybrid-steel approach for moment-resisting and braced frames was implemented with high strength steel used for columns as non-dissipative elastic members and mild carbon steel for beams acting as dissipative members. Additional parameter {{of the study was}} axial force of high level compression in the column. All rib-stiffened and <b>coverplate</b> beam-to-column joints fulfilled the objective of the applied capacity design concept: the whole inelastic action was transferred away {{from the face of the}} beam-to-column connection into the beam section behind the stiffened region. All the joints subjected to variable amplitude loading met prequalification requirements from EN 1998 - 1 and ANSI/AISC 341 - 10. The test results with additional experimental data from literature were used to verify numerical model, which was employed for further parametric studies on both types of stiffened connection subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. An important part of the study was also dedicated to the development of damage curve for low-cycle fatigue resistance evaluation of joints. Numerical parametric study was performed to support the proposed joint detailing and design guidelines for the two stiffened joint types against possibly adverse beam member size effects within the selected range of practically applicable I and H beam profiles typically used in Europe. All designed stiffened beam-to-column joints developed full plastic capacity of the connected beam under monotonic and cyclic loading.

40|$|Beams having high {{flexural}} stiffnesses can {{be utilized}} {{to reduce the}} building drifts to conform within the code requirements. However the large flexural capacities of the beam will increase strength demand of the connection. To avoid the plastic hinges at the connections, the beam-column connections should be designed based on the maximum possible beam flexural strength which is about (1. 1 - 1. 2) RyMp. If {{the top and bottom}} flanges of the beam are welded directly to the column flange using complete penetration groove welds which have the weld tensile capacity of 0. 9 FyA, the tensile force in the beam flange is potentially greater than the weld tensile capacity so that some reinforcements, such as cover plates or side plates, are required. When RBS connection is chosen, the flange cut near the ends of the beam will reduce Mp and the tensile force in the beam flange will be reduced as well so that the need for coverplates can be eliminated. The span to depth ratio of a deep beam in steel moment resisting frame generally is not large, the interaction between shear and bending moment should be checked {{in the design of the}} beam and the connection. In this paper the design of RBS connection for deep beam to deep column special steel moment resisting frames is doneusing a different approach than the one in the AISC 341 - 05. Experimental and analytical studies have shown that Euler-Bernoulli hypothesis can not be applied at the connection region. Therefore the truss-analogy model will be used to express the flow of the forces at the connection, starting from the face of the column to the centroid of the plastic hinge. Truss-analogy model developed by Arlekar and Murty will be used to design the beam-column connection, <b>coverplate</b> in this model will be eliminated but the vertical rib is kept. Combination of deep beam and deep column in steel moment resisting frames will make better drift control, economical connection is realized through the RBS connection...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to re-examine the Charpy V-Notch (CVN) base metal requirements and inspection requirements for steel bridges that contain at least one Fracture Critical Member (FCM). FCMs are defined as members that will cause global failure of the bridge if the FCM fails. Currently FCMs are required by federal law to be inspected with a hands on inspection every two years, although a waiver may be obtained in {{a limited amount of}} cases. Hands on inspections are conducted using only the human eye, where the distance between the human eye and the member is no greater than one an arm length. The flaw detection capabilities of the hands on inspection program are not known at this time. Future means of quantifying the probability of detecting a crack are discussed. This report will review the history of the Charpy V-Notch (CVN) test {{and the use of the}} CVN test in steel bridge material requirements. ^ Damage tolerant design is proposed as an alternative to current U. S. bridge material selection and inspection practice. A deterministic procedure is proposed instead of the reliability based procedures that have been proposed previously in the literature. This is because the distributions of the relevant variables are not known for steel bridges and inspectors. The Master Curve method, standard crack assessment procedures, and the finite element solver ABAQUS were used to investigate the critical crack size at a transverse stiffener weld toe. The lack of consistent fracture resistance among the various steel grades is shown. The transverse stiffener detail was chosen because it will most likely be the most fatigue prone detail in most new bridges. A new CVN requirement is proposed to eliminate the discrepancy among the grades. It is recommended that other welded details be investigated in the future. ^ There are many FCMs that have geometries that have not been previously investigated using modern procedures. A procedure for incorporating three dimensional finite element modeling and the standard crack assessment guides is proposed. The procedure is illustrated using a <b>coverplate</b> detail. Future analytical and experimental research needs are outlined. ...|$|E
