5|$|MSFU crews signed ship's {{articles}} as civilian {{crew members}} {{under the authority}} of the civilian ship's master. The ship's chief engineer became responsible for the <b>catapult,</b> and the first mate acted as <b>Catapult</b> Duty Officer (CDO), responsible for firing the <b>catapult</b> when directed. The single Hurricane fighter was launched only when enemy aircraft were sighted and agreement was reached via hand and flag signals between the pilot, CDO, and ship's master.|$|E
5|$|Both ships carried one {{aircraft}} <b>catapult</b> {{for a pair}} of Heinkel He 60 biplane reconnaissance float planes. They were {{equipped with}} a crane to retrieve the aircraft after landing. The He 60s were later replaced by the monoplane Arado Ar 196 by 1939. Leipzigs <b>catapult</b> was located between the funnel and the forward superstructure, while Nürnbergs was placed aft of the funnel.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{initially}} fitted with flying-off platforms mounted {{on top of}} 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which Fairey Flycatchers could launch. During her 1929–31 refit, the platform was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding <b>catapult</b> was installed on her quarterdeck, along with a crane to recover a seaplane. She embarked a Fairey IIIF from No. 444 Flight of the Royal Air Force. During the 1932 West Indies cruise, the <b>catapult</b> proved {{to be difficult to}} operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently awash in bad weather. The <b>catapult</b> and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.|$|E
50|$|Several early {{aircraft}} carriers included flying-off platforms for launching from the hangar deck while {{the flight deck}} was being used for landings, but those platforms proved impractical. Hangar deck <b>catapults</b> were more successful, but six <b>catapults</b> {{would be required to}} match the deck roll launch rate from a single flight deck, and no aircraft carrier was willing to sacrifice the aircraft storage capacity and defensive gun positions which would have been lost to install that number of <b>catapults.</b> The few <b>catapults</b> required to launch heavy aircraft were typically installed on the flight deck.|$|R
50|$|The {{size and}} {{manpower}} requirements of steam <b>catapults</b> place limits on their capabilities. A newer {{approach is the}} Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS). Electromagnetic <b>catapults</b> place less stress on the aircraft and offer more control during the launch by allowing gradual and continual acceleration. Electromagnetic <b>catapults</b> are also expected to require significantly less maintenance {{through the use of}} solid state components.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>catapults</b> allows an {{aircraft}} carrier to launch large fixed-wing aircraft. For example, the U.S. Navy launches its E-2 Hawkeye AEW aircraft and C-2A Greyhound cargo aircraft with <b>catapults.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1950, Perseus {{was fitted}} with an {{experimental}} steam <b>catapult.</b> The <b>catapult</b> {{was placed on}} top of the carrier's existing flight deck and the deckhouse to port of the island was removed to accommodate it. Some 1,560 launches were made by the <b>catapult,</b> beginning with over 1,000 wheeled dead-loads, of gradually increasing weight, and moving on to with unmanned aircraft with their wings truncated to reduce their ability to glide. The final tests were made by manned aircraft of every type flown by the Fleet Air Arm. After this, the ship arrived in Philadelphia on 14 January 1952 to demonstrate the <b>catapult</b> to the United States Navy. Between them, some 127 launches of manned aircraft were made by the British and the Americans. Perseus arrived back at Portsmouth on 21 March and had the <b>catapult</b> removed. All of her remaining maintenance equipment was removed and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier.|$|E
5|$|The Project 26 ships landed their <b>catapult</b> during 1941 to {{make room}} for more AA guns, as did Molotov in 1942. A ZK-1a <b>catapult</b> was {{installed}} aboard Molotov in 1943, and she conducted successful experiments with a catapult-launched Supermarine Spitfire fighter. The Project 26bis2 ships did not receive a <b>catapult</b> until {{after the end of the}} war, when a ZK-2b was fitted. The catapults, however, were removed from all ships by 1947.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with flying-off {{platforms}} {{mounted on the}} roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. In 1932 the platforms {{were removed from the}} turrets and a trainable <b>catapult</b> was installed on her quarterdeck, along with a crane to recover a seaplane. The <b>catapult</b> and crane were removed by March 1937.|$|E
50|$|Because of this mutual interoperability, American {{aircraft}} are also {{capable of being}} <b>catapulted</b> from and landing on the Charles De Gaulle, and conversely, French naval aircraft can use the US Navy carriers' <b>catapults.</b>|$|R
25|$|Compared {{to steam}} <b>catapults,</b> EMALS {{can control the}} launch {{performance}} with greater precision, allowing it to launch more kinds of aircraft, from heavy fighter jets to light unmanned aircraft. With up to 121 megajoules available, {{each one of the}} four disk alternators in the EMALS system can deliver 29 percent more energy than a steam <b>catapult's</b> approximately 95 MJ. The EMALS will also be more efficient than the 5% efficiency of steam <b>catapults.</b>|$|R
50|$|Castles and {{fortified}} walled {{cities were}} common {{during this period}} and <b>catapults</b> were used as siege weapons against them. As well as their use in attempts to breach walls, incendiary missiles, or diseased carcasses or garbage could be <b>catapulted</b> over the walls.|$|R

5|$|The Kronshtadt-class {{ships were}} {{provided}} with two KOR-2 flying boats which would be launched by the <b>catapult</b> mounted between the funnels.|$|E
50|$|The Romans {{started to}} use <b>catapults</b> as arms for their wars against Syracuse, Macedon, Sparta and Aetolia (3rd and 2nd centuries BC). The Roman machine {{known as an}} arcuballista was similar to a large crossbow. Later the Romans used ballista <b>catapults</b> on their warships.|$|R
50|$|The last {{large scale}} {{military}} use of <b>catapults</b> {{was during the}} trench warfare of World War I. During {{the early stages of}} the war, <b>catapults</b> were used to throw hand grenades across no man's land into enemy trenches. They were eventually replaced by small mortars.|$|R
50|$|In addition, it {{was planned}} that Shinshū Maru should carry {{aircraft}} in a hangar within her voluminous superstructure. The aircraft {{would have been}} launched by two <b>catapults</b> to support amphibious assaults, but the <b>catapults</b> were removed before completion and the ship never carried any operational planes.|$|R
5|$|Ark Royal was recommissioned in 1930 {{to serve}} as a {{training}} ship, for seaplane pilots and to evaluate aircraft <b>catapult</b> operations and techniques. She was renamed HMS Pegasus in 1934, freeing the name for the aircraft carrier ordered that year, and continued {{to serve as}} a training ship until the beginning of the Second World War in September 1939. Assigned to the Home Fleet {{at the beginning of the}} war, she took on tasks as an aircraft transport, in addition to her training duties, until she was modified to serve as the prototype fighter <b>catapult</b> ship in late 1940. This type of ship was intended to defend convoys against attacks by German long-range maritime patrol bombers by launching fighters via their <b>catapult</b> to provide air cover for the convoy. Pegasus served in this role until mid-1941 when she reverted to her previous duties as a training ship. This lasted until early 1944 when she became a barracks ship. The ship was sold in late 1946 and her conversion into a merchant ship began the following year. However, the owner ran out of money during the process and Anita I, as she had been renamed, was seized by her creditors in 1949 and sold for scrap. She was not broken up until late 1950.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years the ship was either in reserve or used as a troop transport, until she began {{reconversion}} into a cruiser at Chatham Dockyard on 1 March 1923. The flight decks were removed and she was mostly restored to her designed configuration, although her 3-inch AA guns were replaced by three QF 4 inch Mk V AA guns. Two of these were mounted on a platform between the aft funnel and the mainmast and the third gun was positioned on the quarterdeck between the two 7.5-inch guns. The major exception was that No. 2 7.5-inch gun was not installed and she retained her hangar in the forward superstructure. The two derricks that serviced the hangar were replaced by a single crane on the starboard side of the hangar roof. No. 2's position was occupied by a prototype compressed-air Carey aircraft <b>catapult,</b> the first British cruiser to mount a <b>catapult.</b> Vindictive used {{it for the first time}} on 3 October when she launched a Fairey IIID floatplane. She also conducted <b>catapult</b> trials on float-equipped Fairey Flycatcher fighters.|$|E
5|$|Fusō {{was briefly}} fitted with an {{aircraft}} flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1924. During {{the first phase}} of her first modernization, a <b>catapult</b> was fitted on the roof of Turret No. 3 and the ship was equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. Fusōs ability to operate her aircraft was greatly improved during the second phase of her second modernization in 1940–41 when the aircraft handling equipment was moved to the stern and a new <b>catapult</b> was installed. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns from 1942 on.|$|E

500|$|The Kirovs were {{designed}} to carry two aircraft, but German <b>catapults</b> had to be imported. Two Heinkel K-12 <b>catapults</b> were bought in 1937 for Kirov and Voroshilov. They could traverse 360° and launch an aircraft weighing [...] at a speed of , although no suitable aircraft were in service until the KOR-1 seaplane entered service in September 1939. They proved to be unsuitable for rough-weather landings and were disembarked when Operation Barbarossa began. Gorky and Molotov mounted Soviet-built ZK-1 <b>catapults</b> of roughly comparable performance, but were destined never to use them for lack of suitable aircraft.|$|R

5|$|In 1951, Unicorn was {{considered}} for modernization {{to make her}} capable of operating modern, heavier jet aircraft. This would have required fitting of a steam <b>catapult,</b> reinforcing her flight deck to handle heavier aircraft and moving and enlarging her forward lift {{to make room for}} the new <b>catapult</b> and larger aircraft. A new crane would also have been necessary to handle the heavier aircraft. The Director of Naval Construction proposed to combine both of her hangars into a single one to eliminate problems with hangar height, but this was rejected because of the excessive cost. This reconstruction would have begun in July 1954, but the entire scheme was cancelled in November 1952 because providing existing carriers with angled flight decks was much more important.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, {{all three}} members of the class were {{modified}} to carry a pair of float planes for reconnaissance. They were equipped with an aircraft <b>catapult</b> to launch the planes and cranes to recover them after they landed in the water. The ships initially carried two Heinkel He 60 biplane float planes, replaced later in the decade with two Arado Ar 196 monoplane float planes. Only one aircraft could be stored on the <b>catapult</b> at a time; the second plane had to be disassembled and placed in storage, and the ships did not have a hangar to store it in.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{announced}} that the operational carrier would have <b>catapult</b> and arrestor gear (CATOBAR) installed to accommodate the carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter rather than the short-take off and vertical-landing version.|$|E

5|$|Mutsu had an {{additional}} boom {{added to the}} mainmast in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y floatplane recently assigned to the ship. In 1933 a <b>catapult</b> was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3, and a collapsible crane was installed in a port-side sponson the following year; the ship was equipped to operate two or three seaplanes, although no hangar was provided. The ship was operating Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. A more powerful <b>catapult</b> was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the single Kawanishi E7K, added in 1939–40. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.|$|E
5|$|Perseus was {{completed}} in 1945, {{after the end of}} World War II, and she made a trip to Australia late in the year, just in time to help return men, aircraft and equipment. Upon her return to the UK in early 1946, Perseus was placed in reserve. The ship was recommissioned in 1950 to serve as the trials ship for the steam <b>catapult</b> then under development. Over 1600 test launches were conducted before the <b>catapult</b> was removed in 1952 and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier to transport aircraft, troops and equipment overseas. She was reduced to reserve again in 1954 and sold for scrap in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The P-3 was powered {{with the}} same DB601A-1 engines. The {{aircraft}} was also designed to take off with a land <b>catapult</b> (KL-12). A towing hook {{was added to the}} fuselage under the cockpit for the cable. Just eight examples were produced, all without bomb equipment.|$|E
