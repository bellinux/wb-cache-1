After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens.

30|$|Fragmentation of the specialty, in contrast, {{represents}} a separation or break-away of {{some parts of}} the imaging services from the original organizational entity, i.e., the department of radiology. The reasons for fragmentation {{can be explained by the}} dramatic expansion of the domain of activity of radiologists. No single person can master all the available knowledge. The response to this development has been a gradual increase in the degree of subspecialization of radiologists. Initially subspecialization occurred based on different modalities in the 1970 s and 1980 s, while later a organ-system-based subspecialization became much more appropriate and was gradually adopted both in the structure of radiological services as well as in the training curriculum [5]. Subspecialization is a clear need for radiologists in large academic and community hospitals and increasingly even in private practices. However, in most of cases subspecialty sections remain within the overarching department of radiology with the benefit of shared facilities, efficient use of resources, and <b>common</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R

40|$|Hierarchies {{are one of}} {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>structures</b> {{observed}} in multi-agent systems. In this paper we study vertical specialization as a reason for hierarchical structures. In vertically specialized systems, more highly skilled agents are also more costly. By using less capable agents to initially process tasks and forwarding only exceptional tasks to more capable agents, such systems may be able to economize on the number of highly capable agents. The result is a hierarchical structure with least capable agents at the bottom. However, such a structure increases the delay in completing some tasks, because they must pass through multiple levels of control. Thus, vertical specialization presents a tradeoff between economizing on skilled agents and increasing task completion time. We find that for a wide range of settings, vertical specialization induces an optimal hierarchy of height at most three. This suggests that a multi-agent system designer interested in exploiting vertical specialization needs to use at most three levels of specialization in order to reap most of the benefits...|$|R
40|$|Background: Innovation is an {{important}} aspect of business today. It is important for companies to be innovative in order to stay competitive with their competitors. During the last couple of decades, technology has become more and more common both in our daily life, as well as in businesses. This has lead to an increase in technology implementation, especially within the service industry, where customers now can use self-service technologies in order to receive the service on their own. However, a lack of self-service technologies was discovered within the fast food industry. Since these types of innovations increased the service efficiency and decreased the waiting-time for customers, the authors believed that this would be very interesting for local managers within the fast food industry. Therefore, the authors began to investigate how much power local management has over these types of new innovations. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to explore how local management affects the innovation process, within fast food restaurant chains. Method: By conducting a cross-case study with the two fast food companies Subway and Max, the authors interviewed local fast food managers in order to explore the effect local management have on the innovation process. These two cases were selected since Subway fully consists of franchisees, while Max is almost completely company owned. Therefore, the two most <b>common</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>structures</b> within the fast food industry are included which will provide a more fair view of the industry. Conclusion: The effect of the innovation process has a positive relationship with the amount of power distributed to the local management. However, these areas differ depending on the <b>organizational</b> <b>structure,</b> with franchisees achieving their highest amount of power within medium-sized innovations and managers in company-owned outlets maintain their highest amount of power within minor innovations. Even though the overall communication was perceived as satisfying and efficient, large opportunities for improvements occur. By implementing more horizontal communication within the local management, it is in the belief of the authors that the entire internal communication will benefit. Especially this would benefit the franchise system where an increased local communication and collaboration would lead to more efficient communication throughout the entire organization...|$|R

The human, financial, and informational resources that go into state tobacco control programs are documented, and the outcomes of these programs have been studied in terms of health and health behavior. However, {{little is known about the}} organizational infrastructure that transforms the human, financial, and informational resources into positive health outcomes. This study examined the inter-organizational relationships among key partner agencies in eight state tobacco control programs. The state programs varied in terms of funding level, funding stability, and region of the country. Using a network analytic approach we asked an average of 14 agencies in each state program about their contacts and partnerships with the other key tobacco control agencies in their state program. Using network visualization and statistics we determined that the state networks shared some common features such as a highly central lead agency, but also had differences in network structure in terms of density and centralization. Using blockmodeling we found that, despite differences in state and program characteristics, there was a <b>common</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>structure</b> among the eight state programs.

40|$|This study explores how {{strategic}} organizational change affects safety as {{an outcome}} variable {{in a high}} reliability organization (HRO). High reliability organizations are defined as organizations operating in high-risk industries that achieve exceptionally high levels of safety performance. Based {{on the assumption that}} HROs achieve these high levels of safety performance through stable safety processes produced by <b>common</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>structures</b> such as: learning environments, highly regulated activities, redundancy, local ownership of tasks, and strong supporting safety cultures, I will study how potentially destabilizing deliberate change processes affect safety as an outcome, over time, in a live single longitudinal case study. This study sets out to answer two questions: (1) How does the interaction between leadership choices and actions, and organizational culture type affect attitudes towards change in a high reliability organization? (2) How do the relationships between leadership choices and actions during strategic change, safety climate in place, and employee attitudes toward change, affect safety as an outcome variable? A deliberate strategic change initiative known as corporatization is studied over a three year period in the Norwegian air navigation services provider - Avinor - with particular focus upon four embedded units that experience three different phases of a common deliberate change process. The findings indicate that the individuals at each embedded unit experience the change process differently regarding both the local leadership and the safety climate in place with varying effects on attitudes and perceptions. However, the findings also show that the attitudes and perceptions toward the top leadership, and the top leadership’s commitment to safety, in particular, are consistently reduced during the time period studied and do not vary across the embedded units. This study focuses on how a mismatch between organizational culture type and strategic change type affects change implementation success. Furthermore, the study shows how this mismatch affects individual attitudes and perceptions toward change, and how these, in turn, affect perceptions of safety for front-line employees directly responsible for safety outcomes. It is argued that different organizational culture types demand specific change types to ensure success. It is also argued that a mismatch between culture and change types can lead to a loss of trust in the leadership and resistance to change that can, in the worst case, lead to the collapse of the change process. Propositions on how changes in perceptions and attitudes affect safety are presented in a structural equation model, and show that individual perceptions of the leadership’s commitment to safety and safety climate have strong positive causal relationships to both attitudes toward change and perceptions of safety. The findings indicate that individual perceptions of the leadership’s commitment to safety have important implications to both change success and safety as an outcome...|$|R

40|$|The subject {{knowledge}} management {{is of great}} relevance in knowledge intensive organizations such as consulting firms or high-tech businesses, since their business model builds on {{the knowledge of the}} em- ployees. Knowledge management is a broad subject that includes, among others, organizational theory, cognitive science, and IT. The literature study has its foundation in knowledge and how both tacit and explicit knowledge can be transferred between individuals or within an organization. A <b>common</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>structure</b> among consulting firms is the project based organization, therefore challenges related to {{knowledge management}} within such organizations, is studied. Different strategies for knowledge management are presented and various methods for knowledge transfer are categorized and assessed. An in depth look into knowledge management in consulting firms end the literature study partnered with a review of affecting factors and tools involved in knowledge exchange and distribution of best practices. The purpose is to create a framework with which to analyze how a case company, a technological consulting firm, works with knowledge exchange. The research questions focus on factors that affect knowledge exchange, what fo- rums and tools drive knowledge exchange, and how best practices are collected and implemented. Barriers to functional knowledge exchange that have been encountered include that many of the employed consultants are permanently stationed with customers in their projects, rendering contact with colleagues from the home office sparse. This, combined with a lack of management control and structure in the case of knowledge, affects and limits the knowledge exchange. Tools and forums for knowledge exchange were identified and show how knowledge is spread in the or- ganization. A majority of the knowledge exchange is found to take place through person-to-person inter- action through mentorship, working in projects, and through contacts that to not constitute a part of con- scious knowledge management. The organization employs a business system where templates and tools are available to the consultants along with documentation from prior projects and reference projects. The management view is that this system is to function as an important platform for learning and knowledge exchange, in essence a knowledge management system, but the system is burdened by technical issues that lead consultants to circumnavigate the system by using templates and tools provided by colleagues instead of the ones officially provided by the system. No structures for continuous development of best practices were identified, although specific projects to update routines and methods occur from time to time on an ad-hoc basis. That lack of structures and routines track back to the handling of consultants’ suggestions for improvements and ideas, where con- sultants experience a lack of directives, support and understanding of how their suggestions and ideas were supposed to be handled in the organization. A conclusion regarding knowledge management in a technical consulting firm is hence that organizational and cultural factors {{have a significant impact on}} the exchange of knowledge. A shortage of opportunities for contact and knowledge exchange with colleagues combined with lacking management control affects the exchange negatively, but the company also displays several success factors that research point out important in order to build a functioning knowledge management system. These include an openness and willingness to share amongst colleagues, in combination with an understanding of the importance of knowledge exchange in the organization that transcends organizational hierarchy. ...|$|E
