40|$|PSR B 1821 - 24 is {{a solitary}} {{millisecond}} pulsar (MSP) which radiates multi-wavelength pulsed photons. It has complex radio, X-ray and γ-ray pulse profiles with distinct peak phase-separations that challenge the traditional caustic emission models. Using the single-pole annular gap model with suitable magnetic inclination angle (α= 40 ^∘) and viewing angle (ζ= 75 ^∘), {{we managed to}} reproduce its pulse profiles of three wavebands. It is found that the middle radio peak is originated from the <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> region at high altitudes, {{and the other two}} radio peaks are originated from the annular gap region at relatively low altitudes. Two peaks of both X-ray and γ-ray wavebands are fundamentally originated from annular gap region, while the γ-ray emission generated from the <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> region contributes somewhat to the first γ-ray peak. Precisely reproducing the multi-wavelength pulse profiles of PSR B 1821 - 24 enables us to understand emission regions of distinct wavebands and justify pulsar emission models.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the three-dimensional (3 D) annular gap model with reasonable parameters (the magnetic inclination angle α = 45 deg and the view angle ζ = 63 deg), we first use the latest hight energy data to self-consistently calculate radio, X-ray, gamma-ray and TeV (MAGIC and VERITAS) light curves, phase-averaged spectrum and phase-resolved spectra for the Crab pulsar. It is found that the acceleration electric field and potential in the annular gap and <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> are huge enough in the several tens of neutron star radii. The pulsed emission of radio, X-ray, gamma-ray and TeV are mainly generated from the emission of primary particles or secondary particles with different emission mechanisms in the nearly similar region of the annular gap located in the only one magnetic pole, which leads to the nearly "phase-aligned" multi-wavelength light curves. The emission of peak 1 (P 1) and peak 2 (P 2) is originated from the annular gap region near the null charge surface, while the emission of bridge is mainly originated from the <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> region. The phase-averaged spectrum and phase-resolved spectra of the Crab pulsar from soft X-ray to TeV band are produced by four components: synchrotron radiation from CR-induced and ICS-induced pairs dominates the X-ray band to soft gamma-ray band (100 eV to 10 MeV); curvature radiation and synchrotron radiation from the primary particles mainly contribute to gamma-ray band (10 MeV to ∼ 20 GeV); ICS from the pairs significantly contributes to the TeV gamma-ray band (∼ 20 GeV to 400 GeV). The multi-wavelength pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar has been well modeled with the annular gap and <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> model. To distinguish our single magnetic pole model from two-pole models, the convincing values of the magnetic inclination angle and the viewing angle will play a key role.

40|$|The Vela pulsar {{represents}} a distinct group of γ-ray pulsars. Fermi γ-ray observations reveal {{that it has}} two sharp peaks (P 1 and P 2) in the light curve with a phase separation of 0. 42 and a third peak (P 3) in the bridge. The location and intensity of P 3 are energy-dependent. We use the 3 D magnetospheric model for the annular gap and <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> to simulate the γ-ray light curves, phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra. We found that the acceleration electric field along a field line in the annular gap region decreases with heights. The emission at high energy GeV band is originated from the curvature radiation of accelerated primary particles, while the synchrotron radiation from secondary particles have some contributions to low energy γ-ray band (0. 1 - 0. 3 GeV). The γ-ray light curve peaks P 1 and P 2 are generated in the annular gap region near the altitude of null charge surface, whereas P 3 and the bridge emission is generated in the <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> region. The intensity and location of P 3 at different energy bands depend on the emission altitudes. The radio emission from the Vela pulsar should be generated in a high-altitude narrow regions of the annular gap, {{which leads to a}} radio phase lag of 0. 13 prior to the first γ-ray peak.

40|$|A new {{drifting}} pulsar, PSR J 0815 + 09, {{was discovered}} in the Arecibo driftscan searches (McLaughlin et al. 2004). An intriguing feature of this source is that within the four pulse components in the integrated pulse profile, the subpulse drifting direction in the two leading components is opposite from that in the two trailing components. In view that the leading theoretical model (Ruderman & Sutherland 1975) for pulsar sub-pulse drifting can only interpret one-direction sub-pulse drifting, the observed bi-drifting phenomenon from PSR J 0815 + 09 poses a great challenge to the pulsar theory. The inner annular gap (IAG), {{a new type of}} inner particle accelerator, was recently proposed to explain both γ-ray and radio emission from pulsars (Qiao et al. 2004). Here we show that the coexistence of the IAG and the conventional inner <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> (ICG) offers a natural interpretation to the bi-drifting phenomenon.

40|$|Overhead {{high voltage}} power line (HVPL) online {{monitoring}} equipment is playing an increasingly important role in smart grids, but the power supply is an obstacle to such systems’ stable and safe operation, so in this work a hybrid wireless power supply system, integrated with inductive energy harvesting and wireless power transmitting, is proposed. The energy harvesting device extracts energy from the HVPL and transfers that from the power line to monitoring equipment on transmission towers by transmitting and receiving coils, which are in a magnetically coupled resonant configuration. In this paper, the optimization design of online energy harvesting devices is analyzed emphatically by taking both HVPL insulation distance and wireless power supply efficiency into account. It is found that essential parameters contributing to more extracted energy include large core inner radius, core radial thickness, core height and small <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> within the threshold constraints. In addition, there is an optimal secondary coil turn that can maximize extracted energy when other parameters remain fixed.

Alternative concept of a DC/AC current measurement device for 100 A peak with better than 1 mA resolution based on MR sensors For most beam parameters the stored current is monitored by a commercially available dc-transformer offering a dynamic range from 1 µA to 20 A maximum. Its bandwidth of 10 kHz allows determination of the beam lifetime with ms time resolution. But it is known, that these types of transformers have severe problems by a high current bunched beam passage [1]. Even though an improved version is available, no test with beams has been performed so far and scalability from other machines might be doubtful due to the resonance nature of the severe distortion. Therefore investigations of a different type of sensitive magnetic field sensor in collaboration with the University Kassel (Germany) have been started. The idea consists in taking the scheme of a clamp-on ammeter and using a high-effective magnetic sensor in the <b>core</b> <b>gap.</b> Usually Hall-sensors are installed in such measurement devices, but due to the larger core diameter needed in beam diagnostics and the high dynamics of the beam currents to be monitored other sensors have to be investigated like AMR (Anisotrope MagnetoResistance) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{emission}} geometries, e. g. {{the emission}} region height, the beam shape, and radius-to-frequency mapping, are important predictions of pulsar radiation model. The multi-band radio observations carry such valuable information. In this paper, we study two bright pulsars, (PSRs B 0329 + 54 and B 1642 - 03) and observe them in high frequency (2. 5 GHz, 5 GHz, and 8 GHz). The newly acquired data together with historical archive provide an atlas of multi-frequency profiles spanning from 100 MHz to 10 GHz. We study the frequency evolution of pulse profiles and the radiation regions with the these data. We firstly fit the pulse profiles with Gaussian functions {{to determine the}} phase of each component, and then calculate the radiation altitudes of different emission components and the radiation regions. We find that the inverse Compton scattering (ICS) model can reproduce the radiation geometry of these two pulsars. But for PSR B 0329 + 54 the radiation can be generated in either annular gap (AG) or <b>core</b> <b>gap</b> (CG), while the radiation of PSR B 1642 - 03 can only be generated in the CG.

However this extant literature has not undertaken detailed policy analysis of the aid programme, leading to conclusions that it is a fresh approach to the Mexican counternarcotics (CN) challenge, or that CN is a ‘fig leaf’ for the U.

Through policy analysis, I make an empirically supported argument that Mérida is a component of a far more ambitious policy agenda to regionalise security with Mexico more generally. This involves stabilising Mexico itself, not least in response to serious drug-related violence. However the U. S. also aims to improve its own security by giving greater ‘depth’ to its borders, and seeks protect the political economy of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) from variegated security threats. In this way, recent U.

By counting the cycles related to obliquity, within the completed delta 18 O record, we date the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary at 792 ka (+/- 10 k. y.), in excellent agreement with previous estimates based on tuning to astronomical signals and with recent radiometric determinations. Thus, the conventional age of 730 ka for this boundary should be abandoned. The major feature of the record is the appearance of a strong component in the band centered on 100 k. y., near 900 ka. At this time, the obliquity-dominated fluctuations give way to eccentricity-dominated fluctuations (whereas precession-related signals remain insignificant throughout). It is not necessary to call for a sudden event at the position of the main change; instead, superposition of long cycles is sufficient cause. Nevertheless, the break in the character of the cyclicity of the record is very clear; we put it at 918 ka, at the entrance to glacial Isotope Stage 22 (mid-Pleistocene climate revolution [MPR]). The change in response of the climate system to astronomic forcing apparently is not accompanied by distinct changes in the trends of sedimentation rates. Sand content increases and carbonate decreases, on the whole, after the mid-Pleistocene climate shift. We suggest that this is a result of increased winnowing during glacial periods...|$|R
40|$|Duplicate {{records of}} the Cobb Mountain Subchron were {{obtained}} from two holes (Holes 1063 B at 33 ‡ 41. 204 PN, 57 ‡ 36 PW and 1063 C at 33 ‡ 41. 181 PN, 57 ‡ 36 PW) drilled in a sediment drift at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1063 on the northeast Bermuda Rise. We sub-sampled the cores from both holes using U-channels (up to 1. 5 m long samples with 2 U 2 cm cross-section) focusing on continuous sampling through the late Matuyama interval containing the Cobb Mountain Subchron. Results of standard progressive alternating field demagnetization experiments reveal that these sediments generally have a stable characteristic component after removal of a low-coercivity drilling overprint. Additional discrete samples (V 7 cm 3 oriented cubes) used in progressive thermal demagnetization studies display similar behavior. By taking duplicate sets of U-channels, {{we were able to}} identify and remove several measurement artifacts, such as edge effects that affect measurements made near the ends of the U-channel samples. The upper normal-to-reverse polarity transition was not obtained because of a <b>coring</b> <b>gap</b> or an interval of coring deformation. After removing measurement artifacts, the records from the two holes were stacked to obtain a composite record. Virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) computed from the composite record follow a path through the central Pacific during the lower polarity transition, very similar to VGP paths from Cobb Mountain Subchron records from other sites around the world. Furthermore, the VGPs cluster near southern Africa early in the reversal process and then group in...|$|R
