5|$|Mary Ann Davis, who {{had bought}} the Fornells grant on Key Biscayne in 1821, died in Galveston, Texas in 1885. Her son Waters Smith Davis began taking steps to assert the family title to the island. In 1887 he {{purchased}} {{the rights of the}} other Davis heirs and received a new deed in his name. He could not get a <b>clear</b> <b>title,</b> however. Venancio Sanchez still claimed a half share of the Fornells Grant, two of the town lots had been sold to William Harney around 1840, and Osborne and Field had their deed from the Florida Internal Improvement Fund. Davis received quitclaims from Osborn and Field, and on the Harney lots, but was unable to settle with Sanchez. He finally received a patent from the United States government for his land in 1898. In 1903 Davis bought the abandoned Cape Florida lighthouse from the United States Treasury for US$400.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1932, the California State Highway Commission {{received}} a recommendation {{to purchase the}} road {{and was able to}} invest $418,000USD by 1936. However, the U.S. Navy owned rights to the right-of-way of part of the route, and opposed the purchase. This resulted in congressional actions to establish a <b>clear</b> <b>title</b> deed for the route. House Representative Richard J. Welch was one of the earliest government officials to pressure the State of California to acquire the toll road in order to convert it into a toll-free highway. He argued that having only one toll road to travel in order to reach the Golden Gate Bridge would benefit commuters; he also cited the ten and seventh-tenths-mile difference in distance between the toll road and a route through Napa. A Navy Department deed permitting the State to purchase the road was granted by the Attorney General on October 26, 1938. The highway then became signed as State Route 48 until the 1964 renumbering.|$|E
25|$|Jasper More's sons died, {{leaving no}} male heir. The estates {{were held in}} an entail whereby {{inheritance}} was restricted to male heirs, but Samuel father, Richard, in the marriage settlement paid 600 pounds to Jasper More, so {{there must have been}} <b>clear</b> <b>title.</b> It was arranged that Katherine would marry her cousin and indeed, on 4 February 1610, (old date style) Katherine, 25, the last unmarried daughter of Jasper, married 17-year-old cousin, Samuel More.|$|E

Since then great legislative {{progress has been made}} in removing defects. The Incumbered Estates Court and Landed Estates Court Acts were passed successively, giving a parliamentary <b>title,</b> and <b>clearing</b> all the land sold by the court of all complications of title prior to the sale. New complications of title were, however, allowed to arise on the <b>cleared</b> <b>title,</b> so that the Incumbered Estates Court and Landed Estates Court produce only a temporary effect in <b>clearing</b> <b>titles,</b> which in the course of time will be entirely obliterated...|$|R

25|$|Income {{tax refund}} {{anticipation}} loans are not technically payday loans (because they are repayable upon receipt of the borrower's income tax refund, not at his next payday), {{but they have}} similar credit and cost characteristics. A car title loan is secured by the borrower's car, but are available only to borrowers who hold <b>clear</b> <b>title</b> (i.e., no other loans) to a vehicle. The maximum amount of the loan is some fraction of the resale value of the car. A similar credit facility seen in the UK is a logbook loan secured against a car's logbook, which the lender retains. These loans may be available on slightly better terms than an unsecured payday loan, since they are less risky to the lender. If the borrower defaults, then the lender can attempt to recover costs by repossessing and reselling the car.|$|E
25|$|After the Red River Rebellion of 1869–1870, {{many of the}} Métis {{moved from}} Manitoba to the Fort Carlton region of the Northwest Territories, where they founded the Southbranch {{settlements}} of Fish Creek, Batoche, St. Laurent, St. Louis, and Duck Lake {{on or near the}} South Saskatchewan River. In 1882, surveyors began dividing the land of the newly formed District of Saskatchewan in the square concession system. The Métis lands were laid out in the seigneurial system of strips reaching back from a river which the Métis were familiar with in their French-Canadian culture. A year after the survey the 36 families of the parish of St. Louis found that their land and village site that included a church and a school (in Tsp 45 Rge 7 W2 of the Dominion Land Survey) had been sold by the Government of Canada to the Prince Albert Colonization Company. Not having <b>clear</b> <b>title</b> the Métis feared losing their land which, now that the buffalo herds were gone, was their primary source of sustenance.|$|E
25|$|Obstacles to {{the project}} soon appeared. In March 1926 the U.S. {{government}} auctioned off some lots on Key Biscayne that had been retained {{when the rest of}} the island was transferred to the State of Florida. The Mathesons wanted to have <b>clear</b> <b>title</b> to all of their land, and determined to outbid other interested parties for the land. They ended up paying US$58,055 for a total of 6.84 acres (2.77 hectares) of land, a record price per acre for the auction of U.S. government land up to that date. Then, on September 18, 1926, the Great Miami Hurricane crossed over Key Biscayne on its way to Miami. While no lives were lost on the island, most of the buildings on Key Biscayne were destroyed or badly damaged, and many of the plantings were lost, including half of the coconut trees. D. P. Davis was not able to meet his end of the contract; he declared bankruptcy and then disappeared en route to Europe by ship. The Florida Land Boom was over, as were plans for a bridge.|$|E

5000|$|One {{theory about}} the Hanks family's westward {{movement}} (first to {{land that is}} now West Virginia) was that Joseph Hanks was concerned about his daughters access to returning Revolutionary War soldiers in the [...] "lax environment" [...] following the war. There are also records that show that Joseph Hanks' mother, Catherine died in 1779. Joseph, executor of the will, inherited monies from her estate and it was after this in 1781 that the Hanks moved from Northern Neck, Virginia to a place between the forks of Mike's Run off of Patterson's Creek in Hampshire County, Virginia (now Mineral County, West Virginia).

50|$|In some countries, LVT is {{impractical}} {{because of}} uncertainty regarding land titles and established land ownership and tenure. For instance a parcel of grazing land may be communally owned by village inhabitants and administered by village elders. The land in question {{would need to}} be held in a trust or similar body for taxation purposes. If the government cannot accurately define ownership boundaries and ascertain the proper owners, it cannot know from whom to collect the tax. The lack of <b>clear</b> <b>titles</b> is found in many developing countries. In African countries with imperfect land registration, boundaries may be poorly surveyed and the owner can be unknown. LVT proponents argue that such owners can be made to identify themselves under penalty of losing the land.|$|R
500|$|Thomas O'Neil, son of General Tire's founder William O'Neil and {{chairman}} of the broadcasting group, saw that the company's new television stations, indeed all TV outlets, were in need of programming. They sought to acquire the RKO library, but Hughes would not sell to General Tire unless they purchased the studio outright. With the purchase of RKO, the studio's library was his, and rights to the 742 films to which RKO retained <b>clear</b> <b>title</b> were quickly put up for sale. C Television Corp., a subsidiary of beverage maker Cantrell & Cochrane, won the bidding in December 1955. It was soon offering the films to independent stations in a package called [...] "MovieTime USA". RKO Teleradio Pictures—the new company created from the merger of General Teleradio and the RKO studio—retained the broadcast rights for the cities where it owned TV stations. By 1956, RKO's classic movies were playing widely on television, allowing many to see such films as Citizen Kane for the first time. The $15.2 million RKO made on the deal convinced the other major studios that their libraries held profit potential—a turning point in the way Hollywood did business.|$|E
500|$|In 1816, {{the family}} moved north across the Ohio River to Indiana, a free, non-slaveholding territory, where they settled in an [...] "unbroken forest" [...] in Hurricane Township, Perry County. (Their land in {{southern}} Indiana became part of Spencer County, Indiana, when the county was established in 1818.) The farm is preserved {{as part of the}} Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial. In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was [...] "partly on account of slavery"; but mainly due to land title difficulties in Kentucky. During the family's years in Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas Lincoln worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter. He owned farms, several town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were also members of a Separate Baptists church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery. Within a year of the family's arrival in Indiana, Thomas claimed title to [...] of Indiana land. Despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained <b>clear</b> <b>title</b> to [...] of land in {{what became known as the}} Little Pigeon Creek Community in Spencer County. Prior to the family's move to Illinois in 1830, Thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property.|$|E
500|$|Although the PRIA {{limited the}} number of horses that could be adopted in any one year by a single adopter to four, it allowed the BLM to make {{exceptions}} to the limit. [...] In the mid-1980s, the BLM had placed for adoption over 20,000 horses to large scale adopters, and thousands of the horses were slaughtered. [...] In March 1987, the Animal Protection Institute sued the Department of the Interior, arguing that BLM was {{turning a blind eye}} to [...] "adopters" [...] who obtained horses with the intent to slaughter. In Animal Protection Institute v. Hodel, 671 F. Supp. 695 (1987), the United States District Court for the District of Nevada held that BLM could not ignore the intent of adopters. The decision was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Animal Protection Institute v. Hodel, 860 F.2d 920 (1988). In 1988, the BLM terminated the large scale adoption program. [...] In 1997, the Animal Protection Institute and BLM signed an out-of-court settlement under which BLM would require individuals to sign an affidavit stating they had no intent to sell the animal for slaughter or for use as rodeo stock. The settlement also required BLM to establish rules requiring horse slaughterhouses to maintain paperwork on horses for no less than one year and to report any horses to which <b>clear</b> <b>title</b> was not established.

50|$|Nevertheless, the Fujiwara {{were not}} demoted by Daigo but {{actually}} became stronger during his reign. Central control of Japan {{had continued to}} decline, and the Fujiwara, along with other great families and religious foundations, acquired ever larger shōen and greater wealth during the early tenth century. By the early Heian period, the shōen had obtained legal status, and the large religious establishments sought <b>clear</b> <b>titles</b> in perpetuity, waiver of taxes, and immunity from government inspection of the shōen they held.

The government named Cooper proprietor of the town. He paid the federal asking price of $2 an acre purchasing more than 3,000 acres (12 km²) of the land, including the town site. He replatted the town using the original survey with minimal alterations. <b>Clear</b> <b>titles</b> were passed to the original settlers who were once again given an [...] "inlot" [...] within the city and an [...] "outlot."

500|$|Returning to the Credit Mission, Jones {{believed}} {{the most pressing}} issue for the Mississaugas was their lack of a <b>clear</b> <b>title</b> to their land.

[...] The Credit Mission Mississaugas had also funded the construction of a pair of piers {{at the mouth of the}} Credit River, the beginning of Port Credit. [...] Although the settlement was prospering, Indian Superintendent Thomas G. Anderson pressured to band to move off the Credit Mission to a different location, hoping to group Indians into larger settlements where schools could be reasonably established and funded. [...] As an inducement to motivate the Mississaugas to move, he promised them the title deeds which were Jones' main goal for the band. [...] The Saugeen Ojibwa invited the Credit Mississaugas to move to the Bruce Peninsula, which was the last large piece of unceded land in southern Ontario. [...] The Credit Mississaugas believed this to be their best chance to obtain deeds to land, and so the band prepared for a move. [...] They turned the Credit lands over to the province in trust, but the first survey of the Bruce returned with terrible news: The soil of the Bruce Peninsula was completely unsuitable for farming. [...] Having already surrendered their land at the Credit Mission, the Mississaugas faced an uncertain situation. [...] The Six Nations, hearing of the Mississaugas' desperate situation offered a portion of their tract to the Credit Mississaugas, remembering that when the Six Nations had fled to Upper Canada the Mississaugas had donated the land the Six Nations. [...] The Mississaugas relocated to this land along the Grand River that was donated by the Six Nations. [...] Founded in 1847, the settlement was named New Credit. Jones would continue in his role as a community leader here, petitioning various branches of government for funding to build the settlement. [...] In 1848, the Wesleyans and Methodists reconciled, and William Ryerson established a mission in New Credit.|$|E
