5|$|Ebla was a polytheistic state. During {{the first}} kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon {{of the first}} Ebla {{included}} pairs of deities {{and they can be}} separated into three genres; in the first and most common one, there were the couples, such as the deity and his female <b>consort.</b> The second type of pairs was the divine twosomes, such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos, like in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons. The third type included divine pairs who were actually a single deity that had two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first genre of pairs included Nidakul, who was exclusive to Ebla, and his <b>consort,</b> Belatu ("his wife"); Rasap and his <b>consort</b> Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his <b>consort</b> Barama. The third genre included the artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain Gods; Shahar as the morning star and Shalim as the evening star.|$|E
50|$|The {{system was}} solid, {{but the number}} of <b>consorts</b> an emperor {{actually}} had during the Qing dynasty was subject to wild variations. The Kangxi Emperor holds the record for having the most <b>consorts</b> with 79, while the Guangxu Emperor holds the record for having the least <b>consorts,</b> with one empress and two <b>consorts</b> - a total of just three <b>consorts.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Consorts</b> were {{considered}} loud or soft, and the exact {{application of these}} titles is sometimes hard to pin down. Generally, loud <b>consorts</b> consisted of cornetti, sackbuts, shawms and the higher-pitched recorders and flutes. Soft <b>consorts</b> generally included the viols, flutes, recorders, krummhorns and other of the quieter instruments.|$|R

50|$|In {{this same}} way, the term kōkyū has {{multiple}} meanings, {{referring to the}} group of buildings situated near the sovereign's personal apartments where the <b>consorts</b> resided, and also describing the staff of female palace officials assigned to the service of those <b>consorts.</b> More broadly, the term kōkyū could be used in identifying the array of <b>consorts</b> below the empress.|$|R
50|$|In consequence, most {{wives of}} several Ottoman Sultans were ethnic Circassians {{converted}} to Islam, e.g. Valide Sultans (Empress mothers), including Perestü Valide Sultan, Pertevniyal Valide Sultan, Şevkefza Valide Sultan, Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan, Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi, other important Hatuns (Ladies) and Sultans like Şemsiruhsar Hatun and Saçbağlı Sultan, Haseki sultans (chief <b>consorts)</b> such as Mahidevran Haseki Sultan, Hümaşah Haseki Sultan, Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan, and Ayşe Haseki Sultan besides numerous Başkadınefendis (most senior <b>consorts),</b> including Bedrifelek I, Bidar II, Kamures I, and Servetseza I {{as well as}} Kadınefendis (senior <b>consorts)</b> such as Bezmara VI, Düzdidil III, Hayranıdil II, Meyliservet IV, Mihrengiz II, Neşerek III, Nurefsun II, Reftaridil II, Şayan III, amongst many others, or İkbals (honoured lady <b>consorts),</b> most notable of them being Cevherriz II, Ceylanyar II, Dilfirib I, Nalanıdil III, and Nergis IV in addition to Gözdes (favourite lady <b>consorts),</b> including Dürdane I, Hüsnicenan III, Safderun IV, amongst others.|$|R
5|$|The main sanctum of the Jagannath Temple {{has three}} deities: Jagannath, Balabhadra (elder brother of Krishna, {{sometimes}} identified with Shiva) and Subhadra (the younger sister of Krishna and Balabhadra). In Jagannath-centric traditions, while Lakshmi is the orthodox <b>consort</b> of Jagannath {{in the temple}} complex, Vimala is the Tantric (heterodox) <b>consort</b> and guardian goddess of the temple complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of the Inner Court varied over different periods, but by all accounts it was large. Each queen <b>consort</b> had her own household of around 200 to 300 women. Her various ladies-in-waiting were usually recruited from noble families; others were minor princesses who would also have a retinue of servants. Each minor wife or <b>consort</b> (เจ้าจอม; Chao Chom) had a fairly large household; this would increase significantly if {{she gave birth to}} the king's child, as she would be elevated to the rank of <b>consort</b> mother (เจ้าจอมมารดา; Chao Chom Manda). Each royal lady had a separate establishment, the size of which was in proportion to her rank and status in accordance with palace law. Altogether the {{population of}} the Inner Court numbered nearly 3,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Vithoba {{is usually}} {{depicted}} with his main <b>consort,</b> Rakhumai, {{on his left}} side. Rakhumai (or Rakhamai) literally means 'mother Rukmini'. Rukmini is traditionally viewed as the wife of Krishna. Hindus generally consider Krishna to {{be a form of}} Vishnu, hence his <b>consort</b> as a form of Lakshmi. Rakhumai is depicted in the arms-akimbo posture, standing on a brick. She has an independent cella in the Pandharpur temple complex. According to Ghurye, Rukmini—a princess of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra—was elevated to the status of the main <b>consort</b> instead of Radha, because of her affiliation with the region. According to Dhangar tradition, Rukhumai is worshipped by the community as Padmavati or Padubai, a protector of the community and cattle in particular. Dhangar folklore explains the reason behind separate shrines for Vithoba and Padubai as the outcome of Vithoba invoking a curse on his <b>consort,</b> and his non-attachment to samsara (the householder's life). Apart from Rakhumai, two other consorts Satyabhama and Rahi (derived from Radha) are worshipped too. All three consorts are regarded as Krishna's in Hindu mythology.|$|E
25|$|Other Russian sovereigns {{either did}} not have <b>consorts</b> {{at the time of}} their coronations, did not ever crown their <b>consorts,</b> or (beginning with Paul I and {{continuing}} until Nicholas II) had them crowned with them at their own coronations.|$|R

50|$|The {{lack of an}} ordinal in {{the case}} of royal <b>consorts</b> complicates the {{recording}} of history, as there may be a number of <b>consorts</b> over time with the same name with no way to distinguish between them. For that reason, royal <b>consorts</b> are sometimes after their deaths recorded in history books and encyclopaedias through the use of their pre-marital name or, if from a reigning family, its Royal House (dynastic name) or the name of the country (e.g. Alexandra of Denmark).|$|R
5|$|When {{the goddess}} is at last placated, the {{retrieving}} god escorts {{her back to}} Egypt. Her return {{marks the beginning of}} the inundation and the new year. The pacified Eye deity is once more a procreative <b>consort</b> for the sun god, or, in some versions of the story, for the god who brings her back. Mehit becomes the <b>consort</b> of Anhur, Tefnut is paired with Shu, and Thoth's spouse is sometimes Nehemtawy, a minor goddess associated with this pacified form of the Eye. In many cases, the Eye goddess and her <b>consort</b> then produce a divine child who becomes the new sun god. The goddess' transformation from hostile to peaceful is a key step in the renewal of the sun god and the kingship that he represents.|$|E
5|$|A {{symbol of}} 800 years of monarchy, the sovereign's {{coronation}} regalia {{is the only}} working collection in Europe– other present-day monarchies have abandoned coronations in favour of inauguration or enthronement ceremonies– and is the largest set of regalia in the world. Objects used to invest and crown the monarch variously denote his or her roles as Head of State, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces. Wives of kings are crowned as queen <b>consort</b> with a plainer set of regalia. Since 1831, a new crown has been made specially for each queen <b>consort.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For many species, mate {{guarding}} {{results in}} dramatic departures from normal behaviour that reflect compromised attention to feeding and other activities. Such departures have previously {{been difficult to}} document in primates, however. Data were gathered on two aspects of male behaviour that were predicted to be constrained during consortships, individual travel distance and duration of feeding bouts, for wild male baboons, Papio cynocephalus, {{in and out of}} mate-guarding episodes. In each case, <b>consorting</b> males were compared with themselves outside of consortships, and, in the case of distance travelled, they were compared also with non-consorting males matched for sample time and location. Males travelled significantly shorter distances while <b>consorting</b> than while not <b>consorting,</b> with the result that <b>consorting</b> males travelled distances similar to those travelled by females. Males also had significantly shorter feeding bouts while <b>consorting.</b> The shorter travel distances and feeding bouts experienced by <b>consorting</b> males may represent important constraints on male foraging activity, and probably result in decreased energy intake during mate guarding. Seasonal and non-seasonal breeding patterns will have different consequences for the magnitude of fluctuations in energy stores and depletions experienced during mate guarding, and costs of mate guarding in species that breed non-seasonally will be more difficult to document because they are necessarily smaller and temporall...|$|R

5|$|Catherine's {{ability to}} bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage.

Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his <b>consort.</b> When King Francis I died on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen <b>consort</b> of France.
