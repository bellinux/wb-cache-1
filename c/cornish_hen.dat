5000|$|In the United States, a Cornish game hen, also {{sometimes}} called a <b>Cornish</b> <b>hen,</b> poussin, Rock <b>Cornish</b> <b>hen,</b> or simply Rock Cornish, is a hybrid chicken sold whole. Despite the name, {{it is not}} a game bird. Rather, it is a broiler chicken, the most common strain of commercially raised meat chickens. Though the bird is called a [...] "hen", it can be either male or female. A <b>Cornish</b> <b>hen</b> typically commands a higher price per pound than typically sold chickens, despite a shorter growing span of 28 to 30 days, as opposed to 42 or more for regular chicken.|$|E

50|$|The Rock Cornish game hen or Rock <b>Cornish</b> <b>hen</b> is a {{cross between}} the Cornish Game and White Plymouth Rock chicken breeds. This breed {{develops}} a large breast over {{a short period of}} time compared to game hens. Rock Cornish game hens weigh about 2.5 lb after four to six weeks, at which time they are slaughtered.|$|E
5000|$|Helland (Hellann) is a {{civil parish}} and village in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is {{situated}} 2+1/2 mi north of Bodmin. The meaning of the name Helland is unclear: {{it is possible that}} the origin is in <b>Cornish</b> <b>hen</b> & lan (i.e. old church). The original dedication of the church is unknown but St Helena is now recognised as the patron.|$|E

5000|$|The {{name comes}} from the <b>Cornish</b> <b>hen</b> lis or old court and ton added later to denote a Saxon manor; the Domesday Book refers to Henliston (which survives as {{the name of a}} road in the town). Only one edition refers to Henlistona. It was granted its charter by King John on 15 April 1201, for the price of forty marks of silver. It was here that tin ingots were weighed to {{determine}} the tin coinage duty due to the Duke of Cornwall when a number of stannary towns were authorised by royal decree. A document of 1396 examined by Charles Henderson shows that the old form [...] "Hellys" [...] was still in use [...] The manor of Helston in Kerrier was one of the seventeen Antiqua maneria of the Duchy of Cornwall. The seal of the borough of Helston was St Michael his wings expanded and standing on a gateway. The two towers domed upon the up-turned dragon, impaling it with his spear and bearing upon his left arm an escutcheon of the arms of England, viz Gu three lions passant guardant in pale Or, with the legend [...] "Sigillum comunitatis helleston burg".|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{products}} here are from Europe, Asia {{and the rest of}} the Americas. Of particular note is the wide variety of meat products found. Fresh meat from many different animals, both from Mexico and abroad can be found. These meats include those from iguanas, skunks, deer, rabbit, suckling pigs, goat, wild boar and lowland paca. One very unusual specialty is lion meat, from animals raised for those purpose in Zumpango and sells for about 850 pesos per kilo. Fresh meats are from both Mexican and international sources, primarily Central America and the United States, with the most popular being rabbit, venison, wild boar and crocodile. Poultry includes <b>Cornish</b> <b>hens,</b> duck, pigeon, goose, turkey, doves as well as the eggs from various types of birds. The market also has some of the finest seafood selections in the city, both Mexican and imported, including caviar that sells for more than 6,000 pesos a kilo.|$|R
40|$|Stress-induced {{alterations}} {{represent a}} most actual problem in veterinary medicine, where improper technological conditions {{are more and}} more frequent under intensive and meanwhile more and more artificialized breeding/exploitation of the domestic birds and mammals, (Mizoguchi Y. et al., 1987; Muntean S., 1990; Schulz V. et al., 1998; Zarnea G., 1990) that negatively influence the results of vaccinations. Immunological changes subsequent to stress can be investigated in field trials, by administering corticosteroids to the birds. Non-specific (hyperbasophilic reaction) and specific (delayed type hypersensitivity) cell-mediated reactions were monitored during a 38 days long experiment on 39 weeks old, Rock x <b>Cornish</b> <b>hens</b> (n= 34), divided into groups: I – vaccinated, Supercortisol treated (10 mg/bird/day for the entire duration of the experiment); II – vaccinated, non-suppressed; III – non-vaccinated, untreated control. The birds were primed with booster use of a 9 R Salmonella pullorum live vaccine. Hyperbasophilic reaction was monitored against 0. 1 ml PHA M/wattle, while the delayed type hypersensitivity was recorded by administering a vaccine lysate (2, 9 mg of protein/ml, 0. 1 ml/wattle), both on days 8 and 15 of the experiment...|$|R
50|$|Although {{intended}} to imitate a meal {{that might have}} been served during the Middle Ages, the food at a madrigal dinner is often regional and will vary from show to show. Courses usually include a wassail or drinks course, salad, a main course and dessert. Although the Boar's Head Carol is the most popular madrigal song to announce the main course, the most popular meat for the main course is chicken, often specifically <b>Cornish</b> game <b>hen.</b>|$|R
40|$|Deep fat frying {{began in}} the {{southern}} part of the United States and has gradually spread nationwide. Turkeys are the most common food prepared by this method. However, chicken, turkey parts (breasts, wings and thighs), and <b>Cornish</b> game <b>hens</b> may be deep fat fried. Deep fat frying results in a juicy product because the hot fat seals the outside and the skin becomes crisp. This NebFact talks about the equipment, ingredients, preparation, frying, and safety of deep fat frying turkeys and other poultry...|$|R
5000|$|Most credit Alphonsine [...] "Therese" [...] and Jacques Makowsky of Connecticut for {{developing}} the small bird in the mid-1950s. A Saturday Evening Post article from July 1955 credited Mrs. Makowsky with {{coming up with the}} idea to breed the Cornish game chicken, which she had discovered in a book. The Makowskys began cross-breeding the Cornish game cocks with various chickens and game birds, including a White Plymouth Rock Hen and a Malayan fighting cock, to develop the Rock <b>Cornish</b> game <b>hen,</b> a succulent bird suitable for a single serving.|$|R
50|$|At dinner, Bakshi's {{place setting}} {{right by the}} kitchen door has a very low chair that puts his chin near the table. An {{increasingly}} drunk waiter named Levinson (Steve Franken) tries to serve dinner and fights with the other staff. During the main course, Bakshi's roast <b>Cornish</b> game <b>hen</b> accidentally catapults off his fork and becomes impaled on a guest's tiara. Bakshi asks Levinson to retrieve his meal, but the woman's wig comes off along with her tiara, as she obliviously engages in conversation. Levinson ends up brawling with other waiting staff, and dinner is disrupted.|$|R
5000|$|A New Orleans surgeon, Dr. Gerald R. LaNasa, was locally {{known for}} his use of a scalpel in {{deboning}} his three birds of choice, sometimes adding pork or veal roasts in the final hen's cavity, thus preserving the turducken tradition as a regional holiday favorite of the southern United States. Andouille sausage and Foie Gras were always key ingredients of the LaNasa creations. The results of Dr. LaNasa's work {{can be found in}} the modern day mass-produced turducken or turduckhen (another variation adding or substituting a <b>cornish</b> game <b>hen).</b> His turkey, duck, and chicken ballotine is now widely commercially available under multiple trademark names. Dr. LaNasa's innovation and success with ballotine, Three Bird Roast and turducken began mid century, expanding in the 1960s and seventies long before many of the popular commercial Cajun/Creole chefs of today took the stage.|$|R
40|$|Bacillus cereus is an uncommonly {{reported}} {{cause of}} foodborne illness in the United States. In May 1989, {{an outbreak of}} B. cereus gastroenteritis occurred among 140 guests who had attended a catered wedding reception in Napa, CA. Investigation established <b>Cornish</b> game <b>hens</b> served at the event as the vehicle for disease transmission (OR = 29, P = 0. 0001). Although the spores of B. cereus are ubiquitous, large numbers of toxin-producing organisms (more than 10 (5) per gram of food) are required for illness to occur. In the Napa outbreak, bacterial multiplication was facilitated at several points during the preparation and transportation of the food. While a licensed restaurant kitchen was used, the facilities were clearly inadequate for the event. At present, the California Health and Safety Code {{does not address the}} scope of catering operations. As caterers increase in number, there will be a growing need for governmental oversight to ensure that food production on a large scale is conducted safely...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the role of}} meats as possible sources of infection leading to Campylobacter jejuni/coli (CJC) enteritis, 218 cases and 526 controls were selected from the King County Group Health Cooperative (GHC) population from April 1982 through September 1983. All subjects were interviewed regarding food consumption one week prior to case onset. Consumption of chicken and <b>cornish</b> game <b>hen</b> were both associated {{with more than a}} doubling of the risk of CJC enteritis: for chicken (relative risk = 2. 4, 95 % CI = 1. 6 - 3. 6), and for game hen, (RR = 3. 3, 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 9. 8). The consumption of raw or rare chicken was even more strongly associated (RR = 7. 6, 95 % CI = 2. 1 - 27. 6). Strains of CJC bearing R factors for tetracycline were equally as likely as tetracycline-susceptible strains to have been acquired from chicken and game hens. Processed turkey sandwich meats (RR = 1. 7, 95 % CI = 1. 0 - 2. 9) raw or rare fish (RR = 4. 0, 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 14. 5) and shellfish (RR = 1. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 2. 1) were the only other meats reported to have been eaten significantly (p less than. 05) more often by cases than by controls. These data along with the results of bacteriologic sampling of meats from King County retail food markets during the same period suggest that ingestion of contaminated chicken is a primary source of CJC enteritis, contributing to approximately half of the cases...|$|R
