5|$|Secondary pneumothoraces {{are only}} treated <b>conservatively</b> if the size {{is very small}} (1 cm or less air rim) and there are limited symptoms. Admission to the {{hospital}} is usually recommended. Oxygen given at a high flow rate may accelerate resorption as much as fourfold.|$|E
5|$|The Sogdian {{religious}} texts {{found in}} China and {{dating to the}} Northern Dynasties, Sui, and Tang are mostly Buddhist (translated from Chinese sources), Manichaean and Nestorian Christian, with only {{a small minority of}} Zoroastrian texts. But tombs of Sogdian merchants in China dated to the last third of the 6th century show predominantly Zoroastrian motifs or Zoroastrian-Manichaean syncretism, while archaeological remains from Sogdiana appear fairly Iranian and <b>conservatively</b> Zoroastrian.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{relatively}} mild visual field loss or double vision only may be managed <b>conservatively,</b> with close {{observation of the}} level of consciousness, visual fields, and results of routine blood tests. If there is any deterioration, or expected spontaneous improvement does not occur, surgical intervention may still be indicated. If the apoplexy occurred in a prolactin-secreting tumor, this may respond to dopamine agonist treatment.|$|E
5|$|According to the ethnobiologists Smith-Hall, Larsen and Pouliotof, a {{medicinal}} plant is {{a plant that}} is used to attempt to maintain health, to be administered for a specific condition, or both, whether in modern medicine or in traditional medicine. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in 2002 that over 50,000 {{medicinal plant}}s are used across the world. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew more <b>conservatively</b> estimated in 2016 that 17,810 plant species have a medicinal use, out of some 30,000 plants for which a use of any kind is documented.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{concern for}} Barnes, when {{returning from the}} United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, <b>conservatively</b> estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on public finances. The tax revenue from financial services, which was <b>conservatively</b> estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in the deficit to an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and a rise in the national debt to above 80% of GDP at its peak. The UK had significant automatic stabilisers which contributed far more than discretionary action and more than most other countries.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his second}} major junior season, Jovanovski signed a four-year, $5.7 million {{contract}} with the Panthers in June 1995. Playing with the club during the subsequent pre-season, he broke his right hand during a fight with Hartford Whalers forward Brendan Shanahan. The injury caused him to miss the first 11 games of the season. After recovering, he scored his first career NHL goal against the Whalers on December 2, 1995, a game-winner in a 5–3 victory. He finished his rookie season with 10 goals and 21 points over 70 games. During the regular season, he was encouraged by Panthers management to play more <b>conservatively</b> than {{he was used to}} in the OHL, focusing on defensive positioning.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} probability of Hale-Bopp's striking Earth in future passages through the inner Solar System is remote, about 2.5×10−9 per orbit. However, {{given that the}} comet nucleus is around 60km in diameter, the consequences of such an impact would be apocalyptic. Weissman <b>conservatively</b> estimates the diameter at 35km; an estimated density of 0.6 g/cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1.3×1019 g. At a probable impact velocity of 52.5km/s, impact energy can be calculated as 1.9×1032 ergs, or 4.4×109 megatons, about 44 times the estimated energy of the K-T impact event.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} US-based {{credit rating}} agencies—Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch—which {{have already been}} under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisis—have also played a central and controversial role in the current European bond market crisis. On one hand, the agencies {{have been accused of}} giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest. On the other hand, ratings agencies have a tendency to act <b>conservatively,</b> and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is in trouble. In the case of Greece, the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades, with Greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such.|$|E
5|$|The non-partisan National Journal rates a Senator's votes by what {{percentage}} of the Senate voted more liberally than he or she, and {{what percentage}} more <b>conservatively,</b> in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006 (as reported in the 2008 Almanac of American Politics), McCain's average ratings were as follows: economic policy: 59percent conservative and 41percent liberal; social policy: 54percent conservative and 38percent liberal; and foreign policy: 56percent conservative and 43percent liberal. In 2012, the National Journal gave McCain a composite score of 73% conservative and 27% liberal. In 2013, the National Journal gave him a composite score of 60% conservative and 40% liberal.|$|E
5|$|The {{rainfall}} lightened {{almost as}} soon as it began, but the top riders in the general classification still faced a course made more difficult by the rain. Most of them rode <b>conservatively,</b> to keep their positions intact rather than aim for the stage win, but Danilo Di Luca did not. Di Luca attacked the course, riding with a high cadence from the outset. He had the best time at the first intermediate time check, but he lost energy and faded away as the course went on, finishing 45 seconds slower than the stage winner.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Tonelli won the 100m {{backstroke}}, 200m backstroke and 200m butterfly {{events at}} the Australian Championships. Although he won more individual titles {{than in the previous}} year, his times were slower; he completed the distances in 59.70s, 2m 10.50s and 2m 10.00s respectively. Tonelli was also part of the Queensland team that successfully defended their medley relay title. Tonelli was thus selected for the 1975 World Championships in Cali, Colombia. He qualified fastest for the 200m backstroke final and had planned to pursue an aggressive strategy to attack from the start. However, he was advised to swim <b>conservatively</b> {{in the first half of}} the race by Australian coach Terry Gathercole so that his main rivals Matthes and John Naber would not be able to draft behind him in the early stages. The tactic backfired and Tonelli ended with the silver medal. He had swum faster in the second half of the racesomething exceedingly rare in top-level swimming and an indication of strategic errorand felt that he had too much unused energy left at the end of the race. Tonelli vowed that from then on, he would always back his judgment and race strategy.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Toyota {{chairman}} Eiji Toyoda {{issued a}} challenge to build the world's best car. The project, code-named F1 (“Flagship One”) developed the Lexus LS 400 to expand Toyota’s product line in the premium segment. The F1 project followed the Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Mark II models. Both the Supra and Mark II were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful 7M-GE or 7M-GTE inline-six engine. The largest sedan Toyota built {{at the time was}} the limited-production, 1960s-vintage Toyota Century, a domestic, hand-built limousine, and V8-powered model, followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium sedan. The Century was <b>conservatively</b> styled for the Japanese market and along with the Crown not slated for export after a restyle in 1982. The F1 designers targeted their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus, a {{widespread}} genus of bats in Africa, southern Eurasia, and Australia, was first recorded from Madagascar by George Edward Dobson, who mentioned the larger Miniopterus schreibersii {{and the smaller}} M.scotinus (currently M.natalensis) in his 1878 catalog of the bats in the British Museum. In 1906, Oldfield Thomas named the larger species M.majori and the smaller M.manavi. He regarded M.manavi {{as close to the}} mainland African M.minor, and in 1971, R.W. Hayman and J.E. Hill placed it as a subspecies of that species. In their 1995 Faune de Madagascar review of Malagasy bats, however, Randolph Peterson and colleagues again separated M.manavi as a species, with M.manavi griveaudi (currently Miniopterus griveaudi) from Grande Comore as a subspecies. Peterson, who died before the review was completed, had originally divided M.manavi into several species occurring in different areas, but his collaborators decided <b>conservatively</b> to keep M.manavi as a single species, recommending reassessment of the status of those forms as new material would become available.|$|E
5|$|Simpson was {{determined}} {{to make an impact}} in the Tour de France; in his eighth year as a professional cyclist, he hoped for larger appearance fees in post-Tour criteriums to help secure his financial future after retirement. His plan was to finish in the top three, or to wear the yellow jersey {{at some point in the}} race. He targeted three key stages, one of which was the thirteenth, over Mont Ventoux, and planned to ride <b>conservatively</b> until the race reached the mountains. In the prologue, Simpson finished thirteenth. After the first week he was in sixth place overall, leading the favourites. As the race crossed the Alps, Simpson fell ill, across the Col du Galibier, with diarrhoea and stomach pains. Unable to eat, he finished stage ten in 16th place and dropped to seventh overall as his rivals passed him. Teammate Vin Denson advised Simpson to limit his losses and accept what he had. He placed in 39th position on stage 11 and 7th on 12. In Marseille, on the evening before stage thirteen, Simpson's manager, Daniel Dousset, pressured him for good results. Plaud begged Simpson to quit the race.|$|E
5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP <b>conservatively</b> if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{used the}} {{opportunity}} of travelling around England to pursue his business interests, cutting many deals. When he was rested from the first match against Yorkshire, {{he stayed in the}} capital and made deals at the London Exhibition. During breaks in play, or when Australia was batting and he had already been dismissed, he often spent the time inspecting local factories and talking to other businesspeople. An important concern for Barnes, when returning to Australia by boat after the tour, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included fine English cloth, which was in very short supply in Australia. Hearing a rumour that customs officers were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, <b>conservatively</b> estimated to be equal to his tour fee. Upon returning to Australia, Barnes opted out of first-class cricket to focus on business interests. He wrote a newspaper column, in which he often criticised cricket administrators and the small share of revenue they gave to players. Barnes wrote in a confrontational manner, often lampooning and angering the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon, on {{the active}} roster {{for the first}} time in the season, came off the bench in the third quarter to rally the Bears past the Buccaneers. He scored a {{touchdown}} on a quarterback sneak with six minutes to go, and tied the game with a touchdown pass to Neal Anderson with 1:28 to go. The Buccaneers allowed seven sacks, but led for most of the game. The Bears were aided by the Buccaneers' poor clock management and their reliance on a conservative offense in the fourth quarter. Perkins denied accusations that they went to a prevent defense and a three-man rush, but admitted that they played too <b>conservatively</b> on defense at the end. Steve DeBerg threw touchdown passes to Calvin Magee and Jeff Smith on the Buccaneers' first two possessions. On the Bears' next possession, Ron Holmes' hit on Mike Tomczak forced a fumble that was recovered in the end zone by Winston Moss to give the Buccaneers a 20–0 lead. The Bears scored two quick touchdowns in the second quarter, but the Buccaneers extended their lead with two Donald Igwebuike field goals. With the Bears struggling on offense, McMahon was inserted into the game. McMahon was 12 of 14 for 144yards and led the Bears to 156yards of offense in the last two drives, compared with 142 in the first 50minutes of the game. A win would have tied the Buccaneers with the Bears for first place in the NFC Central.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of the {{earliest}} production of high carbon steel in the Indian Subcontinent are found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu area, Golconda in Andhra Pradesh area and Karnataka, and in Samanalawewa areas of Sri Lanka. This {{came to be known}} as Wootz steel, produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally. The steel technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil, Arabic and Latin as the finest steel in the world exported to the Romans, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that time – what they called Seric Iron. A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period. The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD. In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India, the origin of steel technology in India can be <b>conservatively</b> estimated at 400–500 BC.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 the U.S. DOT <b>conservatively</b> {{identified}} a 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS {{review of the}} DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities. In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase {{by as much as}} 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the short}} track relay team won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. They {{qualified}} for the four-team final after edging out Japan and New Zealand, finishing second in their semi-final. The quartet adopted a plan of staying on their feet as the first priority, and remaining undisqualified and defeating {{at least one of}} the other three finalists. During the race, the Canadians fell and lost a significant amount of time, meaning that Australia would win a medal if they raced <b>conservatively</b> and avoided a crash. Late in the race, Nizielski was fighting with his American counterpart for track position to claim the silver medal, but took the safe option and yielded, mindful of the lost opportunity of the crash in Albertville. It was a successful campaign for the largest team that Australia had sent—apart from 1960. The 27 athletes recorded an unprecedented five top 10 finishes. Marshall placed first in the opening round of the aerials, but faded to sixth in the final, while Kerryn Rim placed eighth in the 15km biathlon and Steven Bradbury and Nizielski of the medal-winning relay team placed eighth and tenth in the 500m and 1,000m short track events respectively. In contrast to the previous games, the Australian short track speed skaters placed in the top half of the field in six of their eight individual starts. However, the Australians in the remaining disciplines generally finished in the bottom half of their competition.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{was offered}} a higher ranking {{position}} within Indiana Gas at the Chicago headquarters, but by then he had {{become aware of the}} business's connection to the corrupt and disgraced monopolist Charles T. Yerkes. A deeply religious man who feared involvement in any corruption, Haynes entertained the offer only briefly; Bertha's advice to refuse the position persuaded him and he declined the offer and instead sought a position more removed from the company's Chicago leadership. After the pipeline became fully operational in 1892, Haynes moved to Kokomo where he was made a supervisor of the Indiana Gas's local operations. The Indiana General Assembly began attempts to regulate the gas industry and accused the field operations of various companies of gross waste; Indiana Gas became the primary target of scathing reports. Haynes helped the company compile reports and offered opinions on the validity of their claims. He was disturbed to find that many of the claims proved true, and advocated that the gas be used more <b>conservatively.</b> He specifically recommended that the flambeaus (the flames fed by natural gas to show that the gas was flowing) be extinguished, as they were found to be the largest source of waste. He calculated that the company daily wasted $10,000 ($ in 2009 chained dollars) worth of gas by burning flambeaus, a figure that shocked the company's leaders. Despite his support of the governmental anti-waste regulations, he was steadfastly against other rules that regulated pressure and hindered productivity. He personally filed lawsuits against the regulations a month after their passage, claiming that the government had no right to regulate artificial increases in well pressure. The court case continued until 1896, when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the regulations were unconstitutional. The entire set of regulations was repealed, including the anti-waste measures. The gross waste continued among other companies and the field's wells began to run dry by 1905modern experts estimate as much as 90% of the one trillion cubic feet (30km3) of natural gas in the field was lost into the atmosphere or misused.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} resumed {{three weeks}} later in China, with the lead-in period to the race marked by Lotus F1 protesting the legality of Mercedes's rear wing design. The FIA rejected the protest, and with Mercedes allowed to continue racing with their car unchanged, Nico Rosberg took his – and the team's – first pole position since their return to Formula One in , while a penalty to Lewis Hamilton for a gearbox change promoted Michael Schumacher to second on the grid. Schumacher would ultimately retire from the race {{after the first round}} of stops when it was discovered that one of his wheels had not been attached properly. Rosberg took an early lead in the race, and while his attempt to complete the race with only two pit stops came under threat from second-placed Jenson Button, a mistake by Button's pit crew during his final stop handed Rosberg a nineteen-second advantage over Kimi Räikkönen. Räikkönen was attempting a similar two-stop strategy, but his tyres wore out seven laps {{from the end of the}} race, and he lost eleven positions in a single lap. This forced Rosberg to drive <b>conservatively</b> to preserve his tyres while Button recovered from his disastrous pit stop to pass Sebastian Vettel for second. Button was held up by the incumbent World Champion long enough for Rosberg to preserve his tyres, and he became the 103rd person to win a Grand Prix. The result was also Mercedes's first win as a constructor since Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1955 Italian Grand Prix. Button was second, with Hamilton scoring his third consecutive third place, giving him a two-point championship lead over Button; Fernando Alonso, who had been leading the championship before the race, finished ninth. After two retirements in the opening rounds of the championship, Romain Grosjean scored his first points in Formula One by finishing sixth.|$|E
