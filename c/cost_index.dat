Fifty-one houses were built, designed to be at least 30% more efficient than the Building Regulations then in force.

Energy World was preceded by the earlier Salford low-energy houses, built in the early 1980s, which continue to be 40% more efficient than the 2010 Building Regulations.|$|E

Standard ‘‘hedonic’’ analysis is applied to control for variation in project scale and features to extract the true time trends in costs for each market. The findings indicated that real construction costs generally have fallen slightly over the last 35 years. In addition, no correlation is found between costs and building activity. Causal (IV) analysis implies that the construction industry is elastically supplied to local real estate markets, with any ‘‘excess’’ profits going to land and developer entrepreneurship.
