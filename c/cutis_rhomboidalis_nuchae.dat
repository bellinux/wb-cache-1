50|$|Actinic elastosis usually {{appears as}} thickened, dry, {{wrinkled}} skin. Several clinical variants have been recorded. One {{of the most}} readily identifiable is the thickened, deeply fissured skin seen {{on the back of}} the chronically sun-exposed neck, known as <b>cutis</b> <b>rhomboidalis</b> <b>nuchae.</b> These features are a part of the constellation of changes that are seen in photoaged skin.|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} actinic skin lesions in patients with basal cell carcinoma of the head. MethodsA case-control study was carried out. Cases were patients with primary, solid basal cell carcinoma of the head, less than two centimeters in diameter; and as controls, patients with other dermatoses. Constitutional and behavioral variables were analyzed, as well as actinic lesions. ResultsOne hundred twenty cases and 360 controls were evaluated. Facial milia (OR= 2. 3), leukoderma punctata of the upper limbs (OR= 2. 9), and <b>cutis</b> <b>rhomboidalis</b> <b>nuchae</b> (OR= 1. 8) were associated with neoplasms regardless of other variables, suggesting a risk phenotype. There was also association with light hair and eye color phenotypes, family genetics, and cumulative sun exposure. Sunburn, smoking, and alcoholism were not identified as risk factors. The use of sunscreens showed no evidence of protection; however, the control group consisted of dermatology patients who are often prescribed sunscreens. ConclusionActinic lesions were more prevalent in patients with solid basal cell carcinoma of the head than in controls, especially milia, <b>cutis</b> <b>rhomboidalis</b> <b>nuchae,</b> and leukoderma punctata, regardless of other known risk factors...|$|E

40|$|FUNDAMENTOS: A incidência das neoplasias malignas cutâneas vem aumentando em todo o mundo, havendo pouca informação no Brasil sobre seus marcadores e suas lesões precursoras. OBJETIVOS: Identificar fatores de risco e marcadores cutâneos para essas lesões MÉTODOS: Caso-controle aninhado num estudo de prevalência de base populacional com adultos com idade igual ou {{superior}} a 50 anos, moradores da zona urbana de Pelotas. No estudo de prevalência aplicou-se um questionário com questões específicas para rastreamento de possíveis lesões cutâneas malignas ou pré-malignas recentes. As pessoas que responderam afirmativamente foram examinadas por dois médicos especialistas (padrão ouro). Uma subamostra daqueles que responderam não às perguntas já mencionadas foi sorteada e também foi examinada. A amostra total ficou constituída por 288 pessoas: 74 casos positivos, conforme o padrão ouro, e 214 controles sem lesões. O número e o tipo de lesão foram avaliados no momento da consulta com os especialistas. O protocolo continha variáveis sociodemográficas, comportamentais e exame dermatológico. A medida de efeito utilizada foi o Odds Ratio (OR), e para o controle dos fatores de confusão utilizou-se a regressão logística, com modelo hierarquizado RESULTADOS: Na análise multivariada permaneceram significativas as seguintes variáveis: idade 80 anos OR= 10, 21, pele branca OR= 4, 85, cabelos loiros/vermelhos OR= 3, 69; como marcadores de risco: elastose solar OR= 4, 35, <b>cutis</b> <b>rhomboidalis</b> <b>nuchae</b> OR= 2, 88 e mais de 10 melanoses solares no dorso das mãos OR= 6. CONCLUSÃO: Pessoas idosas, com pele clara, cabelos claros, com elastose solar, <b>cutis</b> <b>rhomboidalis</b> <b>nuchae</b> e grande número de melanoses solares nas mãos têm maior risco de apresentar queratoses actínicas e carcinomas basocelulares. BACKGROUND: Incidence of cutaneous neoplasms {{is increasing}} worldwide {{and there is}} little information from South Brazil about its markers and premalignant lesions. OBJECTIVES: To identify the risk factors and dermatological risk markers for cutaneous malignancies. METHODS: A case-control study nested in a population-based prevalence survey was performed in adults aged 50 living in the urban area of Pelotas. In the prevalence study, a questionnaire was applied to identify possible malignant or premalignant lesions and these subjects were examined by two doctors (gold standard). A sub-sample of the persons who answered No to the questions was also sent to the Ambulatory for the same procedure. The sample was constituted of 288 persons: 74 cases and 214 controls. The number and the type of efflorescence was evaluated at the interview with the doctors. The questionnaire also investigated socioeconomic level, behavioral variables and skin examination. The measure of effect used was the Odds Ratio (OR); and to control confounding factors, logistic regression, with hierarchical pattern, was utilized. RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis, the following variables remained significant: age 80 years (OR = 10. 21), white skin (OR = 4. 85), blond or red hair (OR = 3. 69) and risk markers: solar elastosis (OR = 4. 35), <b>cutis</b> <b>rhomboidalis</b> <b>nuchae</b> (OR = 2. 88) and more than 10 melanoses {{on the back of the}} hands (OR = 6. 0). CONCLUSION: Elderly individuals, with fair skin and hair, solar elastosis, <b>cutis</b> <b>rhomboidalis</b> <b>nuchae</b> and a great number of melanoses on the hands, are at high risk for actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma...|$|E

Os casos, constituídos por pacientes com carcinoma basocelular sólido, primário, menor que dois centímetros, no segmento cefálico; e controles, por pacientes com outras dermatoses. Foram analisadas variáveis constitucionais, comportamentais e lesões actínicas. RESULTADOS: Avaliaram-se 120 casos e 360 controles. Mílio facial (OR = 2, 3), leucodermia puntacta de membros superiores (OR = 2, 9) e cutis romboidalis nuchae (OR = 1, 8) associaram-se à neoplasia independentemente das demais variáveis, sugerindo um fenótipo de risco. Houve ainda associação com fenótipos claros, genética familiar e exposição solar cumulativa. Queimadura solar, tabagismo e alcoolismo não foram identificados como fatores de risco. O uso de fotoprotetores não evidenciou proteção; porém, o grupo controle era composto por pacientes dermatológicos, aos quais são indicados fotoprotetores regularmente. CONCLUSÃO: Lesões actínicas foram mais prevalentes em portadores de carcinoma basocelular sólido do segmento cefálico que em controles, especialmente mílio, cutis romboidalis nuchae e leucodermia puntacta, independentemente dos demais fatores de risco conhecidos.

40|$|Nevi can {{approximate}} the melanoma risk and demographic changes {{will increase the}} meaning of signs of skin aging (SSA). However, {{little is known about}} the epidemiology of nevi and SSA in the general adult population. We aimed to estimate the prevalence and age distribution of common and atypical nevi and SSA as well as gender differences in a large population-based sample. Within the Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region (KORA) in Germany, a population-based survey was performed. Data were gathered by interview and the number of pigmented lesions and presence of SSA were obtained by dermatological examination. A total of 2, 823 adults (mean age 49 years, 50 % women) participated (response 67 %). Most subjects (60. 3 %) exhibited 11 to 50 common nevi and 5. 2 % had at least one atypical nevus. 51. 9 % were diagnosed with elastosis (<b>Cutis</b> <b>rhomboidalis</b> <b>nuchae,</b> 18. 3 %; Morbus Favre Racouchot 1. 4 %). Ephelides were seen in 16 %, lentigines solaris in 62. 4 %, and lentigines seniles in 33. 2 %. All signs of skin aging increased significantly with age and so did lentigines solaris, seniles, and actinic keratoses. In contrast, common and atypical nevi and ephelides decreased significantly with age. Signs of skin aging are frequent and increase, in contrast to common and atypical nevi, with age...|$|E
40|$|Currently in today’s world, herbomineral based {{cosmetic}} formulations are continuously gaining popularity globally {{because they}} have a high safety profile and skin protection effects. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of a Consciousness Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect®) Treatment based test formulation and medium (DMEM) against different skin health parameters. The test formulation and DMEM were divided into two parts. One part of each received the Consciousness Energy Healing Treatment by James Jeffery Peoples and were termed as the Biofield Energy Treated samples, while the other samples were denoted as the untreated test items. MTT assay showed more than 70 % viable cells, indicating that the test formulation was safe and nontoxic in all the tested concentrations in three cell lines. The percent cell proliferation by BrdU assay was increased by 251. 30 %, 373. 36 %, and 722. 48 % at 8. 75, 17. 5, and 35 µg/mL, respectively in the BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group compared to the UT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation group. Collagen synthesis was significantly (p≤ 0. 001) increased by 32. 96 % in the UT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group at 2. 5 µg/mL with respect to the untreated group. Elastin was significantly (p≤ 0. 001) increased by 69. 49 % and 17. 13 % in the UT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation and BT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation groups, respectively at 10 µg/mL compared to the untreated group. The level of hyaluronic acid was increased remarkably by 14. 78 % in the BT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation group at 1. 25 µg/mL compared to the untreated group. Melanin was suppressed significantly by 14. 64 % and 18. 25 % in the UT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation and BT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation groups, respectively at 0. 13 µg/mL compared to the untreated group. Skin cells protection against UV-B exposure revealed that the percent cell viability was increased by 4. 23 % in the BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group at 2. 5 µg/mL compared to the untreated group. The wound healing activity by scratch assay showed significant wound closure and cell migration activity in the test formulation and DMEM group in both HFF- 1 and HaCaT cells compared to the untreated group. Altogether, the data suggests that the Biofield Energy Treated DMEM and test formulation showed better responses compared to the untreated group. Overall, the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation could be developed as an effective cosmetic product to protect and treat various skin problems including infection, photosensitivity, <b>cutis</b> <b>rhomboidalis</b> <b>nuchae,</b> erythema, contact dermatitis, behcet's disease, blepharitis, boil, bowen's disease, skin aging, wrinkles and/or change in skin colour, etc...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the Consciousness Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect®) Treatment based test formulation and medium (DMEM) against various skin health parameters using three cell lines i. e., HFF- 1, HaCaT, and B 16 -F 10. The various study parameters viz. collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid, melanin, cell viability against UV-B induced stress, and wound healing were evaluated. The test formulation and DMEM were divided into two parts. One part of the test formulation and one part of the DMEM received the Consciousness Energy Healing Treatment by Janice Patricia Kinney and were defined as the Biofield Energy Treated samples, while the other parts were denoted as the untreated test samples. Cell viability using MTT assay showed more than 70 % cells were viable in all the tested concentrations in three cells, indicating that the test formulation was safe and nontoxic. The collagen synthesis was significantly (p≤ 0. 001) increased by 22. 42 % and 17. 48 % in the UT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group at 0. 63 and 2. 5 µg/mL, respectively in relation to the UT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation group. The Elastin level was significantly (p≤ 0. 001) increased by 28. 41 % in the BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group at 5 µg/mL compared to the untreated group. Hyaluronic acid at 0. 63 µg/mL was increased significantly by 15. 90 % in the BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group compared to the untreated group. The level of melanin was reduced significantly by 9. 25 % and 7. 26 % in the BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group at 0. 013 and 0. 063 µg/mL, respectively in relation to the untreated group. Protection of skin cells after UV-B exposure data displayed that the cell viability was increased significantly by 17. 88 %, 20. 10 %, and 25. 77 % in the BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group at 0. 625, 1. 25, and 2. 5 µg/mL, respectively compared to the UT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation group. Wound healing data exhibited significant wound closure and cell migration activities in the HFF- 1 and HaCaT cells compared to the UT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation. Overall, the data suggests that the Biofield Energy Treated DMEM and test formulation demonstrated better responses compared to the untreated medium and test formulation with respect to the tested skin health parameters.
