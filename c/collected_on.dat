5|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero, also {{referred}} to as the Virgin Islands dwarf gecko, was discovered in the summer of 1964 by biologist Richard Thomas during a collecting trip along the dry, wooded slopes of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands. The holotype for Sphaerodactylus parthenopion, MCZ 77211, was an adult female <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> 12 August 1964 on a hillside above Pond Bay. A total of eight paratypes were <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> Virgin Gorda and used to describe the new species.|$|E

5|$|Among the Selfe family {{papers in}} Mitchell Library {{there is a}} large {{collection}} of postcards featuring bridges from across the world. Some were sent to Selfe by friends and relatives from Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Others, un-postmarked, were <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> his travels in 1884-85. These would have formed a research catalogue of contemporary international bridge-building practices for Selfe's own designs.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{leaves of}} the codex were {{scattered}} in several places of the monastery, from where they were <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> several occasions by people from France, Russia, and Italy. The first was Pierre Séguier (1588–1672), who bought 14 leaves which, known later as Fragmenta Coisliniana, and {{became a part of}} the Fonds Coislin. They were held in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In 1715 Bernard de Montfaucon published text of these 14 leaves. He made a few mistakes corrected by Tischendorf (in 1865). Tischendorf observed in Paris additional passage. Montfaucon used the manuscript for his palaeographical studies.|$|E
5|$|Data <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> Apollo 17 {{show that}} the valley is {{composed}} primarily of feldspar-rich breccia in the large massifs surrounding the valley and basalt underlying the valley floor, covered by an unconsolidated layer of regolith, or mixed materials, formed by various geologic events. Taurus–Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|E

5|$|Data {{obtained}} from the composition of soil samples <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> Apollo 15 show that most (about 90%) of the samples from the Apennine Front are brown-glass breccias, and approximately 60–70% {{obtained from}} the mare surface are basalt. Although the basalts seem to vary in their texture, their ages appear to be approximately the same. Most of the samples obtained on the Apennine Front are KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, phosphorus) materials, anorthosites, recrystallized norite, or recrystallized breccia.|$|E
5|$|Early medieval {{gardens in}} Islamic Spain resembled botanic gardens of the future, an example being the 11th-century Huerta del Ray garden of {{physician}} and author Ibn Wafid (999–1075 CE) in Toledo. This was later {{taken over by}} garden chronicler Ibn Bassal (fl. 1085 CE) until the Christian conquest in 1085 CE. Ibn Bassal then founded a garden in Seville, most of its plants being <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> a botanical expedition that included Morocco, Persia, Sicily, and Egypt. The medical school of Montpelier was also founded by Spanish Arab physicians, and by 1250 CE, it included a physic garden, but the site was not given botanic garden status until 1593.|$|E

5|$|In late 1969, Zappa {{broke up}} the band. He often cited the {{financial}} strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some {{took it as a}} sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> Weasels Ripped My Flesh and Burnt Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, a bounty was levied on J.lagostoma {{in order to reduce}} its numbers. Hunters were paid 6 pence (alternatively paid in rum) for every hundred claws collected. In 1879, the total bag for the island {{comprised}} 66 cats, 4,013 mice, 7,683 rats and 80,414 land crabs; in the eight years to 1887, bounties were <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> more than 330,000 crabs. The current population is much smaller, and the low level of recruitment and lack of juveniles suggests that the species may become endangered.|$|E
