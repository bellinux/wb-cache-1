40|$|Abstract The {{enormous}} {{development of}} wireless multimedia communication techniques requires new modeling methods. In this paper a novel analytical technique is presented, to examine wireless networks with multiple <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> {{that may change}} their generated traffic in time. By our method call-level system parameters can be calculated. We also propose two simple base station admission control policies and investigate {{the effect of these}} policies and the effect of reserved capacity for several <b>connection</b> <b>types.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|CTB was {{notoriously}} {{slow and}} buggy, and received mixed support from developers.

40|$|Bridge {{substructures}} {{are generally}} constructed using cast-in-place concrete {{and designed to}} undergo inelastic deformation in earthquake events. Although this construction approach {{has proven to be}} economical and provides adequate seismic performance through the formation of ductile plastic hinges, there are downsides relating to construction speed and quality, and post-earthquake repairability. This thesis explores two categories of Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) <b>connection</b> <b>types,</b> which use precast concrete instead of cast-in-place concrete to offer advantages including increased construction speed and quality. High Damage (HD) ABC <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> emulate the seismic behaviour of cast-in-place construction through the formation of ductile plastic hinges. Controlled Damage (CD) ABC <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> use unbonded post-tensioned precast connections to offer additional advantages including reduced residual drifts, limited and controlled damage and simple repair options. Novel buckling-restrained, fused mild steel energy dissipators suitable for use in CD connections are also developed and tested. These designs utilise 'dry' fabrication to simplify the fabrication process and minimise cost. Half-scale experimental testing is carried out to demonstrate both the assembly processes and behaviour under reversed cyclic uniaxial and biaxial loading representing an earthquake event. Following benchmark testing, repair strategies are applied to the CD <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> and the columns are tested again, representing a subsequent earthquake event. Good results are obtained from all cases with relatively straightforward construction and repair processes. With further developments and testing, the <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> proposed can provide competitive alternatives to conventional bridge pier design with regard to seismic performance and life cycle costs, with the additional benefits associated with precast construction...|$|R
