5|$|As well as {{causing the}} {{destruction}} of lands, foods and belongings, fire <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to divert manpower. 13th century Mongol armies regularly sent out small detachments from their main forces to start grass fires and fire settlements as diversions.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, David Stirling, {{an injured}} British forces Commando in the North Africa theatre, {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} small airborne special forces units to operate behind enemy lines. Whilst lobbying for support within Middle East Command it came to Clarke's attention, who offered his backing provided the force <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to help his own deception schemes.|$|E

5|$|Theoretically, {{a cardiac}} {{troponin}} activator {{could be useful}} for increasing cardiac contractility {{in the treatment of}} systolic heart failure, whereas a troponin inhibitor could be used to favor relaxation in the treatment of diastolic heart failure. Troponin modulators <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to reverse the impact of cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in the thin filament.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, {{graphene}} {{appears to}} be the strongest material ever tested. The process of separating it from graphite will require some further technological development before it is economical for industrial processes. If successful, graphene could be used in the construction of a space elevator. It <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to safely store hydrogen for use in a hydrogen based engine in cars.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{it being}} {{based on the}} same basic {{equipment}} as the original Mk. IV AI, BABS <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> with the Rebecca equipment, originally developed to home on ground transponders for dropping supplies over occupied Europe. The later Lucero unit was essentially an adapter for a Rebecca receiver, mating it to any existing display; AI, ASV, or H2S.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Adolf Hitler {{decided to}} expand the Reich Chancellery (Reichskanzlei), which he {{considered}} too small for his needs. On 21 July 1935, Leonhard Gall submitted plans for a large reception hall (that <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a ballroom) to be built onto the old Chancellery. The drawings were unique {{because of the large}} cellar that led a further one-and-a-half meters down to a bunker which later became known as the Vorbunker.|$|E
5|$|One further {{variation}} {{places a}} 6-sided die (although other sided die <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used)</b> {{on top of}} the bottle. If the bottle is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle in combination with other point-scoring shots.|$|E

5|$|The Svalbard Treaty {{specifies}} that {{no military}} installations are permitted on the archipelago. The Soviet authorities {{were concerned that}} a permanent civilian airport <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by Norwegian and NATO forces. But the Soviets also needed an airport to serve their settlements at Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and by the early 1970s, an understanding was reached between the two countries.|$|E
5|$|The painful stings of {{bees are}} mostly {{associated}} with the poison gland and the Dufour's gland which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various chemicals. In Lasioglossum leucozonium, the Dufour's Gland mostly contains octadecanolide {{as well as some}} eicosanolide. There is also evidence of n-triscosane, n-heptacosane, and 22-docosanolide. However, the secretions of these glands <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for nest construction.|$|E
5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as antibiotics.|$|E

5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters the lake {{in the form of}} non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} was closed it was almost {{immediately}} modified. The western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The siding is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for servicing trains. The siding tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it had its}} own {{branch line}} into Brookwood Cemetery, most of {{the route of the}} London Necropolis Railway ran on the {{existing}} London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Consequently, a site was selected in Waterloo, near the LSWR's recently opened London terminus at Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo). The building was specifically designed for the use of mourners. It had many private waiting rooms, which <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to hold funeral services, and a hydraulic lift to raise coffins to platform level. Existing railway arches were used for the storage of bodies.|$|E

5|$|Game Capture HD, which {{connects to}} gaming {{consoles}} to record gameplay, {{was introduced in}} 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. The device connects between a gaming console and the TV and {{is powered by a}} USB connection. It captures video as the console sends it to the television, compresses and stores it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that it <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to record iPad games with the right setup.|$|E
5|$|In Vision of the Future (1998), the Grand Admiral is {{revealed}} to be an impostor named Flim, employed by Moff Disra to motivate the Imperial troops. Major Grodin Tierce, the clone of a former stormtrooper imbued with Thrawn's tactical intellect by the Grand Admiral himself, strategized that the false Thrawn <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to rally support for the Empire and intimidate the New Republic. The tactic is successful until Admiral Pellaeon and the smuggler Talon Karrde—on opposing sides but desiring peace—expose Flim. Meanwhile, at a fortress called the Hand of Thrawn, Luke and Mara discover a gestating and near-complete clone of Thrawn, which is killed during their escape.|$|E
5|$|The Parthian Empire had no {{standing}} army, yet {{were able}} to quickly recruit troops {{in the event of}} local crises. There was a permanent armed guard attached to the person of the king, comprising nobles, serfs and mercenaries, but this royal retinue was small. Garrisons were also permanently maintained at border forts; Parthian inscriptions reveal some of the military titles granted to the commanders of these locations. Military forces <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in diplomatic gestures. For example, when Chinese envoys visited Parthia in the late 2nd century BC, the Shiji maintains that 20,000 horsemen were sent to the eastern borders to serve as escorts for the embassy, although this figure is perhaps an exaggeration.|$|E
50|$|The C major scale <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{generated}} <b>using</b> {{cycle of}} perfect fourths (C5), as 12 minus any coprime of twelve <b>is</b> <b>also</b> coprime with twelve: 12 &minus; 7 = 5. B-E-A-D-G-C-F.|$|R
