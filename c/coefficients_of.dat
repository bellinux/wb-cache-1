5|$|ENZO (Enzyme Kinetics) is a {{graphical}} interface {{tool for}} building kinetic models of enzyme catalyzed reactions. ENZO automatically generates the corresponding differential equations from a stipulated enzyme reaction scheme. These differential equations are processed by a numerical solver and a regression algorithm which fits the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> differential equations to experimentally observed time course curves. ENZO allows rapid evaluation of rival reaction schemes {{and can be}} used for routine tests in enzyme kinetics.|$|E

5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E

Fredlund Abstract: The modelling of flow through saturated/unsaturated soils has become routine in geotechnical and geo-environmental engineering. The analysis {{requires that the}} <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability for an unsaturated soil be defined. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability can be estimated based on currently available procedures. However, each procedure has limitations and consequently cares should be taken {{in the selection of}} a proper procedure. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability of a saturated soil is a function of void ratio. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability of an unsaturated soil of constant volume, {{is a function of the}} degree of saturation. However, soil is deformable and both the degree of saturation and the void-ratio influence the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability of a compressible, unsaturated soil. In this paper, the literature pertaining to the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability function for an unsaturated soil of constant volume and the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability for a deformable saturated soil are reviewed. A new <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability function for a deformable unsaturated porous medium is then developed.
