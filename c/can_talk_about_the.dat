500|$|Clarke {{explores the}} limits of [...] "English" [...] magic through the {{characters}} of Stephen Black and Vinculus. As Clarke explains, [...] "If you put a fairy next {{to a person who}} is also outside English society...suddenly {{the fact that there is}} this alien race seems more believable, because you've got another alien and the two of them <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> English in this very natural way." [...] The gentleman with the thistle-down hair sees Stephen as a noble savage and enslaves him—like Lady Pole, Stephen is silenced. Both [...] "suffer under a silencing spell that mimics gaps in the historical record". Furthermore, the gentleman's desire to acquire Stephen for his dancing hall is reminiscent of the English objectification of black slaves. Stephen vows to hate all white Englishmen after he discovers that they enslaved his mother, but when the gentleman shows him the hanging of the white Vinculus, he weeps. Both Strange and Norrell see the essence of Englishness in the Raven King, a character who was raised by fairies and could not speak English. As Elizabeth Hoiem explains, [...] "The most English of all Englishmen, then, is both king and slave, in many ways indistinguishable from Stephen Black. This paradox is what ultimately resolves the plot. When Strange and Norrell summon 'the nameless slave', the Raven King's powerful alliances with nature are transferred to Stephen Black, allowing Stephen to kill the Gentleman and free himself from slavery." [...] In the end, it is Strange and Norrell who are trapped in everlasting darkness while the silenced women, people of colour, and poor whites defeat the antagonist.|$|E

The latter was trying to force his protection racket on Short's White Elephant saloon but Luke rejected his offer. An infuriated Courtright stormed off the saloon, but later returned with two pistols visibly holstered in his belt.

Luke Short met with the two men outside and walked in the street while talking about their dispute. The group however, suddenly stopped at Ella Blackwell’s Shooting Gallery.

In the celebrated gunfight that followed, Short was the last man standing. In his own words, Short described what happened: ...|$|E

50|$|Most {{of these}} papers and lectures were {{indirectly}} or directly directed towards one end: {{a history of}} the figure of Jesus in popular and high culture in England and Germany since 1750. Frei seems to have found a new theological confidence bubbling up with this historical project, however: now, more than ever, the two sides of his work (which had been the source of his ambivalence in the 1970s) become inextricably linked. One moment he <b>can</b> be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rise of the professions in Germany and the impact that had on theology in the Universities.

As the Renascence {{expanded}} into the rationalism of recent centuries, nothing seemed so ridiculous as to butcher and bleed in a distant desert not only for a tomb, but an empty tomb. The last legend of them withered under the wit of Cervantes, though he himself had fought in the last Crusade at Lepanto.

They were dissected like strange beasts by the serene disgust of Gibbon, more serene than the similar horror with which he regarded the similar violence of the French Revolution. By our own time even the flippancy has become a platitude.
