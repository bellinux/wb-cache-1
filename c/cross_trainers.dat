40|$|Pre-participation {{screening}} is {{very important}} for prescribing and practising exercise safely. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate both ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and blood pressure responses in two different types of exercises with matching duration and indirectly determined working heart rate (HR). Participants were 23 male students, who were generally healthy but sedentary. The time course of their RPE and blood pressure during a 50 - minute work-out session on an arm crank ergometer and a <b>cross</b> <b>trainer</b> were compared. RM-ANOVA showed both a higher RPE (p < 0. 001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p < 0. 001) response to the arm exercise that were shown significantly correlated (r = 0. 883; p = 0. 008). Linear regression analysis (p = 0. 001) confirmed the ability to predict the time course of DBP by knowing the RPE on the arm crank ergometer. Even if people use the recommended relative intensity, the HR method is not always safe for health without pre-participation screening because exercise characteristics can negatively influence physiological responses. The HR method could be substituted by the RPE method...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} exercise in the treatment of depression. A number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated a reduction in depressive symptoms with both aerobic and non-aerobic exercise interventions. This has been supported in a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, the heterogeneous nature of the exercise intervention trials makes determining the appropriate program variables (frequency, intensity, duration and type of exercise) difficult. Design: A systematic review was undertaken on all RCTs reporting a significant treatment effect of exercise in the treatment of depression. Methods: Studies were analyzed for exercise frequency, intensity, session duration, exercise type, exercise mode, intervention duration, delivery of exercise, level and quality of supervision and compliance. Study quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Results: Five RCTs published since 2007 met the inclusion criteria and were subsequently analyzed. Most programs were performed three times weekly and of moderate intensity. All included trials used aerobic exercise, either treadmill or outdoor walking, stationary cycle or elliptical <b>cross</b> <b>trainer</b> exercise. Intervention duration ranged from four to twelve weeks. Both group and individual programs were shown to be effective in lowering the symptoms of depression. Some level of supervision is recommended. Conclusions: There is evidence for the use supervised aerobic exercise, undertaken three times weekly at moderate intensity for a minimum of nine weeks in the treatment of depression. Further research on the manipulation of program variables is warranted...|$|R

The <b>trainer</b> training effectiveness model is established again.

40|$|Resistance and aerobic {{exercise}} {{is recommended for}} cardiovascular health and disease prevention. However, the accompanying increase in arterial pressure during resistance exercise may be detrimental to vascular health. This study tests the vascular benefits of aerobic compared with resistance exercise on preventing impaired vascular function induced by a single weight lifting session {{that is associated with}} acute hypertension. Healthy, lean sedentary (SED) subjects, weight lifters, runners (> 15 miles/wk), and <b>cross</b> <b>trainers</b> (chronic aerobic and resistance exercisers), underwent a single progressive leg press weight lifting session with blood pressure measurements. Brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD; an index of arterial endothelial function) was determined using ultrasonography immediately before and after weight lifting. Sublingual nitroglycerin (0. 4 mg) was used to determine endothelium-independent dilation after weight lifting. All subjects were normotensive with similar blood pressure responses during exercise. Baseline FMD was lower in runners (5. 4 ± 0. 5 %; n = 13) and <b>cross</b> <b>trainers</b> (4. 44 ± 0. 3 %; n = 13) vs. SED (8. 5 ± 0. 8 %; n = 13; P = 0. 037). Brachial FMD improved in conditioned weight lifters (to 8. 8 ± 0. 9 %; P = 0. 007) and runners (to 7. 6 ± 0. 6 %; P < 0. 001) but not <b>cross</b> <b>trainers</b> (to 5. 3 ± 0. 6 %; P = NS) after acute hypertension. FMD was decreased in SED (to 5. 7 ± 0. 4 %; P = 0. 019). Dilation to nitroglycerin was similar among groups. These data suggest that endothelial responses are maintained after exposure to a single bout of weight lifting in resistance and aerobic athletes. Resistance and {{aerobic exercise}} may confer similar protection against acute vascular insults such as exertional hypertension...|$|E
