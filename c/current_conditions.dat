5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under <b>current</b> <b>conditions,</b> and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.|$|E

5|$|The Stukas {{also had}} an {{operational}} effect even when little damage was done. On 1 May 1940 Vice Admiral Lionel Wells commanded a Home Fleet expedition of seven destroyers, the heavy cruiser Berwick, the aircraft carriers Glorious and Ark Royal, and the battleship Valiant. The carriers mounted fighter patrols over the ships evacuating troops from Andalsnes. The Stuka waves (accompanied by He 111s) achieved several near misses but were unable to obtain a hit. Nevertheless, Wells ordered that no ship was to operate within range of the Ju 87's Norwegian airfields. The Ju 87's had, in effect, driven British sea power from the Norwegian coast. Moreover, Victor reported to the Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet Admiral, Charles Forbes, that carrier operations were no longer practical under the <b>current</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

First, in situ dynamic tests were performed and modal parameters (mode shapes and frequencies) were identified.

Comparing modal parameters of the finite element bridge model and the in situ experimental results through damage identification techniques, the bridge <b>current</b> <b>condition</b> was examined.

Cape Prime Minister, John Molteno, advised that under <b>current</b> <b>conditions</b> confederation was ill-suited to and badly timed for Southern Africa. It would lead to a lop-sided confederation with resulting instability and resentment. He advised that full union status was a better model, but only at a later date and once it was economically viable.|$|E
25|$|The Late Archaic period {{started about}} 3000 BC, when Florida's climate had reached <b>current</b> <b>conditions</b> {{and the sea}} had risen close to its present level. People {{commonly}} occupied both fresh and saltwater wetlands. Large shell middens accumulated during this period. Many people lived in large villages with purpose-built earthwork mounds, such as at Horr's Island, which had the largest permanently occupied community in the Archaic period in the southeastern United States. It also has the oldest burial mound in the East, dating to about 1450 BC. People began making fired pottery in Florida by 2000 BC. By about 500 BC, the Archaic culture, which had been fairly uniform across Florida, began to fragment into regional cultures.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountains}} of the East-Zagros, the Kuh-i-Jupar (4135 m), Kuh-i-Lalezar (4374 m) and Kuh-i-Hezar (4469 m) do not currently have glaciers. Only at Zard Kuh and Dena some glaciers still survive. However, before the Last Glacial Period {{they had been}} glaciated to a depth in excess of 1900 meters, and during the Last Glacial Period to a depth in excess of 2160 meters. Evidence exists of a 20km wide glacier fed along a 17km long valley dropping approximately 1500 meters along its length {{on the north side}} of Kuh-i-Jupar with a thickness of 350-550m. Under precipitation conditions comparable to the <b>current</b> <b>conditions,</b> this size of glacier could be expected to form where the annual average temperature was between 10.5 and 11.2°C, but since conditions are expected to have been dryer during the period in which this glacier was formed, the temperature must have been lower.|$|E
