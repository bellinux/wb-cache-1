40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> is a bisphosphonate {{used in the}} {{prevention}} and treatment of postmenopausal bone loss. Previous evidence suggests a direct dose-response relationship for the densitometric effect of <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid.</b> Therefore, as it is widely accepted that {{a reduction in the}} dosing frequency of bisphosphonates may improve adherence and therefore therapeutic outcomes, an increase in the interval between consecutive administrations of <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> might be associated with a concomitant increase in the overall bisphosphonate dose received. However, to our knowledge, a direct comparison of the effects of intramuscular <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> 100 [*]mg once weekly with a regimen consisting of a higher dose and a longer interval between two consecutive administrations is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the increase in bone mineral density (BMD) achieved with two different administration schemes of intramuscular <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (100 [*]mg once weekly and 200 [*]mg every 2 weeks) in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial was conducted in the Osteoporosis and Instrumental Diagnosis Center 'OsteoArticolar' (University of Siena, Siena, Italy) between January 2007 and December 2009. PATIENTS: Consecutive women aged 50 - 80 years with postmenopausal osteoporosis, diagnosed ≥ 5 years prior to inclusion in the study, were eligible for participation in this study. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive either intramuscular <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (Clasteon®) 100 [*]mg (group A) [*]+[*]lidocaine (lignocaine) once weekly or intramuscular <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> 100 [*]mg[*]+[*]lidocaine for two consecutive days every 2 weeks (group B), for 2 years.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundBisphosphonates are the {{standard}} of care for {{reducing the risk of}} skeletal-related events in patients with bone lesions from multiple myeloma. The MRC Myeloma IX study was designed to compare the effects of zoledronic acid versus <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. Here, we report the secondary outcomes relating to skeletal events. MethodsPatients (≥ 18 years) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were enrolled from 120 centres in the UK and received intensive or non-intensive antimyeloma treatment. A computer-generated randomisation sequence was used to allocate patients in a 1 : 1 ratio, through an automated telephone service to intravenous zoledronic acid (4 mg every 21 – 28 days) or oral <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (1600 mg/day), and the drugs were continued at least until disease progression. No investigators, staff, or patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoints—overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate—and adverse events have been reported previously. We assessed between-group differences with Cox proportional hazards models for time to first skeletal-related event and incidence of skeletal-related events. These were defined as fractures, spinal cord compression, radiation or surgery to bone, and new osteolytic lesions. Data were analysed until disease progression. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN 68454111. Findings 1960 patients were randomly assigned and analysed— 981 in the zoledronic acid group and 979 in the <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> group. This trial is fully enrolled, and follow-up continues. At a median follow-up of 3 · 7 years (IQR 2 · 9 – 4 · 7), patients in the zoledronic acid group had a lower incidence of skeletal-related events than did those in the <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> group (265 [27 %] vs 346 [35 %], respectively; hazard ratio 0 · 74, 95 % CI 0 · 62 – 0 · 87; p= 0 · 0004). Zoledronic acid was also associated with a lower risk of any skeletal-related event in the subsets of patients with (233 [35 %] of 668 vs 292 [43 %] of 682 with clodronic acid; 0 · 77, 0 · 65 – 0 · 92; p= 0 · 0038) and without bone lesions at baseline (29 [10 %] of 302 vs 48 [17 %] of 276 with clodronic acid; 0 · 53, 0 · 33 – 0 · 84; p= 0 · 0068). Fewer patients in the zoledronic acid group had vertebral fractures than did those in the <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> group (50 [5 %] in the zoledronic acid group vs 88 [9 %] in the <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> group; p= 0 · 0008), other fractures (45 [5 %] vs 66 [7 %]; p= 0 · 04), and new osteolytic lesions (46 [5 %] vs 95 [10 %]; p< 0 · 0001). InterpretationThe results of this study support the early use of zoledronic acid rather than <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma for the prevention of skeletal-related events, irrespective of bone disease status at baseline.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundBisphosphonates {{reduce the}} risk of {{skeletal}} events in patients with malignant bone disease, and zoledronic acid has shown potential anticancer effects in preclinical and clinical studies. We aimed to establish whether bisphosphonates can affect clinical outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma. MethodsPatients of age 18 years or older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were enrolled from 120 centres in the UK. Computer-generated randomisation sequence was used to allocate patients equally, via an automated telephone service, to receive 4 mg zoledronic acid as an infusion every 3 – 4 weeks or 1600 mg oral <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> daily. Patients also received intensive or non-intensive induction chemotherapy. No investigators, staff, or patients were masked to treatment allocation, and bisphosphonate and maintenance therapy continued at least until disease progression. The primary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate. We assessed between-group differences with Cox proportional hazards models for progression-free survival and overall survival, and with logistic regression models for overall response rate. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN 68454111. Findings 1970 patients were enrolled between May, 2003, and November, 2007, of whom 1960 were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis: 981 in the zoledronic acid group (555 on intensive chemotherapy, 426 on non-intensive chemotherapy); and 979 on <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (556 on intensive chemotherapy, 423 on non-intensive chemotherapy). The treatment cutoff was Oct 5, 2009, with patients receiving bisphosphonates for a median of 350 days (IQR 137 – 632) before disease progression, with a median of 3 · 7 years' follow-up (IQR 2 · 9 – 4 · 7). Zoledronic acid reduced mortality by 16 % (95 % CI 4 – 26) versus <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (hazard ratio [HR] 0 · 84, 95 % CI 0 · 74 – 0 · 96; p= 0 · 0118), and extended median overall survival by 5 · 5 months (50 · 0 months, IQR 21 · 0 to not reached vs 44 · 5 months, IQR 16 · 5 to not reached; p= 0 · 04). Zoledronic acid also significantly improved progression-free survival by 12 % (95 % CI 2 – 20) versus <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (HR 0 · 88, 95 % CI 0 · 80 – 0 · 98; p= 0 · 0179), and increased median progression-free survival by 2 · 0 months (19 · 5 months, IQR 9 · 0 – 38 · 0 vs 17 · 5 months, IQR 8 · 5 – 34 · 0; p= 0 · 07). Rates of complete, very good partial, or partial response did not differ significantly between the zoledronic acid and <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> groups for patients receiving intensive induction chemotherapy (432 patients [78 %] vs 422 [76 %]; p= 0 · 43) or non-intensive induction chemotherapy (215 [50 %] vs 195 [46 %]; p= 0 · 18). Both bisphosphonates were generally well tolerated, with similar occurrence of acute renal failure and treatment-emergent serious adverse events, but zoledronic acid was associated with higher rates of confirmed osteonecrosis of the jaw (35 [4 %]) than was <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> (3 [< 1 %]). InterpretationConsistent with the potential anticancer activity of zoledronic acid, overall survival improved independently of prevention of skeletal-related events, showing that zoledronic acid has treatment benefits beyond bone health. These findings support immediate treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, not only for prevention of skeletal-related events, but also for potential antimyeloma benefits.

40|$|Purpose: MRC Myeloma IX was a phase III trial {{evaluating}} bisphosphonate and thalidomide-based {{therapy for}} newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Results were reported previously after a median follow-up of 3. 7 years (Current Controlled Trials number: ISRCTN 68454111). Survival outcomes were re-analyzed after an extended follow-up (median: 5. 9 years). Experimental design: At first randomization, patients (N = 1, 970) {{were assigned to}} bisphosphonate (<b>clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> or zoledronic acid) and induction therapies (cyclophosphamide-vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone [CVAD] or cyclophosphamide-thalidomide-dexamethasone [CTD] followed by high-dose therapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation for younger/fitter patients [intensive pathway], and melphalan-prednisone (MP) or attenuated CTD [CTDa] for older/less fit patients [non-intensive pathway]). At second randomization, patients were assigned to thalidomide maintenance therapy or no maintenance. Interphase FISH (iFISH) was used to analyze cytogenics. Results: Zoledronic acid significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR], 0. 89; P = 0. 02) and overall survival (OS; HR, 0. 86; P = 0. 01) compared with <b>clodronic</b> <b>acid.</b> In the intensive pathway, CTD demonstrated non-inferior PFS and OS compared with CVAD, with a trend toward improved OS in patients with favorable cytogenics (P = 0. 068). In the non-intensive pathway, CTDa significantly improved PFS (HR, 0. 81; P = 0. 007) compared with MP {{and there was an}} emergent survival benefit after 18 - 24 months. Thalidomide maintenance improved PFS (HR, 1. 44; P < 0. 0001) but not OS (HR, 0. 96; P = 0. 70), and was associated with shorter OS in patients with adverse cytogenics (P = 0. 01).

40|$|At present, {{there is}} no cure for bone metastasis. The current goals in patient care are to {{palliate}} pain, prevent pathological bone fracture and increase the strength and function of bone, so as to extend the life expectancy and maintain a good quality of life. Bisphosphonate treatment is the currently standard therapy of bone metastasis and is commonly used by physicians; it alleviates the tumour-induced hypercalcemia in 90 % of patients and reduces the metastatic bone pain in 50 % of patients. Moreover, it also prevents the pathological fracture of the affected bones. However, while effective, bisphosphonate injections are very costly, though its oral formulation is less expensive it is also less efficacious, and causes gastrointestinal discomfort. Furthermore, prolonged use of bisphosphonate treatment may lead to certain adverse effects, including hypocalcemia. These factors will prohibit the longterm use of such medication as it can negatively affect the treatment outcome. Based on enormous medical potentials illustrated by the aforementioned findings, BBYNG deserves wider clinical application, large-scale clinical study on its preventive effect against bone metastasis and detailed investigation of its mode(s) of action in the body. Based on the above-described understanding of Chinese medicine and bone metastasis, supplementing the kidney and strengthening bone could be the basic principle for the treatment of bone metastasis using Chinese medicine. In view of this theory, and in addition to the clinical observation and a thorough search of the available literature, we selected relevant kidney-tonifying Chinese herbs, namely (Fructus Ligustri Lucidi), (Rhizoma Drynariae), (Herba Epimedii), (Psoralea Corylifolia) and wide-spectrum anticancer herbs (Herba Hedyotidis Diffusae) for the preparation of a combined formula [...] BBYNG. Chinese medicine has long been used to treat cancers. Its advantages reside in its holistic properties, which bring palliative, corrective and convalescing functions against damage caused by radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. These features position Chinese medicines as the adjuvant to orthodox cancer treatment. During the late stage of tumour development, when standard therapy is no longer effective, Chinese medicine plays a critical role as an integrated therapy. Searching for a safe, inexpensive and effective Chinese medicine preparation suitable for prolonged use as adjunct therapy in late cancer cases is of paramount importance. Clinical results. Both Chinese medicine and Western medicine treated patients showed no significant change in their blood parameters or liver and kidney examinations before and after drug administration; Male subjects on BBYNG, their bone mass density remained stable after 6 months treatment and the subjects on OSTAC showed slightly decreased In females, subjects on BBYNG remained stable, but subjects on OSTAC slightly increased. Clinical study. The study was designed as a randomized, parallel-group comparison between BBYNG formula and Bisphosphonate. The patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive either BBYNG granules, which was prepared by a GMP manufacturer, or <b>Clodronic</b> <b>acid.</b> The treatment period was 6 months (24 weeks). For both groups, various clinical parameters such as body functions, blood examinations, bone density (BMD) assessment, X-ray examinations, pain intensity and quality of life were evaluated and compared. Conclusions. (1) As an adjuvant to patients with bone metastases, BBYNG is effective in relieving the metastatic bone pain, improving the quality of life. (2) In the animal model, BBYNG reduced the metastatic bone damage, prolonged the survival and enhanced the T lymphocyte immunity in the tumour-bearing mice. (3) In vitro study on the breast and lung cancer cell lines showed that BYYNG could induce apoptosis and prevent tumour cell invasion. It suggests that BYYNG may restrict tumour growth and development, thus reducing the occurrence of bone metastasis. In accordance with Chinese medicine, bone metastasis can be categorized into "bone tumour" "bone erosion" "bone wilting" "bone necrosis" and "bone impediment". The main cause of bone metastasis is twofold: cancer toxicity, and in Chinese medicine theory, the kidney governs the bone marrow, if the kidney is not functioning in balance, then the bone will become weak. Cancer toxicity is the "pathogenic cause" to skeletal metastases, while kidney weakness decreases the body defence against the cancer. A vicious cycle ensues when cancer and kidney deficiency and bone weakness occurs simultaneously coincidently and worsens the conditions. In vitro study on tumour cell lines. The anticancer effects of different concentrations of BBYNG formula and various single components against human breast cancer and lung cancer cell lines were evaluated by cell viability test (MTT assay), cell apoptosis test and invasion suppression test. In vitro study results. BBYNG and the aqueous extracts of its component herbs at very low drug concentrations stimulated the growth of three tumour cell lines tested. When the concentrations were slightly increased, they showed an inhibitory effect on cancer cell proliferation. As the drug concentrations further increased, the extracts showed cytotoxic effects on these tumor cells. At the noncytotoxic dose, the extracts could trigger apoptosis and enhance the caspase- 3 activity in all three tumour cell lines. In addition, at this "non toxic" concentration, the extracts markedly inhibited the in vitro invasive property of the 4 T 1 breast cancer cell lines in our Matrigel invasion model. Thus these in vitro results suggested that BBYNG possess anticancer, invasion-inhibitory and anti-metastatic activities. In vivo animal study results. (Tumour growth was slower in the BBYNG treatment group when compared to the OSTAC and control groups, but this was not significantly difference) BBYNG significantly delayed tumour growth in tumour bearing mice, but it did not minimize the tumour size markedly. Moreover, BBNYG did minimize the mobility restriction caused by tumours, reduce the damage to bones, prolong the survival time and enhanced the T lymphocyte immunity. In vivo animal study. A well-established animal model for breast cancer was used to evaluate and compare the pharmacological effects of BBYNG formula and <b>Clodronic</b> <b>acid,</b> as shown by different indicators such as tumour progression, animal's mobility, survival time, bone metastasis-induced fracture intensity and the immunological status of the tumour-bearing mice. Malignant tumour is characterized by early metastasis. Among them 37 to 80 (depending on which type of cancer) patients show tendency of bone metastasis. Bone metastasis is usually accompanied by various complications, such as severe pain, pathological bone fracture, hypercalcemia, and bone marrow suppression, which can substantially affect {{the quality of life of}} the patients. Thus, the prevention and treatment of bone metastasis in cancer is an issue worth pursuing. Malignant tumours leading to high mortality and morbidity are a serious threat to human health. It is the leading cause of death in China. In Hong Kong, there are over 20 thousand new cancer cases and more than 1100 people die due to cancers every year. Study objectives. To elucidate the efficacy and some pharmacological aspects of BBYNG in regard to the treatment of bone metastasis through clinical observation and different laboratory experiments. This study would be of significant reference value to the disease-oriented drug formulation and application, mechanistic study and research methodology of the treatment of bone metastasis using Chinese medicines. The clinical and laboratory experimental results are summarized as below:The research study is composed of three parts, the clinical study, in vivo animal study and in vitro study on tumour cell lines. The research methods used are as follows:Those on BBYNG treatment showed more a stable and satisfactory quality of life than those in the Western medicine-treated group. For the <b>Clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment group, patients generally showed worsened symptoms and quality of life deteriorated. The ECOG index of the BBYNG group was statistically better than that of the <b>Clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> group. Within the 72 -week clinical observational period, the mortality of <b>Clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> group is significantly higher that of the BBYNG group. The effects of BBYNG group as presented in relieving the pain-induced influence on patients' emotion, interpersonal relationship and entertainment was more pronounced than that in the <b>Clodronic</b> <b>acid</b> group.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} change in the therapeutic approach to patients with Paget's disease of bone over the last 40 years. In the 1960 s, only symptomatic therapy could be given, with control of pain the main objective. Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly used agents. From 1968 onwards, antiosteoclastic agents became available, including calcitonin, plicamycin (mithramycin) and etidronate (etidronic acid), a first-generation bisphosphonate. Limitations with these agents, including potentially deleterious effects on bone mineralization with etidronate (etidronic acid), has cleared the way for increasingly potent second- and third-generation bisphosphonates, including clodronate (<b>clodronic</b> <b>acid),</b> pamidronate (pamidronic acid), alendronate (alendronic acid) and risedronate (risedronic acid). Even more potent bisphosphonates will become available in the near future. With the newer bisphosphonates, there is some hope for long-term remission (if not definitive healing) of pagetic lesions, as well as prevention of long-term complications in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Thus, indications for therapy have been extended to include younger patients to prevent bone deformity of the limbs and skull, leading to secondary osteoarthritis, facial deformities and potentially to sarcoma transformation; as well as to elderly patients to prevent bone fragility, leading to fracture, and pagetic vascular steal syndromes. The increased potency and longer duration of action of newer bisphosphonates more than compensates for their marginally increased cost compared with older bisphosphonates...|$|E
