5|$|A 1994 {{study of}} the nilgai's diet in the Sariska Reserve {{revealed}} its preference for herbs and grasses; grasses became {{more important in the}} rainy season, while during winter and summer it fed additionally on flowers (Butea monosperma), foliage (Anogeissus pendula, Capparis sepiaria, Grewia flavescens and Zizyphus mauritiana), pods (Acacia nilotica, A. catechu and A. leucophloea) and fruits (Zizyphus mauritiana). Preferred grass species include Cenchrus species, Cynodon dactylon, Desmostachya bipinnata, Scirpus tuberosus and Vetiveria zizanoides. Woody plants eaten include Acacia nilotica, A. senegal, A. leucophloea, <b>Clerodendrum</b> phlomidis, Crotalaria burhia, Indigofera oblongifolia, Morus alba and Zizyphus nummularia; herbs favoured are Cocculus hirsutus, Euphorbia hirta and Sida rhombifolia. Seeds of Paspalum distichum occurred in the dung of nilgai most of the year; Acacia nilotica and Prosopis juliflora seeds were discovered in the dry season and those of Echinochloa crusgalli during the monsoon.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, a {{study of}} four {{chloroplast}} DNA intergenic spacers showed that part of <b>Clerodendrum</b> was closer to the New world genera than to other <b>Clerodendrum,</b> and that one species of <b>Clerodendrum</b> was nested within the clade of New World genera. The authors of this study resurrected the genus Volkameria and assigned to it about 30 species {{that had been in}} <b>Clerodendrum.</b> They also resurrected Ovieda as a monotypic genus consisting of [...] Ovieda spinosa. Volkameria and Ovieda had been erected by Linnaeus in 1753. Modern cladistic analysis has largely vindicated his concepts of <b>Clerodendrum</b> and its relatives.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clerodendrum</b> colebrookianum (syn. <b>Clerodendrum</b> glandulosum), {{commonly}} known as East Indian Glory Bower, is a perennial shrub belonging to the family Lamiaceae, but sometimes classified under Verbenaceae. It {{is one of the}} most well known among ~400 species of <b>Clerodendrum,</b> as it is widely used in traditional practices, such as for vegetable and treatments of diabetes, hypertension, cough and rheumatism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clerodendrum</b> {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Endoclita malabaricus and Endoclita sericeus. Both butterflies and hummingbirds are often attracted to blooming <b>clerodendrum.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Clerodendrum</b> phlomidis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the Lamiaceae family. The plant {{has been used in}} Ayurvedic medicine, and some Ayurvedic sources refer to it by the synonym <b>Clerodendrum</b> multiflorum.|$|E
50|$|They are shrubs, lianas, {{and small}} trees, usually growing to 1 - 12 m tall, with {{opposite}} or whorled leaves. C. floribundum can grow to 30 m tall. <b>Clerodendrum</b> fistulosum and <b>Clerodendrum</b> myrmecophila have hollow stems that are inhabited by ants. <b>Clerodendrum</b> trichotomum {{is a common}} ornamental in warmer parts of the world. Eight other species are also grown in the tropics for their abundant and attractive flowers. One of these, <b>Clerodendrum</b> macrostegium, suckers abundantly from the roots, often producing a thicket within a few years. A few other species are also found, somewhat rarely, in cultivation.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, a {{study of}} DNA {{sequences}} showed that the monospecific Australian genus Huxleya was embedded in a clade of <b>Clerodendrum</b> species that had formerly been placed in Volkameria. Huxleya was then sunk into synonymy with <b>Clerodendrum.</b> The 2004 study sampled Aegiphila, Tetraclea, and Amasonia, three New World genera of Ajugoideae that had not previously been sampled for DNA. The {{results of this study}} cast doubt, once again, upon the monophyly of <b>Clerodendrum.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 2010, a {{molecular}} phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences showed {{that most of}} the <b>Clerodendrum</b> species that had been in Volkameria were more closely related to Aegiphila, Ovieda, Tetraclea, and Amasonia than to other species of <b>Clerodendrum.</b> (See the phylogenetic tree at Lamiaceae). Following these results, Volkameria was reinstated. Some species that had been erroneously placed in Volkameria were excluded.

50|$|<b>Clerodendrum</b> tomentosum, {{known as}} the downy chance, hairy lolly bush, hairy clairy or hairy <b>clerodendrum</b> is a shrub or small tree {{occurring}} in eastern and northern Australia. Distributed from Batemans Bay (35° S) in southern coastal New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory, Western Australia, and New Guinea.|$|E
5000|$|The curious {{common name}} of downy chance refers {{to both the}} generic and species name. <b>Clerodendrum</b> is from the Greek. Meaning [...] "lottery tree". Dendros meaning tree. The lottery refers to unsure {{possibility}} of medicinal value from plants of this genus. The generic name <b>Clerodendrum</b> was coined by the father of modern taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus. Tomentosum refers to downy or hairy leaves. Recent phylogenetic {{studies have shown that}} the genus <b>Clerodendrum</b> belongs in the mint family. Consequently, this species is now removed from the verbena family and placed in Lamiaceae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clerodendrum</b> {{is derived}} from Greek and means 'chance tree'.|$|E
