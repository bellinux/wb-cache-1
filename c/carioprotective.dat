40|$|Space maintainers {{make good}} oral hygiene difficult, modify the oral environment, and {{increase}} the chances of enamel demineralization. Demineralization can be prevented or reduced by improving patient oral hygiene or by using topical fluorides. However these methods depend on patient compliance and, therefore, are not very reliable. Thus, caries prevention in banding might be enhanced by using fluoride-releasing cements. The aim {{of the study was}} to comparatively evaluate the <b>carioprotective</b> potential of various luting media used for band cementation in permanent as well as deciduous molars. In this study, 100 molars were taken, which were banded and stored in artificial saliva for 1 month after which the teeth were debanded. An area of 2 x 2 mm was spared and the teeth were coated with nail varnish. The coated teeth were dipped in artificial caries solution in one month followed by 1 -day immersion in methylene blue dye, after which the samples were sectioned through the window. The depth of dye penetration was measured and the results were statistically analyzed. Minimum dye penetration was observed with glass ionomer, which could be due to the fluoride release from the cement, whereas the control group showed the maximum, probably due to direct contact with the artificial caries solution...|$|E
