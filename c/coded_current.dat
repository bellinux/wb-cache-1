40|$|Nowadays {{the problem}} of {{interferences}} that involve railway signaling systems {{is becoming more and}} more important in some railway networks. New electrical and electronic applications in power supply increase the electromagnetic compatibility problems in particular signalling systems like the <b>Coded</b> <b>Current</b> Automatic Block (BACC), installed on about 4400 km of Italian conventional railway lines. Remaining in the sphere of a traditional 3 kV d. c. traction system and apart from its interaction with other types of system, interferences with signalling systems can be produced by the traction inverters installed on the board of the roiling stock and by the electrical substation (ESS) converters. In this paper critical working conditions of the ESS converters, due to the presence of internal failures, will be analysed. A consequence of these internal failures is that 50 Hz harmonic current can be produced on the d. c. side and disturb the BACC operating...|$|E
40|$|In this brief, {{we first}} {{introduce}} a process-variation-aware test-point generation method. With this method, faults are not obscured by process variations {{and we are}} able to generate new test points by measuring a very limited number of current values on-chip and estimating values of the remaining currents. We furthermore introduce a multiple-fault diagnosis procedure where we use the process-variation aware test-point generation method. The proposed methods can also be used for structural test. For the application, we have used a thermometer <b>coded</b> <b>current</b> steering digital to analog converter, as they are widely used due to their suitability for high speed applications and the symmetric design is suitable for the application of our method. We introduce a design-for-test hardware for the diagnosis cost reduction, while implementing our methods. Experimental results show that parametric errors as small as 20 % can be diagnosed with up to 97. 8 % accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Indexing data {{structures}} are well-known to be {{crucial for the}} efficiency of the current state-of-the-art theorem provers. Examples are discrimination trees, which are like tries where terms are seen as strings and common prefixes are shared, and substitution trees, where terms keep their tree structure and all common contexts can be shared. Here we describe a new indexing data structure, context trees, where, by means of a limited kind of context variables, also common subterms can be shared, even if they occur below different function symbols. Apart from introducing the concept, we also provide evidence for its practical value. We describe an implementation of context trees based on Curry terms and on an extension of substitution trees with equality constraints and where one does not distinguish between internal and external variables. Experiments with matching show that our preliminary implementation is already competitive with tightly <b>coded</b> <b>current</b> state-of-the-art implementations of the other main techniques. In particular space consumption of context trees is substantially less than for other index structures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – A {{design for}} test (DFT) {{hardware}} is proposed {{to increase the}} controllability of a thermometer <b>coded</b> <b>current</b> steering digital to analog converter. A procedure is introduced to reduce the diagnosis and structural test time from quadratic to linear using the proposed DFT hardware. To evaluate {{the applicability of the}} proposed technique, principal component analysis is used to create virtual process variations to simulate in lieu of semiconductor fabrication data. An architecture specific soft fault model is suggested for the diagnosis problem. Random errors according to the fault model are introduced in the virtual test environment on top of the process variations and it is shown that diagnosis of a fault is possible with high accuracy with the proposed method. The same technique employing principal component analysis is furthermore used to provide process variation-aware reference test comparison values for a structural test of the DAC. The structural test provides a mechanism to test for even unmodeled manufacturing faults. The process variation-aware test values help detect defects even under process variations. The proposed DFT hardware and method are low cost and quite suitable for a built-in self diagnosis and test implementation. I...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} {{concepts of}} gradient current power supplies are introduced, which {{are suitable for}} the generation of ultra-high intensity pulsed magnetic field gradients of alternating polarity. The first system consists of a directly binary <b>coded</b> <b>current</b> source (DBCCS). It yields current pulses of up to ± 120 A and a maximum voltage across the gradient coil of ± 400 V. The second system consists of two TECHRON 8606 power supplies in push–pull configuration (PSPPC). It yields current pulses of up to ± 100 A and a maximum voltage across the gradient coil of ± 300 V. In combination with actively shielded anti-Helmholtz gradient coils, both systems are used routinely in NMR diffusion studies with unipolar pulsed field gradients of up to 35 T/m. Until now, alternating pulsed field gradient experiments were successfully performed with gradient intensities of up to ± 25 T/m (DBCCS) and ± 35 T/m (PSPPC), respectively. Based on the observation of the NMR spin echo {{in the presence of}} a small read gradient, procedures to test the stability and the matching of such ultra-high pulsed field gradient intensities as well as an automated routine for the compensation of possible mismatches are introduced. The results of these procedures are reported for the PSPPC system...|$|E

30|$|From Eq. (12), we {{see that}} if PML[*]=[*]PMU[*]=[*]PMUL, the flagCB is set to 1 and the <b>current</b> <b>coding</b> block is {{determined}} to belong to KPL. Otherwise, flagCB is set to 0 and the <b>current</b> <b>coding</b> block is determined to belong to HPL. The main reason is that if PML[*]=[*]PMU[*]=[*]PMUL, the <b>current</b> <b>coding</b> block {{is likely to have}} the same prediction mode as its neighboring blocks (left neighboring block, up neighboring block, and up-left neighboring block), which indicates that the <b>current</b> <b>coding</b> block and its neighboring blocks have a similar texture information and structural characteristics and they belong to the homogenous texture areas. Therefore, the <b>current</b> <b>coding</b> block is grouped into KPL. If the flagCB is equal to 0, which means that the <b>current</b> <b>coding</b> block is quite different from its neighboring blocks, the <b>current</b> <b>coding</b> block is grouped into HPL.|$|R
