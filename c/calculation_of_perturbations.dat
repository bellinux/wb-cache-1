40|$|We {{compute the}} {{spectrum}} of scalar and tensor metric perturbations generated, as amplified vacuum fluctuations, during an epoch of dilaton-driven inflation of the type occurring naturally in string cosmology. In the tensor case the computation is straightforward while, in the scalar case, it is made delicate {{by the appearance of}} a growing mode in the familiar longitudinal gauge. In spite of this, a reliable perturbative <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perturbations</b> far outside the horizon can be performed by resorting either to appropriate gauge invariant variables, or to a new coordinate system in which the growing mode can be "gauged down". The simple outcome of this complicated analysis is that both scalar and tensor perturbations exhibit nearly Planckian spectra, whose common "temperature" is related to some very basic parameters of the string-cosmology background.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{formalism}} for the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perturbations</b> of ray trajectories and amplitudes in laterally heterogeneous medium. A Hamiltonian technique {{leads to a}} unified approach for the calculation of paraxial rays and rays perturbed by small changes of velocity distribution and interface shape. Instead of using ray centred coordinates as in the classical approach to dynamic ray tracing, we use straightforward Cartesian coordinates. This has the advantage that paraxial rays may be referred to the unperturbed ray in a very flexible way. We first study perturbation of initial conditions or paraxial ray tracing. With this technique an ensemble of rays propagating {{in the vicinity of}} a central ray is traced {{with the help of the}} so-called paraxial ray propagator. This ray propagator is the basis of all the techniques discussed in this paper. Its efficient determination is discussed and we propose a finite element approach in which the medium is divided into a set of trapezoidal elements with simple velocity distribution. We propose that the simpler results are obtained when a constant gradient of the square of the slowness is adopted in each element. In the second part of the paper we calculate the effect of perturbations of the velocity structure and interfaces upon ray trajectories, amplitudes and waveforms. Our results can be easily adapted for the calculation of FrCchet derivatives for the linearized inversion of travel times, amplitudes and waveforms. Finally, we present an example of the calculation of synthetic seismograms in a simple medium with a perturbed interface. Simplified expressions for the calculation of perturbed rays in a few typical reference media are given. Key words: amplitude, Hamiltonian formulation, perturbation, ray tracing...|$|E

40|$|The article {{describes}} the satellite's trajectory calculation algorithm for near-circular orbits using TLE (two-line element) files in the simplified SGP model. The aim of the algorithm is to obtain the array of satellite's azimuth and elevation required to control the antennas of ground station. The initial conditions of motion in TLE format are very widespread nowadays, they are being used by many calculation software, nevertheless there is a deficit of information concerned with this format in Russian literature. The report presented at NASA web-sites by Dr. T. S. Kelso contains the descriptions of satellite's trajectory calculation algorithms in case of various models (SGP, SGP 4, SDP 4 etc). The realization of these algorithms demands for the executer's experience because speaking about Russian and the American scientific schools there are differences both in measure units and in approaches to satellite's trajectory calculation. Moreover, in opposite to series of related publications all the calculation sequence to obtain the values of antenna pointing is given in this article, the described algorithm is pretty simple and clear. It {{is not enough to}} have the satellite's coordinates and velocity in Earth inertial equatorial system to calculate azimuth and elevation. One has to bind the ground station situated at the surface of the Earth, which is involved in complicated motion, to a point in inertial space using Local Sidereal Time. Several issues propose the utilization of Astronomical Almanac. But the exploitation of the Almanac is not convenient when it is required to get the arrays of values of antenna control angles as functions of time. The article contains the methodology given in foreign issues which allow the calculation of Local Sidereal Time. This methodology is an adjacent part of the trajectory calculation problem with respect to ground station. The calculation results obtained using the described algorithm were compared with the data from well-known Orbitron software where more precise model SGP 4 is implemented. The comparison was executed in case of several types of near-circular orbits. Speaking about antennas with wide radiation patterns (up to 30 °) the obtained inaccuracies are not very critical especially if the antenna is equipped with system of correction and auto-tracking. Nevertheless, if the calculation accuracy presented in the paper is not enough for the concrete task, the described algorithm can be transformed to the full versions of SGP or SG 4 models; the only part is to be changed is the unit responsible for precise <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perturbations</b> which influence on the satellite's motion. </p...|$|E

40|$|Inhomogeneities are {{introduced}} in loop quantum cosmology using regular lattice states, with a kinematical arena {{similar to that}} in homogeneous models considered earlier. The framework is intended to encapsulate crucial features of background independent quantizations in a setting accessible to explicit <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> <b>perturbations</b> on a cosmological background. It is used here only for qualitative insights but can be extended with further more detailed input. One can thus see how several parameters occuring in homogeneous models appear from an inhomogeneous point of view. Their physical roles in several cases then become much clearer, often making previously unnatural choices of values look more natural by providing alternative physical roles. This also illustrates general properties of symmetry reduction at the quantum level and the roles played by inhomogeneities. Moreover, the constructions suggest a picture for gravitons and other metric modes as collective excitations in a discrete theory, and lead to the possibility of quantum gravity corrections in large universes.

40|$|Current {{determinations}} {{of fundamental}} constants [1] and {{the comparison of}} theory and expriment in high-precision experiments are based on perturbative expansions which can at best be regarded as divergent, asymptotic series in the coupling constant [2]. The first terms of the series decrease in absolute magnitude, before the factorial growth of the perturbative coefficients overcompensates the additional coupling factors of higher orders in perturbation theory, and the perturbation series ultimately diverges. Dyson’s related argument [3] {{has given rise to}} much discussion and confusion, until recent explicit 30 – loop <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> <b>perturbation</b> series pertaining to φ 3 and Yukawa theories have firmly established the factorially divergent character of the perturbative expansion [4]. These considerations naturally lead {{to the question of how}} complete, nonperturbative results can be obtained from a finite number of perturbative coefficients, and how the nonperturbative result is related to the partial sums <b>of</b> the <b>perturbation</b> series.

Using the all-data combination, we obtain N_ eff 0 at the 1. 17 σ level and a nonzero mass of sterile neutrino at the 1. 24 σ level.
