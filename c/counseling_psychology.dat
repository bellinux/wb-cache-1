40|$|Research {{about and}} with recent {{immigrants}} has expanded within <b>psychology,</b> <b>counseling,</b> and related fields. Such research has a potential to contribute significantly toward social action through affecting cultural understanding and public policies. However, <b>counseling</b> and <b>psychology</b> professionals and researchers often lack understanding of historical and current trends affecting this research. Thus, {{in this article}} we discuss the broader contextual influences on the scholarly focus on immigration within the psychological literature, reviewing the issues and debates, both historical and current, that dominate scholarly discussions regarding constructs related to immigration. Specifically, we focus on reviewing divergent perspectives on acculturation, transnationalism and immigrant identity, immigrant mental health issues, measurement strategies, and attitudes toward immigrants. Lastly, the article highlights the intersection of politics and research in immigration scholarship within <b>counseling</b> and <b>psychology.</b> Specific suggestions for social action resulting from this knowledge are presented...|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{clinical}} psychology and <b>counseling</b> <b>psychology,</b> which often are doctoral-only fields, school psychology includes individuals with Master's (M.A., M.S., M.Ed.), Specialist (Ed.S. or SSP), Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies (CAGS), and doctoral (Ph.D., Psy.D. or Ed.D.) degrees. In the past, a master's degree {{was considered the}} standard for practice in schools, but the National Association of School Psychologists currently recognizes the 60-credit-hour Specialist degree as the most appropriate level of training needed for entry-level school-based practice. According to the NASP Research Committee (NASP Research Committee, 2007), in 2004-05, 33% of school psychologists possessed master's degrees, 35% possessed Specialist (Ed.S. or SSP) degrees, and 32% possessed doctoral (Ph.D., Psy.D., or Ed.D.) degrees. A B.A. or B.S. is not sufficient.|$|E
