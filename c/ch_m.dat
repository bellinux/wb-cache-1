5000|$|A train {{taking the}} inland route from Moss Bay Ironworks to Lowca would start southwards towards Harrington Harbour, {{squeezed}} between the LNWR {{line and the}} sea. The train would join the harbour line and stop; the locomotive would run round and head north, immediately swinging northeast to cross the coastal route by a bowstring girder bridge. The route then described a 180 degree arc so that by Harrington Junction it was heading south again. An easy run past the Glebe Sand Siding [...] to Rosehill Junction meant that the original Mr Curwen's waggonway 1 in 15 climb from Harrington Harbour {{had been replaced by}} a much gentler 2 mi loop. There was a sting in the tail, as from Rose Hill Junction the line climbed southwards to Copperas Hill for 13 <b>ch</b> <b>m</b> at 1 in 17 easing to 1 in 26 for a further 3 <b>ch</b> <b>m</b> followed by 12 <b>ch</b> <b>m</b> at a relaxed 1 in 49.
