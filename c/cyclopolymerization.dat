40|$|Copolymers of styrene with {{acrylonitrile}} or {{methyl acrylate}} are of commercial importance. Most often strictly regular alternation of the functional groups along the polymer backbone cannot be produced. Since regular alternation of the functional groups could yield polymers which possess more desirable properties, {{we have developed}} a novel strategy for strict control of functional group alternation by free radical <b>cyclopolymerizations</b> of unsymmetrical non-conjugated dienes. Our preliminary results have yielded polymers with molecular weights up to 8100 and which appear to possess the anticipated cyclic structure. The presence of the desired pendant functional groups is indicated by IR spectroscopy. ¹H NMR spectra of the polymers show no vinyl protons from pendant alkenes. The polymers are soluble in common organic solvents suggesting that the monomers were completely cyclopolymerized and that cross-linking was minimal. The comparison of thermal properties of the cyclopolymers {{with those of the}} corresponding copolymers shows that the cyclopolymers are as stable as the copolymers but more highly ordered than the copolymers.

The reactions have been developed on laboratory scale by academia over the last two centuries and subsequently adapted to industrial scale, for instance for the manufacture of dyestuffs & pigments. The most comprehensive handbooks describing organic synthetic methods is Methods of Molecular Transformations. About 10% of the 26,000 synthetic methods described in are currently used on an industrial scale for fine chemicals production. Amination, condensation, esterification, Friedel-Crafts, Grignard, halogenation (esp. chlorination), and hydrogenation, respectively reduction (both catalytic and chemical) are most frequently mentioned on the websites of individual companies. Optically active cyanohydrins, <b>cyclopolymerization,</b> ionic liquids, nitrones, oligonucletides, peptide (both liquid- and solid-phase), electrochemical reactions (e.g., perfluorination) and steroid synthesis are promoted by {{only a limited number of}} companies. With the exception of some stereospecific reactions, particularly biotechnology, mastering these technologies does not represent a distinct competitive advantage. Most reactions can be carried out in standard multipurpose plants. The very versatile organometallic reactions (e.g., conversions with lithium aluminum hydride, boronic acids) may require temperatures as low as -100 °C, which can be achieved only in special cryogenic reaction units, either by using liquefied nitrogen as coolant or by installing a low-temperature unit. Other reaction-specific equipment, such as filters for the separation of catalysts, ozone or phosgene generators, can be purchased in many different sizes. The installation of special equipment generally is not a critical path on the overall project for developing an industrial-scale process of a new molecule.|$|E

Each of these has been examined in free radical copolymerization reactions, primarily with electron rich styrene-type monomers (VAr) {{to investigate the}} possibility of chirality being transferred from the respective metal complexes to {{the backbone of the}} derived copolymers, the chiral metal complex template having previously been cleaved and removed. In the case of CMS and CMN no copolymer products were obtained and it seems that side reactions involving the Cu(II) redox centre inhibit the polymerization of the methacrylate anions. In contrast ZMS and ZAS readily yield a range of methacrylic acid (MAA) -co-VAr polymers which are optically active by virtue only of the configuration of the stereogenic carbon atoms along the backbone i. e., copolymers have been synthesized in which the chirality has been transferred from the ZMS or ZAS to the respective copolymer backbone. The most reasonable rationalization for this is that the dimethacrylate ligands in these two Zn(II) complexes undergo selective <b>cyclopolymerization</b> under the stereochemical control of the (-) -sparteine ligand followed by reaction with an electron rich VAr molecule, to yield asymmetric Wulff-type triads along the polymer backbone. Cleavage of the (-) -sparteine Zn(II) templates reveals the inherent optical activity of the copolymer main chains. Despite a number of attempts similar experiments with Z 3 VBS and Z 4 VBS yielded only optically inactive copolymers once the chiral (-) -sparteine Zn(II) template was removed, and so it seems that chirality transfer does not occur with these complexes. Inspection of the respective crystal structures shows that the styryl carbon - carbon double bonds in these two complexes are well removed from the Zn(II) centre and almost certainly from the stereochemical influence of the (-) -sparteine ligand. They are also sufficiently remote from each other for selective <b>cyclopolymerization</b> to be disfavoured. In the case of ZADAC it proved impossible to isolate any soluble copolymers from the gels that were produced when this complex was subjected to copolymerization. It seems therefore that the much more conformationally mobile chiral diaminocyclohexane ligand in this complex allows the two diacrylate ligands to undergo copolymerization essentially independently of each other, and without any stereochemical control, giving rise to intractable crosslinked products...|$|E

In contrast, the constrained geometry catalyst system based on {C 5 Me 4 SiMe 2 NtBu}TiCl 2 (4) and MAO showed a much lower productivity (ca. 3 kgpol gcat− 1 h− 1 at 60 °C) and yielded a regioirregular, atactic copolymer in which MHD is simply vinyl-inserted in quite moderate amounts (0. 2 mol%) ...|$|E

Co and Fe complexes with bis(imino) pyridine ligands catalyze the <b>cyclopolymerization</b> of 1, 6 -heptadiene {{in the presence of}} MMAO to produce the polymer, which contains five-membered rings in the monomer units. The polymers with cis- or trans-five-membered rings are obtained selectively, depending on the complex used in the polymerization. The catalyst, prepared from the Co complex having a bis(imino) pyridine ligand and MMAO, promotes the polymerization of 2 -aryl- 1 -methylenecyclopropanes without ring-opening. The reaction under ethylene atmosphere produces alternating copolymer of the two monomers to yield the polymers composed of the C 4 repeating unit with a 1, 1 -cyclopropanediyl group. The alternating copolymer of ethylene and 7 -methylenebicyclo[4. 1. 0]heptane undergoes thermal rearrangement to afford the polymer with CC double bond in main chain. A radical pathway is proposed. Dinuclear π-allylpalladium complexes with bridging Cl ligands initiate living polymerization of 2 -alkoxy- 1 -methylenecyclopropanes, which accompanies ring-opening of the monomer, to afford the polymers composed of the C 3 repeating units having alkoxy and vinylidene groups. A cyclic dinuclear π-allylpalladium complex reacts with 2 -alkoxy- 1 -methylenecyclopropane in the presence of pyridine to produce the living polymer with macrocyclic structures. Block copolymerization of the two monomers that contain OR or O(CH 2 CH 2 O) R as the substituents on the three-membered ring, results in the polymers with hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments...|$|E

The hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and degradability of these polymers hinged on innovative monomer designs and adaption of appropriate polymerization strategies including controlled radical polymerization, metathesis polymerization, and ring-opening polymerization. Novel, functional sulfobetaine polymers having functional groups (i. e, alkenes and alkynes) directly attached to the zwitterionic moieties were prepared and shown to stabilize oil-water interfaces, allowing for interfacial crosslinking to afford robust polymer capsules. This represents the first example of inserting functionality directly into the zwitterionic moieties of polymer zwitterions, allowing one to achieve a much greater extent of functionality than is possible in zwitterion-containing copolymers. Functional oil-in-water droplets presenting reactive functionalities at the oil-water interface were realized by inserting reactive functional groups (i. e, activated ester and catechol) into amphiphilic polymer surfactants containing a hydrophobic polyolefin backbone and pendent hydrophilic phosphorylcholine groups by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Efforts in manipulating polymer backbone structures {{led to the development of}} electronically active polymer zwitterions, affording first examples of polymer zwitterions with conjugated polyacetylene-like backbones synthesized by metathesis <b>cyclopolymerization.</b> Redox-responsive disulfides and hydrolyzable phosphoesters were integrated successfully into polyolefins by ROMP with cyclic olefins containing degradable groups, while functional copolyesters featuring pendent alkene and alkyne groups amendable for post-polymerization modification were synthesized by organocatalyzed ring-opening polymerization. Finally, a simple method to immobilize poly(phosphorylcholine methacrylate) onto various surfaces was developed by catecholamine chemistry, which afforded a versatile and robust route to antifouling coating that successfully resisted bacterial and oil fouling...|$|E

Monolithic discs were prepared via ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) from norborn- 2 -ene (NBE), tris(norborn- 5 -ene- 2 -ylmethyleneoxy) methylsilane [(NBE-CH 2 O) 3 -SiCH 3], 2 -propanol, toluene and RuCl 2 (PCy 3) 2 (CHPh). Catalyst loadings of 0. 55 and 0. 7 wt %, respectively, were obtained. Monolithic disc-immobilized 1 {{was used in}} various metathesis-based reactions including ring-closing metathesis (RCM), ring-opening cross metathesis and enyne metathesis. Using 0. 23 – 0. 59  mol % of supported 1, turnover numbers (TONs) up to 330 were achieved. Monolithic disc-immobilized 2 was used in various enantioselective RCM and desymmetrization reactions. Using 9 – 13  mol % of supported catalyst, excellent yields up to 100 % and high enantiomeric excess (ee≤ 88 %) were observed. In both cases, metal leaching was low (≤ 3 and ≤ 2 %, respectively).

40|$|Since the {{pioneering}} work by Ziegler and Natta in the 1950 s on metalcatalyzed olefin polymerization, {{decades of research}} {{have led to the}} development of catalysts capable of furnishing a wide variety of polymers. Early work focused on heterogeneous catalysts, but the later development of homogeneous catalysts provided mechanistic insights that have allowed researchers to develop catalysts that provide access and control over specific polymer microstructures. The majority of commercial polyolefins has traditionally been limited to homopolymers, random copolymers, or blends thereof. In the past decade however, the development of olefin polymerization catalysts that are living have now allowed access to virtually a limitless number of new polyolefin architectures. Despite the fact that a living polymerization system is capable of producing only one polymer chain per metal center, the real advantage lies in the ability to synthesize well-defined block copolymers and identify new materials with promising properties. Our efforts have focused on C 2 -symmetric bis(phenoxyketimine) titanium dichloride complexes and C 1 -symmetric phenoxyamine zirconium and hafnium dibenzyl complexes supported by an sp 3 -C donor. We have shown that upon activation, these complexes can catalyze the living and isoselective polymerization of !-olefins. Using these, the synthesis of a number of new block copolymers featuring semicrystalline isotactic polypropylene segments and amorphous poly(ethylene-co-propylene) segments was accomplished. The resultant block copolymers displayed elastomeric behavior and excellent mechanical properties. We have further shown that catalysts derived from the C 1 -symmetric phenoxyamine zirconium and hafnium dibenzyl complexes are capable of the <b>cyclopolymerization</b> of 1, 5 -hexadiene.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this thesis deals with an {{overview}} on the key discoveries that revealed the pertinence of metathesis {{in the field of}} polymeric monolithic materials. The text also offers a short excursion to the historical background of metathesis reactions and metathesis-derived polymeric materials. A few sections are devoted to the recent developments in metathesis-derived polymeric monoliths and their most recent applications. The second chapter of this thesis addresses the exploration of a novel and convenient method for the synthesis of ROMP-derived aldehyde-semitelechelic polymers via the metathesis of living Ru-alkylidenes of ROMP-derived polymers with O 2 (Scheme I). This study also describes as to what extent ROMP-derived polymers can be functionalized upon termination with O 2 and in which form this reaction can be useful to material science and biocatalysis. The ROMP of norborn- 2 -ene (NBE) and cis-cyclooctene (COE) was initiated with well-defined Grubbs-type initiators, i. e., RuCl 2 (PCy 3) 2 (=CHPh), [RuCl 2 (PCy 3) (IMesH 2) (=CHPh) ], and [RuCl 2 (3 -Br-Py) 2 (IMesH 2) (CHPh) ] (MesH 2 = 1, 3 -bis(2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenyl) imidazolin- 2 -ylidene, PCy 3 = tricyclohexylphosphine, 3 -Br-Py = 3 -bromopyridine). Reaction of the living polymers with O 2 (air) resulted in the formation of aldehyde-semitelechelic polymers in up to 80 % yield, depending on the initiator and monomer used. This simple methodology was then used for the functionalization of ROMP-derived monoliths prepared from NBE, 1, 4, 4 a, 5, 8, 8 a-hexahydro- 1, 4, 5, 8 -exo-endo-dimethanonaphthalene (DMN-H 6) and (NBE-CH 2 O) 3 SiCH 3, to yield aldehyde-funtionalized monoliths. The extent of aldehyde formation was determined by hydrazone formation. Up to 8 &# 956;mol of aldehyde groups/g of the monolith could be generated by this approach. Finally, these aldehyde-functionalized monoliths were used for the immobilization of trypsin. Excellent proteolytic activity of the immobilized enzyme was found in both under batch and continuous flow conditions. The third chapter of this thesis was done in collaboration with Prof. Dr. René Peter’s group at Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Stuttgart. This project focuses on the development of a supported version of a chiral bimetallic catalyst suitable for the enantioselective Michael-additions. The heterogenization of such chiral catalysts has received considerable attention due to the high costs for both the metal and the chiral ligands. Therefore, system that allow for the straightforward separation of expensive chiral catalysts from reaction mixtures and minimum product contamination by metal leaching and efficient recycling are highly desirable. In this chapter, the utility of ROMP-derived monolithic support for the heterogenization of such catalyst is explored. A suitable support for immobilization was prepared via ROMP using the “ 1 st generation Grubbs catalyst”, RuCl 2 (PCy 3) 2 (=CHPh). Norborn- 5 -ene- 2 -ylmethyl hexafluoro- 5 -oxohexanoic acid and mono(norborn- 5 -ene- 2 -ylmethyl) hexafluoroglutarate were surface-grafted utilizing the living termini on to the monolithic support via a grafting from approach (Scheme II). The immobilization of the bimetallic catalyst with a proper counter ion was successfully accomplished by the reaction of the activated complex with free carboxylic acid groups of the graft polymer. The thus prepared supported catalysts were then used for the enantioselective Michael additions of tert-butyl 2 -cyano- 2 -phenylacetate to 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -one. The fourth chapter of this thesis address an unprecedented cyclopolymerization-based approach to conductive monolithic media using tris(4 -methyl- 1, 6 -heptadiyne) benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxylate and bis(4 -methyl- 1, 6 -heptadiyne) terephthalate as cross-linkers and 2 -propanol and 1, 2 -dichloroethane as porogens. N-hydroxysuccinimide-(1, 6 -heptadiyne- 4 -yl) carboxylate and 4 -trimethylsiloxymethyl- 1, 6 -heptadyine was used as a functional monomer, the polymerization was initiated by [Ru(CF 3 COO) 2 (1, 3 -dimesitylimidazolin- 2 -ylidene) (CH- 2 -(2 -PrO) -C 6 H 4) ] (Scheme III). Approximately 77 % of the functional monomers were located at the surface of the microglobules as evidenced by elemental analysis. This way, they are readily accessible to the reaction with redox-active catalysts containing amino groups. Upon doping with various p-dopant in suitable solvents, the thus prepared monoliths displayed a conductivity of 6 × 10 - 4 S. cm- 1. Moreover, successful immobilization of the trypsin without any deterioration of the enzyme was achieved on the doped monolith as shown by the excellent proteolytic activity of the immobilized enzyme. Synthesis, characterization and application possibility of these novel monolithic materials are described in this chapter. The focal theme of the last chapter is the synthesis of telechelic AB-type block copolymers of 4, 4 -bis(octyloxymethyl) - 1, 6 -heptadiyne and dipropargyl malonodinitrile via the metathesis–based <b>cyclopolymerization</b> using well-defined molybdenum- and ruthenium-based initiators. Even though, the polymerization using Ru-based initiator did not resulted in block polymers due to significant backbiting, an investigation towards the influence of various reaction conditions on backbiting of these two monomers was accomplished. A significant improvement in the elimination of backbiting was achieved when the polymerization was carried out with [Ru(NCO) 2 (IMesH 2) (=CH- 2 -(2 -PrO) -C 6 H 4] and [Ru(NCO) 2 (3 -Br-Py) 2 (IMesH 2) (CHPh) ], (IMesH 2 = 1, 3 -dimesitylimidazolin- 2 -ylidene, 3 -Br-Py = 3 -bromopyridine) using 3 -Br-Py as additive. Nevertheless, a successful synthesis of these block copolymers was accomplished by using the designed Mo-based Schrock-type initiators Mo(N- 2, 6 -i-Pr 2 C 6 H 3) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (OCH(CH 3) 2) 2 and THF as solvent. The end-functionalization of these block copolymer using (EtO) 3 SiCH 2 CH 2 CH 2 N=C=O afforded Si(OCH 2 CH 3) -telechelic polymers. Finally, the surface grafting of the thus prepared telechelic polymer on a silica support was also realized as a part of these investigations (Scheme IV). Das erste Kapitel der vorliegenden Arbeit gibt einen Überblick über den hohen Stellenwert der Metathese im Arbeitsgebiet Polymer-basierter monolithischer Materialien sowie über die historische Entwicklung der Metathesechemie und die Synthese Metathese-basierter Polymere bis hin zur aktuellen Entwicklung und Anwendung. Das zweite Kapitel dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit der Untersuchung einer neuen und zweckmäßigen Synthese von Aldehyd-semitelechelen ROMP-Polymeren, wobei die Metathesereaktion lebender Ruthenium-Alkyliden Endgruppen mit Sauerstoff verwendet wird (Abbildung 1). Desweiteren werden die vielfältigen Möglichkeiten der Funktionalisierung von ROMP-hergestellten Polymeren nach Terminierung mit Sauerstoff beschrieben und der Nutzen dieser Reaktion für Materialwissenschaften und Biokatalyse diskutiert. Die ROMP von Norborn- 2 -en (NBE) und cis-Cycloocten (COE) wurde mit definierten Grubbs-Initiatoren wie RuCl 2 (PCy 3) 2 (=CHPh), [RuCl 2 (PCy 3) (IMesH 2) (CHPh) ], und [RuCl 2 (3 -Br-Py) 2 (IMesH 2) (CHPh) ] (MesH 2 = 1, 3 -bis(2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenyl) imidazolin- 2 -yliden, PCy 3 = tricyclohexylphosphin, 3 -Br-Py = 3 -bromopyridin) durchgeführt. Die Synthese von Aldehyd-semitelechelen Polymeren durch die Reaktion von lebenden Polymeren mit Luftsauerstoff konnte in Abhängigkeit vom verwendeten Initiator und Monomer bis zu einer Ausbeute von 80 % durchgeführt werden. Diese simple Methode wurde anschließend bei der Funktionalisierung ROMP-basierter Monolithen ausgehend von NBE, 1, 4, 4 a, 5, 8, 8 a-hexahydro- 1, 4, 5, 8 -exo-endo-dimethanonaphthalin (DMN-H 6) und (NBE-CH 2 O) 3 SiCH 3 angewandt, um Aldehyd-funktionalisierte Monolithe zu erhalten. Die Menge des gebildeten Aldehyds wurde über die Menge an gebildetem Hydrazon bestimmt. Auf diese Weise konnten bis zu 8 &# 61549;m Aldehydgruppen pro Gramm Monolith erzeugt werden. Schließlich wurden diese Aldehyd-funktionalisierten Monolithe zur Immobilisierung von Trypsin verwendet. Es konnte eine hervorragende proteolytische Aktivität des immobilisierten Enzyms sowohl unter Batch-Bedingungen als auch unter kontinuierlichem Durchfluss beobachtet werden. Das dritte Kapitel befasst sich mit der Entwicklung eines auf monolithischem Material immobilisierten chiralen bimetallischen Katalysators, der sich unter anderem für enantioselektive Michael-Additionen eignet. Die Immobilisierung von chiralen Katalysatoren hat aufgrund der hohen Kosten des verwendeten Metalls, sowie des chiralen Liganden erhebliche Bedeutung erlangt. Folglich sind Systeme, welche die einfache Abtrennung des teuren chiralen Katalysators von der Reaktionsmischung ermöglichen und eine Produktkontaminierung durch Auswaschen des Metalls verhindern, erstrebenswert und ermöglichen effizientes Recycling. In diesem Kapitel wird die Anwendbarkeit von monolithischen Trägermaterialien, welche durch ROMP zugänglich sind, für die Immobilisierung solcher Katalysatoren untersucht. Ein geeigneter Zugang für die Immobilisierung wurde durch ROMP mittels Grubbs-Katalysatoren der ersten Generation RuCl 2 (PCy 3) 2 (=CHPh) geschaffen. Norborn- 5 -en- 2 -ylmethylhexafluoro- 5 -oxohexansäure und Mono(norborn- 5 -en- 2 -ylmethyl) hexafluoroglutarat wurden hierbei auf die Oberfläche des Monolithen durch Reaktion mit den lebenden Kettenenden aufpolymerisiert (Abbildung 2). Die Immobilisierung des bimetallischen Katalysators mit entsprechenden Gegenion wurde durch die Reaktion des aktivierten Komplexes mit einem aufgepfropften Polymer, welches freie Säurefunktionalitäten besitzt, erfolgreich durchgeführt. Die auf diese Weise aufgebrachten Katalysatoren wurden anschließend in der enantioselektiven Michael-Addition von tert-Butyl 2 -cyano- 2 -phenylacetat an 2 -Cyclohexen- 1 -on am Institut für Organische Chemie, AK Professor Peters, getestet. Das vierte Kapitel dieser Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit dem bisher unerforschten Ansatz leitfähige, monolithische Materialen mittels Zyklopolymerisation herzustellen, indem Tris(4 -methyl- 1, 6 -heptadiin) benzol- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxylat und Bis(4 -methyl- 1, 6 -heptadiin) terephthalat als Vernetzer mit 2 -Propanol und 1, 2 -Dichloroethan als Porogene verwendet wurden. N-Hydroxysuccinimid-(1, 6 -heptadiin- 4 -yl) carboxylat und 4 -Trimethylsiloxymethyl- 1, 6 -heptadiin wurden als funktionelle Monomere und [Ru(CF 3 COO) 2 (1, 3 -dimesitylimidazolin- 2 -ylidene) (CH- 2 -(2 -PrO) -C 6 H 4) ] als Katalysator eingesetzt (Abbildung 3). Durch Elementaranalyse wurde bewiesen, dass etwa 77 % der funktionellen Monomere auf der Oberfläche der Mikroglobuli aufgebracht werden konnten. Auf diese Weise sind diese für die Reaktion mit redoxaktiven Katalysatoren, über Aminogruppen, leicht zugänglich. Nach Dotierung mit verschiedenen p-Dotierungsmittel in geeigneten Lösungsmitteln, konnte mit diesen Monolithen eine Leitfähigkeit von 6 x 10 - 4 Scm- 1 erreicht werden. Darüberhinaus konnte Trypsin erfolgreich auf dem dotierten Trägermaterial immobilisiert werden ohne dass eine Schädigung des Enzyms festgestellt wurde. Dies wurde durch die exzellente proteolytische Aktivität des immobilisierten Enzyms gezeigt. Des Weiteren wurden die Synthese, Charakterisierung und Anwendungsmöglichkeiten dieser neuen monolithischen Materialien in diesem Kapitel beschrieben. Das Thema des letzten Kapitels ist die Synthese eines telechelen AB-Blockcopolymers von 4, 4 -Bis(octyloxymethyl) - 1, 6 -heptadiin und Dipropargyl-malonodinitril mittels Metathese-basierter Zyklopolymerisation mit wohldefinierten Molybdän- und Rutheniuminitiatoren. Die Polymerisationen mit Rutheniuminitiatoren führten aufgrund von signifikantem „back biting“ nicht zur Bildung von Blockpolymeren. Daraufhin wurden detaillierte Untersuchungen über den Einfluss der Reaktionsbedingungen auf das Auftreten von „back biting“ für beide Monomere durchgeführt. Es konnten deutliche Verbesserungen in der Unterdrückung des „back bitings“ durch die Verwendung von [Ru(NCO) 2 (IMesH 2) (=CH- 2 -(2 -PrO) -C 6 H 4] und [Ru(NCO) 2 (3 -Br-Py) 2 (IMesH 2) (CHPh) ], (IMesH 2 = 1, 3 -dimesytylimidazolin- 2 -ylidene, 3 -Br-Py = 3 -bromopyridine) als Katalysatoren für die Zyklopolymerisation erreicht werden. Die erfolgreiche Synthese dieses Blockcoploymers konnte schließlich durch die Verwendung des optimierten Molybdän-Schrock-Katalysators (N- 2, 6 -i-Pr 2 C 6 H 3) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (OCH(CH 3) 2) 2 und THF als Lösungsmittel erzielt werden. Daraufhin konnte im Rahmen dieser Untersuchungen die Endgruppenfunktionalisierung des Blockpolymers mit EtO) 3 SiCH 2 CH 2 CH 2 N=C=O zur Festphasenanbindung an Kieselgel realisiert werden (Abbildung 4) ...|$|E
