25|$|Vasculogenesis is the {{formation}} of early vasculature, which is laid down by genetic factors. Structures called blood islands form in the mesoderm layer of the yolk sac by cellular differentiation of hemangioblasts into endothelial and red blood cells. Next, the <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus</b> forms as endothelial cells migrate outward from blood islands and form a random network of continuous strands. These strands then undergo a process called lumenization, the spontaneous rearrangement of endothelial cells from a solid cord into a hollow tube.|$|E

These identities are still somewhat flexible, but the initial characterization is important to the embryonic remodelling process.|$|E

40|$|A whole-body {{mathematical}} model (10) for simulating intracranial pressure dynamics. In one embodiment, model (10) includes 17 interacting compartments, of which nine lie entirely outside of intracranial vault (14). Compartments (F) and (T) are defined to distinguish ventricular from extraventricular CSF. The vasculature of the intracranial system within cranial vault (14) is also subdivided into five compartments (A, C, P, V, and S, respectively) representing the intracranial arteries, <b>capillaries,</b> choroid <b>plexus,</b> veins, and venous sinus. The body's extracranial systemic vasculature {{is divided into}} six compartments (I, J, O, Z, D, and X, respectively) representing the arteries, capillaries, and veins of the central body and the lower body. Compartments (G) and (B) include tissue and the associated interstitial fluid in the intracranial and lower regions. Compartment (Y) is a composite involving the tissues, organs, and pulmonary circulation of the central body and compartment (M) represents the external environment...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{transporters}} are membrane proteins {{present in}} various tissues {{such as the}} lymphocytes, intestine, liver, kidney, testis, placenta, and central nervous system. These transporters {{play a significant role}} in drug absorption and distribution to organic systems, particularly if the organs are protected by blood-organ barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier or the maternal-fetal barrier. In contrast to neurotransmitters and receptor-coupled transporters or other modes of interneuronal transmission, drug transporters are not directly involved in specific neuronal functions, but provide global protection to the central nervous system. The lack of capillary fenestration, the low pinocytic activity, and the tight junctions between brain <b>capillary</b> and choroid <b>plexus</b> endothelial cells represent further gatekeepers limiting the entrance of endogenous and exogenous compounds into the central nervous system. Drug transport is a result of the concerted action of efflux and influx pumps (transporters) located both in the basolateral and apical membranes of brain <b>capillary</b> and choroid <b>plexus</b> endothelial cells. By regulating efflux and influx of endogenous or exogenous substances, the blood-brain barrier and, to a lesser extent, the blood-cerebrospinal barrier in the ventricles, represents the main interface between the central nervous system and the blood, ie, the rest of the body. As drug distribution to organs is dependent on the affinity of a substrate for a specific transport system, membrane transporter proteins are increasingly recognized as a key determinant of drug disposition. Many drug transporters are members of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily or the solute-linked carrier (SLC) class. The multidrug resistance protein MDR 1 (ABCB 1), also called P-glycoprotein, the multidrug resistance-associated proteins MRP 1 (ABCC 1) and MRP 2 (ABCC 2), and the breast cancer-resistance protein BCRP (ABCG 2) are ATP-dependent efflux transporters expressed in the blood-brain barrier. They belong to the superfamily of ABC transporters, which export drugs from the intracellular to the extracellular milieu. Members of the SLC class of solute carriers include, for example, organic ion transporting peptides, organic cation transporters, and organic ion transporters. They are ATP-independent polypeptides principally expressed at the basolateral membrane of brain <b>capillary</b> and choroid <b>plexus</b> endothelial cells that also mediate drug transport through central nervous system barriers...|$|R
40|$|The {{blood-brain barrier}} (BBB) {{separates}} {{the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid from the blood and regulates the exchange of substances between the blood and the brain. It is comprised chiefly of brain <b>capillaries,</b> choroid <b>plexus</b> cuboidal epithelium, and the arachnoid membrane (23). Barrier-type capillaries are located also in the retina, iris, inner ear, and within the endoneu-rium of peripheral nerves (27). All BBB sites are characterized {{by the presence of}} tight junc-tions (zonulae occludens, less than 2 ram in width) between contiguous cells, the absence of endothelial pores, and a paucity of pinocytic vesicles (24). Further, brain capillaries contain a several-fold increase in the numerical density of endothelial mitochondria as compared with capillaries from other regions of the body (20, 21) (Fig. 1). The cells constituting the BBB, connected by tight junctions, lacking en-dothelial pores, and possessing relatively few pinocytic vesicles act almost like a continuous cell layer, permitting solute exchange primarily by the transcellular route only (23). Thus lipid-soluble solutes easily penetrate the BBB while electrolytes, lipid-insoluble nonelectrolytes, and protein enter the brain from blood more slowly than they enter non-nervous tissues...|$|R

The portal system carries the CRH to the anterior lobe of the pituitary, where it stimulates corticotropes to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and other biologically-active substances (Î²-endorphin). ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and DHEA.|$|E
40|$|SummaryInteractions {{of adult}} neural stem cells (NSCs) with {{supportive}} vasculature appear critical for their maintenance and function, although the molecular details {{are still under}} investigation. Neurotrophin (NT) - 3 belongs to the NT family of trophic factors, best known for their effects in promoting neuronal survival. Here we show that NT- 3 produced and secreted by endothelial cells of brain and choroid <b>plexus</b> <b>capillaries</b> {{is required for the}} quiescence and long-term maintenance of NSCs in the mouse subependymal niche. Uptake of NT- 3 from irrigating vasculature and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) induces the rapid phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase present in the NSCs, leading to the production of NO, which subsequently acts as a cytostatic factor. Our results identify a novel interaction between stem cells and vasculature/CSF compartments that is mediated by an unprecedented role of a neurotrophin and indicate that stem cells can regulate their own quiescence in response to endothelium-secreted molecules...|$|R
40|$|Pituitaries {{of fetal}} and {{postnatal}} (15 days p. c. - 28 days p. n.) and adult (male) mice were studied by light and electron microscopy to correlate the developmental {{pattern of the}} hypothalamo-hypophysial vascular system with the time of onset of function of the adenohypophysis. The superior and anterior regions of the adenohypophysis become vascularized at 17 days p. c., when portal vessels extend from oral primary plexus to the pars distalis for the first time. Adenohypophysial vascularity {{and the number of}} portal vessels steadily increase to reach the adult pattern at 5 days p. n. At 1 day p. n. deep capillary loops appear in the caudal regions of the oral primary plexus; a <b>capillary</b> (tangential) <b>plexus</b> underlies the ependymal lining of the third ventricle by 6 days p. n. Superficial capillary loops were not observed until the third postnatal week. Granulation of secretory cells commences at 16 days p. c., predominantly in the upper and anterior adenohypophysis; at 17 days thyrotropes, gonadotropes and corticotropes are recognizable and by morphological criteria appear actively secretory on days 17 - 18 p. c., although few appear active at 19 days p. c. and 1 day p. n. Somatotropes are first seen at 18 days p. c., predominantly in the central and lateral regions of the pars distalis. Active secretory cells increase in number over the period 2 - 10 days p. n., but after 11 days p. n. thyrotropes and corticotropes seem to become progressively less active; fewer gonadotropes are seen after 15 days p. n., and these apparently become progressively less active from day 19. Most somatotropes appear active until 28 days p. n. The observations suggest that hypothalamic control of adenohypophysial function may exist in the mouse from 17 days p. c...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the distribution of a recently cloned polyspecific organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp 2) in rat brain by nonradioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy. The results demonstrate that Oatp 2 is expressed in brain <b>capillary</b> and in <b>plexus</b> epithelial cells. At the blood-brain barrier (BBB), Oatp 2 expression could be co-localized with the endothelial marker vWF (von Willebrand factor) {{but not with the}} astrocyte marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein). In choroid plexus epithelial cells, Oatp 2 could be localized to the basolateral cell pole, whereas the first member of the Oatp gene family of membrane transporters to be cloned (Oatp 1) co-localized with the alpha(1) -subunit of Na,K-ATPase at the apical plasma membrane domain. Because Oatp 1 and Oatp 2 have been previously shown to mediate transmembrane transport {{of a wide variety of}} amphipathic organic compounds, including many drugs and other xenobiotics, the histochemical localization of Oatp 2 at the BBB and of Oatp 1 and Oatp 2 in the choroid plexus imply a role for these transporters in the active exchange of amphipathic solutes between the blood, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid compartments...|$|R

40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{profile and}} the anatomical localization of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the vasa nervorum were studied in sections of sciatic nerve using radioreceptor binding and light microscope autoradiography techniques. Sprague-Dawley rats of 4 and 24 {{months of age}} were used. [3 H]Dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and [3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) were used to label beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors, respectively. The ligands were bound to sections of rat sciatic nerve {{in a manner consistent}} with the labelling of beta-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the 2 age groups investigated. The dissociation constant (Kd) values (about 1. 37 nM for [3 H]DHA and 0. 75 nM for [3 H]QNB) did not significantly change between 4 - and 24 -month-old rats. The maximum concentration of binding sites (Bmax) for [3 H]DHA was decreased by about 35 % in 24 in comparison with 4 -month-old rats. The Bmax value for [3 H]QNB was reduced by about 50 % in the aged rats. Light microscope autoradiography revealed the development of specific silver grains in the medial layer of epineurial and perineurial arteries in sections of sciatic nerve exposed either to [3 H]DHA or [3 H]QNB. The number of silver grains developed in epineurial and perineurial arteries of rats of 24 months is significantly lower than in animals of 4 months. The above results suggest the occurrence of an age-dependent loss in the density of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors of vasa nervorum. Vasa nervorum are the blood vessels which supply peripheral nerve trunks. They are constituted by outer (epineurial) and inner (perineurial) arteries and veins as well as by a <b>capillary</b> (endoneurial) <b>plexus.</b> Vasa nervorum are innervated by both sympathetic and non-sympathetic nerves which probably play a role in the pathogenesis of some neuropathies. Several different neurotransmitter containing nerve fibres have been identified in the vasa nervorum perivascular plexuses. However, no information is so far available concerning the neurotransmitter receptors of vasa nervorum. Moreover, although the occurrence of age-dependent changes in peripheral nerve morphology and function is well documented, very few reports were centered on the age-dependent changes of the vasa nervorum. The aims of the present study were to characterize pharmacologically and to localize anatomically the beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the rat vasa nervorum. Moreover, the effect of ageing on the density and pattern of these receptors was investigated...|$|R
40|$|Aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) is the Central Nervous System {{water channel}} highly {{expressed}} at the perivascular glial domain. In the retina, {{two types of}} AQP 4 expressing glial cells {{take part in the}} blood-retinal barrier (BRB), astrocytes and MÃ¼ller cells. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of AQP 4 deletion on the retinal vasculature by looking at typical pathological hallmark such as BRB dysfunction and gliotic condition. AQP 4 dependent BRB properties were evaluated by measuring the number of extravasations in WT and AQP 4 KO retinas by Evans blue injection assay. AQP 4 deletion caused BRB impairment at the deep <b>plexus</b> <b>capillaries</b> while the superficial and intermediate were not compromised. To investigate for gliotic responses caused by AQP 4 deletion, MÃ¼ller cells and astrocytes were analysed by immunofluorescence and western blot, using the MÃ¼ller cell marker Glutamine Synthetase (GS) and the astrocyte marker GFAP. While GS expression was not altered in AQP 4 KO retinas, a strong GFAP upregulation was found at the level of AQP 4 KO astrocytes at the superficial plexus and not at MÃ¼ller cells at the intermediate and deep plexi. These data, together with the upregulation of inflammatory markers (TNF-Î±, IL- 6, IL- 1 Î² and ICAM- 1) in AQP 4 KO retinas indicated AQP 4 deletion as responsible for a gliotic phenotype. Interestingly, no GFAP altered expression was found in AQP 4 siRNA treated astrocyte primary cultures. All together these results indicate that AQP 4 deletion is directly responsible for BRB dysfunction and gliotic condition in the mouse retina. The selective activation of glial cells at the primary plexus suggests that different regulatory elements control the reaction of astrocytes and MÃ¼ller cells. Finally, GFAP upregulation is strictly linked to gliovascular crosstalk, as it is absent in astrocytes in culture. This study is useful to understand the role of AQP 4 in the perivascular domain in the retina and its possible implications in the pathogenesis of retinal vascular diseases and of Neuromyelitis Optica, a human disease characterized by anti-AQP 4 auto-antibodies...|$|R

From this capillary system, the blood is drained in hypophyseal portal veins into the secondary plexus. The peptides released at the median eminence enter the primary plexus capillaries. From there, they are transported to the anterior pituitary via hypophyseal portal veins to the secondary plexus. The secondary plexus is a network of fenestrated sinusoid capillaries that provide blood to the anterior pituitary. The cells of the anterior pituitary express specific G protein-coupled receptors that bind to the neuropeptides, activating intracellular second messenger cascades that produce the release of anterior pituitary hormones.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To report 3 {{cases of}} {{neurofibromatosis}} type 1 (NF 1) with choroidal nodules associated with retinal microvascular changes imaged with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods: Small case series in 3 NF 1 patients. OCTA examinations were performed by a trained examiner (J. J.) after pupillary dilation. A standard scan, centered over the macula measuring 6 Ã 6 mm and 3 Ã 3 mm was obtained according to the findings on standard color photography. Additional scans were obtained in the zones with microvascular abnormalities. The segmentation provided by the machine software was used. Results: Corkscrew retinal vessels were observed in association with âplacoidâ-type choroidal nodules as shown by near-infrared reflectance imaging. In all cases, multiple lesions were found. They were second- or third-order tortuous vessels originating from the superior or inferior temporal veins. OCTA demonstrated that the tortuous venules were located in the superficial <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus,</b> and no abnormalities {{were found in the}} deep <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus.</b> Discussion: Corkscrew retinal vessels are part of a spectrum of retinal microvascular alterations seen in association, sometimes overlying choroidal nodules in patients with NF 1 and are visualized in the superficial <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus</b> on OCTA. We demonstrated with OCTA that they are not associated with flow loss or ischemia in the superficial and deep <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus.</b> The link between the underlying nodule remains unclear. Since neovascularization was described in choroidal ganglioneuroma, we hypothesize that corresponding secretory substances from Schwann cells, ganglion cells, or melanocytes in choroidal nodules might alter the retinal vasculature.

The median of disease duration was 5 years (1 â 25). FRT was 118. 1 [*]Â±[*] 52. 35 [*]Î¼m, which correlated with visual acuity (95 % CI â 60. 47, â 13. 92). Using OCTA, the area of hypoperfusion in SCP (0. 47 [*]Â±[*] 0. 17 [*]mm 2) was smaller than that in DCP (1. 94 [*]Â±[*] 3. 87 [*]mm 2) (p< 0. 001).

In this study, the process is demonstrated in developing chicken eye vasculature and in the chorioallantoic membrane by methylmethacrylate (Mercox) casting, transmission electron microscopy, and in vivo observation. In a first step of intussusceptive angiogenesis, the <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus</b> expands by insertion of numerous transcapillary tissue pillars, ie, by intussusceptive microvascular growth. In a subsequent step, a vascular tree arises from the primitive <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus</b> {{as a result of}} intussusceptive pillar formation and pillar fusions, a process we termed âintussusceptive arborization. â On the basis of the morphological observations, a 4 -step model for intussusceptive arborization is proposed, as follows: phase I, numerous circular pillars are formed in rows, thus demarcating future vessels; phase II, formation of narrow tissue septa by pillar reshaping and pillar fusions; phase III, delineation, segregation, growth, and extraction of the new vascular entity by merging of septa; and phase IV, formation of new branching generations by successively repeating the process, complemented by growth and maturation of all components. In contrast to sprouting, intussusceptive angiogenesis does not require intense local endothelial cell proliferation; it is implemented primarily by rearrangement and attenuation of the endothelial cell plates. In summary, transcapillary pillar formation, ie, intussusception, is a central and probably widespread process, which plays a role not only in capillary network growth and expansion (intussusceptive microvascular growth), but also in vascular plexu...|$|E

40|$|If {{regions of}} the {{anterior}} pituitary gland received systemic blood via a direct arterial blood supply these regions would escape hypothalamic regulation and thus be a sequela in endocrine disorders. Since, in the untreated rat, all of the blood supply to the anterior pituitary gland is via the hypophyseal portal vessels, we hypothesized that partial interruption of the portal vessels could provoke {{the establishment of a}} direct arterial blood supply (arteriogenesis). We utilized the injection of polystyrene microspheres (15 or 9 micron diameter) into the left ventricle of the heart to test this hypothesis. Microspheres are trapped in the first <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus</b> they reach since they are too large to traverse the capillaries. No microspheres reached the anterior pituitary gland of control rats, a finding consistent {{with the fact that the}} anterior pituitary gland receives all of its blood supply via the hypophyseal portal blood vessels. Microspheres were observed in the primary portal <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus</b> in the infundibulum (median eminence), infundibular stalk (pituitary stalk), and infundibular process (pars nervosa), the first <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus</b> which they reached. A lesion of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) which destroyed the long portal vessels did not result in arteriogenesis since few, if any, microspheres were observed in the anterior pituitary gland. We confirmed, using vascular casts, that these lesions resulted in the long-term destruction of the primary portal capillaries in the infundibulum and of the long portal vessels. In MBH-lesioned animals it appears that all of the blood supply of the anterior pituitary gland is via short portal vessels arising from the infundibular stem and process.

40|$|We {{performed}} a light microscope {{and a computer}} three-dimensional reconstruction study of serial sections of the molar enamel organ of 3 - and 5 -day-old rats perfused with Indian ink through the arterial system. the tooth germs were fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. for the three-dimensional reconstruction, light micrographs of the serial sections were digitized, and aligned using the serial EM Align software downloaded from [URL] After alignment, {{the boundaries of the}} India-ink-filled blood vessels were manually traced with a mouse using the software IGL trace (version 1. 26 b), also downloaded from the above website. After tracing, a three-dimensional representation of the blood vessel contours was generated in a VRML format and visualized {{with the help of the}} software Cortona Web 3 D viewer (version 4. 0) downloaded from [URL] Our results showed that in regions where ameloblasts are polarized the capillaries are arranged in three distinct levels: (1) penetrating and leaving capillaries in relation to the outer enamel epithelium; (2) capillaries crossing and branching inside the stellate reticulum; and (3) capillaries branching and anastomosing profusely within the stratum intermedium, thereby forming an extensive <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus</b> intimately associated with the cells of the stratum intermedium. the existence of a conspicuous <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus</b> intermingled with cells of the stratum intermedium, as shown in our results, suggests that some molecules produced by cells of the stratum intermedium could be released into the <b>capillary</b> <b>plexus</b> and thereafter carried to the dental follicle.
