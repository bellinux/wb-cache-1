25|$|The carpet is {{produced}} on a loom {{quite similar to}} woven fabric. The pile can be plush or Berber. Plush carpet is a <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> and Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan and Arabia.|$|E
2500|$|The Ninety-Eight was restyled for 1980, {{along with}} the Delta 88. That year, it gained a new 307 cid (5.0 L) V8 as an option. The 403 was dropped completely. The 1980 models {{received}} new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing {{the look of the}} car. To improve aerodynamics and fuel economy the hood was sloped downward, while the trunk area was higher. This also gave all models a heavier, more substantial appearance, while even slightly increasing interior and trunk space. 1981 saw the introduction of Buick's 252in³ V6 as standard, as well as a new 4-speed THM200-4R automatic transmission. The gas 350 engine was dropped that same year, completely replaced by the smaller 307. The new Regency Brougham model was introduced for 1982.

50|$|People {{restoring}} classic {{cars will}} often freshen up the interior by putting in new carpet to cover new floor pans. When they do replace the carpet {{in their cars}} they have quite a few options in molded carpet. There are several websites that specialize in molded carpets. There are several styles of molded carpet, the most popular include 80-20 loop, cutpile and essex. Most cars from the 1940s to the mid-1970s used 80-20 loop carpet. The major exception being Cadillac which used <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> in their cars at various times. After 1974 car makers used <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> or essex carpet exclusively. 80-20 loop which is 80% rayon 20% nylon thus the name. It has a texture similar to berber house carpet. <b>Cut</b> <b>pile</b> is {{what you see in}} modern cars. It looks like little strands of hair. Essex is a longer more plush version of <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> carpet. It's softer to the touch than <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> and 80-20 loop, but is also more expensive than the other two.|$|E
50|$|The {{quality of}} <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> carpets is {{improved}} significantly by {{a reduction of}} inner tensions in the yarn. This essential benefit results {{from the effects of}} steaming and heatsetting.|$|E
50|$|Carpet {{styles are}} divided into two basic types. These types are loop pile carpets and <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> carpets. Especially for {{cut-pile}} and its variations (Saxony, shag, frieze) the heat setting process is of highest importance.|$|E

Manufactured in camouflage colors, with saw blade painted black and the body a greenish color, the saw worked just about everywhere, including underwater to <b>cut</b> <b>piles</b> or timbers. The Navy had Skil put this tool into a special camouflage box coated and sealed with plastic. When {{they were unable to}} get into a landing area, the unit would be dumped overboard and floated or drug in for use on aircraft landing areas.|$|R
40|$|Principles of Foundation Engineering and Principles of Geotechnical Engineering were {{originally}} published with 1984 and 1985 copyrights, respectively. These texts were well received by instructors, students, and practitioners alike. Depending {{on the needs}} of the users, the texts were revised and are presently in their eighth editions. These texts have also been translated in several languages. Toward the latter part of 1998, there were several requests to prepare a single volume that was concise in nature but combined the essential components of Principles of Foundation Engineering and Principles of Geotechnical Engineering. In response to those requests, the first edition of Fundamentals of Geotechnical Engineering was published in 2000. This text includes the fundamental concepts of soil mechanics as well as foundation engineering, including bearing capacity and settlement of shallow foundations spread footings and mats), retaining walls, braced <b>cuts,</b> <b>piles,</b> and drilled shafts...|$|R
60|$|The cold was {{so intense}} that the boys were glad enough to stir around {{in the snow and}} wind to keep warm. They <b>cut</b> a big <b>pile</b> of {{firewood}} and piled the brushwood thickly around the shelter, taking care, however, to keep it from the campfire.|$|R

50|$|On {{mechanical}} looms {{the technology}} of 'wire weaving' still exists, using modern technology and electronics. This weaving technique allows users to obtain both loop pile and <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> in the same fabric. Other techniques involve the weaving of two layers of fabric {{on top of each}} other, whereby the warp ends used for the pile are inserted {{in such a way that}} they form a vertical connection between the two layers of fabric. By cutting the pile ends in between the two layers one obtains two separate pile fabrics. With this technique only the <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> effect can be obtained. This is known as 'face-to-face weaving'. Both 'wire weaving' and 'face-to-face' weaving are used for the manufacturing of upholstery and furnishing fabrics as well as in rug making (knotted-pile carpet).|$|E
50|$|The {{tufted carpet}} {{is the most}} common {{manufacturing}} technique. It implies poking yarn tufts in a textile support close to a sewing machine. The carpet is then equipped with a folder (rewoven, jute, plastic or cotton) pasted {{on the back of the}} tuft. This technique makes possible the production of <b>cut</b> <b>pile,</b> curly or structured carpets.|$|E
5000|$|Plush (from French [...] ) is {{a textile}} having a <b>cut</b> nap or <b>pile</b> {{the same as}} fustian or velvet. Its {{softness}} of feel {{gave rise to the}} adjective [...] "plush" [...] to describe something soft or luxurious, which was extended to describe luxury accommodation, or something rich and full.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{vocabulary}} arose amongst {{those involved}} in the industry of manufacturing farm implements in the village (yokes, wagons, footstools; and the threshing-board, a wooden tool resembling a sledge, with his bottom-side holding many lithic flakes that <b>cuts</b> the <b>pile</b> of cereal crop, in order to separate the grain {{of the rest of the}} plant: threshing). The argot was thus used by the itinerant salesmen of these products, in opposition to settled villagers. In the face of mechanized agriculture, Gacería has survived amongst those who still sell such ancient farm implements as collectors' items.|$|R
5000|$|The bloom {{was passed}} through rollers and to produce bars. The bars of wrought iron were of poor quality, called muck bars or puddle bars. [...] To improve their quality, the bars were <b>cut</b> up, <b>piled</b> and tied {{together}} by wires, {{a process known}} as faggoting or piling. [...] They were then reheated and rolled again in merchant rolls. The process could be repeated several times to produce wrought iron of desired quality. Wrought iron that has been rolled multiple times is called merchant bar or merchant iron.|$|R
50|$|Usually, when yarn is cut, {{the ends}} fray {{similar to the}} way the ends of a braid or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms. This fraying must be avoided in {{cut-pile}} carpets by all means. A <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> carpet with frayed yarn ends would have a poor appearance, a shorter life cycle and ergonomic disadvantages for the “walker” as scientific research has proven. The carpet is less elastic and doesn’t absorb the steps of the user as well as a heat set carpet would. A carpet manufactured from heat set yarn is more attractive, durable and comfortable for the user. The added value of heatset carpet is significant. Normally a heat set carpet can be identified by its grainy structure, which is called “pinpoint tip definition” in the industry. The appearance of the <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> ends is similar to pin points.|$|E

50|$|The {{carpet of}} the Oval Office bears the Seal of the President. President Harry S. Truman's oval carpet {{was the first}} to {{incorporate}} the presidential seal. In Truman's carpet, the seal was represented monochromatically through varying depths of the <b>cut</b> <b>pile.</b> His carpet was used in the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. In recent years most administrations have created their own rug, working with an interior designer and the Curator of the White House. As part of her overall restoration of the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy had a redecoration of the Oval Office begun on November 21, 1963, when she accompanied President John F. Kennedy on a trip to Texas. The next day, November 22, a new carpet was installed just as the Kennedys were making their way through Dallas and the President was assassinated.|$|E

This piece is a classic model of quality for a mid-century Shoowa cloth. It retains the major {{features}} of the late 19th century style and fine workmanship. Unlike the Bushoong, the Shoowa typically, as here, dye the foundation cloth red before embroidery and execute their designs in natural beige and dark brown. The pattern of two wide columns of interlacing is a long-standing favorite Shoowa theme. The {{manner in which the}} broad columnar outlines are formed by multiple dark and light rows of stem stitching, interspersed with tiny light and dark plush motifs, called tunjoko, is another characteristic of Shoowa style. Because of the subtle distribution of light and dark across the surface, there is a convincing sense of balance despite the asymmetry.|$|E

Ulrich and Lee (2008) found one category of rug surface (average height <b>cut</b> <b>pile)</b> could be characterized as a classic in comparison to other surfaces that showed cyclical or trending patterns (shag, looped styling). Colors with overall lower incidences (e.g., orange, gray) had more frequent periods of disappearance. Although colors are not generally cited as examples of fads, the short cyclical patterns and gaps in appearance of orange and gray marked them as something similar to that.|$|E

40|$|Morimus asper reproduces {{mainly in}} freshly dead wood and, as a consequence, populations are {{affected}} by modern forestry practices. The taxon M. funereus, now incorporated into the species M. asper, is protected by the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92 / 43 /EEC) and its monitoring has received attention in recent years. Larvae of M. asper are polyphagous, but some studies indicate that adults prefer the wood of some tree species. Freshly <b>cut</b> log <b>piles,</b> which attract adults, have been proposed as a monitoring tool. For monitoring programmes, {{it is essential to}} select the most appropriate wood and therefore the attraction of different types of wood for adults of M. asper was investigated in two sites in northern Italian, using freshly <b>cut</b> log <b>piles.</b> The first experiment was carried out in the Nature Reserve Bosco della Fontana (a lowland forest, Mantua province), testing two autochthonous species (Carpinus betulus and Fraxinus ornus) and two allochthonous species (Juglans nigra and Quercus rubra). The second study was conducted in the Parco Naturale Regionale delle Prealpi Giulie (a mountain area, Udine province), employing Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior and Picea abies (all autochthonous species). The population of this area belongs to the taxon formerly named M. funereus. In both sites, adults clearly preferred the wood of some particular species: J. nigra at Bosco della Fontana and F. sylvatica in the mountain area. This is the first study which compared the attraction of several tree species and it showed that this selection is important for the monitoring of M. asper...|$|R
