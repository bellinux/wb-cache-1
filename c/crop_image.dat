40|$|Background: Currently, aerial images, tissue analyses, soil {{sampling}} analyses, and soil plant analysis development (SPAD) readings {{are used to}} assess the crop nutrition status. The remote sensing techniques are very popular and used in many areas including PA in these days. But in the case of remote sensing which uses passive light system, the image data should be processed for vegetation index in PA. This paper presents the dynamic calibration image processing method of a CMOS image sensor, which uses three channels (green, red, blue) of crop images to determine crop reflectance for vegetation index. Methods: The real-time <b>crop</b> <b>image</b> was acquired using CMOS image sensor. The crop images were acquired during a different light condition from sunny to cloudy. And dynamic calibrations were investigated for a true reflectance calculation. The background elimination algorithm and the crop canopy reflectance analysis algorithm were also used for this research. Results: To eliminate the effect of ambient illumination variation on gray levels of <b>crop</b> <b>image</b> caused by either the clouds or the solar radiation angle, the dynamic calibration model calibrates the measured crop reflectance. The core of this investigation is the calibration methods between the CMOS image and the reflectance in crops. Some noticeable relationships between the CMOS image reflectance and light condition were found from this study. Discussions: Development of a system would identify where vegetation index is low and would apply fertilizer only to these identified areas. Conclusion: The developed dynamic calibration model can be used to compensate for the variation of ambient light caused either by the weather condition or the solar zenith angle effectively. The CMOS image sensor is capable of detecting crop reflectance reliably in real-time...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: At present, the {{agriculture}} images are increasing greatly day by day. It becomes {{increasingly difficult for}} users {{to find out the}} desired images. Building the database to store images and realizing the automatic retrieval of images is very important in agriculture field. Based on the study of visual feature retrieval technology of images, this article puts forward a new retrieval algorithm using color, texture and shape features according to the characteristics of <b>crop</b> <b>image</b> database. The retrieval accuracy rate has been improved greatly and by reasonably setting the feature library, the retrieval efficiency is greatly improved. An experimental system is constructed through programming. We establish a relatively complete test database for crop images and generic image database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed re-trieval algorithm. Finally, the retrieval performance using different features is evaluated and compared, and the problems and future works are analyzed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an {{algorithm}} {{for drivers}} ’ drowsiness detection based on eye states tracking is presented. We use a database which contains 150 images captured from different people in various conditions for better results. These images are captured using a camera {{located in a}} {{car in front of}} the driver. These images are used for tracking as input of the proposed method. In first step we use color space for drivers ’ face detection and crop the face from background. In the next step, we estimate the area of the eyes and <b>crop</b> <b>image</b> from this region. Then top and bottom coordinates of the eyes are located using retrench the face pixels from this area and prewitt operator for edge detection. In the last step we count the number of white and black pixels and compare the distance between these coordinates for recognition of the driver’s fatigue. Keywords—fatigue detection, face detection, eye detection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{automatics}} fatigue detection based on eye-tracking. In the present paper we use CCD camera for capturing image from drivers ‘face. The proposed method consists of four steps. In the first step we detect face area using YCbCr color-space, and then crop the image according to calculated maximum and minimum values of vertical and horizontal. based on the obtained results, generally eyes located in the two-fifth to three-fifth of the upper region of face, So we can <b>crop</b> <b>image</b> in this area, and estimate eyes region. In the third step determine exact location of eyes and track them whit use changing pixels of white to black. In the last step counter the number of white and black pixel. In the initial frame we posit driver is awaked, and consideration these number as threshold, so in another frame compare number of white and black pixel whit threshold and determine is driver sleepy or not [...] Index Terms — Introduction, previous worked, overal flowchart, face detection, eyes detection and localization, fatigue detection, experimental results, conclusion, references I...|$|E
40|$|New sensors {{mounted on}} UAV and optimal {{procedures}} for survey, data acquisition and analysis are continuously developed and tested for applications in precision farming. Procedures to integrate multispectral aerial data about soil and crop and ground-based proximal geophysical data are a recent research topic aimed to delineate homogeneous zones {{for the management}} of agricultural inputs (i. e., water, nutrients). Multispectral and multitemporal orthomosaics were produced over a test field (a 100 m × 200 m plot within a maize field), to map vegetation and soil indices, as well as crop heights, with suitable ground resolution. UAV flights were performed in two moments during the crop season, before sowing on bare soil, and just before flowering when maize was nearly at the maximum height. Two cameras, for color (RGB) and false color (NIR-RG) images, were used. The images were processed in Agisoft Photoscan to produce Digital Surface Model (DSM) of bare soil and crop, and multispectral orthophotos. To overcome some difficulties in the automatic searching of matching points for the block adjustment of the <b>crop</b> <b>image,</b> also the scientific software developed by Politecnico of Milan was used to enhance images orientation. Surveys and image processing are described, as well as results about classification of multispectral-multitemporal orthophotos and soil indices...|$|E

40|$|Temporal {{changes in}} soil {{composition}} {{are of interest}} in determining nutrient transport in the soil. This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether electromagnetic (EM) soil conductivity differences can be linked to feedlot manure application and then be used to trace these differences over a growing season. A series of soil conductivity maps of a research cornfield have been generated using GPS and EM induction methods. The site used in this study was treated over a six-year period with manure and compost applied at rates matching either the phosphorus or the nitrogen requirements of the corn. The plot was split with sub-treatments of a cover crop and no cover <b>crop.</b> <b>Image</b> processing techniques were used to establish treatment means for each of the growing season surveys. This method differentiated (P< 0. 05) the cover crop region and no-cover crop region {{with the exception of the}} period of rapid growth of the corn crop. This approach also distinguished (P< 0. 05) the nitrogen check treatment (commercial application rate) versus manure or compost treatment for both the cover crop and no-cover areas at strategic times in the growing season. The EM methods also provide insights into the dynamics of nutrient transformations and are supported with soil analysis. This paper will present the details of the methods used and the results of the study for one growing season...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{sustainable}} agricultural management systems will depend, in part, {{on the ability}} to better use renewable resources, such as animal manure, and to synchronize the levels of soil available N with crop plant needs during the growing season. This study was conducted at the US Meat Animal Research Center in the central USA to determine whether differences in electromagnetic (EM) soil conductivity and available N levels over a growing season can be linked to feedlot manure/compost application and use of a green winter cover crop. A series of soil conductivity maps of a research cornfield were generated using global positioning system (GPS) and EM induction methods. The study site was treated over a 7 -year period with manure and compost at rates matching either the phosphorus or the nitrogen requirements of silage corn (Zea mays L.). The plot was split for sub-treatments of a rye (Secale cereale L.) winter cover crop and no cover <b>crop.</b> <b>Image</b> processing techniques were used to establish electrical conductivity (EC) treatment means for each of the growing season surveys. Sequential measurement of profile weighted soil electrical conductivity (ECa) was effective in identifying the dynamic changes in available soil N, as affected by animal manure and N fertilizer treatments, during the corn-growing season. This method also clearly identified the effectiveness of cover crops in minimizing levels of available soil N before and after the corn-growing season, when soluble N is most subject to loss. The EM method for assessing soil condition provides insights into the dynamics of available N transformations that are supported by soil chemical analyses. This real-time monitoring approach could also be useful to farmers in enhancing N use efficiencies of cropping management systems and in minimizing N losses to the environment...|$|E
