25|$|The Indian Business Directory {{states that}} the Bihar Sugar Industry has flourished {{in the last couple}} of years due to the efforts taken by the state {{government}} to revive the industry. The Sugar Industry has been helped by the climate of the state, which is very suitable for the growth of high-grade sugarcane. The main benefit of the industry is that it provides employment to many people, especially in the rural areas. Further, it provides facilities of transport and communication, and also helps in the development of the rural areas by mobilizing the rural resources. The total number of sugar mills in Bihar Sugar Industry is 28 out which only 9 are operational. The total area under sugarcane production is 2.30 lakh hectares and the total production of sugarcane is around 129.95 lakh M.T. The location of the sugar mills of Bihar Sugar Industry are Samastipur, Gopalganj, Sitamarhi, West Champaran, <b>Chorma,</b> Dulipati, and Supaul.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} Camera tracking in virtual studio environment. The traditional camera tracking methods can be classified into optical-based or electromechanical sensor-based. However, the electromechanical method is extensive time-consuming calibration procedures and cost too much; the optical method suffers from the error detection of references features and the <b>chorma</b> keying limitation in virtual studio. Therefore, in order to overcome those problems, we proposed a novel RFID-based hybrid camera tracking method in virtual studio application. Firstly, we designed a RFID passive tags based camera tracker. By using the triangular position algorithm, the accuracy could reach up to 5 centimeters. Secondly, we combined the optical based tracking method into RFID tracker with the aim to improve the orientation and position accuracy. Finally, the experiment results showed that this method could be a novel potential solution for camera tracking system in virtual studio applications.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Table  4 that the color of the third {{category}} of color blocks is the best with medium-high lightness L* and highest chroma C*, which is characterized by the highest absolute value of a*, and indicated the lowest absolute value of b*, which deviates from green; that is, all parameters point to the most brilliant green, so it is classified as the highest quality level of vivid fancy green: marked as “Fancy Vivid”, represents 135 color blocks, accounting for 9.41 % of total color blocks. The first category of color block quality is slightly lower, even though the lightness is slightly higher than the level before the third class, but the chromaticity of the medium a* and b* that makes its chroma is slightly lower than the third class and obviously biased towards the slight yellow tone, with color appearance shows Yang green, so it is classified as a high-level of intense fancy green, marked as “Fancy Intense,” represents 129 color blocks, accounting for 8.99 % of total color blocks. The color of the sixth category of color block {{is similar to that of}} the former category with similar medium chroma a* and lower b*, it performed weakening yellow tone and reducing chroma which its color appearance shows medium green, so it is classified as deep fancy green, marked as “Fancy Deep”, represents 159 color blocks, accounting for 11.08 % of total color blocks. The lightness of the second category of color blocks continues to decrease. Although the color is similar to the former category 6, the color appearance is dark green, so it is classified as dark fancy green: marked as “Fancy Dark”, represents 126 color blocks, accounting for 15.05 % of total color blocks. The lightness of color of category 5 is medium, and the color is some lower than that of the former category 2. The appearance of color is pale dark green, so it is classified as fancy green: marked as “Fancy”, represents 280 color blocks, accounting for 19.51 % of total color blocks. Although the color of the fourth kind of color has relatively high lightness, its chroma is lower than the previous grade of the fifth kind, and its color appearance is pale green, so it is classified as light fancy green: marked as “Fancy Light”, represents 186 color blocks, accounting for 12.96 % of total color blocks. The lightness and <b>chorma</b> of the seventh color block are the lowest among all the seven colors categories. The color appearance is pale green with obvious gray tone. For the green tone, the color is very light, so it is classified as very light green: marked as “Very Light,” represents 186 color blocks, accounting for 12.96 % of total color blocks. Through cluster analysis, the boundary between the seven categories of 1435 test blocks is clear, the proportion of each class is in accordance with the normal distribution, and the consistency among individual cases in the class is very high.|$|E
