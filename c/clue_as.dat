5|$|The gilded {{monogram}} initials on the Library punchbowl {{are perhaps}} the only current <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to the original commissioner of the punchbowls. The initials are difficult to decipher because of partial loss of the gilt Copperplate script. Possibilities include HCA or HA, TCA or FCA over B. Several candidates have been suggested including Henry, 3rd Earl of Bathurst, and Sir Thomas Brisbane, New South Wales Governor in 1821–1825 after Lachlan Macquarie, but the most likely is Henry Colden Antill (1779–1852). Antill was appointed aide-de-camp to the fifth New South Wales Governor, Macquarie who was in office 1810–1821, on his arrival in Sydney on 1January 1810. He was promoted to Major of Brigade in 1811 and retired from the British Army in 1821. Antill settled on land first at Moorebank near Liverpool and then in 1825 on his estate near Picton—named Jarvisfield in honour of Macquarie's first wife, Jane Jarvis. He was buried at Jarvisfield on 14August 1851. Antill had subdivided part of the estate in 1844, making possible {{the founding of the}} town of Picton. When the State Library acquired its punchbowl in 1926, the Antill family of Picton — Henry's antecedents — had no knowledge of the punchbowl's provenance.|$|E

2500|$|The eight {{possible}} {{abbreviations for}} a position on a compass, e.g., NNW (north-northwest) or ESE (east-southeast), occur with some frequency. They can be <b>clued</b> <b>as</b> simply [...] "Compass point", where the desired answer is determined by a combination of logic—since the third letter can be only E or W, and the second letter can be only N or S— and a process of elimination using checks. Alternatively, compass point answers are more frequently <b>clued</b> <b>as</b> [...] "XXX to YYY direction", where XXX and YYY are two place names. For example, SSW might be <b>clued</b> <b>as</b> [...] "New York to Washington DC dir". Similarly, a <b>clue</b> such <b>as</b> [...] "Right on the map" [...] means EAST. A clue could also consist of objects that point a direction, e.g., [...] "vane dir." [...] or [...] "windsock dir.".|$|R

He also postulated its function to be the generation of accelerin (Factor VI), which later {{turned out to be the}} activated form of V (or Va); hence, VI is not now in active use.|$|E

25|$|There {{are very}} few {{historical}} details in the Book of Malachi. The greatest <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to its dating {{may lie in the}} fact that the Persian-era term for governor (pehâ) is used in 1:8. This points to a post-exilic date of composition both because of the use of the Persian period term and because Judah had a king before the exile. Since, in the same verse, the temple has been rebuilt, the book must also be later than 515BC. Malachi was apparently known to the author of Ecclesiasticus early in the 2nd century BC. Because of the development of themes in the book of Malachi, most scholars assign it to a position between Haggai and Zechariah, slightly before Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in 445BC.|$|E
25|$|Harding {{attempted}} {{to win a}} seat in the House of Representatives twice during his tenure as a senator.

Junor won the election, 5,980 to 4,356, a difference of 1,624 votes. In the 1997 election, Harding attempted to unseat another sitting PNP representative, Horace O. <b>Clue,</b> <b>as</b> part of a three way race for the Saint Andrew East Rural seat that Harding contested twenty years prior. Securing 4,819 votes, Harding came second in the voting, behind Horace Clue's 6,769 votes, but well ahead of the 1,026 votes secured by National Democratic Movement candidate Andre Foote. The People's National Party won both elections overall.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} whether Arrúe has {{inherited}} Traditionalist outlook from his ancestors – like most Carlists in Basque-Navarrese area have – or whether he embraced it during the schooling and academic years. None of the sources consulted offers also any <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to which branch of the movement he joined in the 1920s, the Jaimistas, the Mellistas or the Integristas, though it is the latter group which seems most probable. Asteasu was in the very centre of the Integrist national stronghold, composed of Tolosa and Azpeitia districts; an Anastasio Arrúe was jefe of the local Tolosan Integrist junta, and a Pedro Arrúe was its treasurer; Antonio’s father as an organist was closely related to the parochial clergy; finally, in the early 1930s Antonio commenced collaboration with , the local Gipuzkoan Integrist daily, later editing its newly introduced section in Basque.|$|E

25|$|Exposure to light, {{physical}} damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content {{within the}} tuber. Cooking at high temperatures—over —partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloids may cause headaches, diarrhea, cramps, and in severe cases coma and death; however, poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely. Light exposure causes greening from chlorophyll synthesis, thus giving a visual <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to {{areas of the}} tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this {{does not provide a}} definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids. The Lenape variety was released in 1967 but was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids. Since then breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising cultivar.|$|E

500|$|The {{texts of}} Mari {{show that the}} cult of stones, {{especially}} the [...] "sikkanum" [...] (i.e., Betyles—sacred stones), was widespread in western Syria, and its practice in Qatna is plausible.

Research done after 1999 ruled out du Mesnil du Buisson's hypothesis {{and concluded that the}} room is a bathroom, but further research showed that the bathroom interpretation must also be wrong. Pfälzner, based on its architecture being suitable for containing sacred stones, suggested that room F was the palace shrine for the cult of Betyles. Pfälzner concludes that [...] "an ultimate proof, however, for the function of Room F at Qaṭna cannot be deduced from this parallel. Nor is there a <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to the dedication of the possible Betyle-sanctuary at Qaṭna".|$|E
