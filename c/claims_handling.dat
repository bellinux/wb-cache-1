Lott and Taylor had pushed through federal legislation to investigate <b>claims</b> <b>handling</b> of State Farm and other insurers after Hurricane Katrina, a potential conflict of interest. On July 30, 2008, the Associated Press reported that during a deposition related to the Hurricane Katrina claims, Zach Scruggs, son of Richard Scruggs, was asked by State Farm Fire & Casualty Cos. attorney Jim Robie, [...] "Has it been your custom and habit in prosecuting litigation to have Senator Lott contact and encourage witnesses to give false information?" [...] Zach Scruggs responded, [...] "I invoke my Fifth Amendment rights in response to that question." [...] On February 14, 2009, The New York Times noted in relation to an indictment of Judge Bobby DeLaughter for taking bribes from Scruggs that federal prosecutors have said that Lott was induced by Scruggs to offer DeLaughter a federal judgeship in order to gain the judge's favor. [...] The Richard Scruggs controversy was the subject of the 2009 book Kings of Tort in 2009 by Alan Lange, and the 2010 book The Fall of the House of Zeus: The Rise and Ruin of America's Most Powerful Trial Lawyer.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1970s, {{insurers}} {{argued that}} these early cases {{should be read}} as holding that it was bad faith to deny a claim only when the insurer already knew {{that it had no}} reasonable basis for denying the claim (i.e., when the insurer had already acquired information showing a potentially covered claim and denied it anyway). In other words, they contended that only intentional mistreatment of an insured should be actionable in bad faith, versus merely grossly negligent <b>claim</b> <b>handling.</b> In 1979, California's highest court refuted that argument and further expanded the scope of the tort by holding that inadequate investigation of a claim was actionable in tort as a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.|$|R

The disability severity of motor claims is assessed in numerous European countries by means of score systems.

It is the flexibility to choose whether it is more lucrative to execute a process instance internally or externally depending on the current work load in the process.
