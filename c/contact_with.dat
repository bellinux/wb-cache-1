5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E
