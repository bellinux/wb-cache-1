25|$|The Testarossa is a two-door coupé that premiered at the 1984 Paris Auto Show. All {{versions}} of the Testarossa had the power fed through the wheels from a rear-mounted, five-speed manual transmission. The rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout (engine between the axles but behind the cabin) keeps the centre of gravity {{in the middle of}} the car, which increases stability and improves the car's <b>cornering</b> <b>ability,</b> and thus results in a standing weight distribution of 40% front: 60% rear. The original Testarossa was re-engineered for 1992 and released as the 512 TR, at the Los Angeles Auto Show, effectively as a completely new car, and an improved weight distribution of 41% front: 59% rear. The F512 M was introduced at the 1994 Paris Auto Show. The car dropped the TR initials and added the M which in Italian stood for modificata, or translated to modified, and was the final version of the Testarossa, and continued its predecessor's weight distribution improvement of 42% front: 58% rear. The F512 M was Ferrari's last mid-engine 12-cylinder car, apart from the limited edition F50, Enzo and LaFerrari, featuring the company's last flat engine. The Testarossa was replaced in 1996 by the front-engined 550 Maranello coupé.|$|E
500|$|Lotus had {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} ground effect to the Formula One world championship in [...] with their fast, but not always reliable, Type 78. Peter Wright and Colin Chapman had discovered that by carefully shaping {{the underside of the}} car, they could accelerate the air passing under the car, thereby reducing the air pressure under the car relative to that over it and pushing the tyres down harder onto the track. The increased downforce gave more grip and thus higher cornering speeds. Ground effect had the great advantage of being a low drag solution, unlike conventional wings, meaning that the increased <b>cornering</b> <b>ability</b> was not compromised by a decrease in straight line speed. In 1978 Lotus ironed out the reliability problems and further developed the concept from relatively simple sidepods with a wing profile into full venturi tunnels under the car. As soon as they appeared at Zolder, the black and gold Type 79s of Mario Andretti and Ronnie Peterson outpaced the opposition by a comfortable margin.|$|E
5000|$|The car {{has been}} {{described}} by critics as [...] "putting its power down effectively and tackling twisty roads with confidence." [...] The standard wheels had 215 mm width tyres which greatly contributed to its <b>cornering</b> <b>abilities.</b>|$|R

50|$|Automotive {{aerodynamics}} is {{the study}} of the aerodynamics of road vehicles. Its main goals are reducing drag and wind noise, minimizing noise emission, and preventing undesired lift forces and other causes of aerodynamic instability at high speeds. Air is also considered a fluid in this case. For some classes of racing vehicles, it may also be important to produce downforce to improve traction and thus <b>cornering</b> <b>abilities.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Cruiser {{the rider}} {{sits at a}} lower seat height with the upper torso upright or leaning {{slightly}} rearward. Legs are extended forwards, sometimes {{out of reach of}} the regular controls on cruiser pegs. The low seat height can be a consideration for new or short riders. Handlebars tend to be high and wide. [...] The emphasis is on comfort, while compromising <b>cornering</b> <b>ability</b> because of low ground clearance and the greater likelihood of scraping foot pegs, floor boards, or other parts if turns are taken at the speeds other motorcycles can more readily accomplish.|$|E
2500|$|Car and Driver {{magazine}} {{tested the}} car, {{and found a}} 0- time of 3.6 seconds, a 0- time of 7.6 seconds, and a quarter-mile time of 11.5 seconds at [...] Dodge's claims for top speed are [...] for the Roadster and [...] for the Coupe. Car and Driver also tested the Viper's track performance, and managed a fast sub-3minute lap time around Virginia International Raceway. The Viper's time, despite hot weather, was faster than the Corvette Z06, Ford GT, Nissan GTR, Porsche 911 Turbo, 911 GT3, and 911 GT2, Audi R8, and similar cars. According to Car and Driver and Motor Trend, the car's slightly adjusted suspension setup and new differential gave it <b>cornering</b> <b>ability</b> as sharp as before with better control, feedback, and response.|$|E

5000|$|Ice racing {{tires are}} either studded or non-studded. Studded tires have a stud {{such as a}} screw or bolt to provide better {{traction}} and increased speed. Some studs are sharpened to increase penetration. [...] Tires cannot be purchased with studs, so the pit crew needs to attach the studs to the tire. Through 2008, Menard's Racing in Wisconsin manufactured and sold studded racing tires for cars, and they were required in many ice-racing classes. Cars with studded tires are generally required to contain a roll cage and increased safety equipment since they achieve much more speed with the greater <b>cornering</b> <b>abilities.</b>|$|R

Specifically, goal setting and publicly posted feedback improved the athletic performance of college level football players in two studies, and high school soccer players in one study. The present study found goal setting and publicly posted feedback improved tennis performance for six participants. A multiple baseline across participants design was used. Specifically, the participants improved their <b>corner</b> hitting <b>ability,</b> which is an important competitive shot in tennis. The participants improved their <b>corner</b> hitting <b>ability</b> from an average of 11. 8 % in baseline to 19. 6 % in intervention...|$|R

25|$|A mid-engine layout was {{originally}} chosen {{as a way}} to reduce both aerodynamic drag and vehicle weight to improve fuel efficiency, and also for its handling, traction, and braking benefits. However, the sports car potential of the mid-engine layout was not realized when the Fiero debuted. As a cost-saving measure commonly employed at GM, the tires, brakes, and suspension components were carried over from other GM economy cars (like the X and T platforms). As a result, the handling and <b>cornering</b> <b>abilities</b> of the initial Fiero were merely on par with other contemporary sporty coupes (Road & Track 1985). Additionally, the Iron Duke I4 motor, which was designed for optimal running at low RPM, was unsuited to drivers who purchased the Fiero expecting a quick, high-revving motor more in keeping with the design of the car. As drivers attempted to frequently run the engine at greater RPM than it was designed for, the engines experienced a number of reliability problems and breakdowns were frequent.|$|R
50|$|Sonic, {{who drives}} {{a red and}} white sports car known as the Cyclone, has great speed and {{handling}} but poor control, and has a speed boost as his Special Ability. Tails, who drives a 1960s-era Formula 1 car called the MTP-01 Wheelwind, is well-balanced {{in terms of his}} speed, acceleration and handling, but does not stand out in any particular area- he can utilize a powerful jump as his Special Ability, which allows him to avoid obstacles and particularly tough corners. Eggman (as he is referred to in this game), who pilots a modified version of his standard Eggmobile known as the Egg Typhoon, has poor acceleration, but has very high top speed and <b>cornering</b> <b>abilities,</b> and can toss Bombs onto the track that can cause his rivals to spin out. Finally, Amy Rose, who drives a yellow and blue vintage convertible called the Breeze, has great acceleration at the cost of low top speed, and has the ability to attack by throwing small heart-shaped objects that slow down her opponents and alter their controls for a short time.|$|R
30|$|According to the Bode plot of G_ 1, when ζ> 1.2, {{the gains}} are {{positive}} near the <b>corner</b> frequency, the <b>ability</b> to recurrence signal decreases, {{and the noise}} will be amplified at high frequency. Therefore, the most appropriate range of ζ is 0.5 – 1.0. Therefore, let ζ = 0.707.|$|R
50|$|Of course {{things should}} be the same, left and right, for road cars. Camber affects {{steering}} because a tire generates a force towards the side that the top is leaning towards. This is called camber thrust. Additional front negative camber is used to improve the <b>cornering</b> <b>ability</b> of cars with insufficient camber gain.|$|E
50|$|The greater force {{downwards}} on the tyres {{gave more}} grip and thus higher cornering speeds. This ground effect had the great {{advantage of being}} a low drag solution unlike conventional wings, meaning that the increased <b>cornering</b> <b>ability</b> was not compromised by a decrease in straight-line speed. If anything, because of the decreased air resistance, the top speed of the car also increased accordingly.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{the wheel}} track width through spacers and wide body kits enhance the cars <b>cornering</b> <b>ability.</b> Lowering {{the center of}} gravity via {{suspension}} modifications is another aim of body tuning. Often, suspension tuners unfamiliar with spring dynamics will cut stock springs, producing a harder, bouncy ride. It is also common to lower the car too far, beyond the optimal height for performance, purely for appearance.|$|E
50|$|In basic terms, {{the apex}} or {{clipping}} {{point is the}} point on the inside portion of a corner that a vehicle passes closest to. The apex can also {{be described as the}} point of minimum radius and slowest speed achieved in a corner. An apex can be defined as being an earlier apex or later apex. An earlier apex will reach the inside of a corner at a higher speed and with a larger radius than a later apex. A driver will typically choose their apex based on their vehicle's <b>corner</b> exit <b>abilities</b> with higher acceleration optimally requiring a later apex.|$|R
50|$|These {{detectors}} {{are more}} completely described in blob detection. The scale-normalized Laplacian of the Gaussian and difference-of-Gaussian features (Lindeberg 1994, 1998; Lowe 2004) {{do not necessarily}} make highly selective features, since these operators may also lead to responses near edges. To improve the <b>corner</b> detection <b>ability</b> of the differences of Gaussians detector, the feature detector used in the SIFT system therefore uses an additional post-processing stage, where the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the image at the detection scale are examined {{in a similar way}} as in the Harris operator. If the ratio of the eigenvalues is too high, then the local image is regarded as too edge-like, so the feature is rejected. Also Lindeberg's Laplacian of the Gaussian feature detector can be defined to comprise complementary thresholding on a complementary differential invariant to suppress responses near edges.|$|R

Wooten and James (2008) provide a conceptual model that describes leadership competencies in each of the five stages of crisis management. The development of the crisis identification and aversion instrument was to operationalize the Wooten and James (2008) conceptual model with a focus only on the pre-crisis stages of crisis management competencies. The crisis identification and aversion instrument has been validated through item reduction and content validation {{through the use of a}} Delphi panel of experts, item evaluation through the use of a large sample and factor analysis and assessment of construct validity. The validated instrument measures a leader’s ability to identify and avert crisis by measuring three competencies: sensemaking, participatory management, and resourcefulness.

50|$|Sonic Free Riders is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog universe. The game is controlled by using the player's body to navigate their chosen character through the course. Actions include bending their body to steer, performing kicking motions to increase speed and jumping to perform tricks which earn more boost. The player {{has the ability to}} ride bikes, controlled by steering motions. By collecting enough rings, players can increase their level during each race, which enhances their attributes. There are several power-ups and weapons which each require specific motion actions to activate, such as a missile which is thrown like a football or a boost that is activated by shaking a soda can. As before, characters are divided into Speed, Flight, and Power classes. Players can equip special attributes to their Gear, such as improved <b>cornering</b> or the <b>ability</b> to break through barriers, which can be changed by switching the riding stance. Players can also perform special moves if lacking in races. The game's main single player campaign is the Grand Prix mode, where players select from one of several teams of characters to play through the story. Along with Time Attack and Free Race modes, Sonic Free Riders also features a few multiplayer modes that can be played co-operatively. Tag Mode allows two players to race together, required synchronised coordination to perform combined tricks, while Relay mode, playable with up to 4 players, requires teammates to swap places after each lap. The local multiplayer supports up to two active players while online player multiplayer features one active player per console for up to 8 players. The game also supports voice recognition, allowing people to navigate menus using their voice.|$|R
40|$|Tuminah, S 890907030 : Improving Students’ Vocabulary Mastery Using Beyond Centers and Circle Time Method (A Classroom Action Research in the Islam Kindergarten of Fahimna Surakarta in the Academic Year 2008 / 2009). Surakarta: English Education Department Graduate Program University of Sebelas Maret. This {{thesis is}} written {{to improve the}} students’ {{vocabulary}} mastery. The problem highlighted in this research is the low vocabulary mastery of Kindergarten students in Fahimna Surakarta that is caused by (1) the students’ difficulties in understanding meaning; (2) the students’ difficulties in using English words; (3) the students’ difficulties in pronouncing the words. The research is conducted in three cycles from April 2008 to March 2009 in group B of Islam Kindergarten of Fahimna Surakarta. The procedure of the research consist of identifying the problem, planning the action, implementing the action, observing the action, and reflecting {{the result of the}} research. In collecting the data, the researcher uses observational technique supported with test. The researcher finds quantitative data by doing the test. The tests are in the form of pre-test and post-test. In finding qualitative data, the researcher does direct observation in the classroom, interviews the teacher and the students. The quantitative data are analyzed by descriptive statistics. The qualitative data are analyzed by Constant Comparative Method. The result of the research shows that Beyond Center and Circle Time Method (BCCT) can improve the students’ vocabulary mastery. There is significant improvement in the result of pre-test and post-test of cycle one, two, and three. The mean in pre-test is 6. 2. In cycle one the mean is 6. 7, in cycle two the mean is 8. 2, and in cycle 3 the mean is 8. 8. The data prove that BCCT method really improve the students’ vocabulary mastery. First, they get vocabulary meaning from the main activities in the <b>corner.</b> Second, their <b>ability</b> in pronouncing English words improves through presentation in the circle time. Third, their ability in using English words improves through production phase. Fourth, creating interesting activities in the corner can make the students interested in learning English. Anyhow, there are some weaknesses of using BCCT method. When the teacher doesn’t have an ability to manage the class well, the classroom situation will be very crowded. If the teacher isn’t creative and innovative in creating activities in the corner, some students don’t join in the corner’s activities. The teacher should use interesting media, so that the students will be interested in joining English lesson. The institution should prove the required facilities to support teaching and learning process. The other researcher should prepare the planning of the research well {{in order to get a}} good result. Besides, the researcher should learn the characteristics of very young learners. Therefore, she/he will be able to overcome the problems related to the students’ psychological. The teacher must not either stay in her chair or stand in one place. The teacher has to give the instruction as explicit as possible. It will be better the teacher uses Total Physical Response (TPR). The use of TPR will be easier for the students to response the instruction. Through BCCT method, the students can play in the corner while they are learning. The teacher should be creative and innovative in creating activities in the corner to improve students’ vocabulary mastery...|$|R
