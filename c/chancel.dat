5|$|The <b>chancel</b> {{finally was}} {{restored}} 1880–1884. The <b>chancel</b> glass by Stephen Belham is to Seddon’s designs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chancel,</b> {{which has}} a ceiling {{decorated}} by C. E. Kempe, has three windows {{in the style of}} the late 12th century, and a priest's door built into the south side circa 1250. A south porch was built in 1621 at the behest of Dr Robert Burton, whose arms are carved in the gable above the date. A candelabrum given by Ann Kendall in 1705 hangs in the <b>chancel.</b> The <b>chancel</b> ceiling was decorated with a pattern of gold stars on a blue background in 1914. Two years later, an altar was erected at the east end of the north aisle, and an aumbry placed in the north wall of the <b>chancel.</b> The royal arms of William IV are displayed in the tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry (mainly gritstone) and dressed with freestone. The nave {{measures}} 44feet 9inches long by 15feet 6inches wide (13.6 by 4.7m) and the <b>chancel</b> measures 32feet 9inches long by 20feet 6inches (10 by 6.25m) wide. The nave has three bays, and the <b>chancel</b> {{at the east}} end of the nave has two bays; it is slightly wider than the nave. The nave and the <b>chancel</b> have external buttresses.|$|E
5|$|By the 13th century, {{the church}} had a stone-built nave and chancel; the latter survives in the present building, as does a 12th-century font which was {{probably}} taken from the building in place at that time. A <b>chancel</b> arch was inserted between the nave and <b>chancel</b> in about 1300. The dedication to Saint Margaret is later: it was first recorded in 1489.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Francis Blomefield, in his Collectanea Cantabrigiensia, {{recorded}} StJames' {{as having}} a square tower, with four bells and a clock. The north aisle was leaded {{and there was a}} chantry chapel at the east end with a screen. He concludes this to be the <b>Chancel</b> of the Resurrection. At this time, the south aisle, nave and <b>chancel</b> were also recorded as leaded.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, {{a gallery}} {{was added to}} the west end of the <b>chancel,</b> and in 1934 the North Chapel was added.|$|E
5|$|On the Gospel {{side of the}} <b>chancel</b> is a large hand-carved wood pulpit, {{decorated}} with carved figures of the four Evangelists.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the current}} nave and <b>chancel</b> date from the 14th century, but the church was rebuilt and {{enlarged}} by William Hastings in 1474, {{at the same time}} that he erected the tower of his nearby castle. The new, larger church included a nave with aisles and chapels adjoining the <b>chancel.</b> The tower, Hastings Chapel, and some buttresses and windows still remain from the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|The 13th-century <b>chancel</b> has two rib vaulted bays, {{making it}} one of only six extant Early English vaulted chancels. Its walls were raised in the 15th century by {{constructing}} a chamber above the vaulting using stone from the demolished 13th-century nave, but, from the outside, this end of the church is still lower than the western section. Internally, the <b>chancel</b> vault is much lower than the adjacent nave because of the room above. It has three 15th-century Perpendicular windows down each side, and is notable for the unusual east window with seven stepped lights, a feature found in only two other Early English churches, Lincoln Cathedral and St Martins in Ockham. The <b>chancel</b> contains three simple sedilia, or priest's seats, with trefoil arches and round columns. The sacristry behind the altar has a small lancet window, and the chamber above the <b>chancel,</b> which is floored only by the curved upper surface of the vault below, is lit by a single two-light window.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{which is}} {{built in the}} Decorated style, has a nave at the west end and a <b>chancel</b> at the east end. It is built from rubble masonry dressed with freestone; the roof is made of slate and edged with stone. There is a porch at {{the west end of}} the south wall of the nave and a vestry at the west end of the north wall of the <b>chancel,</b> {{abutting}} the nave. The nave measures approximately 39feet 8inches by 20feet 8inches (12.10m by 6.30m) and the <b>chancel</b> is shorter and narrower at approximately 18feet by 14feet 1inch (5.50 by 4.30m). The total floor space of the church is approximately 1,076square feet (100m2). There is a large bellcote at the west end of the nave, containing one bell.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the <b>chancel</b> from the crossing has a red marble step, with mosaic, and Minton encaustic tile panels of a three-branch lamp, then another marble step and black marble main <b>chancel</b> flooring in small paving slabs. In the sanctuary there are a further three marble steps, with paving of pink marble with black in square or zigzag patterns.|$|E
5|$|The intense {{competition}} for congregations {{also led to}} changes to make worship more attractive that were reflected in architecture. The Church of Scotland {{was among the first}} European Protestant churches to engage in liturgical innovation reflected in seating arrangements, abandoning box pews for open benches. From {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century some of its churches, like Greyfriars in Edinburgh, began installing organs and stained glass windows, reflecting an attempt to return to forms of worship largely excluded since the late seventeenth century. At Duns the church was rebuilt (opened 1888) in a plan used in the Middle Ages, with a separate <b>chancel,</b> communion table at the far end, and the pulpit under the <b>chancel</b> arch. The influence of the ecclesiological movement can be seen in churches built at Crathie (opened 1893), which had an apsidal <b>chancel</b> raised above the level of the nave, a stone pulpit and a brass lectern, and St. Cuthbert's, Edinburgh (rebuilt 1894), with a marble communion table in a <b>chancel</b> decorated with marble and mosaic.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{consists of}} <b>chancel,</b> nave, transepts and south porch, and is formed of rough materials, now largely plastered and whitewashed.|$|E
5|$|The nave and <b>chancel</b> {{are divided}} from the aisles by seven-bay arcades, the piers being without capitals. At {{the top of}} each pier, facing the nave, is a carved human face. The roofs are divided into panels and contain much carving, {{including}} bosses (protrusions), shields, inscriptions and three pendants. The chapel at the west end of the south aisle is known as the Lady Chapel, and that on the north side is dedicated to Saint Mary. The church contains more medieval fittings and furniture than any other Cheshire church. Between the nave and the <b>chancel</b> is a screen, and there are parclose screens between the aisles and the chapels. The <b>chancel</b> screen, dated 1500, is elaborately carved with representations of birds, roses, vines and foliage. It has ten bays with lierne vaulting. The <b>chancel</b> stalls and the carved wooden eagle lectern date from around the same period. The lectern {{is one of the oldest}} eagle lecterns in the United Kingdom. The stalls have hinged seats, and formerly had misericords (shelves to support a standing person). Much of the furniture dates from the 17thcentury and is in Jacobean style. This includes the altar rails, the octagonal pulpit, the box pews, the reredos (screen behind the altar) in the Lady Chapel, and the font cover. The font itself is Perpendicular. The reredos in the <b>chancel</b> of 1866 was designed by the Manchester architect J. S. Crowther.|$|E
5|$|The nave roof becomes {{increasingly}} elaborate towards the <b>chancel.</b> The nave roof is of eight by twelve panels, boarded with bosses and brattished wall plates.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch, Turnham Green is {{an early}} Victorian Gothic {{building}} of flint with stone dressings. The {{main part of the}} building, by George Gilbert Scott and W. B. Moffat, is from 1843; the <b>chancel</b> and northeast chapel were added in 1887 by J. Brooks.|$|E
5|$|Externally, {{there are}} slate roofs and coped gables with cross finials. The roofs have {{patterned}} bands of fishscale Whitland Abbey slates, {{except on the}} nave. There are large scale, plain unbuttressed walls without batter for the nave, a nineteenth century south porch, two transepts and a <b>chancel</b> with a nineteenth century addition of a north choir vestry; the dating of the priests' vestry, {{on the north side}} of the <b>chancel,</b> is less certain. Externally, the nave downpipes on the south side are dated 1884.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a common}} {{practice}} in convents and collegiate churches {{it is believed that}} there were usually choir stalls in the west end of the <b>chancel</b> (often called the choir or quire). Several Seddon pews remain here, although the choir today occupies the crossing.|$|E
5|$|Initially, as {{in some of}} the {{continental}} cathedrals, the interior was decorated with designs emphasizing the arch ribs and portal components. Even the brick was painted with red and white stripes. In the 15th century, frescos of figures in the Late Gothic style with decorative vine leaves were painted {{in various parts of the}} church. Traces of these have been found in the <b>chancel</b> and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf. Unfortunately, they have now been heavily restored. The frescos in the <b>chancel</b> were probably painted by Albertus Pictor's workshop.|$|E
5|$|John III (died 1592), {{the second}} son of Gustav Vasa, {{and his second}} wife Gunilla Bielke are also buried in the Virgin Mary Chapel. His first wife, Catherine Jagiellon from Poland, has a burial chapel of her own {{on the north side}} of the <b>chancel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out {{beginning}} in 1825. The floor-level was raised above flood-level, a full three feet. The roof was rebuilt, the south wall was rebuilt using the original materials, and the main features of the 12th-century <b>chancel</b> arch were discarded.|$|E
5|$|St Edern's Church, Bodedern (sometimes {{referred}} to as St Ederyn's Church) is a medieval parish church {{in the village of}} Bodedern, in Anglesey, north Wales. Although St Edern established a church in the area in the 6th century, the oldest parts of the present building date from the 14th century. Subsequent alterations include the addition of some windows in the 15th century, and a <b>chancel,</b> transept and porch in the 19th century, when the nave walls were largely rebuilt. Stained glass was also inserted into the windows of the <b>chancel</b> and transept.|$|E
5|$|St Eugrad's Church, Llaneugrad is an {{isolated}} church {{near the village}} of Marian-glas, in Anglesey, north Wales. A church was supposedly founded here by St Eugrad in about 605, although the earliest parts of the present structure are the nave, <b>chancel</b> and <b>chancel</b> arch, which date from the 12th century. A side chapel was added to the north in the 16th century, and some moderate restoration work was carried out in the 19th century. It contains a 12th-century font, a 13th-century carved stone depicting the crucifixion, and a memorial to one of the officers killed when the Royal Charter sank off Anglesey in 1859.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chancel</b> {{contains}} memorials to the Lords Stanley of Alderley. The {{memorial to}} John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley contains his effigy dressed in peer's robes lying under a canopy {{with his hand}} on a book, dated 1856 and by Richard Westmacott. On {{the other side of the}} <b>chancel</b> is a memorial to his son Edward Stanley, his effigy holding a scroll in his hand and with a dog at his feet. Engraved in brass on the side of the memorial are the figures of his widow and children. Lady Stanley is seated in the middle with their four surviving sons on her right, five surviving daughters on her left and three children who had died at a young age at her knee and on her lap. A memorial tablet to John Constantine Stanley, who died in 1878, is by Joseph Boehm. The <b>chancel</b> contains a monument to Rev.Edward Shipton, rector of the church from 1625 to 1630.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{parts of}} the present structure are the nave and the <b>chancel,</b> which are 13th-century. The church shows signs of alterations and additions in subsequent centuries. A transept or chapel {{was added to the}} south side of the <b>chancel</b> in the late 13th or early 14th century. The arch between them was once the archway between the <b>chancel</b> and the nave but was later moved. The bellcote at the west end of the roof was added in the 14th century. The porch on {{the south side of the}} nave was built in about 1500, and was re-roofed in 1725. A doorway in the north wall of the nave was inserted in the late 15th or early 16th century, and now leads into a vestry added in the 19th century. The main roof is largely 17th-century. Some repairs were carried out in the 1840s, with further repairs in 1854 under the supervision of the diocesan architect, Henry Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the chapel is marked by quartered oak ceilings, bluestone floors, and five original Tiffany stained glass windows. The <b>chancel</b> contains an onyx altar and mosaic floor made of more than twenty colors of marble.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church includes four 15th-century tomb-chests, some 15th-century stained glass in the <b>chancel,</b> medieval vestments, and a domestic cupboard of about 1500 which was once at Witham Charterhouse.|$|E
5|$|The nave of {{the church}} (where the {{congregation}} sat) has no aisle. The <b>chancel</b> (site of the altar) is at {{the east end of}} the nave. There is a porch, which contains an 18th-century memorial, {{on the south side of}} the nave towards the west end, and a vestry to the north. Each section is steeply gabled, with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell. The windows in the nave have two lights (sections of window separated by mullions), save for one to the west of the porch, which has one light. The east end of the <b>chancel</b> has three adjoining lancet windows, the tallest in the middle.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building, which incorporated {{stone and}} tiles scavenged from the Roman fort, {{was a simple}} one consisting only of a nave and an apsidal <b>chancel,</b> with a small room, or porticus, built out {{from each of the}} church's northern and southern sides where the nave and <b>chancel</b> met. The church was much altered and expanded during the Middle Ages; the last addition, in the 15th century, was of north and south porches leading into the nave. This expansion coincided with a long period of prosperity for the settlement of Reculver, but its decline led to the church's decay and, in the face of coastal erosion, its almost complete demolition in 1809.|$|E
5|$|Two marble steps {{rise from}} the nave to the <b>chancel.</b> At {{the top of the}} steps is a hand-carved white wood communion rail, {{decorated}} with miniature onyx columns and topped with marble.|$|E
5|$|A chapel in {{the village}} was first {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Survey in 1086. The Norman church of St Andrew was first constructed in 1160 after the previous chapel was demolished. The church has flint walls whereas its <b>chancel</b> has cemented walls, along with windows dating from the 14th century. The church was restored in the 19th century, along with a nave extension {{and the addition of}} a new <b>chancel</b> arch. The churchyard has a Grade II listed war memorial which is dedicated to fallen soldiers of the First World War. The memorial is made out of Cornish granite and features a Celtic cross with a crusader's sword sculpted in its centre; it was unveiled on 17 October 1920 by Admiral Jervoise and dedicated by the rector of St Andrew's Church.|$|E
5|$|A {{church in}} Ickenham is not {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book and it is likely that residents travelled to nearby Harefield for services. The original nave and <b>chancel</b> of St Giles' church have been dated to 1335 while the nave was extended west in 1959. The bell turret was built in the 15th century and a brick aisle added in 1575.|$|E
5|$|A large {{range of}} {{seventeenth and eighteenth}} century monuments survive, mainly in the <b>chancel.</b> They include some {{for members of the}} major landowning {{families}} in the (original) parish, including the Powells of Nanteos (who were long-time Lords of the Manor of Llanbadarn Fawr) and the Pryses of Gogerddan. A white marble tablet was erected in 1666 to Colonel John Jones, of Nanteos. Several of the monuments are substantial, including that to Lewis Pryse, erected by his widow Margaret, {{to the left of the}} north wall window. To the left of the great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several members of her family. To the right side of the altar – the epistle side of the <b>chancel</b> – is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments are mounted above both of these. In the south wall there is a large memorial to William Powell, and several smaller memorials.|$|E
5|$|A £3million {{refurbishment}} of {{the crypt}} {{was completed in}} 2009 and was officially re-opened on 1 May that year by the Duke of Gloucester. The refurbishment included new east and west approaches, archive provision, rewiring and new lighting, catering facilities, a new <b>chancel,</b> new toilets and revamped exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 1158 to {{the early}} 16th century, Oxford Cathedral was always a small cathedral and was made smaller by the {{destruction}} {{of much of the}} nave in the 16th century. The stone spire, from 1230, {{is one of the oldest}} in England and contributes to Oxford’s tradition as “the city of dreaming spires”. Its most unusual feature is the late-15th-century pendant vault over the Norman <b>chancel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{disagreed}} {{about its}} age, {{and the existence}} of an older church on the same site. The tower has been dated by its architecture to between 1230 and 1240, but other historians question this date and suggest the tower and the body of the church both date to the 14thcentury. The porch appears to be a 17thcentury addition. There is a tomb of Margaret deCamois in the nave. It has been suggested that its location there, rather than the <b>chancel</b> as would be expected for the family of the lord of the manor (which her surname suggests she was), may indicate that the church was built on the site of an earlier, smaller, church and the tomb was in the <b>chancel</b> of that church. Local historian Roger Chatterton-Newman disagrees, saying there would be no need for a church on the site any earlier.|$|E
