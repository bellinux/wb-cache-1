Following the war, the RAAF had been rapidly demobilised, but in mid-1948, the increasingly tense atmosphere of the Cold War in Europe, as evidenced by the Berlin Blockade, resulted in its resurgence. The Citizen Air Force Squadrons were then re-formed in Australia. This was followed in 1950 by the rapid formation of University Squadrons.

500|$|Baxter's biggest {{clashes with}} {{academic}} staff were over governance issues. He had {{a preference for}} industry-style organisation, with clear lines of authority. In 1957, he created a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>deans,</b> chaired by himself, that met every Wednesday. This became the vice-chancellor's advisory committee in 1960. Through this he created an administrative mechanism which set the university free from the traditional constraints. He did away {{with the election of}} deans by the faculty, replacing it with one in which deans were appointed by the University Council on his recommendation. This provided for more efficient administration, but violated the academic tradition of a dean being primus inter pares among academic colleagues. This aroused the ire of academic staff, and in the end a compromise was reached whereby each faculty elected a chairman who was responsible for academic matters, while the council appointed a dean {{who was in charge of}} administrative matters. This proved to be quite successful, and was retained by Baxter's successors. Ronald Hartwell characterised Baxter's administration as [...] "unusual, undemocratic and unacademic". His successor, Rupert Myers, declared that: [...] "History will show Sir Philip Baxter to have been a great educational administrator who built a fine university and made many beneficial changes in the ways universities handled their business and interacted with governments and the community." ...|$|E

5000|$|San Diego State University was {{originally}} two separate schools. San Diego Normal School had school colors {{of white and}} gold. San Diego Junior College had school colors of blue and gold. They decided to merge schools in 1921 to form San Diego State College. The first school colors of SDSC were blue, white and gold. During the 1921 school year they had their first football game. The central athletic figure at San Diego State {{at the time was}} Charles E. Peterson. He had originally been appointed in 1916 as a physical education instructor. After serving in World War I, President Hardy prevailed upon him to return and oversee the school's athletics program. Initially, Peterson taught all the men's physical education classes and coached all the intercollegiate teams. After the athletic teams were established in 1921, media referred to the teams as [...] "Staters" [...] or [...] "professors". The school newspaper tried to encourage [...] "Wampus Cats" [...] during its coverage of the 1923-24 school year. In the fall of 1924, Athletic Director C.E. Peterson urged the students to select a nickname and the school newspaper, The Paper Lantern, invited suggestions. Over the next few issues, names such as Panthers, Balboans and Thoroughbreds were suggested and submitted to a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> Al Peterson, C.E. Peterson and a student. In 1925, student leaders chose the nickname [...] "Aztecs" [...] over such other suggestions as [...] "Balboans". They felt the terminology was more representative of a southwest image and the selection met with no dissent. In February 1925, President Hardy gave his formal approval to the [...] "Aztec" [...] nickname and teams adopted that identity within a week.|$|R

His inaugural paper presented several innovative solutions to infrastructure development in Nigeria and is considered to have laid seeds for the pioneering of laterite as a road construction material for developing nations. In addition, he suggested a more resilient road construction methodology with a better capacity to sustain heavy traffic loads, leading to lower maintenance cost. He remains the longest serving Dean of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Lagos (1968 - 1971) and upon vacating his Deanship was appointed Head of Civil Engineering Department of the same Institution.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} by questionnaire to assess the current undergraduate curricula in the veterinary faculties of sub-Saharan Africa.

Most faculties do not have formal feedback systems to allow former graduates to contribute to periodic reviews of the curricula. Although some north-south and south-south collaboration exists among African veterinary faculties, more intensive regional collaboration at both undergraduate and postgraduate level would allow optimal use of the available funds and human resources.

The Yapunyah Project was an initiative of the Faculty of Health at the Queensland University of Technology, instigated as a result of ethical, clinical, accreditation, and regulatory imperatives to develop cultural competence in health graduates with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives.

The Yapunyah Project involved extensive consultation and collaboration with Indigenous staff and health experts in the local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, and it carefully constructed a core curriculum and associated graduate capabilities.

40|$|Author version made {{available}} {{in accordance with}} the publisher's policy. Objective Governments and the medical profession are concerned that there continues to be less than optimal health outcomes despite escalating expenditure on health services from the effect of the ageing population with chronic illnesses. In this context, doctors will need to have knowledge and skills in effective Chronic Condition Management (CCM) and Chronic Condition Self-Management (CCSM). Method A national workshop of representatives of eight medical schools from the CCSM Special Interest Group (SIG) of the Australian and New Zealand Association on Medical Education (ANZAME) met in September 2004, to consider curriculum content in CCM and CCSM. Results The workshop recommended that the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deans</b> of Australian Medical Schools (CDAMS) and the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA) consider the identification and possible development of a specific curriculum for CCM and CCSM within the curricula of Australian Medical Schools. Discussion Consideration needs to be given to the changing nature of medical practice and that as part of this; doctors of the future will need skills in team participation, continuity of care, self-management support and patient-centered collaborative care planning. Doctors will also need skills to assist patients to better adhere to medical management, lifestyle behaviour change and risk factor reduction, if optimal health outcomes are to be achieved and costs are to be contained...|$|E
