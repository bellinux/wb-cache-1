25|$|Securitization is the {{financial}} practice of pooling {{various types of}} contractual debt such as residential mortgages, <b>commercial</b> <b>mortgages,</b> auto loans or credit card debt obligations (or other non-debt assets which generate receivables) and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities, which may be described as bonds, pass-through securities, or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing. Securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those backed by other types of receivables are asset-backed securities (ABS).|$|E

50|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>mortgages</b> {{frequently}} amortize {{over the}} term of the loan, meaning the borrower pays both interest and principal over time, and the loan balance {{at the end of}} the term is less than the original loan amount. However, unlike residential mortgages, <b>commercial</b> <b>mortgages</b> generally do not fully amortize over the stated term, and therefore frequently end with a balloon payment of the remaining balance, which is often repaid by refinancing the property. Some <b>commercial</b> <b>mortgages</b> have an interest-only period at the beginning of the loan term during which time the borrower only pays interest.|$|E
