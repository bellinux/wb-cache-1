5|$|Originally, the {{decision}} to move Missouri to Pearl Harbor was met with some resistance. The National Park Service {{expressed concern that the}} battleship, whose name has become synonymous with the end of World War II, would overshadow the battleship , whose dramatic explosion and subsequent sinking on 7 December 1941 has since become synonymous with the attack on Pearl Harbor. To help guard against this impression Missouri was placed well back from and facing the Arizona Memorial, so that those participating in military ceremonies on Missouris aft decks would not have sight of the Arizona Memorial. The decision to have Missouris bow face the Arizona Memorial was intended to <b>convey</b> <b>that</b> Missouri watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizonas hull may rest in peace.|$|E

25|$|In recent decades, Christine de Pizan's {{work has}} been {{returned}} to prominence by the efforts of scholars such as Charity Cannon Willard, Earl Jeffrey Richards and Simone de Beauvoir. Certain scholars have argued {{that she should be}} seen as an early feminist who efficiently used language to <b>convey</b> <b>that</b> women could play an important role within society. This characterization has been challenged by other critics, who say that it is either an anachronistic use of the word or a misinterpretation of her writing and intentions.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} Atlantis is a lost land has {{made of it}} a metaphor for {{something}} no longer attainable. For the American poet Edith Willis Linn Forbes (1865-1945), “The Lost Atlantis” stands for idealisation of the past; the present moment can only be treasured once that is realised. Ella Wheeler Wilcox finds the location of “The Lost Land” (1910) in one’s carefree youthful past. Similarly, for the Irish poet Eavan Boland in “Atlantis, a lost sonnet” (2007), the idea was defined when “the old fable-makers searched hard for a word/ to <b>convey</b> <b>that</b> what is gone is gone forever”.|$|E
25|$|French {{had already}} created (1909–1912) a major {{memorial}} statue of Lincoln—this one standing—for the Nebraska State Capitol (Abraham Lincoln, 1912) in Lincoln, Nebraska. His {{previous studies of}} Lincoln—which included biographies, photographs, and a life mask of Lincoln by Leonard Volk done in 1860—had prepared him for the challenging task of the larger statue. For the national memorial, he and Bacon decided that a large seated figure would be most appropriate. French started with a small clay study and subsequently created several plaster models, each time making subtle changes in the figure's pose or setting. He placed the President not in an ordinary 19th-century seat, but in a classical chair including fasces, a Roman symbol of authority, to <b>convey</b> <b>that</b> the subject was an eminence for all the ages.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to <b>convey</b> <b>that</b> strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to <b>convey</b> <b>that</b> the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E

While Hall noted that he had a great father as a child, he felt the message needed to be conveyed to dads. Hall and the band wrote the song in about two days, in order to get it done prior to an annual NASCAR event held by their church.

500|$|Todd's {{long hair}} was also {{integral}} to the character. It was described by Soap Opera Magazine as [...] "enigmatic, {{with an air of}} innate authority".

[...] Todd's [...] "overhanging brow" [...] seemed threatening, but instead concealed the [...] "intense, vulnerable eyes underneath", features that contrasted well with the character's [...] "pouty, sensual mouth". The features, which conferred [...] "a charming, boyish quality", could sometimes <b>convey</b> <b>that</b> Todd was less dangerous than he actually was. Photographer Robert Milazzo believed Howarth's hair softened Todd's character. [...] "You don't expect that intensity because of it," [...] he said, and felt that it made Todd more intriguing.

The actress blamed Kylie's [...] "very low self-esteem" [...] as a mother and she thinks other residents are judging her. Kylie becomes stressed with managing Max's condition and looking after Lily.
