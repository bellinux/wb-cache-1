40|$|Regrouping in {{commercial}} dairy herds often involves integrating new animals into an established group. This {{can be particularly}} stressful for first-lactation dairy heifers when integrated with the main dairy herd after calving as they are often subject {{to high levels of}} aggression and bullying. This, in turn, can {{have a negative effect on}} production performance. The aim of the research within this thesis was to identify the effect of different re grouping regimes on the welfare and productivity of first lactation" heifers when introduced to a group containing older cows. Experiment 1 examined the effects of introducing heifers to an established group after evening rather than morning milking, and found welfare benefits (in terms of reduced received aggression) in this approach. Experiment 2 determined the effects of mixing heifers with non-lactating cows during the pre-calving period on welfare and performance in the post-calving period. This study showed that these animals were subject to less aggression in the post calving period than those not mixed with older cows prior to calving. Experiments 3 and 4 examined the impact of giving heifers different levels of 'recovery' period after calving before integrating with an established group. Both keeping heifers in a separate heifer group for two weeks after calving, and even just extending the time period in a straw-calving pen, led to improvements in welfare. No effect on stress hormone levels or on productivity were shown in any of the studies. In all studies heifers lay for relatively short periods (i. e. less than 6 hours) during the first 24 hours after introduction to <b>cubicle</b> <b>accommodation</b> if this occurred relatively soon after calving. Lying time was increased if heifers were allowed to stay in straw pens during this period. It is suggested that future research should determine if pain causes reduced lying behaviour in freshly-calved heifers in <b>cubicle</b> <b>accommodation.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Both the {{presence}} of slurry and dark conditions may deter dairy cows from using passageways in <b>cubicle</b> <b>accommodation,</b> thus restricting movement and normal behaviour. We attempted to train seven dairy cows to recognize the quantity of reward offered in a transparent tube containing molasses in a Y-maze. Only one cow failed to consistently select the aisle containing the larger reward. The cows were then individually offered the choice of traversing either a passageway with a 5 cm-depth of cow excreta or a clean, dry passageway to collect their rewards. The quantity of the rewards on the two sides was varied between zero and 400 ml of molasses to determine the price that the cows were prepared to pay for entering the aisle with excreta. Only two of the seven cows showed a clear avoidance of the passageway with excreta. There was a tendency (P < 0. 1) for the cows to avoid the passageway with excreta only when it contained no reward and the clean passageway contained a reward of 400 ml molasses. Otherwise, there was no clear avoidance of the passageway with excreta. We also investigated whether cows preferred to enter a lighted or unlighted passageway. All the cows, except one, showed a strong avoidance of the dark passage, even when it contained the largest reward and the lighten passage contained no reward. We conclude that dairy cows demonstrate only mild avoidance of passageways with excreta but strongly avoid passageways without lighting. Therefore, we suggest that passageways for dairy cows should be lit at all times...|$|E
40|$|The {{desire to}} develop {{national}} greenhouse gas (OHO) emission inventories and mitigation strategies to reduce carbon footprint of cattle production systems, has prompted interest {{to fill the}} knowledge gap of OHO emission from young cattle in the UK. The current UK government funded study was undertaken {{over a two-year period}} to evaluate the effects of gender (steers vs. heifers) of growing Holstein cattle (6 to 22 months of age) on enteric methane emissions and energy and nitrogen utilisation and then to use these data to develop prediction models for quantification of carbon footprint of the dairy production sector. Twenty 5 -month old Holstein cattle (10 steers and 10 heifers) were used in successive 28 d feeding period, with measurements undertaken at age of 6, 12, 18 and 22 months, to investigate the effects on feed intake, live weight gain, energy and nitrogen (N) utilisation and enteric methane (CH 4) emission. Throughout the study, cattle were offered a diet for ad libitum intake containing a single perennial ryegrass silage mixed with concentrates. In the first period, the concentrate supplement was offered at a ratio of 550 g/kg of dry matter (DM), while it was given at a fixed rate of 2 kg DM daily in other 3 periods. During each measurement period, the cattle were housed as a single group in <b>cubicle</b> <b>accommodation</b> for the first 20 d, then individually in metabolism units for the next 3 d, and then in indirect open-circuit respiration calorimeter chambers for the final 5 d with feed intake, faeces and urine outputs and gaseous exchange measured during the last 4 d.

His other business interests included involvement in the cotton industry in the Stockport area, and to newspapers as proprietor of both the Manchester Weekly Chronicle and also of the Cheshire and County News He also bought the Rochdale Coffee House Company, partly for commercial gain but also in support of temperance and to create in each of the taverns a large room fitted with <b>cubicles</b> for the <b>accommodation</b> of working men who needed temporary lodgings.|$|R
40|$|Fifty-nine of the 65 {{dairy farms}} with cubicle sheds in the Norwegian county of Oppland in 1990 were {{included}} {{in a study of}} rearing <b>accommodation,</b> <b>cubicle</b> refusal and mastitis incidence. The farmers recorded the favoured resting location of the individual cows and heifers throughout the final week of pregnancy as well as during calving. The observations were matched with individual records of mastitis cases during the first 30 days after calving. Mastitis incidence in the heifers was analysed by logistic regression using rearing <b>accommodation</b> and <b>cubicle</b> refusal as independent variables, controlling for herd as a clustering factor. Cubicle refusal was found in 29 % of the heifers, but in only 3 % of older cows. The results of the analysis indicated a tendency for cubicle refusal to be associated with an increased mastitis incidence among the heifers (OR = 2. 2, c. i. 95 %OR = 0. 9 – 5. 4, P = 0. 08). Cubicle refusal accounted for 21 % (0 – 32 %) of the mastitis cases in the study population (PAF = 0. 21) ...|$|R
