5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace <b>culverts</b> that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while <b>culverts</b> impeding andromadous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining <b>culverts</b> that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned <b>culverts</b> that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned <b>culverts</b> that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} fish inhabiting the river include Chinook salmon, {{threatened}} coho salmon, and rainbow trout. Fish populations are declining, however, due to low {{water quality and}} barriers such as dams and <b>culverts.</b>|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} by the LNWR found that the bridges and <b>culverts</b> were in a fair condition, but the stations were dirty. Fences were decayed, rails needed replacing, some sleepers were rotten, and the ballast was soft and shaley. The LNWR addressed these problems over the coming years.|$|E
50|$|Accidents due to <b>culvert</b> failure {{can also}} occur if a <b>culvert</b> {{has not been}} {{adequately}} sized and a flood event overwhelms the <b>culvert,</b> or disrupts the road or railway above it.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{demolition}} in 1996 {{of all of}} the above-ground structure of the South station, foundations, <b>culverts</b> and more remained. These needed to be removed before construction could start. The removal of these underground structures was completed in early 2007, whereupon construction of the houses began immediately.|$|E
5|$|Opuwo airfield: The major {{task was}} the {{completion}} of the airfield upgrade at Opuwo begun by the first contingent. A detachment from Captain Kurt Heidecker's Plant Troop, supported by a section from 9th Construction Troop, worked over Christmas to complete these works (which included resurfacing and shaping the runway, drainage and installing <b>culverts).</b>|$|E
5|$|Several tributaries of Aliso Creek—the Dairy Fork, Aliso Hills Channel, Munger Creek, {{and other}} smaller ones—have been {{replaced}} by storm drains. Wood Canyon Creek remains much like its original condition, despite degradation due to polluted water. Sulphur Creek has been channelized and diverted into <b>culverts</b> in several stretches, and English Canyon Creek has received some riprap stabilization and bank protection.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} impacts of human {{interference}} on Nile River morphology. A roadway <b>culvert</b> was constructed to connect an island on Nile River to the eastern bank of the Nile had altered river morphology {{in the vicinity of}} the island. The paper focuses on, 1) the efficiency of the roadway <b>culvert</b> to pass the normal flow, and 2) the impact of the roadway <b>culvert</b> on river morphology. A one-dimension mathematical model was applied to estimate the flow characteristics and the efficiency of the roadway <b>culvert.</b> It was found that the <b>culvert</b> passes 4 % of the flow that would had passed through the eastern branch if the <b>culvert</b> were not existed. As a result, the flow rate in the western channel had increased. Analysis of data indicated changes in river morphology in terms of erosion and sedimentation. In order to restore the efficiency of the eastern channel and to eliminate the side effects of the roadway <b>culvert,</b> a bridge is proposed to replace the roadway <b>culvert.</b> In this case, model results indicated improvements in the hydraulic conditions...|$|R
5|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the passage of Igor, a weather buoy from St. John's was spotted near the Shetland Islands north of Scotland on September12, 2011. In early October, Newfoundland was again struck by a {{tropical}} cyclone– Hurricane Ophelia. Though a weaker storm, Ophelia caused more damage than expected as it destroyed infrastructure repaired in the wake of Igor. The mayor of Marystown criticized government officials for not increasing the size of repairs, especially to <b>culverts,</b> to account for flooding.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s {{these had}} fallen into disuse, and the locks were {{dismantled}} in 1933. The Forth and Clyde Canal closed {{at the end of}} 1962, and by the mid-1970s the Union Canal was filled in at both ends, rendered impassable by <b>culverts</b> in two places and run in pipes under a housing estate. The British Waterways Board (BWB) came into existence on 1 January 1963, the day the Forth and Clyde Canal was closed, with the objective of finding a broad strategy for the future of canals in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|During 2009 and 2010, {{work was}} {{undertaken}} to upgrade sluice gates, watercourses, and <b>culverts</b> to enable seasonal flooding of Southlake Moor {{during the winter}} diverting water from the Sowy River onto the moor. It {{has the capacity to}} hold 1.2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board to restore ten floodplains in Somerset. In spring, the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer. The scheme is also used to encourage water birds.|$|E
50|$|Soil {{and sand}} carried through a <b>culvert</b> can wear away the {{galvanizing}} of a steel <b>culvert,</b> {{allowing it to}} corrode and eventually collapse, disrupting the road or railway above it.

5|$|Initially, Cosme was {{predicted}} {{to make landfall}} on Hawaii as a tropical storm. In anticipation of the storm, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for the island of Hawaii on July 20. Also, small craft advisories were in effect for Maui and Hawaii; wind advisories were issued for summits in those regions. High surf advisories were also put into effect for coastal areas. The Hawaii County Civil Defense prepared for the storm by planning for increases in emergency response personnel and opening of evacuation centers. County crews worked to clean out drains and <b>culverts</b> to prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|Intermittent torrents {{battered}} Saint Kitts and Nevis for {{at least}} four days; a total of up to 10.99inches (279mm) of precipitation was recorded during that time. Several homeowners reported significant flooding, and a number of persons had to be rescued from their homes. Gusty winds generated rough sea conditions along coastal regions, resulting in some beach erosion and the collapse of a sidewalk section. Rains and associated floods topped a number of <b>culverts</b> and bridges, washed out the sides of some roadways, and damage to some utility lines, followed by significant disruptions to electricity services. The exact amount of damage to the territory remains unknown, however.|$|E
5|$|Since Innogy plc {{was taken}} over by RWE in 2002, the site has been owned by RWE Npower. The only {{substantial}} structures remaining are the National Grid and NEDL substations. These buildings will continue to remain and there are plans to extend the National Grid substation. The rest of the power station site is unused brownfield land. The site of the main station buildings is currently covered in crushed concrete, left over from the demolition process. Underground workings, such as tunnels and <b>culverts,</b> also still exist on the site. The coal storage area to the north has been tarmaced and ash settling ponds have been filled with concrete. Some ash mounds are still situated to the east of the site.|$|E
50|$|During several {{measurements}} in 1973 and 1974, {{the water}} temperature of Warrior Creek ranged from 0 to 15 C at the outlet of a <b>culvert</b> on Middle Road. At the inlet of the <b>culvert,</b> {{the water temperature}} ranged from 0 to 27 C. At the outlet of the <b>culvert</b> on Middle Road, the creek's pH ranged from 4.50 to 7.40. At the inlet of the <b>culvert,</b> the pH ranged from 6.55 to 8.45.|$|R

The area immediately adjacent to the <b>culvert</b> contains a number of trees of varying ages, and is thickly covered in tall grass and other scrub. The <b>culvert</b> measures approximately 2 metres in width and 2.5 metres in height. The length of the <b>culvert</b> from the southeastern entrance to {{the remains of the}} northwestern end is 16 metres.|$|R
40|$|A {{two year}} study of fish {{passage through the}} Fish Creek <b>Culvert,</b> located at Mile 132. 2 of the Denali Highway, {{was carried out by}} an {{interdisciplinary}} task force. The purposes of this study were: monitor the interaction of the spawning Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and the existing <b>culvert,</b> and document variables of watershed hydrology (primarily runoff) and hydraulic behaviour of the <b>culvert</b> that may impact fish passage. In summary, Arctic grayling encountered minimal difficulty in passing upstream through the <b>culvert.</b> The major areas of difficulty for the fish were entering the slightly perched <b>culvert</b> and exiting where nonuniform flow rates of movement through the <b>culvert</b> barrel varied from less than a minute over 80 minutes. Generally, larger fish moved through more rapidly than smaller fish. All fish stayed as close to the boundary of the <b>culvert</b> as possible, and they oriented themselves normal to this boundary; meaning that they were not always swimming in a vertical position...|$|R
5|$|The Johnson Creek Watershed Council (JCWC) is {{a nonprofit}} group {{organized}} in 1995 to protect the creek and its watershed. Its projects involve such things as controlling invasive species, planting native riparian vegetation, improving fish passage, and creating off-channel flood storage. JCWC's fish passage barrier program focuses on removing or improving fish passage barriers such as <b>culverts.</b> The council is heavily dependent on volunteers for watershed riparian restoration activities such as planting native plants, and in their Community Science program, where volunteers collect data on wildlife in the watershed. In 2011 alone, {{more than a thousand}} volunteers donated 5,500 hours of their time to JCWC activities.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean Greeks {{were also}} pioneers {{in the field}} of engineering, {{launching}} large-scale projects unmatched in Europe until the Roman period, such as fortifications, bridges, <b>culverts,</b> aqueducts, dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the relieving triangle. They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe. Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods; so, it would be no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization.|$|E
5|$|The depots and airbases {{depended}} on an efficient road network, so the engineers gave this a high priority. A major {{effort was made}} to bring the roads up to all-weather standard before onset of the 1942 wet season. New roads were also built. One of the first was the By Pass Road, which was designed to divert traffic from the main road, which ran around the south eastern end of Jackson Drome, and was therefore an operational hazard. The By Pass Road ran between Jackson and Wards Dromes, and was later extended to Berry, Schwimmer and Durand Dromes. The opening of the new wharf at Tatana Island in October caused a sudden jump in road traffic, so a new Barune Road was opened in November that provided a loop to Jackson and Wards Dromes. Fortunately, the local red shale contained clay and rock fragments, and when laid on a prepared subgrade and watered, either by sprinklers or rain, became hard like concrete. This could take motor vehicle traffic, although it became dusty when dry and slippery when wet. Surfacing material was obtained from the Nine Mile Quarry. Wood was found to be unsuitable for <b>culverts,</b> as it was quickly destroyed by the action of climate and insects. Oil drums were found to be superior, but they rusted, and using them for <b>culverts</b> depleted the drum supply.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with brown trout to evaluate their ability to pass through a small, baffled prototype-scale <b>culvert</b> {{under a variety of}} <b>culvert</b> slopes and discharge conditions. The <b>culvert</b> was 18. 3 m long and 0. 60 m in diameter with 0. 15 D 0. 15 D baffle height and 0. 9 D 0. 9 D spacing, where DD is the <b>culvert</b> inside diameter. An inverse relationship was observed between fish passage success and flow rate and/or <b>culvert</b> slope. The influence of the sample fish population and the length of the individual fish on passage rates were investigated; the data showed that the brown trout fish passage sample size evaluated in this study (25 per test) was sufficiently large to minimize sample size dependency. The elapsed time required for fish to traverse the <b>culvert</b> decreased with increasing hydraulic difficulty primarily owing to diminishing resting zones. The behavior of fish traversing the <b>culvert</b> was observed and reported, including resting/staging zone locations...|$|R
50|$|The Brisbane Tuff (porphyry) ovoid <b>culvert</b> is {{significant}} as a rare surviving {{example of a}} long Brisbane Tuff (porphyry) <b>culvert</b> in Queensland. The <b>culvert</b> is also rare as stone ovoid drains were only constructed in the early 1860s. By the 1870s drains were constructed mainly of cheaper brick.|$|R
50|$|The <b>culvert</b> {{comprises}} a long tunnel, about 1.2m wide, {{beneath an}} unsealed roadway. It is lined {{on the floor}} and to about a third of its height along the sides with rusticated sandstone blocks. The blocks lining the floor are long and considerably narrower than those lining the side. There are two courses of blocks {{on each side of the}} <b>culvert.</b> The arched roof of the <b>culvert</b> is lined with bricks.The portals of the <b>culvert</b> are fashioned from dressed sandstone, cut to form an arch; the brick roof of the <b>culvert</b> is not visible externally. At the eastern end of the <b>culvert,</b> the arched sandstone portal intersects with a wing wall made from rusticated sandstone blocks. Both portals are obscured by vegetation at the foot of the gully.|$|R
5|$|With the {{prospect}} of the Chard Canal in particular damaging trade on the Parrett, four traders from Langport including Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot, who together operated a river freight business, commissioned the engineer Joseph Jones to carry out a survey for the Parrett Navigation which was then put before Parliament. It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by <b>culverts,</b> siphons, and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, {{after his}} {{attacked}} failed to overtake any major positions, Zur decided to withdraw, {{for the first}} time in his life. He ordered Harpaz's company, which had the most casualties, to go first, and at 06:00 told Dromi's company to follow. Harpaz's company had five men missing in action, four of whom were picked up by Dromi's people. One of Dromi's platoons remained on top of a sand dune to provide cover fire for the retreat. Meanwhile, the rest of the company made its way under the road and the railway through <b>culverts.</b> On the eastern side, Dromi met Harpaz. They sent the cover platoon home with the injured, and remained in their place to wait for Zur. Their lookout also spotted Kotzer's retreating company and Harpaz requested artillery cover using the only working communication device they had. The Napoleonchiks missed their targets, but deterred the Egyptians, who stopped following Kotzer.|$|E
5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt {{underlies}} much of the watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are relatively free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22percent of the protected zone was logged {{during the second half}} of the 20thcentury, and erosion increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the Portland Water Bureau and the United States Forest Service have closed many of the logging roads and removed <b>culverts</b> and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} 3 D Finite Element {{simulations}} {{was performed to}} investigate the effect of different factors influencing the distortions undergone by a plastic <b>culvert</b> tube while subject to external loading from a heavy truck. The applied simulation model was verified by full-scale loading tests carried out {{on a number of}} actual <b>culvert</b> installation sites. Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that both installation depth and quality of the material surrounding the <b>culvert</b> have a dominant effect on <b>culvert</b> distortions while the effects of material quality above the <b>culvert</b> and the type of tyre configuration transmitting the wheel load are much less pronounced...|$|R
