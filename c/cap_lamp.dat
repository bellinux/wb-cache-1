50|$|A <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> is a lamp worn on {{the head}} or helmet. It is mostly used in an {{underground}} environment, like mines or during outdoor activities, e.g. climbing.|$|E
50|$|These new <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> {{variants}} {{that use}} LEDs follows research {{done by the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in the United States, comparing LEDs to traditional incandescent light bulbs, where {{they found that the}} LEDs improved hazard detection.|$|E
50|$|Portable {{batteries}} for miners' <b>cap</b> <b>lamps</b> headlamps {{typically have}} two or three cells.|$|R
50|$|A {{patent for}} a {{self-adjusting}} bracket {{for use with}} <b>cap</b> <b>lamps</b> was awarded in 1985.|$|R
50|$|Early {{electric}} lamps in Britain were {{hand held}} as miners {{were used to}} this and helmet lamps became common much later than in countries like the USA where helmet (<b>cap)</b> <b>lamps</b> had been the norm.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} {{conventional}} Flooded Flat Plate batteries for Automotive application, Exide also produces industrial range of batteries, which includes, Flooded - Flat plate, Flooded - Tubular plate, Flooded - Plante and Sealed Maintenance Free VRLA batteries. Miners’ <b>Cap</b> <b>Lamp</b> Batteries are also produced.|$|E
50|$|Bayonet bases or caps {{are often}} {{abbreviated}} to BA, {{often with a}} number after. The number refers to {{the diameter of the}} base (e.g., BA22 is a 22 mm diameter bayonet <b>cap</b> <b>lamp).</b> BA15, a 15 mm base, can also be referred to as SBC standing for small bayonet cap. The lower-case letter s or d specifies whether the bulb has single or double contacts.|$|E
5000|$|MSA {{is based}} in the Pittsburgh suburb of Cranberry. [...] With help from Thomas Edison the company was formed in 1914 to develop a {{battery-powered}} <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> for miners to help prevent methane-related explosions caused by open flame lamps. Since {{the turn of the}} 21st Century, MSA has seen record sales. Only {{a small portion of the}} company's current products involve mining related products. The company’s competitors include Industrial Scientific Corporation, RAE Systems and Dräger.|$|E
50|$|LEDs {{are used}} in mining operations, as <b>cap</b> <b>lamps</b> to provide light for miners. Research {{has been done to}} improve LEDs for mining, to reduce glare and to {{increase}} illumination, reducing risk of injury to the miners.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Edison {{developed}} electric <b>cap</b> <b>lamps</b> for miners {{starting in}} 1914; by 1915, certain <b>cap</b> <b>lamps</b> {{were approved by}} the United States Bureau of Mines for safe use in gassy coal mines. These included features such as spring-loaded contacts to automatically disconnect broken bulbs. These lamps consisted of a reflector and incandescent lamp and a separate belt-mounted wet-cell storage battery. The battery was sized to power the lamp for the entire working shift. After 12 hours a 1917-era miner's lamp produced less than one candlepower and about 2 to 5 total lumens. [...] This pattern became popular for similar lamps. Head lamps approved for use in coal mines are designed not to allow an internal spark to ignite flammable gas surrounding the headlamp.|$|R
50|$|September 2011 - July 2012Defying the Darkness {{traced the}} history of mine {{illumination}} {{from the perspectives of}} mining companies, miners, governments, and inventors. Objects on display included early oil lamps, enclosed-flame lamps, carbide lights, battery-powered <b>cap</b> <b>lamps,</b> and the flame safety lamp. The exhibit also included historical photographs.|$|R
5000|$|A methanometer [...] is an {{instrument}} {{used to measure}} methane gas in {{the air of a}} mine. The Mine Safety Appliances Company Ltd. manufactured the first type - W8 Methanometer around 1950 and it was approved for use by the Ventilation Regulations of 1947. The Methanometer could be powered by an Edison battery <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> and it could be carried on a miner's belt with other tools. Methane is the main gas present in firedamp. It is highly explosive and had previously been detected by the blue halo effect it gave to the flame of a safety lamp.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} recent {{variants}} of the <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> are the GEN 4 and GEN 5 models. The GEN 4 model, approved {{for use by}} the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MHSA), uses the headpiece of existing cap lamps, but retrofitted with new LEDs and electronics. The GEN 5 model is very similar to the GEN 4 model except with a more intense spot beam that can illuminate objects that are more than 40 feet away. Since GEN 5 is very similar to GEN 4, it has not been separately approved by MHSA. These lamps will last up to 50 hours with a six-cell battery pack. Energy-saving variants of these models, GEN 4E and GEN 5E, use a single lithium-ion battery.|$|E
5000|$|The Office of Mine Safety and Health (OMSHR), {{a part of}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (itself part of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in the United States {{has been}} {{investigating}} the benefits of LED headlamps. A problem in mining is that the average age is increasing: 43.3 years in 2013 (in the USA) and as a person ages vision degenerates. [...] LED technology is physically robust compared to a filament light bulb, and has a longer life: 50,000 hours compared to 1,000 - 3,000. Extended life reduces light maintenance and failures; according to OMSHR an average of 28 accidents per year occur in US mines involving lighting. NIOSH has sponsored the development of <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> systems which they claim improve the [...] "ability of older subjects to detect moving hazards by 15% and trip hazards by 23.7%, and discomfort glare was reduced by 45%". [...] Conventional lights are strongly focussed in a beam, NIOSH LED lamps are designed to produce a wider more diffuse beam which is claimed to improve the perception of objects by 79.5%.|$|E
5000|$|After Rescue Hole No. 1 {{broke through}} into the mine, rescuers {{signaled}} the trapped miners by tapping on the 6 in drill steel with a hammer, and a faint response was heard.

5000|$|The London Gazette {{reported}} on 13 January 1948 that:"The KING has been pleased to award the Edward Medal to David Brown {{in recognition of}} his gallantry in the following circumstances: -An explosion occurred in the Burngrange Shale Mine, West Calder, Midlothian, at about 8pm on Friday, 10th January, 1947, when 53 persons were at work underground in the district. Firedamp was ignited by an open acetylene <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> and the initial explosion started fires which spread rapidly.David Brown, the overman, descended the pit and proceeded with a fireman to explore the narrow workings where men were trapped. Though they encountered smoke for a time it was not sufficiently dense to prevent progress but as they passed the junction of another heading increasing smoke compelled their withdrawal. After waiting a few minutes Brown made another attempt, alone, to get inbye. He actually got in to No. 3 Dookhead, where he shouted but got no response. He saw no signs, of the inbye men nor of their lights, and {{he was forced to}} withdraw again. On his way outbye, he again met the fireman, who said he had been trying to improve the atmospheric conditions in the inbye section by a partial opening of some brattice screen doors, but this step was of no avail. The atmospheric conditions were getting worse all the time, to the spreading of the fires, the extent and seriousness of which even then were not generally realized. Brown, however, did realize the seriousness of the position in relation to the trapped men and immediately sent word explaining the position to the manager who was dealing with fires elsewhere, asking for all possible assistance and making it quite clear that there was no hope of undertaking further exploratory work without the use of rescue teams wearing self-contained breathing apparatus. He then set out to discover for himself where all the smoke was coming from.Although the National Fire Service was never intended for fire-fighting underground in mines, nevertheless, a team at once volunteered for this duty. Two members of the team donned their one-hour Proto-Breathing Apparatus. Underground, they met the overman, Brown, who pleaded {{for the use of the}} two sets of Proto-Apparatus, so that he and another trained member of the Burngrange Mines Rescue Team could make another attempt to get into the workings beyond No. 3 Dook. Using the one-hour apparatus borrowed from the N.F.S. Brown and his companion made an unsuccessful attempt to rescue the trapped men. At 11.15 pm under the captaincy of Brown a fresh team wearing goggles and using a life-line again attempted to reach the men but were forced to return as the temperature was very high and the smoke so dense that their lights could not be seen. There had been a fall of stone and sounds of strata movement were heard. A further attempt along another level led to the discovery of another fire and it became certain that there was no hope of saving the men until this was under control. The work of firefighting continued for four days and it was not until the night of 13th/14th January, that it was considered practicable to send a rescue team beyond the fire area. With one exception the bodies of all the 15 men who lost their lives by the effect of afterdamp and fumes were in No. 3 Dook."The Scotsman newspaper {{reported on}} 30 January 1948:"The Carnegie Hero Fund Trustees at Dunfermline yesterday awarded an honorary certificate and grants of £25 and £15 respectively to David Brown, mine oversman, 82 Parkhead Crescent, and James M'Arthur, shaleminer, 12 Kirkgate, both of West Calder, Midlothian, who on January 10, 1947, attempted to rescue a number of workmen who had been trapped following an explosion in a colliery at West Calder.

40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) {{are emerging}} as viable replacements for incandescent-based cap lamps used in mining. The photometric and energy characteristics of these light sources differ in important ways. The present paper describes {{the performance of}} LED and incandescent sources in cap lamps in terms of correlated color temperature, color rendering, light output, electric power, ambient temperature and airflow, and light source aging. Importantly, these characteristics can influence a miner s ability to spot mining hazards thus impacting safety. Secondly, some of these characteristics interact with the operating life of the <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> s battery power, such that differences between LED and incandescent sources can be magnified {{toward the end of}} a 10 hour battery discharge cycle. Empirically, we have determined that after 8 hours at an ambient temperature of 25 C, the average light output of an incandescent <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> can decrease to about 69 % of its initial value when powered by a lead-acid battery and it can decrease to about 65 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. An LED-based <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> using a constant current drive circuit can maintain about 96 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. Real-world tests addressing the effects of ambient temperature and airflow on the light output of an LED and incandescent <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> were conducted in the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). The LED <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> yielded a vertical average illuminance improvement of approximately 9. 5 % and the INC <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation o f approximately 4 %. The differences between LED and incandescent cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of mesopic luminance data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i. e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> could be up to 38 % more efficient than the incandescent <b>cap</b> <b>lamp</b> with a lead-acid battery {{at the end of the}} 10 -hour driving cycle. Lastly, accelerated life tests were used to empirically determine light output depreciation as the incandescent light source age approached its useful life. There was about a 35 % decrease in light output. This is quite considerable, especially given that the light output will decrease an additional 30 % to 45 % over the period of a 10 -hour shift. The implications of the differences between LED and incandescent sources are discussed. This information is crucial in determining how visual performance could be affected for real-world conditions where batteries discharge during the work shift and as the light source ages.

Some hazards are located in the miners 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 peripheral field-of-view (10 degrees to about 60 degrees off-axis) or on-axis (0 degrees). The objective of this research was to determine if there were visual performance improvements when using solid-state cap lamps with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as compared to incandescent light bulbs commonly used in miner cap lamps. Recent research has indicated that an increased short-wavelength content of the spectral power distribution of LEDs relative to incandescent lamps improves peripheral visual performance for low-light (mesopic) conditions. The visual performances of nine subjects were quantified by measuring the subjects 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 speed and accuracy in detecting floor objects located on axis and at 2120 degrees off axis.
