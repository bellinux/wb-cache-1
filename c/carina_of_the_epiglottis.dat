40|$|Although {{backward}} folding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mammalian adult swallow, <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> {{does not}} fold during the infant swallow. How this functional change occurs is unknown, but we hypothesize {{that a change}} in swallow mechanism occurs with maturation, prior to weaning. Using videofluoroscopy, we found three characteristic patterns of swallowing movement at different ages in the pig: an infant swallow, a transitional swallow and a post-weaning (juvenile or adult) swallow. In animals <b>of</b> all ages, <b>the</b> dorsal region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> and larynx was held in an intranarial position by a muscular sphincter formed by the palatopharyngeal arch. In the infant swallow, increasing pressure in the oropharynx forced a liquid bolus through the piriform recesses {{on either side of}} a relatively stationary <b>epiglottis</b> into <b>the</b> esophagus. As the infant matured, the palatopharyngeal arch and the soft palate elevated at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swallow, so exposing a larger area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> to bolus pressure. In transitional swallows, <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> was tilted backward relatively slowly by a combination of bolus pressure and squeezing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> by closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palatopharyngeal sphincter. The bolus, however, traveled alongside but never over <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis.</b> In <b>the</b> juvenile swallow, the bolus always passed over <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis.</b> <b>The</b> tilting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> resulted from several factors, including <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palatopharyngeal sphincter, higher bolus pressure exerted on <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> and <b>the</b> allometry <b>of</b> increased size.

40|$|URL] Pentax-AWS {{system is}} a rigid {{indirect}} video laryngoscope with integrated tube guidance. Complications associated with this device are not well understood. We report two cases of epiglottis malposition during intubation with the Pentax-AWS. <b>The</b> standard technique <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> Pentax-AWS system involves direct elevation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> for exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vocal cords. The blade tip should be passed posterior to <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> for laryngeal exposure, but pressure on <b>the</b> anterior surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> by <b>the</b> tip can rarely happen even during the correct maneuver. Although the Pentax-AWS provides clear images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airway structures, it is sometimes difficult to observe <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> continuously because <b>the</b> camera is located beneath the blade tip. Consequently, <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> from <b>the</b> camera may be impeded by the blade tip and may result in undiagnosed <b>epiglottis</b> malposition. <b>The</b> AWS's structural feature and its approach to the larynx {{can be associated with}} increased chance of unexpected epiglottis folding.

40|$|Two {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed which address <b>the</b> downfolding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> during swallowing. <b>The</b> passive mechanism (Fink et al. 1979) focuses on passive mechanical forces transmitted through the median hyoepiglottic ligament and pre-epiglottic adipose tissue to <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis.</b> <b>The</b> active mechanism (Ekberg & Sigurjonsson, 1982) expands the passive mechanism to include active contributions from the aryepiglotticus and thyroepiglotticus muscles. By means of laryngeal microdissection and whole mount orcein staining, distinct bands of fascial condensations were identified running from <b>the</b> lateral edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> just superior to <b>the</b> attachment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> median hyoepiglottic ligament to the hyoid bone near <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greater horns. Neither the proposed active nor the passive mechanisms address <b>the</b> possible contribution <b>of</b> these paired lateral hyoepiglottic ligaments to epiglottic downfolding. Computer image analysis of videofluoroscopic examinations of swallowing was then used to assess <b>the</b> dynamic movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larynx during swallowing. It was observed that <b>the</b> downfolding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> occurred in <b>the</b> same video frame as initiation of anterior displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hyoid bone and thyrohyoid approximation. Based on the anatomical and dynamic relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> to other laryngeal structures, we propose that as the larynx elevates and the hyoid bone moves anteriorly, these lateral ligaments exert traction preferentially on <b>the</b> upper third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> {{to bring it to}} a position below the horizontal...|$|R

40|$|Background. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to define <b>the</b> {{pathological}} changes <b>of</b> some lesions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elastic cartilage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larynx and the auricle and to consider their pathogenesis. Methods.

In <b>the</b> anterior region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epiglottic cartilage, but not the posterior, perichondrium was fibrotic, and chondrocytes and elastic fibres were markedly reduced. There were similar changes in relation to the auricular cartilage pseudocyst. In the auricles with chondrodermatitis the changes were those of focal necrosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cartilage at the helix with associated acute inflammation, ulceration and hyperplasia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overlying epidermis.

MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> laryngeal exposure, time required for intubation, and intubation difficulty scale (IDS) were measured. <b>The</b> frequency <b>of</b> postoperative sore throat and hoarseness also were noted. MAIN RESULTS: Patient demographics did not differ among the groups. In Groups AWS-I and AWS-D, IDS scores were reduced significantly, and <b>the</b> percentages <b>of</b> glottic opening were significantly improved, compared with the Macintosh group. Time to place the endotracheal tube was significantly shortest in Group AWS-I. In one case from each group, intubation within two attempts failed and a different approach was required. CONCLUSION: The AWS offers better intubation conditions than the Macintosh laryngoscope during nasotracheal intubation. The AWS may be used to elevate <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> both directly and indirectly for nasotracheal intubation...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{epiglottitis}} {{in adults}} {{is often referred}} to as supraglottitis as the inflammation is generally not confined to <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> but can also affect supraglottic structures such as the pharynx, uvula, base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue, aryepiglottic folds or the false vocal cords. Acute epiglottitis is classically described as a haemophilus influenzae type b bacterial infec-tion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> in children [1]. In adults only 20 % of epiglottitis is caused by haemophilus influ-enzae [1, 2]. Recent epidemiological studies have recorded a decline in <b>the</b> incidence <b>of</b> epiglottitis in children since the haemophilus b conjugate vac-cines were introduced [3, 49, 50].

40|$|AbstractIntroductionAdult laryngomalacia is rare. It may be {{idiopathic}} {{or secondary}} to trauma or degenerative disease. Case reportA 25 -year-old man presented with inspiratory dyspnea on effort of several months’ evolution. Flexible endoscopy found epiglottic laryngomalacia, managed by CO 2 laser V-shaped partial epiglottectomy. DiscussionExcessive resection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epiglottis</b> {{may lead to}} false passage; insufficient resection risks being ineffective. V-shaped partial epiglottectomy minimizes risk of false passage while ensuring permanent respiratory airflow via the epiglottic V during epiglottic movement...|$|R
