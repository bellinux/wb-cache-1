50|$|However, many normal {{applications}} obviously need {{access to}} these components, so system calls are made available by the operating system to provide well defined, safe implementations for such operations. The operating system executes {{at the highest level}} of privilege, and allows applications to request services via system calls, which are often initiated via interrupts. An interrupt automatically puts the CPU into some elevated privilege level, and then passes control to the kernel, which determines whether the <b>calling</b> <b>program</b> should be granted the requested service. If the service is granted, the kernel executes a specific set of instructions over which the <b>calling</b> <b>program</b> has no direct control, returns the privilege level to that of the <b>calling</b> <b>program,</b> and then returns control to the <b>calling</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{powerful}} {{feature of}} ARPACK {{is its ability}} to use any matrix storage format. This is possible because it doesn't operate on the matrices directly, but instead when a matrix operation is required it returns control to the <b>calling</b> <b>program</b> with a flag indicating what operation is required. The <b>calling</b> <b>program</b> must then perform the operation and call the ARPACK routine again to continue. The operations are typically matrix-vector products, and solving linear systems.|$|E
50|$|A driver {{communicates}} {{with the}} device through the computer bus or communications subsystem {{to which the}} hardware connects. When a <b>calling</b> <b>program</b> invokes a routine in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device. Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original <b>calling</b> <b>program.</b> Drivers are hardware dependent and operating-system-specific. They usually provide the interrupt handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface.|$|E

It also investigates their attitudes toward the computer-assisted language learning (<b>CALL)</b> <b>program.</b> Thirty-three students of first-year classes participate in this study. They are divided into experimental and control groups (17 and 16 participants respectively). The experimental group is taught through using the <b>CALL</b> <b>program</b> and the control group through a conventional method of learning. The study examines the students' listening and speaking skills by conducting a pretest prior to using the program and a posttest after using the program. In addition, Abstract students in the experimental group answer a questionnaire {{at the end of the}} study to address the effectiveness of CALL in the classes and their perceptions of the program that they have already used. The study finds that within two months of the implementation of the <b>CALL</b> <b>program,</b> participants in the experimental group have significant improvement in their listening and speaking scores. Results show a significant difference between experimental group and control group in favor of the experimental group (p <. 05). The study also reveals that members of the experimental group have positive attitudes toward the use of the <b>CALL</b> <b>program</b> for learning. They also have positive attitudes toward using CALL in learning English in the future. The study concludes with recommendations for using interactive multimedia programs in improving college students' listening and speaking skills.
