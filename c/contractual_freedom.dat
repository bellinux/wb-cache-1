40|$|The Problem Cereals are an {{important}} component of the UK diet and of livestock feedstuffs but during storage are at risk of infestation by insects which damage quality and value. Chemical pesticides have been used to control infestations but are being phased out due to concerns about perceived safety, resistance and environmental impact. Biological control offers an alternative to the use of conventional chemical agents. Project Aims The primary aim of this project is to provide the basis for a whole new class of biological pesticides for use in the storage of a wide range of commodities including cereals and oilseeds. Approach Devise novel methodology which enables a model putative biopesticide to function under simulated conditions representing storage. Develop innovative methods to maximise delivery of the agent to a range of pests under appropriate conditions. Clarify the risks that need to be considered for registration. Confirm acceptability and practicality by addressing concerns about use, validating efficacy on realistic surfaces and in a trial premises, and calculating cost. Benefits to the industry This project will benefit the UK durables industry by a) providing sufficient evidence that a model biopesticide will provide a real alternative to the use of conventional pesticides for the protection of stored cereals b) ultimately allowing conventional pesticides to be restricted to emergency use only c) helping organic farmers to protect the quality of their product by storage in compliance with organic standards d) laying the foundations for the development of other biopesticides. The project will benefit the pest control industry by enabling <b>contractual</b> obligations for <b>freedom</b> from pests to be achieved without exposing operatives to harmful chemicals...|$|R

40|$|The recent Great Recession has shaken the nation’s {{faith in}} {{free markets and}} {{inspired}} various forms of actual or proposed regulatory intervention displacing free competition. Proponents of such intervention often claim that such interference with free-market outcomes will help foster economic recovery and thus macroeconomic stability by, for instance, enhancing the “purchasing power” of workers or reducing consumer prices. Such arguments for increased economic centralization echo those made during the Great Depression, when proponents of regulatory intervention claimed that such interference with economic liberty and free competition, including suspension of the antitrust laws, was necessary to foster economic recovery. Indeed, this view has even left its mark on constitutional law, with several modern Supreme Court justices claiming that protection for economic liberty and free competition deepened and prolonged the Depression, thereby justifying judicial repudiation of liberty of contract and requiring an expansive reading of Congress’s Commerce power. Using the Great Depression as a case study, the Article examines the link between free competition—and generally applicable regulation that ensures such competition—and macroeconomic stability. The {{results of this study}} shed important light on claims that protection for economic liberty and free competition exacerbated the Depression as well as modern arguments that coercive interference with free-market outcomes can speed the ongoing recovery from the recent Great Recession. Many equate “competition policy” with antitrust law. However, this Article widens the focus beyond antitrust. This wider focus reveals that, at least before the Depression, there were two other important sources of competition policy. Thus, while antitrust regulation, particularly the Sherman Act, protected free competition from undue private restraint, the Dormant Commerce Clause and Due Process Clauses prohibited undue state and federal restraints on economic liberty and thus free competition. As of 1929, then, these three sources of law combined to create and enforce a unified and doctrinally symbiotic commitment to free competition as the norm governing American economic life. Unfortunately, relaxation of antitrust’s anti-collusion standards in the late 1920 s and early 1930 s {{paved the way for the}} 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), FDR’s stimulus plan. In particular, the NIRA fostered collective wage and price setting and banned forms of normal competition, thereby protecting incumbent firms from more efficient rivals. Antitrust’s surprising embrace of collusive practices also presaged judicial repudiation of due process protection for economic liberty in Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502 (1934), repudiation which the Supreme Court confirmed in the late 1930 s. While the Court unanimously overturned the NIRA in Schechter Poultry v. United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935) Congress and many states, apparently emboldened by Nebbia, responded by enacting various statutes interfering with free competition, some of which survive to this day. In particular, the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) mandated collective bargaining with labor cartels known as unions, thereby displacing free competition in wage setting, while the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act further displaced such competition by imposing minimum wages. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court invoked Nebbia-like reasoning when holding that neither the antitrust laws nor the dormant Commerce Clause prevents states from organizing and enforcing cartels that would otherwise unreasonably restrain interstate commerce and thus violate the Sherman Act. See Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943). This “state action” exemption applied, the Court said, even though California producers exported nearly all their raisins to other states. As a result, the rest of the nation bore the brunt of such collusive output reduction. By the mid- 1940 s the pre-Depression commitment to free-market competition was a thing of the past. While the antitrust laws still banned private restraints interfering with free competition, states and the federal government were entirely free to displace free-market outcomes by statute, or for that matter, exempt private conduct from antitrust regulation. While proponents advocated the NIRA and other coercive interference with free markets as recovery measures, both theory and empirical evidence establish that these policies, including cartelization of labor via collective bargaining mandated by the NLRA, in fact deepened and lengthened the Depression. If history is any guide, then, free competition did not cause the recent Great Recession and displacing free competition will only slow recovery. This paper ends by sketching various lessons from the New Deal experience and advocating a return to the pre-Depression commitment to free-market competition. While important, antitrust regulation of private markets cannot ensure the primacy of such competition if states and the national government are left free to exempt large sectors from such regulation and impose price and output restrictions that would be felonies if imposed by private parties. Restoration of free competition as the national norm requires a new symbiosis, whereby state and federal efforts to displace market outcomes are tested by the same skepticism as similar efforts by private parties. Antitrust experts can assist in developing this new symbiosis by devoting more intellectual energy to expanding the domain of antitrust by, for instance, advocating the elimination of various exemptions, particularly Parker’s state action exemption that currently shelters state-created cartels from the Sherman Act. This is not to say that competition should be completely unrestrained by private contract or regulation. Even before the New Deal, courts properly upheld numerous examples of police power regulation that interfered with contractual liberty while counteracting market failure by combating externalities and monopoly pricing. <b>Contractual</b> restrictions on <b>freedom</b> of action, even those that appear “exclusionary,” can have similar beneficial effects, furthering free competition and enhancing economic welfare. Like other proposals to interfere with free competition, recent calls for antitrust to ban certain wealth creating restraints simply because they reduce short run rivalry and raise prices in a particular market are therefore misguided...|$|R
2500|$|Part of {{the process}} of {{construction}} includes the courts and statute implying terms into agreements. Courts imply terms, as a general rule, when the express terms of a contract leave a gap to be filled. Given their basic attachment to <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom,</b> the courts are reluctant to override express terms for contracting parties. Legislation can also be a source of implied terms, and may be overridden by agreement of the parties, or have a compulsory character. For contracts in general, individualised terms are implied (terms [...] "implied in fact") to reflect the [...] "reasonable expectations of the parties", and like the process of interpretation, implication of a term of a commercial contract must follow from its commercial setting. In Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman the House of Lords held (in a notorious decision) that [...] "guaranteed annuity rate" [...] policy holders of the life insurance company could not have their bonus rates lowered by the directors, when the company was in financial difficulty, if it would undermine all the policy holders' [...] "reasonable expectations". Lord Steyn said that a term should be implied in the policy contract that the directors' discretion was limited, as this term was [...] "strictly necessary... essential to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties". This objective, contextual formulation of the test for individualised implied terms represents a shift from the older and subjective formulation of the implied term test, asking like an [...] "officious bystander" [...] what the parties [...] "would have contracted for" [...] if they had applied their minds to a gap in the contract. In AG of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd, Lord Hoffmann in the Privy Council added that the process of implication is to be seen as part of the overall process of interpretation: designed to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the parties in their context. The custom of the trade may also be a source of an implied term, if it is [...] "certain, notorious, reasonable, recognised as legally binding and consistent with the express terms".|$|E
2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, negotiable instruments, uncalled shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom.</b> Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|E
2500|$|Businesses, and {{the banks}} who had {{previously}} enjoyed uncompromised priority for their security, increasingly looked for ways to circumvent {{the effect of the}} insolvency legislation's scheme of priorities. A floating charge, in order for its value to be ascertained, must have [...] "crystallised" [...] into a fixed charge on some particular date, usually set by agreement. Before the date of crystallisation (given the charge merely [...] "floats" [...] over no particular property) there is the possibility that a company could both charge out property to creditors with priority, or that other creditors could set-off claims against property subject to the (uncrystallised) floating charge. Furthermore, other security interests (such as a contractual lien) will take priority to a crystallised floating charge if it arises before in time. But after crystallisation, assets received by the company can be caught by the charge. One way for companies to gain priority with floating charges originally was to stipulate in the charge agreement that the charge would convert from [...] "floating" [...] to [...] "fixed" [...] automatically on some event before the date of insolvency. According to the default rules at common law, floating charges impliedly crystallise when a receiver is appointed, if a business ceases or is sold, if a company is would up, or if {{under the terms of the}} debenture provision is made for crystallisation on reasonable notice from the charge holder. However an automatic crystallisation clause would mean that at the time of insolvency - when preferential creditors' claims are determined - there would be no floating charge above which preferential creditors could be elevated. The courts held that it was legitimate for security agreements to have this effect. In Re Brightlife Ltd Brightlife Ltd had contracted with its bank, Norandex, to allow a floating charge to be converted to a fixed charge on notice, and this was done one week before a voluntary winding up resolution. Against the argument that public policy should restrict the events allowing for crystallisation, Hoffmann J held that in his view it was not [...] "open to the courts to restrict the <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> of parties to a floating charge on such grounds." [...] Parliament, however, intervened to state in the Insolvency Act 1986 section 251 that if a charge was created as a floating charge, it would deem to remain a floating charge at the point of insolvency, regardless of whether it had crystallised.|$|E
2500|$|In {{commercial}} practice the term [...] "debenture" [...] typically {{refers to the}} document that evidences a secured debt, although in law the definition may also cover unsecured debts (like any [...] "IOU"). The legal definition is relevant for certain tax statutes, so for instance in British India Steam Navigation Co v IRC Lindley J held that a simple [...] "acknowledgement of indebtedness" [...] was a debenture, which meant that a paper on which directors promised to pay the holder £100 in 1882 and 5% interest each half year was enough, {{and as a result}} subject to pay duty under the Stamp Act 1870. The definition depends on the purpose of the statutory provision for which it is used. It matters because debenture holders have the right to company accounts and the director's report, because debenture holders must be recorded on a company register which other debenture holders may inspect, and when issued by a company, debentures are not subject to the rule against [...] "clogs on the equity of redemption". This old equitable rule was a form of common law consumer protection, which held that if a person contracted for a mortgage, they must always have the right to pay off the debt and get full title to their property back. The mortgage agreement could not be turned into a sale to the lender, and one could not contract for a perpetual period for interest repayments. However, because the rule limited on <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> to protect borrowers with weaker bargaining power, it was thought to be inappropriate for companies. In Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd the House of Lords held that an agreement by New Patagonia to sell sheepskins exclusively to Kreglinger in return for a £10,000 loan secured by a floating charge would persist for five years even after the principal sum was repaid. The contract to keep buying exclusively was construed to not be a clog on redeeming autonomy from the loan because the rule's purpose was to preclude unconscionable bargains. Subsequently, the clog on the equity of redemption rule as a whole was abolished by what is now section 739 of the Companies Act 2006. In Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne the House of Lords applied this so that when Knightsbridge took a secured loan of £310,000 from Mr Byrne and contracted to repay interest over 40 years, Knightsbridge could not then argue that the contract should be void. The deal created a debenture under the Act, and so this rule of equity was not applied.|$|E
2500|$|In {{specific}} contracts, such {{as those}} for sales of goods, between a landlord and tenant, or in employment, the courts imply standardised contractual terms (or terms [...] "implied in law"). Such terms set out a menu of [...] "default rules" [...] that generally apply in absence of true agreement to the contrary. In one instance of partial codification, the Sale of Goods Act 1893 summed up all the standard contractual provisions in typical commercial sales agreements developed by the common law. This is now updated in the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and in default of people agreeing something different in general its terms will apply. For instance, under section 12-14, any contract for sale of goods carries the implied terms that the seller has legal title, that it will match prior descriptions {{and that it is}} of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. Similarly the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 section 13 says services must be performed with reasonable care and skill. As a matter of common law the test is what terms are a [...] "necessary incident" [...] to the specific type of contract in question. This test derives from Liverpool City Council v Irwin where the House of Lords held that, although fulfilled on the facts of the case, a landlord owes a duty to tenants in a block of flats to keep the common parts in reasonable repair. In employment contracts, multiple standardised implied terms arise also, even before statute comes into play, for instance to give employees adequate information to make a judgment about how to take advantage of their pension entitlements. The primary standardised employment term is that both employer and worker owe one another an obligation of [...] "mutual trust and confidence". Mutual trust and confidence can be undermined in multiple ways, primarily where an employer's repulsive conduct means a worker can treat herself as being constructively dismissed. In Mahmud and Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA the House of Lords held the duty was breached by the employer running the business as a cover for numerous illegal activities. The House of Lords has repeated that the term may always be excluded, but this has been disputed because unlike a contract for goods or services among commercial parties, an employment relation is characterised by unequal bargaining power between employer and worker. In Johnstone v Bloomsbury Health Authority the Court of Appeal all held that a junior doctor could not be made to work at an average of 88 hours a week, even though this was an express term of his contract, where it would damage his health. However, one judge said that result followed from application of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, one judge said it was because at common law express terms could be construed in the light of implied terms, and one judge said implied terms may override express terms. Even in employment, or in consumer affairs, English courts remain divided {{about the extent to which}} they should depart from the basic paradigm of <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom,</b> that is, in absence of legislation.|$|E

An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|E

"The {{foundation}} of contract is the reasonable expectation, which {{the person who}} promises raises in the person to whom he binds himself; of which the satisfaction may be exerted by force." [...] Adam Smith, Lectures on Jurisprudence (1763) Part I, Introduction Part {{of the process of}} construction includes the courts and statute implying terms into agreements. Courts imply terms, as a general rule, when the express terms of a contract leave a gap to be filled. Given their basic attachment to <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom,</b> the courts are reluctant to override express terms for contracting parties. Legislation can also be a source of implied terms, and may be overridden by agreement of the parties, or have a compulsory character. For contracts in general, individualised terms are implied (terms [...] "implied in fact") to reflect the [...] "reasonable expectations of the parties", and like the process of interpretation, implication of a term of a commercial contract must follow from its commercial setting. In Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman the House of Lords held (in a notorious decision) that [...] "guaranteed annuity rate" [...] policy holders of the life insurance company could not have their bonus rates lowered by the directors, when the company was in financial difficulty, if it would undermine all the policy holders' [...] "reasonable expectations". Lord Steyn said that a term should be implied in the policy contract that the directors' discretion was limited, as this term was [...] "strictly necessary... essential to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties". This objective, contextual formulation of the test for individualised implied terms represents a shift from the older and subjective formulation of the implied term test, asking like an [...] "officious bystander" [...] what the parties [...] "would have contracted for" [...] if they had applied their minds to a gap in the contract. In AG of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd, Lord Hoffmann in the Privy Council added that the process of implication is to be seen as part of the overall process of interpretation: designed to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the parties in their context. The custom of the trade may also be a source of an implied term, if it is [...] "certain, notorious, reasonable, recognised as legally binding and consistent with the express terms".|$|E
5000|$|In {{commercial}} practice the term [...] "debenture" [...] typically {{refers to the}} document that evidences a secured debt, although in law the definition may also cover unsecured debts (like any [...] "IOU"). The legal definition is relevant for certain tax statutes, so for instance in British India Steam Navigation Co v IRC Lindley J held that a simple [...] "acknowledgement of indebtedness" [...] was a debenture, which meant that a paper on which directors promised to pay the holder £100 in 1882 and 5% interest each half year was enough, {{and as a result}} subject to pay duty under the Stamp Act 1870. The definition depends on the purpose of the statutory provision for which it is used. It matters because debenture holders have the right to company accounts and the director's report, because debenture holders must be recorded on a company register which other debenture holders may inspect, and when issued by a company, debentures are not subject to the rule against [...] "clogs on the equity of redemption". This old equitable rule was a form of common law consumer protection, which held that if a person contracted for a mortgage, they must always have the right to pay off the debt and get full title to their property back. The mortgage agreement could not be turned into a sale to the lender, and one could not contract for a perpetual period for interest repayments. However, because the rule limited on <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> to protect borrowers with weaker bargaining power, it was thought to be inappropriate for companies. In Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd the House of Lords held that an agreement by New Patagonia to sell sheepskins exclusively to Kreglinger in return for a £10,000 loan secured by a floating charge would persist for five years even after the principal sum was repaid. The contract to keep buying exclusively was construed to not be a clog on redeeming autonomy from the loan because the rule's purpose was to preclude unconscionable bargains. Subsequently, the clog on the equity of redemption rule as a whole was abolished by what is now section 739 of the Companies Act 2006. In Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne the House of Lords applied this so that when Knightsbridge took a secured loan of £310,000 from Mr Byrne and contracted to repay interest over 40 years, Knightsbridge could not then argue that the contract should be void. The deal created a debenture under the Act, and so this rule of equity was not applied.|$|E
5000|$|In {{specific}} contracts, such {{as those}} for sales of goods, between a landlord and tenant, or in employment, the courts imply standardised contractual terms (or terms [...] "implied in law"). Such terms set out a menu of [...] "default rules" [...] that generally apply in absence of true agreement to the contrary. In one instance of partial codification, the Sale of Goods Act 1893 summed up all the standard contractual provisions in typical commercial sales agreements developed by the common law. This is now updated in the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and in default of people agreeing something different in general its terms will apply. For instance, under section 12-14, any contract for sale of goods carries the implied terms that the seller has legal title, that it will match prior descriptions {{and that it is}} of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. Similarly the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 section 13 says services must be performed with reasonable care and skill. As a matter of common law the test is what terms are a [...] "necessary incident" [...] to the specific type of contract in question. This test derives from Liverpool City Council v Irwin where the House of Lords held that, although fulfilled on the facts of the case, a landlord owes a duty to tenants in a block of flats to keep the common parts in reasonable repair. In employment contracts, multiple standardised implied terms arise also, even before statute comes into play, for instance to give employees adequate information to make a judgment about how to take advantage of their pension entitlements. The primary standardised employment term is that both employer and worker owe one another an obligation of [...] "mutual trust and confidence". Mutual trust and confidence can be undermined in multiple ways, primarily where an employer's repulsive conduct means a worker can treat herself as being constructively dismissed. In Mahmud and Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA the House of Lords held the duty was breached by the employer running the business as a cover for numerous illegal activities. The House of Lords has repeated that the term may always be excluded, but this has been disputed because unlike a contract for goods or services among commercial parties, an employment relation is characterised by unequal bargaining power between employer and worker. In Johnstone v Bloomsbury Health Authority the Court of Appeal all held that a junior doctor could not be made to work at an average of 88 hours a week, even though this was an express term of his contract, where it would damage his health. However, one judge said that result followed from application of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, one judge said it was because at common law express terms could be construed in the light of implied terms, and one judge said implied terms may override express terms. Even in employment, or in consumer affairs, English courts remain divided {{about the extent to which}} they should depart from the basic paradigm of <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom,</b> that is, in absence of legislation.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the actual extent of <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> in labor law {{relations}} from the theoretical perspective and {{from the perspective of}} its specific consequences in labor law as well. Therefore the thesis consists of two main parts. In part one, the thesis defines the legal principle concept and continues with the autonomy of the will characteristic, from which the <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> principle derives, and then it describes its restrictions as a reset of both the principle of equality and the principle of protection of the weaker party to contract. As follows, the thesis {{deals with the}} position of labor law within the private law area, its historical development, the influence of the Constitutional Court decision no. 116 / 2008 Coll. and the adoption of the new Civil Code in terms of the labor law <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> extent. The ending of the first part is dedicated to the modern "flexicurity" system that seeks to reach the balance between <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> on one hand and an employee protection within labor law on the other hand. In its second part, the thesis aims to analyze particular appearances of <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> within chosen labor law aspects as it both, shortly describes them and assesses them in terms of the space that they provide to <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> and the amount of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Freedom of {{contract}} {{is one of}} the fundamental principles of private law. Most pronounced is the principle of <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> in business contractual relationships, in which is admitted the highest degree of <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom.</b> <b>Contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> is often generally associated with the rule that what is not forbidden is allowed, ie. if the legal regulation does not prohibit any contractual arrangement, is such an arrangement allowed. This understanding of freedom {{of contract}} is very simplistic and misleading and thus in many cases incorrect. Given that freedom of contract is seen as a rule or principle, approach to it is fairly spontaneously and in search of answers to the question of legality or illegality of certain contractual arrangements, the progress is often intuitively and based on ad hoc reasoning the <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> is in individual cases either accepted or rejected. One reason for this approach is the fact that there have been no more precise rules for a differentiation of non- mandatory and mandatory legal rules. Their differentiation is for the recipients of legal rules crucial because it gives an answer to the question, how far reaches their liberal sphere, in particular, if the <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> is in the particular legal issue enabled or not. A lack of structure and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on a <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> in {{employment}} relations, especially upon formation, changes and termination of the employment relationship. The <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> is the key principle of private law, therefore also of labor law, and {{the expression of the}} <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> is the freedom of an individual in his choice whether to enter into an employment relationship, who to enter with, what content would the employment relationship have and when and how to terminate this relationship. The <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> upon formation, changes and termination of an employment relationship is necessary to be limited due to protection, safety and certainty of employees and also in the public interest. One of the objectives of this thesis is to think about how should be this restriction of the <b>contractual</b> <b>freedom</b> limited. In this work there is also a description of a historical development of a regulatory autonomy of the will of the parties and a description of a statutory regulation of the formation, changes and termination of an employment relationship. Another objective of this thesis is to reflect on the impact of extensive recodification of private law, that occurred in recent years, on the formation, changes and termination of the employment relationship. This thesis consists of an introduction, 8 [...] ...|$|E
