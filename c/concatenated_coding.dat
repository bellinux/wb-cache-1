40|$|This paper {{presents}} and analyzes a novel <b>concatenated</b> <b>coding</b> scheme for enabling error resilience in two distributed storage settings: one being storage using existing regenerating codes {{and the second}} being storage using locally repairable codes. The <b>concatenated</b> <b>coding</b> scheme brings together a maximum rank distance (MRD) code as an outer code and either a globally regenerating or a locally repairable code as an inner code. Also, error resilience for combination of locally repairable codes with regenerating codes is considered. This <b>concatenated</b> <b>coding</b> system is designed to handle {{two different types of}} adversarial errors: the first type includes an adversary that can replace the content of an affected node only once; while the second type studies an adversary that is capable of polluting data an unbounded number of times. The paper establishes an upper bound on the resilience capacity for a locally repairable code and proves that this <b>concatenated</b> <b>coding</b> coding scheme attains the upper bound on resilience capacity for the first type of adversary. Further, the paper presents mechanisms that combine the presented <b>concatenated</b> <b>coding</b> scheme with subspace signatures to achieve error resilience for the second type of errors.
