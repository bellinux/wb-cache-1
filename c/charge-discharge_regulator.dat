40|$|A new optimum {{topology}} dc-to-dc switching converter {{is extended}} to provide bidirectional current flow. The resulting two-quadrant converter {{can be employed}} to eliminate the discontinuous current mode in normal unidirectional applications, but is especially suited for spacecraft battery conditioning as a <b>charge-discharge</b> <b>regulator</b> {{in place of the}} conventional separate converters. Implementation of the control features and the battery charge current and voltage limits are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A Battery <b>Charge-Discharge</b> <b>regulator</b> (BCDR) {{intended}} to interface a 12 V bus with a single-cell Li-ion battery for power {{levels in the}} 100 W range is presented. It {{may be useful in}} small space vehicles, and especially in the cases when battery sizing is driven by the need to complement the power provided by primary power sources during high peaks of load, with comparatively small energy amounts. In particular, the Bidirectional Three Level Neutral Point Clamped (TLNPC) converter configuration was selected, and a prototype was designed, built and tested. After providing a rationale of the single-battery-cell approach, and of the criteria adopted to select the TLNPC converter circuit, the paper reports the principles of operation of the converter and indicates the design criteria for the main circuit parameters. Extensive characterization of the prototype completes the work. Â© 2012 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the Electrical Power System of the Lunar Rover, {{developed}} for the AMALIA mission, intended {{to compete in the}} Google Lunar X prize. The main subsystems are described and their operation analyzed {{on the basis of the}} observed experimental behavior. Primary generation is provided by triple-junction solar cells, arranged as four sections, each connected to a dedicated Array Power Regulator with separate Maximum Power Point Tracking. A Switch Matrix allows to rearrange the inter-connections among the Solar Array sections and the APR in order to manage possible failures. During load peaks and/or with low Sun elevation the solar array is supported by a secondary generator consisting of three redundant units with Li-Ion battery cells. Two alternate configurations of the Battery Subsystem were developed: a classical 8 S Li-Ion battery, for a 28 V Sun-regulated bus, and a novel approach, based on a single-cell (1 S) Li-Ion battery and a high-voltage-gain Battery <b>Charge-Discharge</b> <b>Regulator.</b> A specific converter was designed for this configuration, based on the non-insulated Three Levels Neutral Point Clamped switching converter topology. Its correct operation with bus voltages up to 48 V and fully discharged battery cells was demonstrated...|$|E
