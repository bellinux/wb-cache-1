25|$|A <b>corn</b> <b>sheller</b> or maize sheller, is {{a machine}} used to shell or shuck ears of sweet corn of their silk. By feeding ears of sweet corn into a {{concentric}} cylindrical rest, they are {{parallel to the}} axis of the shelling cylinder in a hopper fixed {{on one side of}} the machine. As the cylindrical rest revolves, an ear falls into each space between staves, and is kept in contact with the shelling cylinder by the pressure of the segment concave. The grain shelled falls beneath the machine and the ear of sweet corn is delivered at the side opposite to the hopper, after having been in contact with the cylinder during approximately four or five revolutions. The <b>corn</b> <b>sheller</b> was invented by Lester E. Denison of Sayville, Connecticut who received a patent on August 12, 1839.|$|E

50|$|In 1825, a canal {{was begun}} to connect Seneca Lake with the newly {{constructed}} Erie Canal at Montezuma and the Cayuga-Seneca Canal {{was put into}} use in 1828. The Canal was enlarged in 1862, and the Flats, an area adjacent to and east of the village center, grew into a major industrial area, producing fire engines, hose carts and other firefighting equipment, pumps and other iron goods including stove parts, bootjacks, <b>corn</b> <b>shellers,</b> meat choppers, sausage stuffers, flatirons and bells. A knitting mill made socks and once produced 85,000 pairs of socks for the Army and Navy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>corn</b> <b>sheller</b> {{was almost}} {{identical}} in design, with slight modifications {{to deal with}} the larger kernel size and presence of cobs. Modern-day combines can be adjusted to work with any grain crop, and many unusual seed crops.|$|E

50|$|Meinrad Rumely {{emigrated from}} Germany in 1848, joining his brother John in the {{operation}} of a foundry in La Porte, Indiana. This basic operation gradually expanded by 1859 into the production of <b>corn</b> <b>shellers</b> and complete threshing machines powered by horses. Following success in this new field, Meinrad then bought out his brother's portion of the business and incorporated it as the M. Rumely Company by 1887. Starting in 1895, the line expanded to include steam-powered traction engines. Meinrad died in 1904, but his sons continued to manage the business. Rumely's most famous product, the kerosene-powered Rumely Oil Pull traction engine, was first developed in 1909 and began selling to the public by 1910.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountains}} surrounding Snowville were, and in {{many places}} still are, rich with iron ore. One of the first factories established in Snowville was a trip-hammer forge. It was located at the confluence of Little Laurel and Big Laurel creeks (near present-day Blue Ridge Mountains Council property) and was operated by Asiel Snow and his son-in-law, David B. Bill. Cast and wrought iron products were transported to Snowville by wagons and oxen carts. The cast iron was collected as scrap and later made into stoves, kettles, <b>corn</b> <b>shellers,</b> cane mills, and many more other cast-iron products. The wrought iron {{on the other hand}} was quickly produced into horseshoes and horseshoe nails, buckboards and buggies, and hearses; it was also used in forgings for sawmills, gristmills, and cane mills.|$|R
5000|$|The garage {{contained}} the toilet facilities for the family. The outhouse within the garage is a [...] "three holer". The facilities were {{hidden from the}} neighbors because of its unusual location, giving it complete privacy. Being in the garage had the additional benefit that Halloween pranksters could not vandalize and tip it over, the fate of many neighborhood outhouses.The garage displays vintage tools like antique saws, hammers, drill bits, axes and shovels. The old logging tools on display {{were used in the}} construction of houses and barns. The garage also has nineteenth century farm machines like <b>corn</b> <b>shellers,</b> planters, bean sorters, and scales. It also displays an unusual ladder specially designed by a local man for picking fruit. Some additionally tools on display, like wrenches and pliers, were used in maintaining farm implements and dairy equipment.|$|R
50|$|The Pleasant Hill Shakers {{were also}} known for their {{labor-saving}} engineering accomplishments. They had a municipal water system well before some towns in their area. By 1825 they had pumps in their kitchens for the sisters' convenience (at {{a time when many}} farmwives had to carry water from a creek). Their mill had an elevator for moving grain to the upper floor, and they had a mechanical <b>corn</b> <b>sheller.</b>|$|E
50|$|The modern <b>corn</b> <b>sheller</b> is {{commonly}} attributed to Lester E. Denison from Middlesex County, Connecticut. Denison was issued {{a patent on}} August 12, 1839, for a freestanding, hand-operated machine that removed individual kernels of corn by pulling the cob {{through a series of}} metal-toothed cylinders which stripped the kernels off the cob. Soon after, other patents were granted for similar machines, sometimes having improvements over Denison's original design.|$|E
50|$|Rubber and {{cavendish banana}} {{production}} {{are the major}} crops. A major company engaged in Cavendish production in the area is AJMR/SUMIFRU Philippines. Other industries present in the area deal with agriculture support facilities such as Rice mill, corn mills, <b>corn</b> <b>sheller</b> and drier. Some furniture making, tailoring and welding are also present within the locality. The Palm Oil Industry is now also in the rise as Businessmen and Farmers venture further in finding ways on how to utilize their lands effectively.|$|E
40|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War II {{augmented}} {{the necessity of}} utilizing agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s resources to the fullest extent in meeting increased food demands with reduced supplies of labor. One of the principal means of expanding production under such conditions is by fuller use of available farm machinery. Unfortunately, however, when a state of national emergency was declared in May, 1941, little was known either about the utilization of Iowa farm machinery or about the numbers of various types of machines available on the farms. To provide the needed information a survey was conducted in August and September of 1941 {{with the cooperation of}} the Work Projects Administration and the Agricultural Marketing Service. Information was collected in August from 2, 911 farms regarding corn planters, grain binders, grain drills, double disks, single disks, hay loaders, manure spreaders, mowers, plows, rakes, rollers, seeders, spike harrows and spring tooth harrows. The September survey obtained information from 3, 012 farms on. cornpickers, combines, ensilage cutters, grain elevators, <b>corn</b> <b>shellers,</b> feed grinders, milking machines, tractors, trucks, trailers and wagons 2 (table 1) ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, {{business}} expanded in the Western United States, as did the company's catalog. It grew to include typewriters, hand trucks, railway velocipedes, pumps, tractors {{and a variety of}} warehouse and bulk shipping tools. The company became an industrial supplier distributing complete [...] "turn-key" [...] systems: tools, plumbing, gauges, gaskets, parts, valves and pipe. Its 1910 catalog contained over 800 pages. The Fairbanks Morse Company began producing oil and naptha engines in the 1890s with the purchase of the Charter line of engines (the first commercially available gas engine). Fairbanks Morse gas engine became a success with farmers. Irrigation, electricity generation, and oilfield work also benefited from these engines. Small lighting plants built by the company were also popular. Fairbanks Morse powerplants evolved by burning kerosene in 1893, coal gas in 1905, then to semi-diesel engines in 1913 and to full diesel engines in 1924. In 1914 the company began production of the Model Z single-cylinder engine in one-, three- and six-horsepower sizes. The Z was soon made in sizes up to [...] Over a half million units were produced in the following 30 years. The model Z found favor with farmers, and the Model N was popular in stationary industrial applications. The Company also had brief forays into building automobiles, tractors, <b>corn</b> <b>shellers,</b> hammermills, cranes, televisions, radios and refrigerators, but output was small in these fields.|$|R
50|$|Rustons were {{primarily}} steam engineers, manufacturing portable, stationary and traction engines, boilers, and associated engineering {{products such as}} winding gear, shafts and pulleys. Threshing machines, clover hullers, <b>corn</b> mills, maize <b>shellers</b> and pumps for steam power were also made. As well as engines for agriculture machines Rustons made railway locomotives, industrial equipment and mining machinery. The company also expanded into electrical and diesel engineering.|$|R
50|$|Cold Brook Feed Mill is a {{historic}} grist mill located at Cold Brook in Herkimer County, New York. It includes the mill, mill dam, flume, and land {{on both sides of}} the stream between the mill and dam. The mill is a simple wood frame structure built in 1857. The main block is two story, square structure with a shed roof, and attached is a one story, plus basement, lean-to, added after 1857. It is equipped with the original water powered stone grinder and <b>corn</b> <b>sheller.</b>|$|E
50|$|A large barn {{is often}} {{central to the}} barnyard, storing farm equipment, and {{providing}} stalls for the farm animals. In traditional designs, a hayloft often occupies the second floor, and a barn cupola caps off the hayloft. In some barns, the loft has a series of openings in the floor just above the stalls to send hay into the mangers below. In some places, the barn houses a corn crib and a <b>corn</b> <b>sheller.</b> Feed storage, however, is also a boon to mice and rats, so farmers often keep barn cats to control vermin.|$|E
50|$|During 1825-1826 he {{published}} four editions of A Select Collection of Valuable and Curious Arts, and Interesting Experiments. He built a portable camera obscura that let him make silhouette portraits {{in less than}} 15 minutes. (He charged 20 cents apiece for them.) He experimented with a wind-powered gristmill, a washing machine, a <b>corn</b> <b>sheller,</b> a fire alarm, a rope-making machine, and a camera. He invented clocks, railway signals, churns, a distance measuring appliance, a horsepower mechanism, a churn, a life preserver, a cheese press, and a revolving rifle.|$|E
40|$|R. Douglas Hurt {{deals with}} the {{invention}} and development of American farm implements and machinery with a special emphasis on the nineteenth century. The material is organized around the functions of various agricultural machines used in the major grain-growing states. Ten chapters focus on the improvements made in plows, grain drills, corn planters, cultivators, reapers, binders, headers, <b>corn</b> binders, <b>corn</b> <b>shellers,</b> threshing machines, combined harvesters, mowing machines, hay stackers, feed mills, and steam traction engines. The author decided to describe certain lines of farm equipment without trying to catalogue all agricultural tools, implements, and machines. Therefore the reader will not find descriptions of such items as cotton gins, saw mills, blacksmith tools, windmills, irrigation pumps, wagons, buggies, washing machines, and hardware materials. Also, during the period 1892 to 1914, no mention is made of the manufacture of {{the internal combustion engine}} and its uses in stationary gas engines, the early tractors, automobiles, trucks, and electric light plants. The judicious use of 219 photographs and illustrations gives a visual presentation of the evolution of rural technology. The verbal descriptions of mechanical and technical matters can be readily understood by the general reader. The book includes a good bibliography and a helpful appendix to aid the reader in understanding the importance of metallurgy as an important factor in the manufacture of farm machinery. Better farm machinery had to wait until the making of steel had been perfected. Some readers would welcome more analysis and interpretation of rural technology. For example, virtually all historians mention that our colonial forefathers used the wooden plow, the sickle, and the flail to grow crops, the same tools used thousands of years earlier in Biblical times. Why was this progress so slow? Why were no new machines invented in colonial America in the 170 years prior to the Revolutionary War? Why did it take two hundred years of experimentation before the first successful track-type Caterpillar engines were built in 1904 ? Combines were widely used in the Pacific Coast states in the 1880 s, yet they were not adopted in the Midwest until the late 1920 s, a lag of forty years. Perhaps historians should give more attention to the factors that deter progress and to the obstacles that prevent the adoption of new ideas, to try to explain the inability of people to adopt new methods. Nevertheless, the narrative is informative and well written. American Farm Tools is a fine addition to the historical record...|$|R
5000|$|John Wind was an {{architect}} {{who worked in}} southwest Georgia in the United States from approximately 1838 {{until his death in}} 1863. He was born in Bristol, England, in 1819. John Wind designed the Greenwood, Susina, Oak Lawn, Pebble Hill, Eudora and Fair Oaks monumental plantation houses, the Thomas county courthouse and a few in-town cottages. William Warren Rogers writes [...] "Some of Wind's work still exists and reveals him as one of the South's most talented but, unfortunately, least known architects." [...] John Wind also worked as an inventor, jeweler, master mechanic and surveyor. He devised a clock that remained wound for one year and was awarded a patent for a cotton thresher and cleaner, Patent Number 5369. He was also the co-recipient of a <b>corn</b> husker and <b>sheller</b> patent in 1860. But it was his work as {{an architect}} that made him an enduring figure.|$|R
50|$|Horse engines {{were used}} to power farm {{implements}} and industrial processes. Examples of machines that were powered with a horse engine include the threshing machine, the <b>corn</b> <b>sheller,</b> pumps and machines for sawing wood. Horse engines were modular in {{that they could be}} attached to whichever implement they were needed for at the time, preventing these machines from needing to incorporate power sources into their design. They could also be used interchangeably with other forms of power, such as a hand crank, line shaft, stationary engine, or the PTO shaft or flat belt pulley from a tractor, which eventually replaced them. Today there are modern versions of these being built that have been used with great success to do household chores as well as power a complete Amish-run machine shop in Kentucky.|$|E
5000|$|On July 19, 1902, Byron J. Carter, {{manager of}} a Jackson bicycle shop, along with {{founding}} partners, George A. Matthews, a buggy manufacturer, and Charles Lewis, once Jackson's biggest employer as owner of a spring axle company, formed the Jackson Automobile Company, on Hupp Street, Jackson. Carter was its first vice president. In 1905 he left to form the Motorcar Company in Jackson, featuring his friction drive car and naming it “Cartercar.” The new variable speed transmission used friction discs, not gears, and also allowed the car to brake by reversing the lever. [...] Carter developed his friction-drive system with parts from a <b>corn</b> <b>sheller.</b> Responding {{to the problem of}} other friction-drive cars failing in wet conditions, he developed an aluminum friction disc with a cardboard traverse wheel lining.|$|E
50|$|The first {{settlers}} planted wheat, oats, and corn, {{which did}} not need special equipment to harvest and process. In later years, cotton was planted, and {{proved to be a}} productive cash crop. In 1870, the first gin was built by the Schertz family. It was powered by mules and then later by steam. This gin was located where the post office is at the present time. The second cotton gin built by Weyel and Kallies was between First and Second streets. In later years, there also was a <b>corn</b> <b>sheller</b> and lumber yard. The first school, built in 1890, was across Cibolo Creek where the Randolph Stables are now located. In 1917 a new two-story brick school was built, later torn down {{to make room for the}} O'Henry School. The land for the school was donated by Adolph Schertz.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operation}} of a <b>corn</b> <b>sheller</b> {{is similar to a}} threshing machine, but with some differences to deal with larger grain size and other differences of corn compared to wheat and other crops. Corn shellers can be powered by a hand crank, a tractor, a stationary engine, or by an electric motor. Whole corn cobs are fed in. They are pulled between two toothed wheels, usually made of metal. Each wheel spins the opposite direction of the other. The teeth pull the kernals off the cob until there are no kernels left. The kernels fall out through a screen into a container (such as a bucket) placed underneath the machine. The cob is then ejected out, since it cannot pass through the screen. Some models have a [...] "walker", similar to a threshing machine or combine, to take the cobs out.|$|E
50|$|Before about World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand (as {{it still}} is {{in most of the}} other countries where it is grown). This often involved large numbers of workers and associated social events. Some one- and two-row mechanical pickers were in use but the corn combine was not adopted until after the War. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested which then requires a separate operation of a <b>corn</b> <b>sheller</b> to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of corn were often stored in corn cribs and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Few modern farms store maize in this manner. Most harvest the grain from the field and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground. The ear of corn is too large to pass through a slit in a plate and the snap rolls pull the ear of corn from the stalk so that only the ear and husk enter the machinery. The combine separates the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|E
5000|$|The mill was {{constructed}} in 1826 and was operated continuously until the 1980s taking its water power from Rambo Run. The mill now {{a part of the}} York County Parks system was placed on the Pennsylvania Inventory of Historic Places on February 24, 1977 and the National Register of Historic Places on June 10, 1977. The owner Harry Cross gave the mill to the County of York in 1979. A major renovation of the building, both inside and out, was undertaken by York County Parks in the early 2000s. Since 1840, ownership of the mill changed only four times with one name change from the family name of Wallace to Cross. [...] The restoration focus is the 1950 era; the pinnacle of Harry Cross' career when the mill ran 24 hours a day and seven days a week. All three floors of the mill {{are open to the public}} with milling displays and equipment. The exhibits and demonstrations appeal to all ages but especially fifth through seventh grade students of Pennsylvania history. [...] Milling equipment includes a Lieberknecht mill and a hand-powered <b>corn</b> <b>sheller.</b> Also, there is a display on how millstones function and are sharpen. A family-tree display of the Wallace and Cross family can be found in the office. [...] The first floor office where Harry Cross conducted his business gives the impression that he stepped out for a moment. It includes a stove, miller's desk, work bench and chairs. [...] The mill was originally powered by a wooden overshot wheel with wooden spokes and shaft. In 1922, the wooden wheel was replaced by a steel Fitz wheel, manufactured in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Fitz was the preeminent manufacturer of mill wheels in the 19th century. The original Fitz waterwheel was restored and re-installed through the kindness of Harvey Bradley.|$|E
