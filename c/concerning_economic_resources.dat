An electronic survey was designed to evaluate students' attitudes, behaviors, values, and awareness. In Fall 2008, 1500 undergraduate students at the University of Delaware (also referred to as UD in this report) were drawn from a random sample of environmental and non-environmental majors. The survey was sent out and remained open for a month, at which time a response rate of 34. 8 % was received. The results will be useful in determining what issues need to be emphasized across campus and if demographics are correlated to students' environmental <b>concerns.</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Economic...</b>|$|R

40|$|Understanding the Patterns and Successes of Our Huron-Erie Corridor The Huron-Erie Corridor, {{centered}} by Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario, is {{an exceptional}} {{example of a}} place with a concentration of various natural and human boundaries, contrasts, and complex dynamics. The inherent diversity and abundance of habitats in the Corridor {{in relation to the}} North American continent and the Great Lakes Basin gives it a centrality that has long attracted both wildlife and people. Of primary importance is the U. S. -Canada border which bisects the Corridor, oft en cited as the location of the largest flow of transnational trade on Earth. Here, a combination of geographical and historical factors intersected with access to abundant natural resources to allow the creation {{of one of the most}} heavily industrialized waterways ever to exist. Unfortunately, nature was degraded by intense urbanization and industrialization to the point that by 1970 the St. Clair, Clinton, Rouge, Ecorse, and Detroit rivers, and the River Raisin, were grossly polluted, and Lake Erie was overwhelmed by excessive phosphorus loadings, wastewater treatment plant effluent that was only receiving primary or minimal treatment, and persistent toxic substances. Since then, great efforts have been made by many to preserve and restore environmental integrity, bringing ecosystems back to a level of health perhaps unimaginable 40 years ago. Superimposed upon all this is the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge – established in 2001 as the only international wildlife refuge in North America. This unprecedented international wildlife refuge represents a major opportunity to continue to restore and protect ecosystems in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable manner. While environmental conditions within the Huron-Erie Corridor and Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge have improved substantially, certain challenges remain to be dealt with. Ecological threats from over a hundred invasive species continue to mount, and urbanization, agriculture, industry, and global climate change present their own management <b>concerns.</b> Scarce <b>economic</b> <b>resources</b> make it increasingly difficult for governments and stakeholders to provide support for environmental concerns. This means that money and efforts directed towards environmental cleanup and ecosystem restoration must be managed and deployed efficiently and effectively, as well as monitored to determine the success of natural resource management practices...|$|R

Contrary to predictions, university-educated men {{are also more likely to}} remain single. The association between <b>economic</b> <b>resources</b> and permanent singlehood shows little change over time. Several explanations for this unexpected finding are discussed. ...|$|R
