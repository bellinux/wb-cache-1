2500|$|The {{railway link}} from Haiphong to the Chinese city of Kunming was {{originally}} {{built by the}} French administration of Indochina in the early 20th century. The section within Vietnam is 389km long (237km between Hanoi and the border at Lào Cai). The railway used [...] gauge due to the mountainous terrain along the route. Currently, the line is the only main line in China using metre gauge, (or dual gauge, since {{it can also be}} converted to standard gauge). Railway service along the Chinese portion of the route is currently suspended. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>service</b> was available until 2002, when floods and landslides, which frequently caused delays along the route, caused serious damage to the tracks on the Chinese side. The railway will form the Chinese part of the Kunming–Singapore Railway, which has been proposed many times, and which at some point was expected to be completed in 2015.|$|E

40|$|International train {{services}} {{generally have}} lower qualities {{and are less}} stable in time then domestic train services. The paper shows that this is also valid for <b>cross-border</b> <b>services</b> within the Benelux compared to domestic services in the Netherlands. The <b>cross-border</b> <b>services</b> have significantly lower qualities with respect to speed, detours, frequency, and transfers. A good integration of timetables for the networks of neighbouring countries and addition of direct international train services on longer distances might enhance the quality for cross-border travelling. The development of standards for required quality might encourage operators to improve their services, while authorities could use them for defining regulations in concessions.
