25|$|ERα/ERβ are in {{inactive}} state trapped in multimolecular chaperone complexes {{organized around the}} heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), containing p23 protein, and immunophilin, and located in majority in cytoplasm and partially in nucleus. In the E2 <b>classical</b> <b>pathway</b> or estrogen <b>classical</b> <b>pathway,</b> estradiol enters the cytoplasm, where it interacts with ERs. Once bound E2, ERs dissociate from the molecular chaperone complexes and become competent to dimerize, migrate to nucleus, and to bind to specific DNA sequences (estrogen response element, ERE), allowing for gene transcription which can take place over hours and days.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>classical</b> <b>pathway,</b> C1 binds {{with its}} C1q {{subunits}} to Fc fragments (made of CH2 region) of IgG or IgM, which {{has formed a}} complex with antigens. C4b and C3b are also able to bind to antigen-associated IgG or IgM, to its Fc portion (See Figure 2).|$|E
25|$|The <b>classical</b> <b>pathway</b> is {{triggered}} by {{activation of the}} C1-complex. The C1-complex is composed of 1 molecule of C1q, 2 molecules of C1r and 2 molecules of C1s, or C1qr2s2. This occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens. A single pentameric IgM can initiate the pathway, while several, ideally six, IgGs are needed. This also occurs when C1q binds directly {{to the surface of}} the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two C1r molecules. C1r is a serine protease. They then cleave C1s (another serine protease). The C1r2s2 component now splits C4 and then C2, producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b. C4b and C2b (historically, the larger fragment of C2 was called C2a but is now referred to as C2b) bind to form the <b>classical</b> <b>pathway</b> C3-convertase (C4b2b complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b later joins with C4b2b to make C5 convertase (C4b2b3b complex).|$|E

25|$|The {{lectin pathway}} is {{homologous}} to the <b>classical</b> <b>pathway,</b> {{but with the}} opsonin, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and ficolins, instead of C1q. This pathway is activated by binding of MBL to mannose residues on the pathogen surface, which activates the MBL-associated serine proteases, MASP-1, and MASP-2 (very similar to C1r and C1s, respectively), which can then split C4 into C4a and C4b and C2 into C2a and C2b. C4b and C2a then bind together to form the classical C3-convertase, as in the <b>classical</b> <b>pathway.</b> Ficolins are homologous to MBL and function via MASP in a similar way. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been described in M-ficolin in humans, with effect on ligand-binding ability and serum levels. Historically, the larger fragment of C2 was named C2a, but it is now referred to as C2b. In invertebrates without an adaptive immune system, ficolins are expanded and their binding specificities diversified {{to compensate for the}} lack of pathogen-specific recognition molecules.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{designate}} {{the larger}} and smaller fragments as C2a and C2b respectively while other sources apply the converse. However, {{due to the}} widely established convention, C2b here is the larger fragment, which, in the <b>classical</b> <b>pathway,</b> forms C4b2b (classically C4b2a). It may be noteworthy that, {{in a series of}} editions of Janeway's book, 1st to 7th, in the latest edition they withdraw the stance to indicate the larger fragment of C2 as C2b.|$|E
25|$|The {{complement}} system {{has the potential}} to be extremely damaging to host tissues, meaning its activation must be tightly regulated. The {{complement system}} is regulated by complement control proteins, which are present at a higher concentration in the blood plasma than the complement proteins themselves. Some complement control proteins are present on the membranes of self-cells preventing them from being targeted by complement. One example is CD59, also known as protectin, which inhibits C9 polymerisation during the formation of the membrane attack complex. The <b>classical</b> <b>pathway</b> is inhibited by C1-inhibitor, which binds to C1 to prevent its activation.|$|E

40|$|Complex polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides can {{activate}} the terminal components of complement {{by either the}} classical (antibody, C 1, C 4, and C 2) or alternative complement pathways, but {{the relative importance of}} either pathway for terminal component consumption in normal serum is poorly understood. Since <b>classical</b> complement <b>pathway</b> function requires both calcium and magnesium ions, whereas the alternative pathway requires only magnesium ions, selective chelation of calcium ions in serum can be used to block the <b>classical</b> complement <b>pathway</b> while leaving the alternative pathway intact. In these studies, ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether) N, N-tetraacetic acid, a potent chelator or calcium, was used to block the <b>classical</b> complement <b>pathway</b> in normal guinea pig serum. Consumption of the terminal complement components by endotoxin, inulin, and zymosan in such serum was strikingly depressed when compared to serum containing an intact <b>classical</b> complement <b>pathway.</b> These studies demonstrate that in normal serum, both the classical and alternative complement pathways participate in the consumption of the terminal complement components by complex polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides...|$|R
25|$|Figure 2 {{shows the}} {{classical}} and the alternative pathways {{with the late}} steps of complement activation schematically. Some components {{have a variety of}} binding sites. In the <b>classical</b> <b>pathway</b> C4 binds to Ig-associated C1q and C1r2s2 enzyme cleave C4 to C4b and 4a. C4b binds to C1q, antigen-associated Ig (specifically to its Fc portion), and even to the microbe surface. C3b binds to antigen-associated Ig and to the microbe surface. Ability of C3b to bind to antigen-associated Ig would work effectively against antigen-antibody immune complexes to make them soluble. In the figure, C2b refers to the larger of the C2 fragments.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{alternative}} pathway, C3b binds to Factor B. [...] Factor D releases Factor Ba from Factor B bound to C3b. [...] The complex of C3b(2)Bb is a protease which cleaves C5 into C5b and C5a. C5 convertase is also {{formed by the}} <b>Classical</b> <b>Pathway</b> when C3b binds C4b and C2a. C5a is an important chemotactic protein, helping recruit inflammatory cells. C3a is the precursor of an important cytokine (adipokine) named ASP (although this is not universally accepted [...] ) and is usually rapidly cleaved by carboxypeptidase B. [...] Both C3a and C5a have anaphylatoxin activity, directly triggering degranulation of mast cells as well as increasing vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. C5b initiates the membrane attack pathway, which results in the membrane attack complex (MAC), consisting of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and polymeric C9. MAC is the cytolytic endproduct of the complement cascade; it forms a transmembrane channel, which causes osmotic lysis of the target cell. Kupffer cells and other macrophage cell types help clear complement-coated pathogens. [...] As part of the innate immune system, elements of the complement cascade {{can be found in}} species earlier than vertebrates; most recently in the protostome horseshoe crab species, putting the origins of the system back further than was previously thought.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the <b>classical</b> complement <b>pathway</b> and the alternative complement pathway was studied in 30 SLE patients. The activities of both pathways were measured by chemotaxis assay, and the following results were obtained. 1) The classical pathway-derived chemotactic index (CCI) was correlated {{with the level of}} CH 50, C 4 and C 3, but not with those of C 5. 2) The alternative pathway-derived chemotactic index (ACI) was correlated with the level of CH 50, but not with those of C 4, C 3 and C 5. 3) CCI was positively correlated with ACI. Both indices were low but CCI was more depressed than ACI. These findings suggest that the alternative complement pathway is activated mainly by the C 3 b positive feedback mechanism which is probably triggered via the <b>classical</b> complement <b>pathway,</b> and that the alternative complement pathway probably play a part in defence mechanism instead of reduced <b>classical</b> complement <b>pathway</b> in SLE...|$|R
40|$|The {{complement}} system mediates inflammatory diseases, including kidney disease, through {{one or more}} of three <b>pathways</b> named the <b>classical,</b> the alternative and the lectin pathway. The existing experimental data do not allow comprehensive understanding of the individual complement pathway or pathways that mediate the renal injury. This study therefore aimed to determine the complement pathway(s) that are involved in mediating the injury in three models of kidney disease: protein overload proteinuria, unilateral ureteric obstruction nephropathy and adriamycin nephropathy. In protein overload proteinuria, a highly significant increase in the expression levels of TGF-β, TNF-α and IL- 6 was observed in WT mice compared to the lectin pathway deficient mice. Macrophage infiltration, apoptosis and the expression of the gene for Col 4 α 1 were also significantly increased. These data suggested a significant role for the lectin pathway in mediating the injury. Most interestingly, the results indicated that antibody mediated inhibition of the lectin pathway led to less injury in some of the examined parameters. These data might suggest a novel therapeutic approach to relief the renal injury in proteinuric nephropathies by targeting the activation of the lectin pathway. In unilateral ureteric obstruction nephropathy, results indicated that deficiency in either the lectin or the <b>classical</b> <b>pathways</b> led to reduced macrophage infiltration and renal fibrosis. The expression levels of Il 6, Ifn-γ, TGFβ- 1 and Col 4 α 1 were reduced in the lectin pathway deficient mice but not in C 1 qKO mice when compared to WT. However, lower expression levels of these genes were not up to statistical significance. These data suggested that both the lectin and the <b>classical</b> <b>pathways</b> mediate the injury. Similarly, adriamycin nephropathy mice deficient in the lectin pathway showed significant reduction in renal inflammation and fibrosis when compared to WT mice. Additionally, two gene targeting approaches were utilized in order to establish a novel mouse line with specific deficiencies of both the lectin and the <b>classical</b> <b>pathways</b> of the complement. This mouse model should provide a powerful tool to investigate the possible synergetic cooperation between these two pathways in mediating inflammatory renal pathology...|$|R
