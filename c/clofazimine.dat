25|$|In 2010, the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{stated that}} it did not {{recommend}} thalidomide due the difficulty of adequately controlling its use, and due to the availability of <b>clofazimine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rifabutin, {{clarithromycin}} and <b>clofazimine</b> are antibiotics {{designed to}} attack mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, {{which may be}} a cause of Crohn's disease. This treatment, called Myoconda, is being tested by Giaconda.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} leprostatic agents are {{available}} for treatment. For paucibacillary (PB or tuberculoid) cases, treatment with daily dapsone and monthly rifampicin for six months is recommended. While for multibacillary (MB or lepromatous) cases, treatment with daily dapsone and <b>clofazimine</b> along with monthly rifampicin for 12 months is recommended.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Browne {{resigned}} from the Baptist Missionary Society. He was recruited {{by the government of}} the Eastern Region of Nigeria to succeed Dr. Frank Davey as senior leprologist. As a result of his continued contributions to the fight against leprosy, he was known as 'Mr. Leprosy' throughout West Africa. While in Nigeria, he pioneered the use of anti-leprosy drug, <b>clofazimine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The causative {{agent of}} leprosy, M. leprae, was {{discovered}} by G. H. Armauer Hansen in Norway in 1873, making it the first bacterium {{to be identified as}} causing disease in humans. The first effective treatment (promin) became available in the 1940s. In the 1950s, dapsone was introduced. The search for further effective antileprosy drugs led to the use of <b>clofazimine</b> and rifampicin in the 1960s and 1970s. Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using rifampicin and dapsone, intended to mitigate bacterial resistance. MDT combining all three drugs was first recommended by the WHO in 1981. These three antileprosy drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens.|$|E
25|$|Leprosy is curable with a {{treatment}} known as multidrug therapy. Treatment for paucibacillary leprosy {{is with the}} medications dapsone and rifampicin for six months. Treatment for multibacillary leprosy consists of rifampicin, dapsone, and <b>clofazimine</b> for 12 months. A number of other antibiotics may also be used. These treatments are provided free of charge by the World Health Organization. Globally in 2012, the number of chronic cases of leprosy was 189,000, down from some 5.2 million in the 1980s. The number of new cases was 230,000. Most new cases occur in 16 countries, with India accounting for more than half. In the past 20 years, 16 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy. About 200 cases are reported {{per year in the}} United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clofazimine</b> is marketed {{under the}} trade name Lamprene by Novartis. One of the world's only {{producers}} of the <b>clofazimine</b> molecule is Sangrose Laboratories, located in Mavelikara, India.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clofazimine</b> has a {{biological}} half life of about 70 days. Autopsies performed {{on those who}} have died while on <b>clofazimine</b> show crystal-like s in the intestinal mucosa, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes.|$|E
5000|$|Kv1.3 {{is blocked}} by several {{peptides}} from venomous creatures including scorpions (ADWX1, OSK1, margatoxin, kaliotoxin, charybdotoxin, noxiustoxin, anuroctoxin) and sea anemone (ShK, ShK-F6CA, ShK-186, ShK-192, [...] BgK), and by small molecule compounds (e.g., PAP-1, correolide, benzamides, CP339818, progesterone and the anti-lepromatous drug <b>clofazimine).</b> Interestingly, the Kv1.3 blocker <b>clofazimine</b> {{has been reported}} to be effective in the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease, cutaneous lupus, and pustular psoriasis in humans. Furthermore, <b>clofazimine</b> in combination with the antibiotics clarithromycin and rifabutin induced remission for about 2 years in patients with Crohn's disease, but the effect was temporary; the effect was thought to be due to anti-mycobacterial activity, but could well have been an immunomodulatory effect by <b>clofazimine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Clofazimine</b> {{is given}} to treat sulfone-resistant leprosy or to {{patients}} who are intolerant to sulfones. It also exerts an antiinflammatory effect and prevents erythema nodosum leprosum, which can interrupt treatment with dapsone. This is a major advantage of <b>clofazimine</b> over other antileprosy drugs. Ulcerative lesions caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans respond well to <b>clofazimine.</b> It also has some activity against M. tuberculosis {{and can be used}} as last resort therapy for the treatment of MDR tuberculosis. The most disturbing adverse reaction to <b>clofazimine</b> is a red-brown discoloration of the skin, especially inlight-skinned persons. A rare but serious adverse reaction is acute abdominal pain significant enough to warrant exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy. Other infrequent side effects include splenic infarction, bowel obstruction, paralytic ileus, and upper GI bleeding.|$|E
50|$|The {{immunosuppressive}} {{effects of}} <b>clofazimine</b> were immediately noticed when applied in animal model. Macrophages were first {{reported to be}} inhibited due to the stabilization of lysosomal membrane by <b>clofazimine.</b> <b>Clofazimine</b> also showed a dosage-dependent inhibition of neutrophil motility, lymphocyte transformation, mitogen-induced PBMC proliferation and complement-mediated solubilization of pre-formed immune complexes in vitro. A mechanistic studying of <b>clofazimine</b> in human T cells revealed that this drug is a Kv1.3 (KCNA3) channel blocker. This indicates that <b>clofazimine</b> will be potentially used for treatment of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. Because the Kv1.3-high effector memory T cells (TEM) are {{actively involved in the}} development of these diseases, and Kv1.3 activity is essential for stimulation and proliferation of TEM by regulating calcium influx in the T cells. Several clinical trials were also conducted looking for its immunosuppressive activity even before it was approved for leprosy by FDA. It was first reported to be effective in treating chronic discoid lupus erythematosus with 17 out of 26 patients got remission. But later another group found it was ineffective in treating diffuse, photosensitive, systemic lupus erythematosus. <b>Clofazimine</b> also has been sporadically reported with some success in other autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, Miescher’s granulomatous cheilitis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clofazimine</b> {{is also a}} FIASMA (functional {{inhibitor}} of acid sphingomyelinase).|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the drugs}} {{of choice for}} {{treating}} leprosy are dapsone, rifampicin and <b>clofazimine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Clofazimine</b> is a weakly {{bactericidal}} dye {{that has}} some activity against M. leprae. Its precise mechanism of action is unknown but may involve mycobacterial DNA binding. Its oral absorption is quite variable, with 9 to 70% of the drug eliminated in the feces. <b>Clofazimine</b> achieves significant concentrations in tissues, including the phagocytic cells; it has a plasma half-life of 70 days. It is primarily excreted in bile, with less than 1% excretion in urine.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary use}} of <b>clofazimine</b> {{is for the}} {{treatment}} of leprosy. Other uses have not been proven to be safe or effective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clofazimine</b> {{produces}} pink to brownish skin pigmentation in 75-100% {{of patients}} {{within a few}} weeks, as well as similar discoloration of most bodily fluids and secretions. These discolorations are reversible but may take months to years to disappear. There is evidence in medical literature {{that as a result}} of <b>clofazimine</b> administration, several patients have developed depression which in some cases resulted in suicide. It has been hypothesized that the depression was a result of this chronic skin discoloration.|$|E

50|$|Vincent Christopher Barry (1908 - 1975) was a {{scientist}} and researcher from Ireland. He {{is known for}} leading the team which developed the anti-leprosy drug <b>clofazimine.</b>|$|E
50|$|With multidrug therapy {{used as the}} {{standard}} treatment of Hansen's disease, rifampicin is always used in combination with dapsone and <b>clofazimine</b> to avoid causing drug resistance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clofazimine,</b> {{initially}} {{known as}} B663, was first synthesised in 1954 {{by a team}} of scientists at Trinity College, Dublin: Frank Winder, J.G. Belton, Stanley McElhinney, M.L. Conalty, Seán O'Sullivan, and Dermot Twomey, led by Vincent Barry. <b>Clofazimine</b> was originally intended as an anti-tuberculosis drug but drug proved ineffective. In 1959, a researcher named Y. T. Chang identified its effectiveness against leprosy. After clinical trials in Nigeria and elsewhere during the 1960s, Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis launched the product in 1969 under the brand name Lamprene.|$|E
50|$|Lucio's {{phenomenon}} is treated by anti-leprosy therapy (dapsone, rifampin, and <b>clofazimine),</b> optimal wound care, and treatment for bacteremia, including antibiotics. In severe cases, exchange transfusion is helpful.|$|E

50|$|Since bedaquiline {{can also}} prolong the QT interval, {{use of other}} QT prolonging drugs should be avoided. Other {{medications}} for tuberculosis that can prolong the QT interval include fluoroquinolones and <b>clofazimine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dapsone is {{commonly}} used in combination with rifampicin and <b>clofazimine</b> {{for the treatment of}} leprosy. It is also used to both treat and prevent pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). It is also used for toxoplasmosis in people unable to tolerate trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clofazimine</b> {{works by}} binding to the guanine bases of {{bacterial}} DNA, thereby blocking the template {{function of the}} DNA and inhibiting bacterial proliferation. It also increases activity of bacterial phospholipase A2, leading to release and accumulation of lysophospholipids, which are toxic and inhibit bacterial proliferation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clofazimine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Lamprene, is a {{medication}} used together with rifampicin and dapsone to treat leprosy. It is specifically used for multibacillary (MB) leprosy and erythema nodosum leprosum. Evidence is insufficient to support its use in other conditions. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Patients whose {{cutaneous}} lesions {{continued to}} develop were successfully treated with prednisone (1 mg/kg per day). No patient had a relapse after discontinuation of indomethacin.Other alternatives to corticosteroid treatment include dapsone, doxycycline, <b>clofazimine,</b> and cyclosporine. All {{of these drugs}} influence migration and other functions of neutrophils.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} leprostatic agents are {{available}} for treatment. For paucibacillary (PB or tuberculoid) cases, treatment with daily dapsone and monthly rifampicin for six months is recommended. While for multibacillary (MB or lepromatous) cases, treatment with daily dapsone and <b>clofazimine</b> along with monthly rifampicin for 12 months is recommended.|$|E
50|$|M. kubicae {{requires}} 21 days of incubation between 33°C and 37°C {{to reach}} mature growth. Isolates {{have been shown}} to be resistant to the antibiotics amikacin and rifampin and partially resistant to ciprofloxacin, cycloserine, ethambutol, isoniazid, rifabutin and streptomycin. Susceptibility to clarithromycin, <b>clofazimine</b> and ethionamide has been detected for some strains.|$|E
50|$|Surgical {{excision}} or cryosurgery is {{the treatment}} of choice. Treatment with antifungals has been considered ineffective, {{but the use of}} <b>clofazimine</b> and dapsone in patients with leprosy and lobomycosis has been found to improve the latter. This treatment regimen, with concomitant itraconazole, has been used to prevent recurrence after surgery.|$|E
