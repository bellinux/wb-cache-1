40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} aimed at {{the study of the}} {{propagation}} of discharge at the surface of solid insulator and the development of an analytical model of flashover in air. The experimental results show that the critical conditions of flashover are met when the discharge reaches the half of <b>creeping</b> <b>distance.</b> Using electrical equivalent circuit and the impedance criterion, we developed a relationship giving the flashover voltage (FOV). This formula evidences the fact that flashover voltage depends on the discharge temperature, the capacitance and the resistance of solid insulator, and the propagation conditions of the discharge. We also show that the computed FOV are in a good accordance with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Dental {{implants}} {{have been}} widely applied in clinic for many years. However, the success rate is still challenging mainly because of bone deficiency. An ideal bone graft is traditionally thought to guide and induce new bone regeneration as well as been absorbed completely by human body. The Hypothesis: Autogenous bone mixed with titanium granules might be an ideal bone graft for dental implantation. Evaluation of the Hypothesis: First, we analyzed advantages of grafts of autogenous bone mixed with titanium granules, such as serving as a s scaffold for wound healing and tissue regeneration, creating sui microenvironment for implant-bone integration, shortening the new bone′s <b>creeping</b> <b>distance,</b> etc. Then we creatively hypothesized a novel alternative bone graft with premixed autogenous bone and non-absorbent titanium granules. Apart from repairing bone deficiency, our hypothesis could promote the integration between new bone and titanium implant {{from the perspective of}} microenvironment. We believe that the method is promising and worth extension in clinical application...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract:This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{influence}} of the direction of the applied electric field (namely perpendicular and parallel to the insulator surface) and the type of insulator materials on the propagation of creeping discharges (pattern and stopping length) in presence of air under standard lightning impulse voltage. The investigated materials belong to two distinguished families among the mostly used in electrical industry: (i) thermoplastics (namely polyamide 6 and polyarylamide), and (ii) one cycloaliphatic filled epoxy resin. It is shown that the stopping discharges length on a solid/air interface covers generally 55 % of the <b>creeping</b> <b>distance</b> for both polarities under perpendicular E-field right before the flashover. While with parallel E-field, the stopping length is included between 20 to 30 % for positive polarity and less than 25 % for negative polarity. Also, the application of a perpendicular E-field is more straitened than the tangential one due mainly to the dielectric constant of polymers. Numerical simulations show that the electric field is more reduced for perpendicular E-field inferring that discharges (streamers) lengthen and develop easily at lower voltage levels...|$|E
30|$|As expected, a well-tuned KF {{provided}} a better {{estimate of the}} <b>creep</b> <b>distance</b> than the MA filter, reacting to rapid changes in the range more smoothly than the MA filter could do for a reasonable window size. The MA filter result could be made arbitrarily smooth by selecting a large enough window, but this introduces an unacceptable lag in the position estimate. The KF also {{provided a}} closer match to the creep estimate obtained from the laser scanner data when the two sensors were compared.|$|R

60|$|That first duck {{was a great}} joy, {{and having}} succeeded so well with my careful tactics, I {{continued}} in the same way, confining my attention to pairs or small parties {{of three or four}} birds, when by patiently <b>creeping</b> a long <b>distance</b> through the grass I could get very close to them. In this way I shot teal, widgeon, pintail, shovellers, and finally the noble rosy-bill, which was esteemed for the table above all the others.|$|R

60|$|Frank tried, {{and succeeded}} in walking {{in a sort}} of half-sleeping, half-waking {{condition}} for about a mile--stumbling as he went, and often unwittingly crushing his little guide to the ground. After this he fell once more, and could not again recover his upright position. Poor Edith now began to lose heart. The utter hopelessness of getting the wounded man to advance more than a few yards at a time, and her own gradually increasing weakness, induced the tears once more to start to her eyes. She observed, too, that Frank was sinking into that state of lethargy which is so dangerous in cold climates, and she had much difficulty in preventing him from falling into that sleep which, if indulged in, is indeed the sleep of death. By persevering, however, she succeeded in rousing him so far as to <b>creep</b> a short <b>distance,</b> now and then, on his hands and knees--sometimes to stagger a few paces forward; and at length, long after the cold moon had arisen on the scene, they reached the margin of the lake.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBone {{fragility}} is {{a concern}} for aged and diseased bone. Measuring bone toughness and understanding fracture properties of the bone are critical for predicting fracture risk associated with age and disease and for preclinical testing of therapies. A reference point indentation technique (BioDent) has recently been developed to determine bone's resistance to fracture in a minimally invasive way by measuring the indentation distance increase (IDI) {{between the first and}} last indentations over cyclic indentations in the same position. In this study, we investigate the relationship between fracture toughness KC and reference point indentation parameters (i. e. IDI, total indentation <b>distance</b> (TID) and <b>creep</b> indentation <b>distance</b> (CID)) in bones from 38 mice from six types (C 57 Bl/ 6, Balb, oim/oim, oim/+, Phospho 1 −/− and Phospho 1 wild type counterpart). These mice bone are models of healthy and diseased bone spanning a range of fracture toughness from very brittle (oim/oim) to ductile (Phospho 1 −/−). Left femora were dissected, notched and tested in 3 -point bending until complete failure. Contralateral femora were dissected and indented in 10 sites of their anterior and posterior shaft surface over 10 indentation cycles. IDI, TID and CID were measured. Results from this study suggest that reference point indentation parameters are not indicative of stress intensity fracture toughness in mouse bone. In particular, the IDI values at the anterior mid-diaphysis across mouse types overlapped, making it difficult to discern differences between mouse types, despite having extreme differences in stress intensity based toughness measures. When more locations of indentation were considered, the normalised IDIs could distinguish between mouse types. Future studies should investigate the relationship of the reference point indentation parameters for mouse bone in other material properties of the bone tissue in order to determine their use for measuring bone quality...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes detrimentally {{affects the}} {{musculoskeletal}} system by stiffening the collagen matrix {{due to increased}} advanced glycation end products (AGEs). In this study, tibiae and tendon from Zucker diabetic Sprague–Dawley (ZDSD) rats were compared to Sprague–Dawley derived controls (CD) using Atomic Force Microscopy. ZDSD and CD tibiae were compared using Raman Spectroscopy and Reference Point Indentation (RPI). ZDSD bone had a significantly different distribution of collagen D-spacing than CD (p = 0. 015; ZDSD n = 294 fibrils; CD n = 274 fibrils) which was more variable and shifted to higher values. This shift between ZDSD and CD D-spacing distribution was more pronounced in tendon (p < 0. 001; ZDSD n = 350; CD n = 371). Raman revealed significant increases in measures of bone matrix mineralization in ZDSD (PO 43 − ν 1 /Amide I p = 0. 008; PO 43 − ν 1 /CH 2 wag p = 0. 047; n = 5 per group) despite lower bone mineral density (aBMD) and ash fraction indicating diabetes may preferentially reduce the Raman signature of collagen. Decreased indentation distance increase (p = 0. 010) and <b>creep</b> indentation <b>distance</b> (p = 0. 040) measured by RPI (n = 9 per group) in ZDSD rats suggest a matrix more resistant to indentation under the high stresses associated with RPI at this length scale. There were significant correlations between Raman and RPI measurements in the ZDSD population (n = 18 locations) but not the CD population (n = 16 locations) indicating that while RPI is relatively unaffected by biological noise, it is sensitive to disease-induced compositional changes. In conclusion, diabetes in the ZDSD rat causes changes to the nanoscale morphology of collagen that result in compositional and mechanical effects in bone at the microscale...|$|R
40|$|Calcareous sands {{are widely}} used in the {{construction}} of putting greens in the western USA. Plants growing on these sands frequently exhibit nutrient deficiencies and rapidly changing nutrient levels due to the low nutrient-holding capacity of this medium. Our objectives were {{to determine the effects of}} N, P, K, and N × K and P × K interactions on the growth of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera Huds.) in calcareous sand greens. Measurements included visual ratings of turfgrass quality, soil and tissue nutrient levels, and golf ball roll <b>distance.</b> <b>Creeping</b> bentgrass plots receiving 5. 5 kg P ha− 1 yr− 1 had lower quality than the remainder of the treatments (27. 5 – 110 kg P ha− 1 yr− 1). Interactions between P and K were not observed. Ball roll was negatively correlated with soil test P. According to linear plateau regression analysis, soil test P level was 3. 0 mg kg− 1 soil, and tissue test P was 0. 4 % for maximum quality. Nitrogen fertilizer treatments increased turfgrass quality with each successively higher treatment. No N × K interactions were observed. No significant effect of K on turfgrass quality was observed; however, K rates increased soil test K, and tissue K showed a weak correlation (R 2 = 0. 13) with turfgrass quality. Potassium levels within the soil profile indicated leaching of K through the root zone. Alternative K fertilization methods (foliar, increased frequency, and slow-release forms) may be needed to improve K nutrition of bentgrass growing on calcareous sands...|$|R
60|$|Best of {{all it is}} {{to observe}} the birds when {{breeding}} in May. Brean Down is an ancient favourite breeding-site, and the birds breed there in the rabbit holes, and sometimes under a thick furze-bush on the ground. At another spot on this coast I have had the rare good fortune to find a number of pairs breeding at one spot on private enclosed land, where I could approach them very closely, and watch them any day {{for hours at a}} stretch, studying their curious sign-language, about which nothing, to my knowledge, has hitherto been written. There were about thirty pairs, and their breeding-holes were mostly rabbit-burrows scattered about on a piece of sandy ground, about an acre and a half in extent, almost surrounded by water. When I watched them the birds were laying; and at about ten o'clock in the morning they would begin to come in from the sea in pairs, all to settle down at one spot; and by <b>creeping</b> some <b>distance</b> at the water-side among the rushes, I could get within forty yards of them, and watch them by the hour without being discovered by them. In an hour or so there would be forty or fifty birds forming a flock, each couple always keeping close together, some sitting on the short grass, others standing, all very quiet. At length one bird in the flock, a male, would all at once begin to move his head in a slow, measured manner from side to side, like a pianist swaying his body in time to his own music. If no notice was taken of this motion by the duck sitting by his side dozing on the grass, the drake, would take a few steps forward and place himself directly before her, so as to compel her to give attention, and rock more vigorously than ever, haranguing her, as it were, although without words; the meaning of it all being {{that it was time for}} her to get up and go to her burrow to lay her egg. I do not know any other species in which the male takes it on himself to instruct his mate on a domestic matter which one would imagine to be exclusively within her own province; and some ornithologists may doubt that I have given a right explanation of these curious doings of the sheldrake. But mark what follows: The duck at length gets up, in a lazy, reluctant way, perhaps, and stretches a wing and a leg, and then after awhile sways her head two or three times, as if to say that she is ready. At once the drake, followed by her, walks off, and leads the way to the burrow, which may be a couple of hundred yards away; and during the walk she sometimes stops, whereupon he at once turns back and begins the swaying motion again. At last, arriving at the mouth of the burrow, he steps aside and invites her to enter, rocking himself again, and anon bending his head down and looking into the cavity, then drawing back again; and at last, after so much persuasion on his part, she lowers her head, creeps quietly down and disappears within. Left alone, the drake stations himself at the burrow's mouth, with head raised like a sentinel on duty; but after five or ten minutes he slowly walks back to the flock, and settles down for a quiet nap among his fellows. They are all married couples; and every drake among them, when in some mysterious way he knows the time has come for the egg to be laid, has to go through the same long ceremonious performance, with variations according to his partner's individual disposition.|$|R
