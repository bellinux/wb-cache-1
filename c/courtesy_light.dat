2500|$|In 1955 the Oldsmobile 98 again had {{a longer}} {{wheelbase}} than the 88.

The Hydramatic automatic transmission gear selector had an S on it, which was used for better performance climbing hills. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in the 98 series. The 4-door Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, along with the 4-door 88 Holiday and the 4-door Buick Century Riviera and 4-door Special Riviera, were the first 4-door hardtops ever produced. Perhaps because of the popularity of the new 4-door hardtop body style total 98 sales set a new record of 118,626.|$|E
5000|$|The X8 has 56 L load {{capacity}} and dual {{access to the}} storage area. The under-seat storage area holds items up to 80 cm in length. The storage area also contains a foldaway seat cover and a <b>courtesy</b> <b>light.</b> The front shield provides further space to place small items or documents within easy reach and is also equipped with a 12 V plug to recharge a mobile phone.|$|E
50|$|A vehicle {{lawfully}} displaying <b>courtesy</b> <b>lights</b> is not {{an emergency}} response vehicle. In most states, vehicles displaying <b>courtesy</b> <b>lights</b> must still stop at stop signs, red lights, etc. and may not speed or disobey any traffic regulations. Usually, violation ticket fines are increased if the ticketed car was flashing <b>courtesy</b> <b>lights.</b> Laws vary greatly by state.|$|R
5000|$|In most states, other {{vehicles}} {{are not required}} to yield to the vehicle displaying the <b>courtesy</b> <b>lights,</b> hence the name [...] "courtesy", although laws requiring permits for those using <b>courtesy</b> <b>lights</b> vary by state.|$|R

50|$|An {{optional}} Illuminated Entry System—a timed (25-second) interior <b>courtesy</b> <b>light</b> {{illumination system}} with lighted {{door lock cylinder}} rings (activated by lifting either exterior door handle)—also made its debut for 1977. This feature would {{set the stage for}} Ford's exclusive and popular Illuminated/Keyless Entry System (with driver's door belt molding mounted keypad), which would first be seen on the then newly downsized Continental/Mark VI and Thunderbird/Cougar XR-7 beginning in the 1980 model year.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinctive}} XEvo {{element is}} its boot, a large understeat storage space with 56 L capacity, {{enough for two}} full-face helmets or objects up to 80 cm long, and the remote style key that separately opens {{the front and rear}} storage compartments. The storage compartment also has a foldaway seat cover and a <b>courtesy</b> <b>light.</b> The front shield area, besides the odometer, trip computer and tachometer, provides further space to place small items and is also equipped with a 12 volt plug to use a GPS, or recharge a mobile phone.|$|E
50|$|On many Cadillac {{models of}} the 1950s and '60s, the antenna could be raised and lowered by pulling out or pushing in on the radio's volume control knob. The Lincoln Continental of the late 1960s had {{push-button}} controls integrated into the factory radio. But most cars had a separate control that often was not even located near the car radio. And sometimes the control on early models was not even labeled, e.g., the late 1960s, early '70s Ford Thunderbird control was integrated into a <b>courtesy</b> <b>light</b> module on the dash panel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Courtesy</b> <b>lights</b> {{are used}} to request {{right-of-way}} primarily by volunteer or call firefighters and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to expedite their drive in their privately owned vehicles, to their firehouse or base. <b>Courtesy</b> <b>lights</b> do not allow the user to disobey traffic laws such as speed limit, stop signs or stop <b>lights.</b> <b>Courtesy</b> <b>lights</b> {{should not be confused}} with emergency warning lights used in conjunction with audible warning systems (sirens) for emergency vehicles such as police cars, fire apparatus and ambulances, nor should they be confused with warning lights as used by tow-trucks, snow-plows, construction vehicles and school buses to increase awareness especially when moving slowly or stopped in the roadway.|$|R
50|$|Police cars, fire trucks, {{ambulances}} {{or other}} emergency vehicles have sirens and red lights. On the other hand, private vehicles operated by volunteer fire and rescue squad members (with emergency vehicle identification) responding {{to an emergency}} call use blue lights. If an officer pulls a vehicle over for using <b>courtesy</b> <b>lights,</b> the driver will need to provide sufficient identification proving their Emergency Personnel statusbadge, ID number, ID cardand their reasoning for usage of <b>courtesy</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R

50|$|An armed IRA team {{followed}} him by car to ensure he obeyed their commands. Four {{minutes from the}} checkpoint, the IRA team armed the bomb remotely. When Gillespie reached the checkpoint, at 3:55 AM, {{he tried to get}} out and warn the soldiers, but the bomb detonated when he attempted to open the door. IRA bomb makers had installed a detonation device linked to the van's <b>courtesy</b> <b>light,</b> which came on whenever the van door opened. As a safeguard, the bombers also used a timing device to ensure the bomb detonated at the right moment. Gillespie and five soldiers were killed, including Kingsman Stephen Beacham, Vincent Scott, David Sweeney, Paul Worrall and Lance Corporal Stephen Burrows, from D (Support) Company of the 1st Battalion the King’s Regiment.|$|E

Standard 98 equipment included bumper guards, rubber simulated carpets front and rear, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, aluminum door sill plates, turn signals, chrome rocker panel moldings, deck lid ornament, foam rubber seat cushions, padded dash, parking brake light, <b>courtesy</b> <b>light</b> package, stainless steel wheel discs, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring.

50|$|The UZZ30 series Soarer {{was used}} as the base vehicle for the Lexus SC400 (model code UZZ30) {{exported}} to the United States, although to satisfy U.S. tastes, a comprehensive range of luxury options was offered, including some features of the UZZ31, such as seat memory position, traction control, sunroof, sun visors with <b>courtesy</b> <b>light</b> and electronic steering position adjustment. Local Japanese Soarers had an electronic dashboard which used an integral mirror to display the instruments holographically. Although beautiful, this design was never offered on a USA spec model. Those cars came with a standard dash layout of round dials and lit needles similar to the LS400 Lexus sedan. Whereas the left hand drive version of UZZ30 was made throughout the entire 9 year production run, the right hand drive version was made from 1991 to 1993 only.|$|E

25|$|The Caprice was {{intended}} {{to compete with the}} Ford LTD, Plymouth VIP, AMC's Ambassador DPL, and even the smaller Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. These models included luxuriously upholstered interiors with simulated wood dashboard and door-panel trim, thicker carpeting, sound insulation, <b>courtesy</b> <b>lighting,</b> and more upscale exterior trims.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to the two}} predecessors, the 1301 and 1501 {{kept the}} same stylistic approach, even if made decidedly more modern: they were then {{characterized}} by the same four door saloon and wagon bodystyles. The most obvious differences were {{in the front and}} rear overhangs: the snout was longer by 6.9 cm, while the tail was elongated as well by 13.5 cm in order to allow a greater load capacity. The result was that 1301 and 1501 were longer by 21 cm compared to 1300 and 1500. Other differences were both in the front, where it was given a new grille and redesigned slightly in the side, and the previous circular spotlights gave way to two rectangular lights. Differences stand out in the cockpit instrument panel with a new horizontal and straight design. Despite the disappearance of some such as the <b>courtesy</b> <b>light</b> inside, they did improve the overall quality and comfort of the seats and their upholstery.|$|E
