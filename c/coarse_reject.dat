40|$|Co-disposal of {{fine-grained}} wastes or tailings and coarse-grained wastes or <b>coarse</b> <b>reject</b> {{generated on}} {{the processing of}} the run-of-mine coal, offers potential economic, geotechnical and environmental advantages over conventional separate disposal practices. To evaluate the compressibility behaviour and performance of <b>coarse</b> <b>reject,</b> tailings and mixtures of <b>coarse</b> <b>reject</b> and tailings, laboratory compression testing was performed in a large, purpose-built consolidometer on scalped clay mineralrich <b>coarse</b> <b>reject,</b> on tailings slurry, and on combined scalped <b>coarse</b> <b>reject</b> and tailings at two dry mass ratios of 6 : 1 and 3 : 1 (<b>coarse</b> <b>reject</b> to tailings). In this paper, {{the results of the}} compression testing on the specimens are compared and the settling and compressibility behaviour of the tailings slurry, effect of mixture ratio and scalping on the permeability and compressibility of the mixtures are discussed. The results of this investigation can assist in coal washery waste management, through the improved understanding of the geotechnical behaviour of codisposed coal washery wastes...|$|E
40|$|Coal {{mines in}} Australia are under {{increasing}} pressure to minimise {{the environmental impacts}} of the washery wastes generated on the processing of the run-of-mine coal. <b>Coarse</b> <b>reject</b> and tailings, the products of coal processing, are segregated based on their particle size and are conventionally disposed of separately, the <b>coarse</b> <b>reject</b> in dumps and the slurried tailings to a surface containment or dis-used pit. However, they may be recombined and co-disposed, usually by pumping. Co-disposal potentially results in a mixture having improved geotechnical parameters to those of the two waste streams disposed of separately, with potential economic and environmental advantages.

40|$|Acid mine {{drainage}} is {{an unavoidable}} consequence of some coal mining operations. Typically runoff pH is below 3. 5 and at these pH levels heavy metals are mobilised. Leachate from coal reject dumps may require collection and treatment {{to raise the}} pH and precipitate the metals before being discharged. A bi-product of coal mining operations at Clarence Colliery is coarse washery reject. At present the <b>coarse</b> <b>reject</b> is deposited above ground and rehabilitated. Adjacent to Clarence Colliery is the Kable 2 ̆ 7 s Transport Pty Ltd sand mining operation. It has been proposed that co-disposal of the rejects from both operations may produce a product whose leachate has near neutral pH. The University of Western Sydney undertook laboratory experiments to investigate the chemistry of leachate water from 22 co-disposal options. Reject material was placed in 205 L drums.

40|$|<b>Coarse</b> coal <b>rejects</b> are {{conventionally}} loose-dumped while {{fine coal}} tailings are conventionally thickened and disposed {{of as an}} aqueous slurry in a mine tailings deposit area. The easy ingress of water and oxygen makes loose, <b>coarse</b> <b>rejects</b> prone to spontaneous combustion, degradation and acid generation. The fine particle size and low density of coal tailings ensure that coal tailings deposits remain wet and soft and thus difficult to rehabilitate for alternative land use. Co-disposal by combined pumping through a pipeline followed by subaerial deposition is a promising waste disposal and rehabilitation option. It can make better use of available storage than separate disposal of coarse and fine wastes, improve the water return from waste impoundments and facilitate their rehabilitation. To achieve the full potential of subaerial deposition, {{the properties of the}} co-disposed watse must be known.

40|$|A completed, conventional, surface slurried coal {{tailings}} {{storage facility}} in Southeast Queensland, Australia, required capping to facilitate rehabilitation for grazing purposes. The facility {{had been closed}} for some years and {{the upper part of}} the tailings beach was well-desiccated, while residual ponds covered the low areas with the extent of ponding varying with rainfall. Prior to the commencement of capping, the tailings were tested using a field shear vane, the results of which were used to assess the safe trafficking of the dozer and placement of the initial capping layer. Both the peak and remoulded vane shear strengths were tested, the former representing small-strain loading and the latter representing bow-waving. An initial 1 to 2 m deep capping layer of <b>coarse</b> <b>reject</b> was placed using a D 6 Swamp Dozer. Capping commenced from the strongest, highest elevation of the tailings beach, and extended towards the ponds. As the capping progressed, further vane shear testing was carried out to assess the shear strength of the tailings beyond the capping layer, and the strength gain over time in the already covered tailings, which would enable further capping material to be safely placed. The paper describes the capping approach and sequence adopted. The initial capping was followed by the placement of further <b>coarse</b> <b>reject</b> by D 9 Dozer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSedimentary {{phosphate}} occurs largely at Gafsa mining basin. Among these occurrences Jebel Alima (Redeyf region) is an {{open pit}} quarry. After extraction, raw phosphate requires several stages of treatments to become concentrated: crushing, grinding, scrubbing, sizing, attrition, de-sliming and flotation. The <b>coarse</b> <b>reject,</b> generated from {{the first step of}} ore processing, constitutes the main pollution source in the mining area around the washing plant. Since composition contains a host of environmentally hazardous chemical elements such as Cd, U, Pb…. The results of the chemical characterization also show that the raw sample can achieve P 2 O 5 grade of 13. 52 %. After 170 scrubbing tests, with 4 kg of solid waste for each test, the liberated fraction showed a content of 24. 33 % P 2 O 5. After sieving, the fraction under 315 microns was recovered for flotation, whereas the fraction greater than 315 microns goes through grinding. 11 grinding tests were carried out taking into account the parameter variations (rotational speed, grinding time, solid concentration and load). The result of the optimum grinding is: Load: 7 / 1; speed: 60 tr / min; time: 5, 5 min; Cs: 45 %. The liberated fraction content is 20. 24 %. Before the reverse flotation, the product from scrubber outlet (fraction 315 microns) were mixed. The feed material has a content of 22. 44 % P 2 O 5. The beneficiation of waste reject was carried out by reverse flotation in acid medium with amines and esters. The content reached 28. 16 % P 2 O 5 with carbonation rate of 1. 6. This content is very close to 29 % (content of commercial phosphates). Therefore the coarse waste reject could be considered as potential reserves for the future...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Billions of tons {{of mineral}} wastes are {{generated}} annually by the Australian open-cut coal-mining industry. These wastes include the waste rock which is excavated in order to access the underlying coal seams, and the impurities which are removed when processing the unrefined raw coal. These processing wastes include a gravel-dominated <b>coarse</b> <b>reject</b> stream and a slurry-like tailings reject stream. Typically, the rock waste is disposed of in massive fill structures commonly termed waste dumps or spoil piles, which may be hundreds of meters in height. Coarse rejects from coal processing are trucked to and disposed of in the spoil piles, whilst the fine tailings rejects are traditionally pumped to and disposed of as an aqueous slurry in large tailings dams. These tailings dams are {{a major source of}} safety, environmental and financial risk for mine operators and as such, are subject to increasing financial, social and legislative pressures, coinciding with a decrease in the availability of land on which they can be constructed. An emerging waste disposal strategy in the Australian coal mining industry is spoil-pile codisposal. This entails partly dewatering the tailings rejects, mixing them with the coarse rejects, then disposing of the mixed rejects (herein termed mixed plant rejects or MPR) with the waste rock in the spoil pile. Spoil-pile co-disposal eliminates the requirements to establish and operate a tailings dam and therefore eliminates the associated risks. However, the introduction of potentially low-strength MPR mixtures with relatively high moisture contents poses an increased likelihood of spoil pile slope instability. To date, implementation of spoil-pile co-disposal in the Australian coal mining industry has been largely empirical and based on a “trial and error” approach for waste dump design. Engineering based stability assessments are seldom performed as, at present, the fundamental behaviour or MPR within a spoil pile is not well understood. This is largely attributable to a limited understanding of how various hydrogeological processes facilitate excess pore pressure and varying degrees of saturation during spoil pile construction...|$|E

50|$|The {{primary air}} input to a ball tube mill {{performs}} a dual function. It {{is used for}} drying and as the fuel transport medium, and by regulating it the mill output is regulated. Governed by the pulverized fuel outlet temperature requirement, the cold air and hot air dampers are regulated to achieve the correct primary air temperature. In addition to raising the coal temperature inside the mill for drying and better grinding, the same air works as the transport medium to move the pulverized coal out of the mill: it travels through the annular space between the fixed trunnion tubes and the rotating hot air tube onwards to the classifier. Coal-laden air passes through double cone static classifiers, with adjustable classifier vanes, for segregation into pulverized fuel of the desired fineness, and coarse particles. The pulverised fuel continues its journey towards the coal burners for combustion. The <b>coarse</b> particles <b>rejected</b> in the classifier are returned to the mill for another cycle of grinding.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Significant {{amounts of}} waste sludge and rejects are {{generated}} by {{pulp and paper}} mills, and stricter environmental regulations have made waste handling a global challenge. Thermochemical conversion of mechanically dewatered by-products is expensive and inefficient due to their high moisture content; therefore drying is a vital unit operation in waste management. This paper reports results from drying of light <b>coarse</b> fiber <b>reject</b> in a bench-scale cyclone that allows changes in geometry. For the sake of comparison, convective fixed-bed drying tests were also performed. The {{results showed that the}} drying rate in the cyclone was hundreds of times higher than in the fixed-bed. For cyclone drying, the inlet air velocity was {{the most important factor in}} both determining the drying rate and residence time of the material. This led to the hypothesis that grinding of the reject particles due to particle-wall and particle-particle collisions play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of heat and mass transfer. In addition to inlet air velocity, cyclone geometry was the main factor that determined particle residence time, as drying air temperature mainly determined drying rate. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A paste {{thickener}} produces underflow with a {{high solids}} concentration by removing water from a dilute suspension. Paste thickening technology has been gradually gaining acceptance in the mining industry. Some of the main challenges in thickening are the complex dynamics due to severe interactions between operating parameters {{and the existence of}} a large range of process time constants. Additionally, being a downstream process, paste thickeners suffer from fluctuating feed conditions from upstream processes. Furthermore, the operation of paste thickeners involves a tight operating window as the underflow properties are sensitive to small changes in concentration. The above challenges motivate this work to develop a systematic advanced control strategy, in particular, model predictive control (MPC) to effectively and efficiently regulate this complex, multivariable process. In this thesis, the sedimentation-consolidation model is adopted and analysed to identify important dynamical features and the key process parameter which will be considered in control system design. The model is then validated using industrial plant data. An extended Kalman filter is developed to estimate in real-time the key process parameter which affects thickening dynamics significantly. Through extensive simulation studies, it has been demonstrated that the proposed MPC approach can deliver a higher underflow solids concentration and a better regulated underflow removal rate. In addition to the basic MPC, several important extensions are developed based on three practical considerations. Firstly, it is illustrated that incorporating ``future'' time-varying constraints in the MPC can help deal with the control difficulty arising from the co-disposal of underflow and <b>coarse</b> <b>reject,</b> leading to improved control performance. Secondly, an MPC with a non-uniformly spaced optimisation horizon is proposed to deal with the timescale multiplicity of thickening. The proposed approach provides similar levels of performance as compared to a conventional MPC with the advantage of reduced computational complexity. A stability ensuring condition for the proposed MPC is also developed. Thirdly, an MPC is developed to control both underflow solids concentration and rake torque. The nonlinear rake torque control problem is converted into a linear MPC problem, reducing the computational complexity of the optimisation problem. Simulation {{studies have shown that the}} proposed approach can effectively control the underflow solids concentration while minimising the rake torque, potentially preventing serious operational problems such as underflow blockage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis work was to examine different approaches to tailor chemical fibres of different raw materials. The focus in searching for new approaches was on pressure screen fractionation, selective treatment of each fraction, mechanical pre-treatment before refining, refiner loadability and its link to fibre properties and filling design, and on-line quality control of fibre properties. The evaluation {{is based on the}} impacts on fibre properties, filtration, refining and the resulting paper properties. Tailoring of fibres using pressure screen fractionation was found to produce a long and <b>coarse</b> (<b>reject)</b> fraction offering high dewatering efficiency, homogeneous and energy-efficient refining, and better strength properties, such as tear index, bulk and fracture toughness, in pure and mixed sheets with other fibres. Although the accept fraction contains short and thin fibres and has a high fines content, it proved possible to use the accept fraction to increase the bonding and scattering of once dried softwood and to reduce the refining energy input needed to reach a certain tensile strength level. A new mechanical pre-treatment was examined and found to promote lumen collapse and de-swelling of fibres, and hence to improve the strength-dewatering combination of softwood kraft pulp. The treatment involved application of linear loads, heat, and shear forces over multiple passes. In refining, the pre-treated fibres produced better dewatering and a consolidated structure with less cutting, fines creation and external fibrillation compared to never dried fibres. The pre-treated fibres offer better potential for developing a higher tensile index, stiffness and Scott bond than once dried fibres at a certain degree of refining. Refiner loadability and gap movement are strongly related to fibre properties and filling design. Fibre properties together with pulp consistency contribute to the size and strength of flocs building up inside the refiner, where big and strong flocs are loaded earlier and maintain a wide gap with less floc size changes. Here, pulp consistency was found to have a smaller effect than fibre properties. Filling design, reflected in the cutting edge speed, was found to contribute strongly to the gap movement and refiner loadability. An increase in edge cutting speed caused the refiner gap width to decrease linearly, thus enhancing different refining effects such as fibre cutting, fibrillation and fibre swelling. A factor network linking on-line measured fibre properties, calculated factors and predicted paper properties was found to be an effective tool for monitoring changes in pulp quality, such as different raw materials with different average fibre lengths. The model was built off-line and tested against on-line mill operation and found to be effective in predicting paper properties of both never and once dried pulp. The refining model was tested with a laboratory refiner and used to explain strength properties such as tensile index, to monitor changes in paper properties due to refining and to determine the optimum refining conditions and different refining effects such as bonding, straightening and fibre cutting...|$|E
50|$|Most {{prominent}} {{example of}} the application of sensor-based ore sorting is the rejection of barren waste before transporting and comminution. Waste rejection is also known under the term pre-concentration. A discrimination has been introduced by Robben. Rule of thumb is that at least 25% of liberated barren waste must {{be present in the}} fraction to be treated by sensor-based ore sorting to make waste rejection financially feasible.Reduction of waste before it enters comminution and grinding processes does not only reduce the costs in those processes, but also releases the capacity that can be filled with higher grade material and thus implies higher productivity of the system. A prejudice against the application of a waste rejection process is, that the valuable content lost in this process is a penalty higher than the savings that can be achieved. But it is reported in the literature that the overall recovery even increases through bringing higher grade material as feed into the mill. In addition, the higher productivity is an additional source of income. If noxious waste such as acid consuming calcite is removed, the downstream recovery increases and the downstream costs decrease disproportionally as reported for example by Bergmann. The <b>coarse</b> waste <b>rejected</b> can be an additional source of income if there is a local market for aggregates.|$|R

Each detector had a central scintillation spectrometer crystal of NaI(Tl) 12 in (303 mm) in diameter, by 4 in (102 mm) thick, optically coupled at the rear to a 3 in (76.2 mm) thick CsI(Na) crystal of similar diameter, viewed by seven photomultiplier tubes, operated as a phoswich: i.e., particle and gamma-ray events from the rear produced slow-rise time (~1 μs) pulses, which could be electronically distinguished from pure NaI events from the front, which produced faster (~0.25 μs) pulses. Thus the CsI backing crystal acted as an active anticoincidence shield, vetoing events from the rear. A further barrel-shaped CsI shield, also in electronic anticoincidence, surrounded the central detector on the sides and provided <b>coarse</b> collimation, <b>rejecting</b> gamma rays and charged particles from the sides or most of the forward field-of-view (FOV). A finder level of angular collimation was provided by a tungsten slat collimator grid within the outer CsI barrel, which collimated the response to a 3.8° x 11.4° FWHM rectangular FOV. A plastic scintillator across the front of each module vetoed charged particles entering from the front. The four detectors were typically operated in pairs of two. During a gamma-ray source observation, one detector would take observations of the source, while the other would slew slightly off source to measure the background levels. The two detectors would routinely switch roles, allowing for more accurate measurements of both the source and background. The instruments could slew with a speed of approximately 2 degrees per second.|$|R

In September the crabs started activity after four to twelve minutes from the recession of the tide, while in December they began activity after about two hours. This may be due to a difference in soil or air temperatures between September and December. Active time of individuals outside burrow between emergence from burrow and subsequent descent into the burrow was on an average about three minutes in summer and about five minutes in winter. This may be related to differences in soil moisture and the rate of evaporation from the crabs' body between summer and winter. There was a correlation between organic nitrogen content and the amount of fine particles (∠O. 063 mm) in surface soil. Lower level (D) of habitat contained more organic nitrogen and fine particles than in upper level (A).
