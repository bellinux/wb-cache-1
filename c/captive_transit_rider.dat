40|$|Overall, Spain´s {{mobility}} patterns develop along {{a relatively}} typical European path. Therefore, developments {{in other countries}} help understand developments in Spain. But travel demand in metropolitan areas in Spain is likely to turn out lower and more transit oriented than in other European metro areas. There will be growth of total travel in some metropolitan areas due to population growth. But overall, everyday travel of Europeans shows signs of saturation. The group of <b>captive</b> <b>transit</b> <b>riders</b> will continue to decrease in the future. In the future, urban travel will be more multimodal, more diverse and increasingly shaped by non-routine travel. If urban transit adapts to this situation, there will be substantial opportunities...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} an {{important}} citizen right: {{the ability to}} walk from home or work to the transit stop, or wait {{at a bus stop}} or on a station platform without the fear of being victimized. Crime and fear of crime unfortunately affect many aspects of everyday life in our cities. Transit crime is a rather persistent but underreported trend that scares and intimidates riders – particularly women. The majority of incidents represent public nuisance crimes. The majority of the victims are <b>captive</b> <b>transit</b> <b>riders,</b> frequently immigrant and poor. In Los Angeles some of the victims are even afraid to report transit crimes to the authorities lest they expose their illegal-resident status. In this chapter, we want to argue that planners and policy makers need to often scratch beyond the surface of official numbers and crime statistics. At the same time, relying on one theory to understand a complex urban phenomenon, such as crime, may often prove inadequate. In our case, we found two seemingly antithetical theories useful, but still needing validation with empirical data: compositional theories that cast attention on offenders, and ecological theories that focus on the context of crime. We discovered that to understand a problem that is largely invisible to authorities, we had to rely not only on crim...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the transit industry emerged as a leader in leveraging the value and power of the public 2 ̆ 7 s “eyes and ears” to promote system security. Although a public awareness program is widely viewed as a core component of a transit agency’s system security plan, efforts to assess whether the messages are reaching <b>transit</b> <b>riders</b> and to identify obstacles to participation have been limited. This paper highlights strategies and tactics to engage <b>transit</b> <b>riders</b> in public security awareness programs based on interviews with transit agency representatives, the analysis of <b>transit</b> <b>rider</b> survey data, and <b>transit</b> <b>rider</b> focus groups...|$|R

The device is particularly suited to help individuals {{with special needs}} (i. e. physical or mental disabilities) successfully navigate the transit system through cues that are delivered through the device. In certain embodiments the device utilizes a global positioning system (GPS) -enabled cell phone. The GPS features of the cell phone enable {{the location of a}} <b>transit</b> <b>rider</b> to be identified. The wireless communication features of the device allow positional data to be transmitted from the device to a geographic information system and to one or more interested parties to track the location of the <b>transit</b> <b>rider.</b> The device can be integrated with vehicle location systems of a transit system to coordinate the transit of the <b>transit</b> <b>rider.</b> In additional aspects the system facilitates the delivery of signal, cues or other communication to the <b>transit</b> <b>rider</b> to enable the rider to safely and effectively use the transit system without the immediate presence of a guide or supervisor...|$|R

40|$|Real-time {{information}} that informs <b>transit</b> <b>riders</b> about <b>transit</b> schedules, next bus or train arrivals, and service alerts, {{is becoming increasingly}} available, particularly through internet-enabled smartphone applications. However, the extent of communication technology usage amongst <b>transit</b> <b>riders,</b> specifically their access to mobile applications and alternative technologies that can provide real-time information, is largely unknown. Without this information, transit agencies are risking investing in an alternative technology that may not sufficiently supply real-time information {{to as many as}} possible riders. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the differences in individual technology accessibility and prioritize investing in real-time information application development that mirrors the unique characteristics of <b>transit</b> <b>riders.</b> This recognition and development will allow a wider availability of real-time information amongst <b>transit</b> <b>riders.</b> Paired with an investigation of cellular phone usage among <b>transit</b> <b>riders</b> and the general American population, an analysis of Saint Louis Metro’s Onboard Survey was performed. Cross tabulations and chi-squared tests were conducted to examine riders’ communication technology usage. Binary logit models were used to understand how, and whether, the ownership of smartphone applications is dependent on various demographic factors. These analyses identified specific demographic groups that would benefit from supplemental technology methods more conducive to their particular information accessibility. Results showed that communication technology usage has risen substantially in recent years but a portion of riders are still without access to smartphone applications. Specific demographic groups (e. g., riders over 40 years of age) were less likely to own smartphones, and these results indicate that computer-based websites and IVR are the best supplementary alternatives for those groups.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{factors that}} influence the mode choice for trips between home and light rail stations, an often neglected part of a person's trip making behavior. This is important for transit planning, demand modeling, and transit oriented development. Using transit survey data describing St. Louis MetroLink riders in the United States, this study found {{that some of the}} factors associated with increased shares of walking relative to other modes were full-time student status, higher income <b>transit</b> <b>riders,</b> and trips made during the evening. It was also found that crime at stations had an impact. In particular, crime made female <b>transit</b> <b>riders</b> more likely to be picked-up/dropped-off at the station. Females {{are more likely to be}} picked-up or dropped-off at night. Bus availability and convenience showed that <b>transit</b> <b>riders</b> that have a direct bus connection to a light rail station were more likely to use the bus. Private vehicle availability was strongly associated with increased probability of drive and park, when connecting to light rail. ...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} the use of an innovative social media-based data source, Twitter, to evaluate <b>transit</b> <b>rider</b> satisfaction. <b>Transit</b> authorities have access to vast amounts of performance metrics that measure ridership, timeliness, efficiency, safety, cleanliness, and service, to name a few. These performance metrics, however, are generally one-sided; they represent the interests of the business and are not customer-based. This paper recognizes the limitations of standard performance metrics and attempts to gauge <b>transit</b> <b>rider</b> sentiments by measuring Twitter feeds.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{pedestrian}} environments on walking behavior, and the related choice of travel path for <b>transit</b> <b>riders.</b> Activity logs from trip surveys combined with transit-route and land-use information are used to fit discrete-choice models of how riders choose among multiple paths to downtown destinations. The work illustrates (1)  how the quality of pedestrian environments along transit egress paths affects transfers inside a transit system, and (2) how the impedance of transferring affects egress walking path choices. The use of GIS techniques for path-based spatial analysis is key to understanding {{the impact of}} pedestrian environments on walking behavior at the street level. The results show that desirable pedestrian environments encourage <b>transit</b> <b>riders</b> to choose paths that are ‘friendlier’, even if they involve more walking after leaving transit. Policy implications for land-use planning and transit service planning are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} extreme public <b>transit</b> <b>riders</b> in Beijing using both traditional household survey and emerging new data {{sources such as}} Smart Card Data (SCD). We focus on four types of extreme transit behaviors: public <b>transit</b> <b>riders</b> who (1) travel significantly earlier than average riders (the 'early birds'); (2) ride in unusual late hours (the 'night owls'); and (3) commute in excessively long distance (the 'tireless itinerants'); (4) travel over frequently in a day (the 'recurring itinerants). SCD are used to identify the spatiotemporal patterns of these three extreme transit behaviors. In addition, household survey data are employed to supplement the socioeconomic background and provide a tentative profiling of extreme travelers. While the research findings are useful to guide urban governance and planning in Beijing, the methods developed in this paper {{can be applied to}} understand travel patterns elsewhere.
