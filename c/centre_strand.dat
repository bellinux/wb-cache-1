50|$|Of {{particular}} interest {{was the possibility}} of damaging Germany's electricity distribution network by shorting out high-voltage overhead power lines with thin wires dragged by balloons. Again, the results of investigations were favourable: trials showed that even a thin steel wire, much thinner than that used to tether the static barrage balloons, when drawn in sliding contact across two or more phases, could cause an arc as long as 15 ft and that arc would be maintained until the circuit breaker opened. In some cases, the arc's heat could melt the aluminum outer layers and then the reinforcing steel <b>centre</b> <b>strands</b> of the conductors. Even if the cable was not severed, the conductors would be weakened {{so that they would}} be susceptible to breaking due to increased electrical demands or normal weather events such as wind, snow and ice. Investigations revealed that it was common practise in pre-war Germany to use a Petersen coil as protection against earthing; this design was effective against a short between a high voltage cable and earth but relatively vulnerable to a short between different phases. A short between phases could result in damage, not just to a cable, but to transformers and the circuit breakers themselves. The Admiralty ran trials using surplus spherical latex meteorological balloons about 8 ft in diameter when inflated. Calculations based on the trials predicted that there would be between a 10% to 75% chance of a balloon's wire coming into contact with a high-voltage overhead line during a 30 mi transit along the ground.|$|R

Project partners will work together to identify the specific opportunities and issues faced by peripheral and island communities in exploiting marine renewable energy resources {{with the aim of}} developing tool kits and resources for use by other similar communities. The project will develop and deliver joint activities between the two regions, looking at issues such as: Marine energy resource assessment/mapping; Policy issues and potential barriers to marine energy development; Business and commercial opportunities for island/mainland communities; Island/mainland interaction on appropriate infrastructure and Community and stakeholder engagement with key groups (e. g. fishing, wave farm developers, and investors). This report provides a final combined assessment of two nationally <b>centred</b> <b>strands</b> of research that has been undertaken within the marine energy policy stream of the MERiFIC project. This research consisted of a two stage stakeholder consultation carried out in both the regions central to the project: the South West region of England and Brittany in France.

This document draws its conclusions primarily through comparative analysis of the output documentation for both deliverables, namely the synthesis reports on stakeholder consultation of marine renewable energy policy measures documents and the minutes of MERiFIC stakeholder workshop documents. Additionally, it draws upon the comparison of national policy frameworks for marine renewable energy within the United Kingdom and France that were prepared for each country and region before the stakeholder consultation was carried out.

40|$|This report - {{the first}} from the <b>Centre’s</b> {{comparative}} <b>strand</b> of research - {{focuses on the}} effects of education on social cohesion at the societal level. The research involved two elements. The first was a theoretical analysis and critique of models in the existing international and comparative literature on education, social capital and social cohesion. This {{led to the development of}} a new hypothetical model relating skills distribution to social cohesion. The second part of the research used cross-national, quantitative techniques to test the model on aggregated data for 15 countries. The analysis suggests that educational distribution may be a very significant influence on societal cohesion in certain contexts. Improving levels of education alone may not foster social solidarity if inequalities of skill and income persist. The findings here have important policy implications. Existing policies focus on developing the individual resources and competences which will help to build social capital and community cohesion. However, these will not necessarily impact on cohesion at the societal level. Creating a more cohesive society is likely to require policies that are also designed to increase equality through narrowing educational outcomes...|$|R

Spaghetti and powdered pasta were prepared from three different cultivars of durum semolina, and starch was also purified from each cultivar. Digestion kinetic parameters were obtained through logarithm-of-slope analysis, allowing identification of sequential digestion steps. Purified starch and semolina were digested following a single first-order rate constant, while pasta and powdered pasta followed two sequential first-order rate constants. Rate coefficients were altered by pepsin hydrolysis. Confocal microscopy revealed that, following cooking, starch granules were completely swollen for starch, semolina and pasta powder samples. In pasta, they were completely swollen in the external regions, partially swollen in the intermediate region and almost intact in the pasta <b>strand</b> <b>centre.</b> Gluten entrapment accounts for sequential kinetic steps in starch digestion of pasta; the compact microstructure of pasta also reduces digestion rates...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{initiative}} Sure Start {{is probably}} the most ambitious attempt of any government to improve the outcomes of children living in disadvantaged areas. Unlike programs in the United States, which have a longer history and are targeted at individual children, Sure Start has an ecological focus that comes from theoretical research and empirical evidence on the importance of family and neighbourhood to how children fare. Sure Start shares several characteristics with current Australian initiatives and is based in some cases on identical research. Moreover, the long history of intellectual exchange and networking between the UK and Australia, and the impact of new information technologies on research, policy and practice dissemination, means a great deal of traffic between Sure Start and Australian programs takes place.

40|$|A {{dumbbell}} double-stranded DNA decamer tethered with a hexaethylene glycol linker moiety (DDSDPEG), with a nick in the <b>centre</b> of one <b>strand,</b> {{has been}} synthesised. The standard NMR methods, E. COSY, TOCSY, NOESY and HMQC, {{were used to}} measure 1 H, 31 P and T 1 spectral parameters. Molecular modelling using rMD-simulated annealing was used to compute the structure. Scalar couplings and dipolar contacts show that the molecule adopts a right-handed B-DNA helix in 38 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7. Its high melting temperature confirms the good base stacking and stability of the duplex. This is partly attributed {{to the presence of}} the PEG 6 linker {{at both ends of the}} duplex that restricts the dynamics of the stem pentamers and thus stabilises the oligonucleotide. The inspection of the global parameters shows that the linker does not distort the B-DNA geometry. The computed structure suggests that the presence of the nick is not disturbing the overall tertiary structure, base pair geometry or duplex base pairing to a substantial extent. The nick has, however, a noticeable impact on the local geometry at the nick site, indicated clearly by NMR analysis and reflected in the conformational parameters of the computed structure. The 1 H spectra also show much sharper resonances in the presence of K+ indicating that conformational heterogeneity of DDSDPEG is reduced in the presence of potassium as compared to sodium or caesium ions. At the same time the 1 H resonances have longer T 1 times. This parameter is suggested as a sensitive gauge of stabilisation...|$|R
40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] to their peculiar construction, axially preloaded spiral strands undergo plane-section bending only for sufficiently small maximum lateral deflection/span ratios. Beyond a certain limit of this ratio, plane sections do not remain plane and, depending {{on the level of}} axial tension and imposed radius of curvature, interlayer slippage takes place, starting from the outer layer and spreading towards the <b>centre</b> of the <b>strand.</b> On the theoretical side, apart from one publication in the mid- 1980 s and some fairly recent publications by the first author and his associates, all other theoreticians have previously assumed either plane-section bending or, in many cases, have totally ignored the ever-present interwire friction, assuming that the individual helical wires act as simple helical springs. Previously reported experimental techniques, aimed at measuring the effective bending stiffness of helically wound cables, also largely suffer from major shortcomings. In the present paper, a novel experimental method is reported for obtaining reliable measurements of the effective bending stiffness of axially loaded spiral strands. It is very simple and relatively inexpensive to use in practice, for even very large (greater than, say, 100 mm outside diameter) spiral strands. Effective bending stiffness measurements, based on this approach, are reported here for a 164 mm outside diameter spiral strand (with axial loads of up to 3 MN), with these supported by a detailed theoretical analysis, which reinforces the generally sound nature of the proposed method...|$|R

Entire villages and settlements such as Gaurikund and the market town of Ram Bada, a transition point to Kedarnath, had been obliterated, while the market town of Sonprayag suffered heavy damage and loss of lives. Pilgrimage centres in the region, including Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath, the hallowed Hindu Chardham (four sites) pilgrimage centers, are usually visited by thousands of devotees, especially after the month of July on wards. Over 70,000 people were stuck in various regions because of damaged or blocked roads. People in other important locations like the Valley of flowers, Roopkund and the Sikh pilgrimage <b>centre</b> Hemkund were <b>stranded</b> {{for more than three}} days. National Highway 58, an important artery connecting the region was also washed away near Jyotirmath and in many other places. Because summers have more number of tourists, the number of people impacted is substantial. For more than three days, stranded pilgrims and tourists were without rations or survived on little food. The roads were seriously damaged at more than 450 places, resulting in huge traffic jams, and the floods caused many cars and other vehicles to be washed away.

In June 1993, in collaboration with Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, the Society established a Patient Support Service to provide advice, information, support, counselling and rehabilitation to patients attending hospital appointments. In 1995 A Community Housing initiative in Newcastle was developed for people leaving long hospital stays. The project began in 1994 {{with the opening of}} a home for five people. In March 1995, Henshaws Head Office and Greater Manchester Resource Centre moved to new premises in Talbot Road, Old Trafford. John Derby House, named after the late 18th Earl of Derby, President of the Society for 46 years, was officially opened in September 1995 by his nephew, the 19th Earl of Derby. Its School of Visual Impairment Studies based at Henshaw's College opened to provide training for Rehabilitation Officers. It quickly became established as a leading training provider - the only one {{of its kind in the}} North of England. In 1996 The Godfrey Ermen Home officially opened on April 26.

40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{progress}} {{in our understanding}} of DNA during the past half-century, there are many important aspects of its chemical and biological role yet to be explored. The principles by which it selectively interacts with other molecules have attracted much interest due to the relevance for fundamental cellular processes, {{as well as for the}} development of diagnostic probes and effective pharmaceutical agents. This Thesis describes the study of the process in which a planar aromatic moiety, hindered by bulky substituents on both ends, is threaded through the DNA double helix. Dumb-bell shaped binuclear ruthenium complexes of the type [µ-(bidppz) (L) 4 Ru 2] 4 +, L = phenanthroline (P) or bipyridine (B) bind upon mixing with DNA rapidly on the outside of the double-helix, after which they rearrange to an intercalated binding mode. Passing one large metal <b>centre</b> between the <b>strands</b> requires large transient distortions of the duplex, leading to extremely slow binding kinetics that is sensitive to DNA sequence as well as ruthenium complex structure. This work has (1) addressed the mechanisms behind this “kinetic recognition” and (2) identified potential DNA structural targets. Both enantiomers of chiral analogues P and B require several hours at 50 °C to rearrange to the threaded binding mode in mixed sequence DNA. Alternating AT polymers, on the other hand, are intercalated within a few minutes at room temperature. The ratio between the forward rates is estimated to vary between 65 (ΛΛ-P) and 2500 (ΛΛ-B). Studies with AT-tract oligonucleotides show that more than one complete helix turn of AT-DNA is required for efficient threading, a stretch considerably larger than the complexes themselves. Long AT-stretches are however not the only kinetically favored targets; subjecting mixed sequence DNA to negative supercoiling can increase the threading rate by as much as two orders of magnitude. Accelerated intercalation is also observed with partially unpaired DNA. Dissociation from mixed sequence DNA displays half-lives of up to 38 h at physiological temperature, the slowest release reported for a reversibly bound agent. The selectivity demonstrated by the binuclear ruthenium complexes in vitro make them interesting in the development of new agents against parasitic protozoa with AT-rich DNA...|$|R
