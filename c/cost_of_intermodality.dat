40|$|International audienceThis paper {{originates}} {{from a study}} {{performed for}} Eurocontrol in 2004, {{with a view to}} investigate the role <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> in relation to the airport of the future: "The airport of the future : Central link of intermodal transport?". In a broad sense, intermodal transport can be viewed as the transport of goods and passengers by the use of several coordinated transport modes. In the first section of this paper, we study the different forms <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> and define more precisely what are the forms relevant to (intermodality with) air travel. We also address the issue of financing intermodal infrastructure, and of incentives for signing agreements on the part of operators. We turn next to the issue of the future <b>of</b> <b>intermodality.</b> The main difficulty appearing when analyzing intermodality lies in the large number of factors impacting its development and in their complex mutual influences. Determining how intermodality could develop requires to decompose the analysis in several steps. In part two, we identify factors directly or indirectly influencing the development <b>of</b> airport <b>intermodality</b> and perform a qualitative analysis showing the factors' complex relationships. This analysis will then be used in part three for building and analyzing different scenarios <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> evolution at airport. Finally, in part four, those scenarios will be applied to Portugal and France, which constitute today polar cases of transport network development in Europe...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} articulates {{a writing}} pedagogy {{based on a}} theory <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> to help writing instructors navigate the affordances and challenges of multimodal composition. Drawing from recent discoveries in neuroscience about how the brain makes meaning, I situate this pedagogy <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> – literally, “between the modes” – within the Rhetoric and Composition traditions of embodied rhetoric and visual/multi-sensory rhetoric. A pedagogy attuned to intermodality capitalizes on how the senses (“modes”) work together to create meaning when composing with sound, image, movement, and text. In addition to the five senses, intermodality also incorporates the cultural, social, and material aspects of meaning-making. This study focuses on my own writing classrooms as sites of inquiry for implementing intermodality at key points {{in the writing process}} – invention, revision, reflection, and moments of resistance – as students compose digital literacy narratives. The digital literacy narrative provides an ideal opportunity to study intermodality in the writing classroom because of its invitation for students to reflect critically on their perceptions of digital writing specifically and literacy more generally, and its ability to encourage students to (re) position themselves as agents in their own stories. The text describes the synergistic, imagistic, and embodied dimensions of a pedagogy <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> and suggests the increased avenues for student expression, analysis, and persuasion when writing digitally. A pedagogy <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> reinforces the embodied, sensory aspects of writing by opening students to the affiliative elements of writing such as emotion, memory, and experience. The dissertation argues that, coupled with more traditional rhetorical instruction, a writing pedagogy attentive to intermodality helps students construct and implement effective rhetorical decision-making processes as they compose multimodally.

This project aims at minimizing the overall <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> empty container management in the hinterlands of the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam. The proposed model is a two-stage stochastic network model which takes account of transit time between ports and terminals, shipping cost, the carrying capacity of the various modes of transport, the stochastic demand and supply of each terminal and port as well as other parameters such as substitution or holding costs.

40|$|Intermodal {{research}} has {{to a large}} extent focused on the technical issues <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> and transport optimisation. While {{the focal point of the}} theoretical intermodal concept is on the transfer of load units between transport modes, practitioners acknowledge the transfer of information and responsibilities between involved actors as key issues. This research investigates the contradiction of viewpoints: on one hand, the goods flow perspective where flows are seen as continuous chains through nodes and links in a transport network, and on the other hand, the firm perspective with focus on the transport operators internal productivity and profitability. There is thus a conceptual limitation in the simplistic linear view of the theoretical intermodal concept, referring to intermodal transport chains as seamless, with regard to cooperation among actors in the network structure. As a consequence, a conflict of interests may occur between the two perspectives. The conclusions have been reached through two extensive case studies where findings have been categorised into three key areas that are essential in order to attain high performance in an intermodal assignment: interfaces, chain integration and resource utilisation. The key areas include both technical and organisational aspects, to reflect the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>intermodality.</b> Execution <b>of</b> an intermodal transport assignment relies on both the operators business strategies and the characteristics of their respective transport modes. The former relates to the efficiency of information transfer and the willingness to cooperate among the actors, whereas the latter refers to connectivity in terms of appropriate facilities and bridging of gaps between the modes concerning frequency, capacity and time. This paper focuses on the first issue and the objective is to broaden the view on intermodal transportation by bringing organisational and managerial aspects into consideration besides the pure technical description. There is thus a need of expanding the most widespread theoretical definition <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> in order to reflect the distinguishing characteristics of intermodal transportation. Thereby the theoretical description of the concept better reflects practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{intermodality}} is main {{an element}} of economic competitiveness and basic tool for support of the Trans-European Network- Transport (TEN-T) development. This paper offers {{the analysis of the}} promising innovative approaches to synthesis of the intermodal traffic systems including inland navigation. Inland waterways are the powerful tool for the further development <b>of</b> <b>intermodality.</b> Waterborne transport is the oldest mode of the cargoes haulage and the passengers’ travels. Now this environment-friendly transport mode gets main importance again, that requires innovative changes in the inland vessels, pushers, barges and its service systems. It is connected by that the combined transport, namely rail/road using along the main traffic corridors of the TEN-T is currently struggling with high external <b>costs,</b> including <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> environment renewal, congestion consequences and refund of traffic accidents charges. Experience of some EU countries has shown, that innovative approaches to the organization of inland navigation as element of integrated transport systems could help to solve these problems including elimination of “bottlenecks ” in transport chains.

30|$|Consistent with a {{previous}} study [5] showing that the type <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> image registration had no significant impact on SUVmax, the present study showed {{that the type of}} intramodality registration had no significant impact on absolute TRT of SUVmax compared with delineating VOIs separately on both scans. The same was true for SUVmean (except for CTPET registration) and TLG. Only for absolute TRT of metabolic volume, significant lower values were observed for all registration strategies when compared to delineating VOIs separately, except for non-rigid PET and CTPET registrations. Rigid image registration does not allow any changes in volume, so in theory this should always be zero. Some lesions, however, showed small non-zero TRT values due to small sampling errors or VOIs that were moved partly outside the image borders after registration.|$|R
30|$|As we {{stressed}} at {{the beginning}} of the paper building models <b>of</b> <b>intermodality</b> is facilitated if the descriptions of distinct modalities are informed by the same theoretical principles; and this is important for applications. Work in educational linguistics, for example Hood (2011) and Hao and Hood (in press), regularly has to deal with the interaction of language, paralanguage and imaging on Power Point slides. And for forensic linguistics, for example Martin and Zappavigna (2013) and Martin and Zappavigna, 2018, Zappavigna and Martin (2018), language and paralanguage interact with the semiotics of the location of the legal proceedings (which are very different for courtrooms and Youth Justice Conferences). The model of intermodal convergence (ideational concurrence, interpersonal resonance and textual synchronicity) presented in Table 2 above is far easier to operationalise when each of the modalities involved is interpreted from the perspective of SFL.|$|R

The model is then {{used to analyze the}} impact of TOIs on rail demand, accessibility and passenger welfare under the assumption of bounded rationality. Providing that the model captures the major processes in play, the results will show the potential effects of policy choices and technological innovations both on their own and in a combined form, thus enabling discussion of their relative merits and synergies. An analysis of quantitative results shows that the effect is positive, highly non-linear, and prone to cumulative effects due to far-reaching impacts related, for instance, to the economics of climate change. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the tyranny}} of {{distance}} has been reduced by cheaper and faster transport, important geographical differences remain. Transport provision varies enormously. Globalization is uneven. Location remains all-important as time/space relationships collapse differentially.
