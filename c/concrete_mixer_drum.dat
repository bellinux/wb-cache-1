40|$|We have {{provided}} technical solutions {{to improve performance}} of technological systems for the preparation of solutions and concrete based {{on the use of}} screw rotors in the form of drums with helix lines formed on the perimeter as interconnect lines of his spiral surfaces. We discuss the six varieties of devices and installations for mixing, including <b>concrete</b> <b>mixers,</b> reels which are of a complicated geometric body formed by helical surfaces with variable or constant pitch and which creates screw lines in the places of their connection. In the form of screw drums, they may be conical, concave, convex, cylindrical. The experimental test was conducted on the <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> <b>drums,</b> which are arranged one in the other. The implementation of the mixer in the form of coaxially edited two barrels provides not only a reduction in size in length, but a significant reduction in energy consumption due to the use of heat, released during the activation process of inert heating of the concrete mix as when re-mixing and concrete mix when mixing it with water and transportation. The drums of such systems is made of flat elements with the formation of the helical lines discretely spaced around the perimeter of different pitch and with different numbers directed towards each other helical surfaces. In the process of transporting the components of concrete in the internal screw drum there is active mixture of sand, gravel and cement. Thus, there is not only the destruction of lumpy, sticky components of the raw materials, but also active uniform distribution of particles of cement, sand and gravel into a homogenous mass. The implementation of the proposed technology and equipment ensures not only reduction of the dimensions of the mixer length, but also improving the quality of finished products, as well as potential cement savings of 3 - 5...|$|R

50|$|A <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> (often mistakenly {{called a}} cement mixer) is {{a device that}} {{homogeneously}} combines cement, aggregate such as sand or gravel, and water to form concrete. A typical <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> uses a revolving drum to mix the components. For smaller volume works portable <b>concrete</b> <b>mixers</b> are often used so that the concrete can be made at the construction site, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens. An alternative to a machine is mixing concrete by hand. This is usually done in a wheelbarrow; however, several companies have recently begun to sell modified tarps for this purpose.|$|R
