Armed security personnel also patrol El Al terminals overseas. Inside the terminal, passengers and their baggage are checked by a trained team. El Al security procedures require that all passengers be interviewed individually prior to boarding, allowing El Al staff to identify possible security threats. Passengers are {{asked questions about}} their place of origin, the reason for their trip, their job or occupation, and whether they have packed their bags themselves. El Al believes interviewers <b>can</b> <b>spot</b> signs of nervousness.|$|E
25|$|It is only by {{maintaining}} such a continual vigilance that the sociologists <b>can</b> <b>spot</b> {{themselves in the}} act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking down those guilty of 'vulgarity'. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to be conscious of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.|$|E
25|$|In the United States and a {{few other}} countries, Doppler capable weather radar {{stations}} are used. These devices are capable of measuring the radial velocity, including radial direction (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so <b>can</b> <b>spot</b> evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160nbsp&km) away. A supercell is characterized by a mesocyclone, which is usually first observed in velocity data as a tight, cyclonic structure in the middle levels of the thunderstorm. If it meets certain requirements of strength, duration, and vorticity, it may trip the mesocyclone detection algorithm (MDA). Tornadic signatures are indicated by a cyclonic inbound-outbound velocity couplet, where strong winds flowing in one direction and strong winds flowing in the opposite direction are occurring in very close proximity. The algorithm for this is the tornadic vortex signature (TVS) or the tornado detection algorithm (TDA). TVS is then an extremely strong mesocyclone found at very low level and extending over a deep layer of the thunderstorm, not the actual tornadic circulation. The TVS is, however, indicative of a likely tornado or an incipient tornado. The couplet and TVS typically precede tornado formation by 10–30 minutes but may occur at nearly the same time or precede the tornado by 45 minutes or more. Polarimetric radar can discern meteorological and nonmeteorological and other characteristics of hydrometeors that are helpful to tornado detection and nowcasting. Nonmeteorological reflectors co-located with a couplet, can confirm that a tornado has likely occurred and lofted debris. An area of high reflectivity, or debris ball, may also be visible {{on the end of the}} hook. Either the polarimetric data or debris ball are formally known as the tornado debris signature (TDS). The hook echo feature is formed as the RFD occludes precipitation around the mesocyclone and is also indicative of a probable tornado (tornadogenesis usually ensues shortly after the RFD reaches the surface).|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} {{of the game is}} spent sailing from destination to destination around the Caribbean islands. To control their ship the player must use the number pad (or the directional arrows) on the keyboard. Mouse navigation is also possible, where clicking anywhere on the screen will send the ship sailing in that direction. During the sailing segment, the player navigates between areas of interest in the Caribbean, including colonies, cities, missions, pirate havens, and others. Wind conditions have an important effect on sailing, as winds tend to blow westwards (especially on lower difficulty levels) and as such speed up travels to the west while slowing down travel to the east. Clouds passing overhead indicate barometric depressions, and at the centers of these depressions are storms which cause powerful winds, usually assisting sailing in any direction but also posing a threat to any ship passing underneath the storm. Unlike previous versions of the game, the Caribbean is teeming with ships represented visually by their three-dimensional models. The player <b>can</b> <b>spot</b> these ships from a distance and even collect information about their mission, port of departure, destination, and nationality. This allows the player to hand-pick his targets, as well as actively pursue most ships if an attack is to be attempted. Unlike previous Pirates! games, however, enemy ships cannot force the player to fight, although they can bombard the player's ships en route to a destination and even sink some (but not all) of the player's ships if they bombard them long enough. Fortified cities which hold a particular grudge against the player (or whose controlling nation holds a substantial bounty over the player's head) may also open fire upon the player's fleet as it passes by. The player must also navigate around reefs and shoals, which cause hull damage to any ship which passes over them (but rarely sink ships, unlike in previous versions). Finally, if the player wishes, he may sail the ship onto the shoreline, allowing the crew to disembark and begin to march. This can be used when the player wishes to approach a hostile city without being fired upon, to attack a friendly city, or to travel on land seeking buried treasure, lost cities, or Montalban's hideout.|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} {{optional}} side quests {{that do not}} advance the main plot, which feature fleshed out supporting characters and multiple outcomes. According to a writer for Digital Spy, {{most of these are}} not [...] "fetch quests". During the game, the protagonist can build up a reputation depending on their actions. Non-playable characters will react differently to him or her depending on this, and it can also affect the outcome of certain events in the game. The game features a scouting mode in which the party can sneak, which allows the player to avoid being seen by enemies. During scouting, the party <b>can</b> <b>spot</b> hidden items and traps, which the player can disarm and use against enemies.|$|E
500|$|The game is set {{around a}} year after the {{previous}} game, , in a time where the court system has entered a dark era of false charges and fabricated evidence, caused in part by the event that led to Phoenix being unjustly disbarred. The player takes the roles of three defense attorneys Phoenix Wright, Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes, who defend their clients in multiple cases and try to restore confidence in the courts. The gameplay is split into investigation sections, where the player searches for evidence and talks to witnesses, and trials, where they search for inconsistencies between witness testimonies and the evidence. The player can use some character-specific gameplay mechanics: Phoenix can see [...] "psyche-locks" [...] over witnesses who are hiding something; Apollo <b>can</b> <b>spot</b> visual cues in witnesses that indicate lying; and Athena can detect conflicting emotions in witnesses' voices.|$|E

500|$|Today, most {{developed}} countries have {{a network of}} weather radars, which remains the main method of detecting signatures probably associated with tornadoes. In the United States {{and a few other}} countries, Doppler weather radar stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial direction (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so <b>can</b> <b>spot</b> evidence of rotation in storms from more than [...] away. When storms are distant from a radar, only areas high within the storm are observed and the important areas below are not sampled. Data resolution also decreases with distance from the radar. Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data. Doppler radar systems can detect mesocyclones within the supercell of a thunderstorm. This allows meteorologists to predict tornado formations throughout thunderstorms.|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{describes}} himself as racially color-blind and unable to visually identify a person's race, explaining, [...] "Now, I don't see race ... People tell me I'm white, and I believe them, because I own a lot of Jimmy Buffett albums." [...] His race-blindness is a recurring joke, and this statement is often repeated on the show with different punch lines. For this same reason he believed that he was black when he had an emotional breakdown after watching Obama's inauguration video. He later qualified these statements in his book, stating, [...] "When I say I don't see race, I mean I don't see Black people. But I <b>can</b> <b>spot</b> a Mexican at a hundred paces." [...] Despite all these claims, Colbert often boasts {{that he has a}} large number of token minority friends (including Jon Stewart as [...] " [...] Jewish friend" [...] and Oprah Winfrey as [...] " [...] black friend"), although in the photos shown these friends appear decidedly uninterested in him. He has stated a similar inability to distinguish between the sexes, claiming to only [...] "see an American". This comes in contradiction of his at times sexist behavior, for instance, calling only on men during an open discussion with his audience on women's issues.|$|E
500|$|The {{hotel has}} a {{tradition}} of keeping a cat that has the run of the hotel. The practice dates to the 1930s, when Frank Case took in a stray male cat that was initially named [...] "Rusty." [...] Hotel lore says actor John Barrymore suggested the cat needed a more [...] "dignified" [...] name, so the cat was renamed [...] "Hamlet." [...] Nowadays, whenever the hotel has a male cat, he's named Hamlet; but if the hotel has a female cat, she's named [...] "Matilda." [...] The current Algonquin cat, a Matilda, is a Ragdoll that was named 2006 cat of the year at the Westchester (New York) Cat Show. [...] Visitors <b>can</b> <b>spot</b> Matilda on her personal chaise longue in the lobby; she can also be found in her favorite places: behind the computer on the front desk, or lounging on a baggage cart. The doormen feed her and the general manager's executive assistant answers Matilda's e-mail. During 2011, Matilda was temporarily confined to an upper floor or to the limits of a leash tethered to the check-in desk, due to a directive from the city Department of Health. As of late 2011, Matilda has been confined to the non-food areas of the lobby by an electronic pet fence.|$|E

2500|$|For Maykov, {{who took}} his {{historical}} poems and plays seriously, authenticity was the main objective. In his Old Believers drama The Wanderer (1867), he used the hand-written literature of raskolniks and, [...] "having discovered those poetic gems, tried to re-mold them into... modern poetic forms," [...] as he explained in the preface. In his historical works Maykov often had contemporary Russian issues in mind. [...] "While writing of ancient history I was looking for parallels {{to the things that}} I had to live through.
