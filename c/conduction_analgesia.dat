40|$|Abstract Background Current analgesics have {{drawbacks}} such as {{delays in}} acquisition, lag-times for effect, and side effects. We recently presented {{a preliminary report}} of a new analgesic method involving a two-minute sciatic nerve press, which resulted in immediate short-term relief of pain associated with dental and renal diseases. The present study investigated whether this technique was effective for pain associated with other disease types, and whether the relief was effective for up to one hour. Methods This randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted in four hospitals in Anhui Province, China. Patients with pain were sequentially recruited by participating physicians during clinic visits, and 135 patients aged 15 – 80 years were enrolled. Dental disease patients included those with acute pulpitis and periapical abscesses. Renal disease patients included those with kidney infections and/or stones. Tumor patients included those with nose, breast, stomach and liver cancers, while Emergency Room patients had various pathologies. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive a "sciatic nerve press" in which pressure was applied simultaneously to the sciatic nerves at the back of both thighs, or a "placebo press" in which pressure was applied to a parallel region {{on the front of the}} thighs. Each fist applied a pressure of 11 – 20 kg for 2 minutes. Patients rated their level of pain before and after the procedure. Results The "sciatic nerve press" produced immediate relief of pain in all patient groups. Emergency patients reported a 43. 5 % reduction in pain (p th minutes, and the relief decreased 47 % by the 60 th minutes. Conclusion Two minutes of pressure on both sciatic nerves produced immediate significant short-term <b>conduction</b> <b>analgesia.</b> This technique is a convenient, safe and powerful method for the short-term treatment of clinical pain associated with a diverse range of pathologies.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite much research, an {{immediately}} available, instantly {{effective and}} harmless pain relief technique {{has not been}} discovered. This study describes a new manipulation: a " 2 -minute sciatic nerve press", for rapid short-term relief of pain brought on by various dental and renal diseases. Methods This randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial ran in three hospitals in Anhui Province, China, with an enrollment of 66 out of 111 solicited patients aged 16 to 74 years. Patients were recruited sequentially, by specific participating physicians at their clinic visits to three independent hospitals. The diseases in enrolled dental patients included dental caries, periodontal diseases and dental trauma. Renal diseases in recruits included kidney infections, stones and some other conditions. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive the " 2 -minute sciatic nerve press" or the "placebo press". For the " 2 -minute sciatic nerve press", pressure was applied simultaneously to the sciatic nerves {{at the back of the}} thighs, using the fists while patients lay prone. For the "placebo press", pressure was applied simultaneously to a parallel spot on the front of the thighs, using the fists while patients lay supine. Each fist applied a pressure of 11 to 20 kg for 2 minutes, after which, patients arose to rate pain. Results The " 2 -minute sciatic nerve press" produced greater pain relief than the "placebo press". Within the first 10 minutes after sciatic pressure, immediate pain relief ratings averaged 66. 4 % (p Conclusion Two minutes of pressure on both sciatic nerves can produce immediate significant <b>conduction</b> <b>analgesia,</b> providing a convenient, safe and powerful way to overcome clinical pain brought on by dental diseases and renal diseases for short term purposes.

40|$|The use of {{regional}} analgesia for pain relief during labor {{has become increasingly}} common in ob-stetric practice. Intrapartum regional analgesia is now used by more than 50 % of parturients in the United States. 1 Although this form of obstet-ric analgesia {{has been shown to}} be a safe and ef-fective method of pain relief, there is controversy regarding the effect {{of regional}} analgesia on the rate of cesarean births due to the indication of dystocia. 2 – 7 Elevated rates of instrument-assisted vaginal delivery associated with the <b>conduction</b> of <b>analgesia</b> have also been reported. 5, 6, 8 Differ-ences in study design have made it difficult to compare reported data on the effect of regiona...|$|R
