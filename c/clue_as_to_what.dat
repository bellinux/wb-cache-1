5|$|For {{security}} reasons, filming {{and photography}} {{were not allowed}} near or inside the United States Bullion Depository. All sets for the interiors of the building were designed and built from scratch at Pinewood Studios. The filmmakers had no <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> {{the interior of the}} depository looked like, so Ken Adam's imagination provided the idea of gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars.|$|E
500|$|Throughout August 2011, the Carowinds {{web site}} had six {{different}} QR codes, {{each of which}} led the user to a website giving a <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the 2012 attraction might be. When all six clues were put together, they made a picture that read [...] "Voiceless it cries, wingless flutters, toothless bites, mouthless mutters, fun soars to new heights... August 24". On August 24, 2011, it was officially announced that Carowinds would receive the fifth WindSeeker, and on September 1, 2011, Kings Dominion officially announced that the sixth would open at the park in 2012. The WindSeekers at Carowinds and Kings Dominion {{will have the same}} appearance as those at Canada's Wonderland, Cedar Point, and Kings Island and are expected to open in 2012. Their construction started in early November 2011, after the parks closed for the season. At Kings Dominion, El Dorado was removed {{at the end of the}} 2011 season to make room for WindSeeker. The first WindSeeker tower piece was installed there on January 20, 2012, and at Carowinds on January 23, 2012. Carowinds soft-opened their version on March 30, 2012 to media and invited guests; it opened to the public on March 31, 2012. Kings Dominion officially opened their model on April 6, 2012.|$|E
500|$|In early 2009, Rovio staff began {{reviewing}} {{proposals for}} potential games. One such proposal came from senior game designer Jaakko Iisalo {{in the form}} of a simulated screenshot featuring some angry-looking birds with no visible legs or wings. While the picture gave no <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> type of game was being played, the staff liked the characters, and the team elected to design a game around them. In early 2009, physics games, such as Crush the Castle, were popular flash-based web games, so the Rovio team was inspired by these games. During the development of Angry Birds, the staff realized the birds needed an enemy. At the time, the [...] "swine flu" [...] epidemic was in the news, so the staff made the birds' enemies pigs. Angry Birds was the studio's 52nd produced game and on its initial release, the game didn't sell many copies. After Angry Birds was a featured app on the UK App Store in February 2010 and quickly reached No.1 there, it reached the No. 1 spot on the paid apps chart in the US App Store in the middle of 2010 and then stayed there for 275 days. The initial cost to develop Angry Birds was estimated to exceed €100,000, not including costs for the subsequent updates. For the iOS version, Rovio partnered with distributor Chillingo to publish the game to the App Store.|$|E

5000|$|Decoding the Past (2005-2008) is a History Channel paranormal {{television}} series that [...] "decodes" [...] {{the past by}} looking for unusual, and mysterious things written about throughout history that may give <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> {{will happen in the}} future.|$|R
500|$|The {{original}} album cover, {{designed by}} art collective Hipgnosis, shows a Holstein-Friesian cow {{standing in a}} pasture with no text nor any other <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> {{might be on the}} record. Some later editions have the title and artist name added to the cover. This concept was the group's reaction to the psychedelic space rock imagery associated with Pink Floyd {{at the time of the}} album's release; the band wanted to explore all sorts of music without being limited to a particular image or style of performance. They thus requested that their new album had [...] "something plain" [...] on the cover, which ended up being the image of a cow. Storm Thorgerson, inspired by Andy Warhol's famous [...] "cow wallpaper", has said that he simply drove out into a rural area near Potters Bar and photographed the first cow he saw. The cow's owner identified her name as [...] "Lulubelle III". More cows appear on the back cover, again with no text or titles, and on the inside gatefold. Also, a pink balloon shaped like a cow udder accompanied the album as part of Capitol's marketing strategy campaign to [...] "break" [...] the band in the US. The liner notes in later CD editions give a recipe for Traditional Bedouin Wedding Feast on a card labelled [...] "Breakfast Tips". Looking back on the artwork, Thorgerson remembered: [...] "I think the cow represents, in terms of the Pink Floyd, part of their humour, which I think is often underestimated or just unwritten about." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, {{one of the}} Shiden fighters was {{recovered}} from Bungo Channel in shallow water some [...] from shore. Among the fishermen who helped bring the aircraft to the surface were ones who had witnessed it falling into the water on 24 July 1945. The wrecked aircraft showed no bullet holes and provided no other <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> caused it to ditch. It was restored for display and placed in an exhibit at a nearby museum in Shikoku. No evidence is available to identify which 343rd Air Group pilot flew the fighter, so the museum honors all six of the Shiden pilots {{who lost their lives}} that day, including Muto and Oshibuchi.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, Henrici's texts {{have survived}} and Bach's {{settings}} have not.

6000|$|We made an {{accurate}} {{examination of the}} place, the Professor saying as we began, [...] "The first thing is {{to see how many}} of the boxes are left, we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> has become of the rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will, Sophy. I {{will bring}} him up {{as my own}} child. But all this is really too bad, Sophy.

6000|$|... "My first {{conjecture}} was, {{that possibly}} {{there had been}} some passages between this young lady and the old soldier, which the former had now confessed to the wife. That would account for the angry return, and also for the girl's denial that anything had occurred. Nor would it be entirely incompatible with most of the words overhead. But there was the reference to David, and there was the known affection of the Colonel for his wife, to weigh against it, {{to say nothing of the}} tragic intrusion of this other man, which might, of course, be entirely disconnected with what had gone before. It was not easy to pick one's steps, but, on the whole, I was inclined to dismiss the idea that there had been anything between the Colonel and Miss Morrison, but more than ever convinced that the young lady held the <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> it was which had turned Mrs. Barclay to hatred of her husband. I took the obvious course, therefore, of calling upon Miss M., of explaining to her that I was perfectly certain that she held the facts in her possession, and of assuring her that her friend, Mrs. Barclay, might find herself in the dock upon a capital charge unless the matter were cleared up.|$|E
5000|$|The Hassidic Rabbi Nachman of Breslov is {{reported}} to have written a book which he himself burned in 1808.

50|$|Like {{other insects}} of its time, Rhyniognatha presumably fed on plant sporophylls - which {{occur at the}} tips of {{branches}} and bear sporangia, the spore-producing organs. The insect’s anatomy might also give <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> it ate. The creature had large mandibles {{which may or may}} not have been used for hunting.|$|R
25|$|This {{strategy}} was chosen after Uchiyama {{and others on}} the design team spent time in the United States studying owners of earlier RX-7s and other sports cars popular in the American market.

6000|$|... “It {{is of no}} use my waiting here,” he said to himself, {{after some}} thought. “Pita has no shadow of a <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> has become of me, and as I may be thirty miles away from him it would take an army to find me. I had better try and push on until I get to dry land. I may {{then be able to}} work round the inundations until I reach the rocky ground and can make my way along it to the mission.” As soon as the sun rose he was able to {{determine}} the points of the compass, and paddled steadily on, his eyes fixed upon the trees above him. Other snakes might be lurking or wild beasts taking refuge in the branches. That there were many of these indeed he was sure, by the number of uneasy howls that he had heard before the sun rose. Several times as he rowed he caught sight of leopards and jaguars in the trees; one of the latter, unobserved until he had passed beyond the branches, sprang down from above, narrowly missing the stern of the canoe, and starting in pursuit as soon as it came to the surface again. Stephen, however, was able to drive the boat through the water at a much higher rate than the beast could swim, and it was not long before he had left it far behind him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{she was a}} foreigner," [...] he declared. [...] "I {{should like}} to know of what account any foreign family is against our good city firms, such as I have been {{speaking}} of. No, Chetwode, my opinion is that she's {{brought a lot of}} her miserable, foreign hangers-on over here, and that somehow or other they are worrying Mr. Weatherley. I should like, if I could, to interest you in the chief. You can't be expected to feel as I do towards him. At the same time, he {{is the head of the}} firm, and you are bound, therefore, to feel a certain respect due to him, and I thought that if I talked to you and put these matters before you, which have occurred not only to me but to those others who have been with Mr. Weatherley for so many years, you might be able to help us by watching, and if you can find any <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is bothering him, why, I'd be glad to hear of it, for there isn't one of us who wouldn't do anything that lay in his power to have the master back once more as he used to be a few years ago. Why, the business seems to have lost all its spring, nowadays," [...] Mr. Jarvis went on, mournfully. [...] "We do well, of course, because we couldn't help doing well, but we plod along more like a machine. It was different altogether in the days when Mr. Weatherley used to bring out the morning orders himself and chaff us about selling for no profit. You follow me, Chetwode?" ...|$|E

40|$|These {{findings}} are discussed {{with respect to}} the possible role of hydroxylysine glycosides in limiting collagen fibril diameter. Comparisons of the amino acid sequences around the seven glycoside sites however gave no <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> makes some lysyl residues more susceptible to modification than others.

5000|$|On February 6, 2017, Frontier {{announced}} that they had acquired licensing rights from an unnamed Hollywood movie studio {{to be used in}} their third self-published title.

50|$|The game {{takes place}} in the students' home. The player can choose <b>to</b> play <b>as</b> either Mike, Neil, Vyvyan or Rick to explore the house and enter {{different}} rooms.
