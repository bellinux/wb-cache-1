In GIS applications, map coverage is {{important in terms of}} performing reliable and meaningful queries. Map projections can be conformal, equal-area and equidistant. The goal of an application {{plays an important role in}} choosing one of those projections. Choosing the equal-area projection for an application in which area information is used (forestry, agriculture, ecosystem etc) reduces the amount of distortion on the area, but many users using GIS ignore this fact and continue to use applications with present map sheets no matter in what map projection it is. For example, extracting area information from data whose country systemÃ¢Â€Â™s map sheet is in <b>conformal</b> <b>projection</b> is relatively more distorted, compared to an equal-area projection one. The goal of this study is to make the best decision in choosing the most proper equal-area projection among the choices provided by ArcGIS 9. 0, which is a popular GIS software package, and making a comparison on area errors when <b>conformal</b> <b>projection</b> is used.
