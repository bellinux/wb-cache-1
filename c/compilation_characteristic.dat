Heuristics {{play a key}} role in determining when it is most beneficial to inline procedures during region formation. An ILP optimizing compiler using a region-based approach restructures a program to better reflect dynamic behavior and increase interprocedural optimization and scheduling opportunities. This paper presents an interprocedural compilation technique which performs procedure inlining on-demand, rather than as a separate phase, to improve the ability of a region-based optimizer to control code growth, compilation time and memory usage while improving performance. The interprocedural region formation algorithm utilizes a demand-driven, heuristics-guided approach to inlining, restructuring an input program into interprocedural regions. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the impact of the algorithm and several inlining heuristics upon a number of traditional and novel <b>compilation</b> <b>characteristics</b> within a region-based ILP compiler and simulator.

40|$|Iterative {{compilation}} techniques, {{which involve}} iterating over {{different sets of}} optimizations, have proven useful in helping compilers choose the right set of optimizations for a given program. However, compilers typically have {{a large number of}} optimizations to choose from, making it impossible to iterate over a significant fraction of the entire optimization search space. Recent research has proposed to “intelligently” iterate over the optimization search space using predictive methods. In particular, state-the-art methods in iterative <b>compilation</b> use <b>characteristics</b> of the code being optimized to predict good optimization sequences to evaluate. Thus, an important step in developing predictive methods for compilation is deciding how to model the problem of choosing the right optimizations. In this paper, we evaluate three different ways of modeling the problem of choosing the right optimization sequences using machine learning techniques. We evaluate a novel prediction modeling technique, namely a tournament predictor, that is able to effectively predict good optimization sequences. We show that our tournament predictor can outperform current state-of-the-art predictors and the most aggressive setting of the Open 64 compiler (-Ofast) on an average by 75 % in just 10 iterations over a set of embedded and scientific kernels. Moreover, using our tournament predictor, we achieved on average 10 % improvement for a set of MiBench applications...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{increasing}} use of embedded software, often implemented on a core processor in a single-chip system, is a {{clear trend}} in the telecommunications, multimedia, and consumer electronics industries. A companion paper in this issue presents a survey of application and architecture trends for embedded systems in these growth markets. However, the lack of suitable design technology remains a significant obstacle {{in the development of}} such systems. One of the key requirements is more efficient software compilation technology. Especially in the case of fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP) cores, it is often cited that commercially available compilers are unable {{to take full advantage of}} the architectural features of the processor. Moreover, due to the shorter lifetimes and the architectural specialization of many processor cores, processor designers are often compelled to neglect the issue of compiler support. This situation has resulted in an increased research activity in the area of design tool support for embedded processors.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THESIS OF Susan D. Sipes, for the Masters of Science {{degree in}} Workforce Education and Development, {{presented}} on October 11, 2010, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: ONE CONSORTIUM, TWO POPULATIONS: WHAT IT TAKES TO SUCCEED MAJOR PROFESSORS: Dr. Marcia Anderson and Dr. Beth Winfrey-Freeburg University consortia have existed for over 50 {{years as a}} practical solution to increase regional {{access to higher education}} and control costs. The challenge has been to determine how to measure the effectiveness of consortia in order to predict their success. The goal was to apply a business case to UCLC, treating students as customers, and administrators as business owners. Throughout the literature, much has been written to define the critical operational characteristics of successful consortia, but little has been done to explore the needs of consortia 2 ̆ 7 s customers. This work presents a <b>compilation</b> of operational <b>characteristics</b> with services desired by students in order to predict the success of one newer consortium, the University Center of Lake County in IL (UCLC). The characteristics and services of existing successful consortia were gleaned from the literature and a written survey instrument was developed. Students and administrators at UCLC were surveyed; their responses were compared to data extracted from other research using descriptive statistics and a chi-squared test. Results showed that UCLC exhibits many of the most important operational characteristics to be successful. Practical recommendations are provided to UCLC to further explore how to improve student services. For example, UCLC needs to increase its marketing and advertising efforts. Other consortia will be able to repeat the surveys to learn more about their operations and service levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{intent of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between the major characteristics and motivations of female volunteers in long-term care settings. Both a detailed description of who tends to volunteer as well as a sociocultural explanation for why one volunteers are provided. To assist in the sociocultural explanation, a life course paradigm of work transitions is utilized. Age-related differences in volunteer motivation are expected and represent the central focus {{of this study}}: Older women are primarily motivated by the internal rewards of volunteering whereas the younger volunteers are primarily motivated by the career-related rewards. The influence of gender, occupation, and setting are also considered. A questionnaire of mostly close-ended style questions is distributed by volunteers coordinators to the female volunteers of the long-term care organizations within the Windsor/Essex County area. A <b>compilation</b> of social <b>characteristics</b> presents the 2 ̆ 2 typical 2 ̆ 2 long-term care volunteer profile of a married, older woman of lower educational attainment, whose former main work position is lower-skilled, and whose volunteer work consists mainly of providing direct services to clients that are socio-emotional in nature. Support for the research hypotheses regarding the age-related differences in volunteer motivation is obtained and commonly identified reasons for volunteering are further explored. The relationship between one 2 ̆ 7 s main work tasks and one 2 ̆ 7 s volunteer tasks is also examined. The study concludes with the recognition of topical areas worthy of further research and the implications for the development and improvement of volunteer programming within a long-term care context.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess (a) the world views of faculty investigators in dentistry, nursing, and pharmacy; (b) their identification of ethical issues; and (c) the importance of ethical principles in human subject research. Relationships between world views and the identification of ethical issues and importance of ethical principles were also explored. World views were theorized as biological-technical, psychological-sociological, and biochemical for dentistry, nursing, and pharmacy respectively. A review of the literature supported these models and suggested that the constructs of autonomy, beneficence/nonmaleficence, and justice be used in determining identification and importance of ethical issues and principles. An instrument consisting of 59 items was developed and a pilot study conducted. In an attempt to obtain the desired number of respondents two mailings of the questionnaire were initiated to a total of 264 randomly selected faculty investigators in each discipline. These individuals held both professional and doctoral degrees and were employed in universities within the United States. The response rates were 32. 95 % for dentistry, 51. 89 % for nursing, and 35. 23 % for pharmacy. No response bias was present. The reliability of the instrument was. 82. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results support the world views theorized for dentistry and nursing but was different than expected for pharmacy. A psychological-sociological world view was found in pharmacy. For all disciplines the highest mean value on the identification scale was given to autonomy. Respondents indicated this principle as most important in nursing and pharmacy. Beneficence/nonmaleficence was deemed more important by dentists. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine relationships between world views and identification of ethical issues and world views and the importance of ethical principles; none were significant. The study is significant because of the development of an instrument, <b>compilation</b> of demographic <b>characteristics,</b> and documentation of world views. Results lend support to the findings of previous studies associating age and gender with moral development. Implications for further research as well as ethics education, revision of codes of ethics, and institutional review boards are apparent. ...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{popularity}} of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology {{has made the}} synthesis of Hardware Description Language (HDL) programs into FPGAs a very attractive topic for research. In particular, the correctness in the synthesis of an FPGA programming file from a source HDL program has gained significant relevance {{in the context of}} safety or mission-critical systems. The results presented here are part of a research project aiming at producing a verified compiler for the Handel-C language. Handel-C is a high level HDL based on the syntax of the C language extended with constructs to deal with parallel behaviour and process communications based on CSP. Given the complexity of designing a provably correct compiler for a language like Handel-C, we have adopted the algebraic approach to compilation as it offers an elegant solution to this problem. The idea behind algebraic compilation is to create a sound reasoning framework in which the a formal model of the source Handel-C program can be embedded and refined into a formal abstraction of the target hardware. As the algebraic rules used to compile the program are proven to preserve the semantics, the correctness of the entire compilation process (i. e., semantic equivalence between source and target programs) can be argued by construction, considering each programming construct in isolation, rather than trying to assert the correctness of the compilation in a single step. Regarding hardware synthesis, the algebraic approach has already been applied to subsets of Occam and Verilog. Our work builds on some ideas from these works but focuses on the more complex timing model imposed by Handel-C. Moreover, our work covers features like shared variables, multi-way communications and priorities which, to our knowledge, have never been addressed within the framework of algebraic <b>compilation.</b> Finally, one <b>characteristic</b> of the algebraic approach is that the basic reduction laws in the reasoning framework are postulated as axioms. As an invalid axiom would allow us to prove invalid results (up to the extent of being able to prove a false theorem) we are also concerned about the consistency of the basic postulates in our theory. We addressed this by providing denotational semantics for Handel-C and its reasoning extensions {{in the context of the}} Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP). Our UTP denotational semantics not only provided a model for our theory (hence, proving its consistency) but also allowed us to prove all the axioms in the compilation framework...|$|R
40|$|After {{earning a}} degree from Drake University, author Claude Barr settled on a {{homestead}} {{just south of the}} Black Hills. In addition to his principal occupation as a rancher, Barr began to observe and propagate native plants in his small garden. One of his earliest ventures into writing about his avocation was an article in 1930 on the pasqueflower. He commented, 2 ̆ 2 I was paid 20 for it, which seemed like a munificent price. 2 ̆ 2 This modest effort led to at least one hundred articles over the next fifty years. Jewels of the Plains is not simply a <b>compilation</b> of plant <b>characteristics</b> and a recitation of hints about how to grow them. Rather, it is a knowledgeable, loving record of one man 2 ̆ 7 s inquiries into the natural history of living things all but ignored by most people. The book 2 ̆ 7 s introductory chapter is a brief overview of plains geography, climate, and flora. A few remarks about specific landforms from southern Canada to the Texas Panhandle impart both a sense of place and the author 2 ̆ 7 s manner of interpreting the landscape. The sense of place also occurs throughout the book in references to collecting trips in localities such as Crow Butte (Nebraska), palo Duro Canyon (Texas), Flag Mountain (South Dakota), and Carrizo Mesa (Colorado). The body of the volume includes descriptions and propagation notes for approximately one hundred forty genera of plants, plus general discussions of two large diverse groups, cacti and ferns. Barr was not hesitant about expressing preferences for some subjects of his research. Likewise, he left little to the reader 2 ̆ 7 s imagination when recommending that some plants are better left in the wild. Writing about Vicia sparsifolia, a widely distributed native legume, he observed 2 ̆ 2 the roots and slender rhizomes are deep-seated, ineradicable, and insufferable [...] Beware! 2 ̆ 2 (p. 184). More than one hundred color plates of species mentioned in the text lend an appreciation for the variety of plant size, structure, and flower color among the region 2 ̆ 7 s flora. A two-page map of the plains includes state boundaries, major streams, and topographic features referred to in the text. (The cartographer, however, translocated the Black Hills to southwestern North Dakota.) The book concludes with a brief discussion of Barr 2 ̆ 7 s botanical contributions; this section was written by Ronald R. Weedon of Chadron State College. In the course of receiving an award in 1958, Claude Barr explained his philosophies in this manner: 2 ̆ 2 My life 2 ̆ 7 s ambition is a full life (I have it), a well-rounded life (I 2 ̆ 7 m working toward it), and a life that has made the best of the opportunities at hand. 2 ̆ 2 Most people his age (seventy one at that time) might have eased up a bit, but nearly forty more published articles were still to come from his inquiring mind.

40|$|High {{levels of}} polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in edible {{fish in the}} Baltic Sea have raised health {{concerns}} in the Baltic region {{and the rest of}} Europe. Thus, there are urgent needs to characterize sources in order to formulate effective mitigation strategies. The aim of this thesis is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} past and present sources of PCDD/Fs in the Baltic Sea environment by exploring chemical fingerprints in sediments, air, and biota. The spatial and temporal patterns of PCDD/F distributions in the Baltic Sea during the 20 th century were studied in Swedish coastal and offshore sediment cores. The results showed that PCDD/F levels peaked in 1975 (± 7 years) in coastal and 1991 (± 5 years) in offshore areas. The time trends of PCDD/Fs in the sediment cores also showed that environmental half-lives of these pollutants have been shorter in coastal than in offshore areas (15 ± 5 and 29 ± 14 years, respectively). Consequently, there have been remarkable recoveries in coastal areas, but slower recovery in offshore areas with 81 ± 12 % and 38 ± 11 % reductions from peak levels, respectively. Source-to-receptor multivariate modeling by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) showed that six types of PCDD/F sources are and have been important for the Baltic Sea environment: PCDD/Fs related to i) atmospheric background, ii) thermal processes, iii) manufacture and use of tetra-chlorophenol (TCP) and iv) penta-chlorophenol (PCP), v) industrial use of elementary chlo- rine and the chloralkali-process (Chl), and vi) hexa-CDD sources. The results showed that diffuse sources (i and ii) have consistently contributed > 80 % of the total amounts in the Southern Baltic Sea. In the Northern Baltic Sea, where the biota is most heavily contaminated, impacts of local sources (TCP, PCP and Chl) have been higher, contributing ca. 50 % of total amounts. Among the six sources, only Thermal and chlorophenols (ii-iv) have had major impacts on biota. The impact of thermal sources has, however, been declining as shown from source apportioned time-trend data of PCDD/Fs in Baltic herring. In contrast, impacts of chlorophenol-associated sources generally increased, remained at steady-state or slowly decreased during 1990 - 2010, suggesting that these sources have substantially contributed to the persistently high levels of PCDD/Fs in Baltic biota. Atmospheric sources of PCDD/Fs for the Baltic region (Northern Europe) were also investigated, and specifically whether the inclusion of parallel measurements of metals in the analysis of air would help back-tracking sources. PCDD/Fs and metals in high-volume air samples from a rural field station near the shore of the central Baltic Sea were measured. The study focused on the winter season and air from the S and E sectors, as these samples showed elevated levels of PCDD/Fs, particularly PCDFs. Several metals were found to correlate significantly with the PCDFs. The wide range of candidate metals as source markers for PCDD/F emissions, and the lack of an up-to-date extensive <b>compilation</b> of source <b>characteristics</b> for metal emission from vari- ous sources, limited the use of the metals as source markers. The study was not able to pin-point primary PCDD/F sources for Baltic air, but it demonstrated a new promising approach for source tracing of air emissions. The best leads for back-tracking primary sources of atmospheric PCDD/Fs in Baltic air were seasonal trends and PCDD/F congener patterns, pointing at non-industrial related thermal sources related to heating. The non-localized natures of the sources raise challenges for managing the emissions and thus societal efforts are required to better control atmospheric emissions of PCDD/Fs.
