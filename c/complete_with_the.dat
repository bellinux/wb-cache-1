5|$|Another segment, Debussy's Clair de lune, was {{developed}} {{as part of}} the film's original program. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The animation depicted two Great white herons flying through the Florida Everglades on a moonlit night. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the Blue Bayou segment in Make Mine Music (1946). In 1992, a workprint of the original was discovered and Clair de Lune was restored, <b>complete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000.|$|E
5|$|As of September 2017, {{reconstruction}} of the damaged lower section of the spillway was about one-third <b>complete,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> goal of making the spillway operational by November 1. In 2018, the upper section of the spillway which was undamaged by the flood but also {{has been identified as}} structurally defective, will be demolished and rebuilt. In addition, crews are working to extend a cutoff wall under the emergency spillway to prevent erosion should that structure be used again in the future.|$|E
5|$|Despite the World War I, {{significant}} {{extensions of}} rail lines were carried out, {{particularly in the}} wheat growing areas in the north west and west. The new lengthy parallel lines {{were considered to be}} cheaper to operate than the numerous short spurs such as those in the Goulburn Valley. By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely <b>complete,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with a number of lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW. On November 1937 the first run of the Spirit of Progress was made, a streamlined all air conditioned train run between Melbourne and Albury, led by the matching S class steam locomotives.|$|E

5|$|ENT Limited, a Launceston-based {{company that}} owned {{a number of}} {{television}} and radio stations in regional Victoria and Tasmania, was bought in 1994. Television Victoria and TasTV were, as a result, incorporated into the WIN network and subsequently renamed WIN Television, <b>complete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> nine dots logo of the Nine Network. The network further expanded to Griffith in 1998, when WIN purchased MTN-9 Griffith and its supplementary station AMN-31 from its local owners. Although station had previously {{been part of the}} Prime Television network, MTN already had links with WIN and took its feed from the network's Wollongong base.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly <b>complete,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} RAM 14000 is almost <b>complete,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> left side only lacking {{a piece of}} the maxilla. However, the skull was split down the middle by erosion, {{possibly}} when it was resting on the bottom of a river bed. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a trapezoid in shape.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{ordered that}} the excess baggage {{be taken to}} Burlington where it could be sent to Pennsylvania. The ground had frozen, making it {{possible}} to move the artillery without it sinking into the ground. By midnight, the plan was <b>complete,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> baggage on its way to Burlington and the guns wrapped in heavy cloth to stifle noise and prevent the British from learning of the evacuation. Washington left 500 men behind with two cannon to patrol, keep the fires burning, and to work with picks and shovels to make the British think that they were digging in. Before dawn, these men were to join up with the main army.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent <b>complete,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E

5|$|On 11May the briefcase, <b>complete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> documents, was {{returned}} to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Reginald Blomfield's Menin Gate was {{the first}} {{memorial}} to the missing located in Europe to be completed, and was unveiled on 24 July 1927. The Menin Gate (Menenpoort) {{was found to have}} insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34,984 names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker's Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing. Other memorials followed: the Helles Memorial in Gallipoli designed by John James Burnet; the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme and the Arras Memorial designed by Edwin Lutyens; and the Basra Memorial in Iraq designed by Edward Prioleau Warren. The Dominions and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing: the Neuve-Chapelle Memorial for the forces of India, the Vimy Memorial by Canada, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial by Australia, the Delville Wood Memorial by South Africa and the Beaumont-Hamel Memorial by Newfoundland. The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially <b>complete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inauguration of the Thiepval Memorial in 1932, though the Vimy Memorial would not be finished until 1936, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the Menin Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Tank, {{himself a}} capable {{development}} test pilot, {{took over the}} test program to investigate the aircraft's stalling characteristics, although the requisite airframe changes took several months to <b>complete,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pulqui II N. 02(m) so modified not able to undertake its third proving flight until 23 October. During the ensuing high-altitude test, on two successive occasions, the IAe 33 stalled inadvertently, although Tank had sufficient height at 9,000 m for recovery. Adding ballast to {{the nose of the}} aircraft cured the problem. On 8 February 1951, Tank publicly demonstrated the IAe 33 before Perón at the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires. The audience also included government officials, legislators and the foreign diplomatic corps in the military attaches of the embassies, along with a large crowd of spectators. Both the IAe 27 Pulqui I and IAe 33 Pulqui II flew during the demonstration.|$|E

5|$|The 160 hidden panels do {{not form}} a {{continuous}} story, but each panel provides one complete illustration {{of cause and}} effect. There are depictions of blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include charity and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, <b>complete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> full panorama of samsara (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was dissembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas in 1890. It is these photographs that are displayed in Borobudur Museum (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmawibhangga reliefs. Today, only {{the southeast corner of}} the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} August, Simon & Schuster published Faithful, a {{book which}} collected e-mails about the Red Sox between American writers and Red Sox fans Stephen King and Stewart O'Nan during the 2004 season. In March 2005, Houghton Mifflin Company published Reversing the Curse, {{a book by}} Shaughnessy, author of the bestselling The Curse of the Bambino, chronicling the 2004 Red Sox season. ESPN's Bill Simmons published Now I Can Die In Peace, a collection of his columns with updated annotations and notes, including columns {{for each of the}} last four games of the ALCS and each World Series game – with Game 4 being a running diary. The Farrelly Brothers altered the ending of their 2005 film Fever Pitch – which includes appearances by Damon, Nixon and Varitek – to coincide with the actual end of the series. They and their crew, plus stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon, flew to St. Louis and Barrymore and Fallon attended Game 4 in character, <b>complete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> two of them running onto the field at Busch Stadium and kissing once the final out was made.|$|E
5|$|The last {{member of}} the Hungerford family to hold the castle, Sir Edward Hungerford, {{inherited}} it in 1657, but his gambling and expensive living forced him to sell the property in 1686. By the 18th century the castle was no longer lived in by its owners and fell into disrepair; in 1730 it was bought by the Houlton family, when {{much of it was}} broken up for salvage. Antiquarian and tourist interest in the now ruined castle increased through the 18th and 19th centuries. The castle chapel was repaired in 1779 and became a museum of curiosities, <b>complete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> murals rediscovered on its walls in 1844 and a number of rare lead anthropomorphic coffins from the mid-17th century. In the 1915 Farleigh Hungerford Castle was sold to the Office of Works and a controversial restoration programme began. It is now owned by English Heritage, who operate it as a tourist attraction, and the castle is a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
