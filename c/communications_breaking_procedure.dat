In Fig.  18 a, a larger oscillation in the port voltage of HHB 34 in the positive-pole line is observed after the voltage decreases to zero vertically with the traditional strategy, while with the proposed strategy, a smaller voltage oscillation is discovered due to the voltage from triggered MOVs that have not been bypassed, which is the same as in Fig.  16 a. As shown in Fig.  18 b, d, the fault current, which is much smaller than the peak current in the <b>breaking</b> <b>procedure</b> flowing through the same HHB 34 and faulty positive-pole line, is detected somewhat earlier with the traditional strategy.

30|$|It is {{important}} {{to say that in}} geological engineering, including in underground rock engineering and rock mechanics, lots of the hazards sources arise from geotechnical uncertainty or error. The sources of uncertainty can be classified as: (1) inalienable spatial and fleeting fluctuation; (2) estimation and observing blunders; (3) demonstrating vulnerability; (4) load and stresses vulnerability (Brown 2012). In geotechnical engineering it is perceived that stone disfigurement is imperative in deciding the advancement of characteristic structures and structural highlights.

Assuming that one can eavesdrop a few consecutive rounds of authentications for the same RFID tag (the expected number for the presented algorithm is about 9, {{but it is possible}} to reduce this number to about 3. 5), the attacker learns the identity number of the tag and every common secret shared by the tag and the reader.

40|$|Abstract Background Co-bedding, a {{developmental}} care strategy, is {{the practice of}} caring for diaper clad twins in one incubator (versus separating and caring for each infant in separate incubators), thus creating the opportunity for skin-to-skin contact and touch between the twins. In studies of mothers and their infants, maternal skin-to-skin contact {{has been shown to}} decrease procedural pain response according to both behavioral and physiological indicators in very preterm neonates. It is uncertain if this comfort is derived solely from maternal presence or from stabilization of regulatory processes from direct skin contact. The intent {{of this study is to}} compare the comfort effect of co-bedding (between twin infants who are co-bedding and those who are not) on infant pain response and physiologic stability during a tissue <b>breaking</b> <b>procedure</b> (heelstick). Methods/Design Medically stable preterm twin infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit will be randomly assigned to a co-bedding group or a standard care group. Pain response will be measured by physiological and videotaped facial reaction using the Premature Infant Pain Profile scale (PIPP). Recovery from the tissue <b>breaking</b> <b>procedure</b> will be determined by the length of time for heart rate and oxygen saturation to return to baseline. Sixty four sets of twins (n = 128) will be recruited into the study. Analysis and inference will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Discussion If twin contact while co-bedding is determined to have a comforting effect for painful procedures, then changes in current neonatal care practices to include co-bedding may be an inexpensive, non invasive method to help maintain physiologic stability and decrease the long term psychological impact of procedural pain in this high risk population. Knowledge obtained from this study will also add to existing theoretical models with respect to the exact mechanism of comfort through touch. Trial registration NCT 00917631 </p...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  15, a {{permanent}} fault is detected immediately {{with the traditional}} strategy, while with the proposed strategy, it is not detected until the MOVs {{that have not been}} bypassed are triggered. Once the fault is detected, the control signals for PEMs in the transfer branch are de-energized immediately. In Fig.  16 a, a larger oscillation in the port-voltage of HHB 34 at the positive-pole line is observed after the voltage decreases to zero vertically with the traditional strategy, while with the proposed strategy, a smaller voltage oscillation is discovered due to the voltage caused by the triggered MOVs that have not been bypassed. In Fig.  16 b, the fault current flowing through the same HHB 34 is detected somewhat earlier with the traditional strategy. The current occurring in the reclosing procedure is much smaller than the peak current in the <b>breaking</b> <b>procedure.</b> As shown in Fig.  16 c, the voltage oscillation amplitude of the fault line with the traditional strategy is larger than that with the proposed strategy. In Fig.  16 d, the current waveforms of the fault line with the corresponding auto-reclosing strategy are the same as those in Fig.  16 b, again because the HHBs are connected with DC lines in series. As shown in Fig.  16 e, f, the voltages of healthy pole lines show a larger oscillation with the traditional strategy than those with the proposed strategy. In Fig.  16 g, h, no obvious oscillation is observed in the outlet currents of all the converter stations with either strategy. As shown in Fig.  16 i, the maximum energy absorbed by MOV in a cascaded unit is larger with the proposed strategy than that with the traditional strategy in the same HHB 34 auto-reclosing procedure. However, the dissipated energy is still within the tolerance of the corresponding MOV and can be ignored when compared to that in the same HHB 34 <b>breaking</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|R

40|$|We analise braneworld {{scenarios}} via a configurational entropy (CE) formalism. Braneworld scenarios {{have drawn}} attention mainly {{due to the}} fact that they can explain the hierarchy problem and unify the fundamental forces through a symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>procedure.</b> Those scenarios localize matter in a $(3 + 1) $ hypersurface, the brane, which is inserted in a higher dimensional space, the bulk. Novel analytical braneworld models, {in which the warp factor depends} on a free parameter $n$, were recently released in the literature. In this article we will provide a way to constrain this parameter through the relation between information and dynamics of a system described by the CE. We demonstrate that in some cases the CE is an important tool in order to provide the most probable physical system among all the possibilities. In addition, we show that the highest CE is correlated to a tachyonic sector of the configuration, where the solutions for the corresponding model are dynamically unstable...|$|R

40|$|International audienceConstraint {{programming}} is traditionally {{viewed as the}} combination of two components: a constraint model and a search procedure. In this paper we show that tree search procedures can be fully inter-nalized in the constraint model with a fixed enumeration strategy. This approach has several advantages: 1) it makes search strategies declarative, and modeled as constraint satisfaction problems; 2) it {{makes it possible to}} express search strategies in existing front-end modeling languages supporting reified constraints without any extension; 3) it opens up constraint propagation algorithms to search constraints and to the implementation of novel search procedures based on constraint propagation. We illustrate this approach with a Horn clause extension of the MiniZinc modeling language and the modeling in this language of a variety of search procedures, including dynamic symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>procedures</b> and limited discrepancy search, as constraint satisfaction problems. We show that this generality does not come with a significant overhead, and can in fact exhibit exponential speedups over procedural implementations, thanks to the propagation of the search constraints. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} gravity be {{intrinsically}} quantum-mechanical, {{so that in}} the absence of quantum mechanics the geometry of the universe would be Minkowski. We show that in such a situation gravity does not require any independent quantization of its own, with it being quantized simply by virtue of its being coupled to the quantized matter fields that serve as its source. We show that when the gravitational and matter fields possess an underlying conformal symmetry, the gravitational field and fermionic matter-field zero-point fluctuations cancel each other identically. Then, when the fermions acquire mass by a dynamical symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>procedure</b> that induces a cosmological constant in such conformal theories, the zero-point fluctuations readjust so as to cancel the induced cosmological constant identically. The zero-point vacuum problem and the cosmological constant vacuum problems thus mutually solve each other.
