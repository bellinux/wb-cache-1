5|$|Fluff Cowan {{served as}} Woods' <b>caddie</b> {{from the start}} of his {{professional}} career until Tiger fired him in March 1999. He was replaced by Steve Williams, who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts. In June 2011, Woods fired Williams and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former <b>caddie</b> of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after and has remained Woods' <b>caddie</b> since then, but he has seen very limited work.|$|E

50|$|This was {{the first}} year that players were allowed {{to have their own}} <b>caddies</b> at the U.S. Open.

5000|$|Augusta National {{employs a}} staff of <b>caddies</b> to assist members, guests, and professionals. Before 1983, staff <b>caddies</b> were {{assigned}} to players at the Masters, and all were black males. Club co-founder Roberts once said, [...] "As long as I'm alive, all the golfers will be white and all the <b>caddies</b> will be black." [...] Roberts died in 1977 and five years later in November 1982, chairman Hord Hardin announced that players were henceforth permitted to use their regular <b>caddies</b> at the Masters. This followed an incident in the 1982 tournament when many of the <b>caddies</b> failed to show at the proper time on Friday morning following a Thursday rain delay, and scathing letters to Hardin from two-time champion Tom Watson and others followed.|$|R
5|$|Strong {{was born}} on 13 February 1880 in Ramsgate, Kent, England, to William R. Strong (1846–1899) and Charlotte E. Strong née Stock (1850–1923). Like many golfers from his era, he was first {{introduced}} to golf via his participation as a <b>caddie</b> when he toted bags at Royal St George's Golf Club located in Sandwich, England, in the mid-1890s. In 1905 he emigrated to the United States, departing Liverpool on 14 June 1905 aboard the RMS Teutonic which arrived in New York on 22 June 1905 with $400 in his pocket, a hefty sum at the time.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} one of two courses: the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews. The player's <b>caddie</b> {{provides}} information about the pitfalls and idiosyncrasies of each course. The game simulates the strong wind and weather typical of the courses' real-world counterparts, which lie near the seaside. The player may adjust environmental aspects such as weather, wind speed and the wetness of the soil. During a match, the player uses information on the heads-up display to determine such factors as wind speed and direction, the ball's distance from the flag and the height difference between the ball and the hole.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Scavino, {{social media}} {{director}} for Trump's presidential campaign began working at Briar Hall Country Club as a <b>caddie</b> in 2009, while in high school. He was promoted several times, including to {{general manager of}} the club after Trump's purchase. In December 2016, he was announced as Assistant to the President and Director of Social Media. Trump's candidacy for the 2016 United States presidential election affected the club; Horace Greeley High School used the facility for its annual proms, which was protested by its students in late 2015 due to its connection to Trump as a political candidate. The location for the 2016 prom has yet to be changed by student decision. In the following year, it was reported that Pleasantville High School's graduating class was considering changing its prom venue from Trump's club as well. The graduating class voted, 97-44, to keep the venue. On June 7, 2016, Trump gave his nomination victory speech at the clubhouse; he had just won the Republican primaries.|$|E
40|$|For generations, {{country clubs}} and the Professional Golf Association (PGA) Tour {{featured}} white golfers crossing manicured fairways, followed by black <b>caddies</b> carrying their bags. Now most clubs rely on golf carts; and pros on the PGA Tour are attended by highly paid white <b>caddies.</b> The {{transformation of the}} golf world has mirrored larger shifts in the American workplace, in which the increased status and increased earnings of skilled work have been accompanied by a de facto “push out” of black workers. In the 1960 s, the Professional Golf Association (PGA) Tour began being more popular and more profitable. Many observers credit this development during this period to Arnold Palmer’s charismatic, swashbuckling style of play and {{to the growth of}} televised golf. The increased popularity of the sport involved wide scale marketing of golf’s big three – Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. By end of the 1960 s, Lee Trevino was added to the mix, making the big four. Golf caddying was becoming a respected profession, as the <b>caddies</b> for the big four became famous in their own right. These <b>caddies</b> were Ernest “Creamy” Carolan, Angelo Argea, Afred “Rabbit” Dyer, and Herman Mitchell, <b>caddies</b> respectively for Palmer, Nicklaus, Player, and Trevino. Since at the time most <b>caddies</b> were black, {{it is not surprising that}} two of the four – Dyer and Mitchell – were African American. The 1960 s and 1970 s launched the glory years for caddying, as <b>caddies</b> benefited from the increasing popularity and hence increasing money prizes available in professional tournament golf. In fact, Alfred Dyer, Gary Player’s caddy, was able to send a son to Princeton University (Sailor 2003), a financial feat unheard of among <b>caddies</b> before the 1960 s. However, as the status of <b>caddies</b> increased, the presence of African American <b>caddies</b> steadily decreased...|$|R
5000|$|The Masters {{requires}} <b>caddies</b> to wear {{a uniform}} consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes. The surname, and sometimes first initial, of each player is found {{on the back of}} his <b>caddie's</b> uniform. The defending champion always receives caddy number [...] "1": other golfers get their caddy numbers from the order in which they register for the tournament. The other majors and some PGA Tour events formerly had a similar policy concerning <b>caddies</b> well into the 1970s; the U.S. Open first allowed players to use their own <b>caddies</b> in 1976.|$|R
50|$|After caddy Garland Dempsey {{collapsed}} at the Western Open {{in early}} July, the PGA Tour allowed male <b>caddies,</b> on a trial basis, to wear shorts on extremely hot days. Two years earlier, the USGA changed its policy and allowed <b>caddies</b> to wear shorts at the U.S. Open in June 1997. The shorts dispute had surfaced at the PGA Championship in August 1996 as a gender equity issue, as female <b>caddies</b> {{were allowed to}} wear them, but not males.|$|R
5|$|John F. Tierney {{was born}} September 18, 1951, in Salem, Massachusetts. His mother, Doris H. (née Gelineau) Tierney, was a Salem native who worked a split {{shift at the}} New England Telephone Company, where she {{remained}} for 42 years. His father, Albert R. Tierney, was a bookkeeper for Nabisco and a local fuel company. Tierney {{was one of three}} children, along with his brother Michael A. and sister Catherine. His father was of Irish descent and his mother was of half French-Canadian and half Irish ancestry. He moved with his family to his grandmother's home when he was five years old. He began working at the Kernwood Country Club in Salem as a <b>caddie</b> when he was 8 and soon adopted a paper route. He later attended Salem High School. When he was young, Tierney campaigned for his uncle, a Peabody ward councilor, and he ascribes his political interest in part to this experience.|$|E

50|$|Female <b>caddies</b> are permitted. Most of {{them are}} {{professional}} golfers' regular <b>caddies,</b> such as Fanny Sunesson.

The first female caddy at Augusta was George Archer's daughter Elizabeth in 1983, her 21st event carrying the bag for her father. Archer, the 1969 champion, tied for twelfth for one of his better finishes at Augusta.|$|R
5000|$|Many clubs use {{a ranking}} system. Caddies will {{start as a}} trainee, and be {{promoted}} {{through the ranks of}} Intermediate, Captain, Honor, and finally Championship. Many courses start their <b>caddies</b> off at the B level, and after a year move them to A, and on their fourth year (if they have earned it), they will receive the title of Honor caddy. The intermediate and captain ranks can usually be obtained within the first year of caddying, and the honor rank is usually obtained in the second or third year of caddying. Championship takes at least 6 years and often as many as 10 years to obtain. An alternative ranking system often used in the American Mid-West proceeds as B level, A level, AA level, Honor level, and Evans Scholar. Caddies often obtain a promotion in rank once a year, while often Honor takes two years to achieve and Evans Scholars are only produced by winning the venerable Evans Scholarship for university. However, in many American clubs, <b>caddies</b> are divided simply between [...] "B" [...] <b>caddies</b> (usually younger, less experienced <b>caddies</b> who often carry only one bag), and [...] "A" [...] <b>caddies</b> (usually older, more experienced <b>caddies</b> who almost always carry two bags).|$|R
