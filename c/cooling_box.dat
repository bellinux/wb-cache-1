After traveling to Lake Victoria, which many people think {{is the source of the}} River Nile, the boys noticed, that Lake Victoria is fed by several rivers that come from different locations. After a look on the map, the three found some other lakes further south which could be the source of the Nile. So they started their long drive south. After sleeping in a really poor hotel the boys decided to convert their cars into [...] "mobile homes". Hammond installed a little kitchen, Jeremy a <b>cooling</b> <b>box</b> full of beer, and a toilet on the outside of his car, and James a little workshop complete with tools. All of them also installed some sort of bed. After a long drive through Africa, which showed that Hammond made a clever choice with his all wheel drive Subaru in view of all those dirt tracks, and several [...] "modifications" [...] (the guys were stealing bits from each other's cars to modify their own car) the boys were getting closer. Whilst driving over some rough dirt tracks the cars suffered a lot. There were several punctures and Hammond broke his wishbone on the passenger's side. During the night, he was able to fix it so they could finish their journey together. But the Producers then told them, that only one could find the [...] "Source of the river Nile" [...] and so only one could find his name in the history books. This meant a final race between the three. Even though Hammond was making the best progress on the rough roads and dirt tracks thanks to his AWD Subaru, May was the first to find the true source of the river Nile which made him the winner.

40|$|End-stage liver {{diseases}} are nowadays effectively treated by transplantation {{of the affected}} liver. The transplantation procedure includes procurement of the liver from the donor and subsequently transport of the liver from donor to receiving patient (Chapter 1). To bridge the timespan of transport between donor operation and actual implantation of the organ in the receiving patient, the liver has to be optimally stored and preserved {{in order to maintain}} viability of the organ. To date, the conventional method of preservation is the Cold Storage (CS) preservation technique. The CS method implies a single flush of the liver in situ with an ice-cold preservation solution to wash-out remaining blood and immediately cool the organ. Subsequently, the liver is stored in a plastic bag containing cold preservation solution and transported in a <b>cooling</b> <b>box</b> filled with melting ice to maintain a lowered metabolism during hypothermia (0 - 4 ±C). The University of Wisconsin cold storage (UW-CS) solution is nowadays the golden standard in preservation solutions. Although CS preservation shows good results in preserving livers from brain-dead donors, who have an intact circulation, expansion of the donor pool with an important potential group of non-heart-beating donors (NHBDs), after cardiac arrest, requires improved preservation techniques. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is a dynamic preservation method that actively perfuses the liver. With HMP a continuous supply of oxygen and removal of waste products is obtained which improves preservation outcome. Especially marginal, older and NHB donor livers will benefit from this improved quality. The aim of this thesis was to develop a hypothermic machine perfusion system which is able to optimally preserve donor livers. ...|$|E

40|$|Moisture {{transport}} {{processes in}} wood {{have become increasingly}} important with the growing use of wood as construction material. This thesis deals with two key processes: capillary suction and nonisothermal diffusion. In the study on capillary suction, several methods were used. In the main study, sticks from pine sapwood and heartwood of different lengths (100 - 400 mm) were placed with the end grain in water. After 1000 hours and 1900 hours of exposure, the moisture content (MC) distribution in each stick was determined. The results from the main study, regarding the sapwood sticks, were peculiar. For the short sticks (100 mm), the MC distributions started out high in the bottom parts and decreased as expected toward the middle. But from the middle to the top, the MC/ increased/. The longer sticks (200 and 300 mm) showed a similar strange behaviour. The penomenon was seen for both exposure times. In the longest sticks (400 mm), this behaviour was not seen. These results show a very non-Fickian nature. In the transient flow, which gradually approached steady-state, MC gradients developed with the flow going/ from a// low MC to a higher MC/ in the upper parts of the samples. It is from this clear that when dealing with capillary suction, a Fickian approach on the macro scale may be inadequate. An explanation on the fiber level is proposed, where the anomalous behaviour is explained by water penetrating some flow channels, being spread laterally on the top surface and then sucked back into unfilled fibers. In the nonisothermal studies, a new method was developed using samples pre-conditioned to high or low MC to avoid hysteresis. Six series of diffusion cups were mounted in the lid of a <b>cooling</b> <b>box</b> that {{was placed in a}} climate room, establishing temperature and moisture gradients over the samples. Simultaneously, other cups with matched samples were placed in the same room, only without the temperature gradient. At steady-state conditions, the moisture fluxes and the MC distributions of the samples ere determined. The temperature of the top and bottom surfaces of the samples was monitored. In the study, the applied boundary conditions resulted in pairs of isothermal and nonisothermal MC distributions and moisture fluxes. The results from the experiments were used in a two-term flux model to evaluate the moisture transport coefficients/// D_u / and/// D_Tu /. From experiments and mathematical derivations, it was shown that the moisture state variable can be chosen at will, none distinctively better than any other. Further, it was shown that two sets of measurements, isothermal and nonisothermal, are needed for an accurate evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. This {{dissertation}} {{involves the}} experimental and numerical analysis of heat transfer on a transonic high turning angle gas turbine blade, {{which has been}} performed on the supersonic cascade experimental facility at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), {{as part of the}} continuous research and development project run under ARMSCOR. Efforts have been made to keep constant maintenance on the experimental rig. This now functional rig was used to generate experimental results, which were used to validate numerical models created using the commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package of FLUENT. The facility at UKZN is a continuously running cascade system, which consists of a plenum run under vacuum pressure and houses a four-blade cascade. One of these SMR- 95 turbine blades is instrumented with thin-film gauges, which allow heat transfer measurement via a heat transfer analogy through electrical circuit boards. This blade is interchangeable with an instrumented blade with pressure tappings along its span for pressure distribution tests. This facility was used to validate flow measurements, and results compared to previous test data conducted on the rig, using two pressure transducers, a scanivalve and a data acquisition system with LabView software. The method of generating heat transfer measurement results involved pre-chilling the test blade in a <b>cooling</b> <b>box,</b> before rapidly plunging it directly into a hot-air stream. Re-instrumented and more sensitive thin-film gauges would react resistively according to the temperature change. The heat transfer coefficient distribution was calculated using LabView. The turbulence intensity at the inlet of the cascade was varied using a grid of rods of varying diameter. For 15 % turbulence intensity, there was a 16 % overall increase in heat transfer on the pressure side, and 25 % increase on the suction side. For 25. 5 % turbulence intensity, there was an overall increase of 23 % on the pressure side and 40 % on the suction side. The results compared favourably to that of previous results generated by Stieger (1998). The experimental results were used to validate and compare to the CFD model developed in FLUENT. Improvements were made with the meshes developed previously, and results obtained showed that the general trend of distribution was similar, although certain models varied in the correct prediction of magnitude. This research includes a comprehensive study of various methods of numerical heat transfer measurement techniques, which would be used to replace the current ageing electrical heat transfer analogue method used at UKZN...|$|E
40|$|The aim of optimalization the {{insemination}} doses {{production is}} to provide the highest fertilization ability of spermatozoa during the demanding proces of processing fresh semen and its subsequent cryopreservation. Temperature changes causes spermatozoa damage during the cooling and freezing. Spermatozoa is exposed to cold shock and many others limiting factors, which leads to cell death and therefore to decline of fertilization ability of thawed insemination doses. For increasing spermatozoa resistance, exactly the plasma membrane resistance against cold shock was fraction of egg yolk LDL cholesterol (low density lipoprotein) at various concentrations into the comercially produced diluents added. It is believed that LDL acts possitively to plasma membrane and helps to maintain the fertilization ability of spermatozoa after thawing. Following step in the proces of insemination doses production is slow cooling of diluted semen and equilibration, when the straws are store at <b>cooling</b> <b>box</b> for 30 minutes to 240 hours. This period is necessary to penetrate of certain diluent components into the spermatazoa also maintain the balance between their intracellular and extracellular concentration. Also important is subsequent freezing temperature gradient of insemination doses. The most suitable freezing method is based on computer controlled temperature decline in freezing chamber which allows the precise control of ice crystals formation that could tear and kill the cell. During 2012 to 2016 was repeatedly collected semen from the group of breeding bulls (n = 27, Holstein and Czech Fleckvieh breed) at AI centre. Semen which fulfill the standard entrance conditions in first step was evenly into several parts divided. For dilution {{the three types of}} comercially diluents AndroMed, Bioxcell and Triladyl with and without LDL addition were used. Into the diluents AndroMed and Bioxcell the concentration of LDL 4 %, 6 % and 8 % into the dilent Triladyl 6 %, 8 % and 10 % was added. Diluted semen was filled into the glass capillares with volume 0, 1 ml and temperature + 4 °C. Subsequently the sample was placed to cold bath (0 °C) for 10 minutes. Then the volume of capillare with physiological solution (37 °C) was mixed and for next 120 minutes was incubate. The effect of cold shock to proportion of live spermatozoa was evaluated by using Eosin and Nigrosine staining technique during heat test of spermatozoa survivability after spermatozoa heating and after 120 minutes of incubation. The more suitable semen diluents which provide the higher spermatozoa resistance against cold shock were AndroMed and Bioxcell. Together the possitive effect of LDL addition into the diluents to lower decrease of proportion of live spermatozoa during heat test was found (P< 0. 05). The most suitable LDL concentration which had a favorable influence at spermatozoa resistance against cold shock was 6 % in diluent Bioxcell. Values of the proportion of live sperm were higher {{at the beginning of the}} heat test (+ 1. 31 % to + 3. 2 %) and after 120 minute incubation (+ 5. 82 % to + 8. 41 %) compared to other diluents with and without addition of LDL. In the next step the process of equilibration was optimized, is an important part of insemination doses production. The effect of the length of equilibration for subsequent fertilization ability of spermatozoa was evaluated using spermatozoa motility based of CASA and proportion of live spermatozoa after thawing and during heat survival test lasting 120 minutes (37 ° C). Suitable semen was diluted by comercially used diluent AndroMed based on soya lecithin, filled into the straws (0. 25 ml), cooled and equilibrated in <b>cooling</b> <b>box</b> for 30, 120 and 240 minutes and freezed in programmable freezing box applying four types of freezing curves differing in temperature rate decline. There was used standard and by producer recommended 3. phase freezing curve, then 2. phase freezing curve, and 3. phase freezing curve with slower as well as rapid decline of temperature rate in freezing chamber, compared with standard freezing curve. The highest spermatozoa motility was found using 240 minutes of equilibration by + 2. 72 % and + 4. 58 % compared to other lengths of equilibration (P < 0. 05 to 0. 01). The highest proportion of live spermatozoa was found using 120 minutes of equilibration (+ 6. 87 % and + 8. 68 %). The highest average spermatozoa motility during heat test after thawing was achieved by using 2. phase freezing curve (from + 2. 97 % to + 10. 37 %, P < 0. 05), also in the proportion of live spermatozoa (from + 4. 37 % to + 8. 82 %, P < 0. 01). When evaluating interaction between the length of equilibration and freezing curve (standard 3. phase and 2. phase freezing curve), the highest average spermatozoa motility and proportion of live spermatozoa using 240 minutes of equilibration by both freezing curves was reached, there was no statistically significant differences. As well as, in all evaluated parts of this study the individual differences between ejaculate of bulls and within semen from one bull (P < 0. 05) as secondary effect were found. To maintain good fertilization ability of semen during cryopreservation is necessary to increase the spermatozoa resistance against cold shock using addition of correct concentration of LDL into the commercially used diluents AndroMed and Bioxcell. Subsequently the fertilization ability of insemination dose is influenced by cooling, the length of equilibration and freezing. The length of equilibration 120 minutes and more as well as gentle way of freezing according to freezing curve, which ensures a gradual decrease of temperature in freezing chamber provided the higher average spermatozoa motility and proportion of live spermatozoa...|$|E
40|$|Evaporative cooling systems using a {{combination}} of evaporative pads and extractor fans require greenhouses to be hermetic. The greatest concentration of greenhouses in the world is located in southeast Spain, but these tend not to be hermetic structures and consequently can only rely on fogging systems as evaporative cooling techniques. Evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>boxes</b> provide an alternative to such systems. Using a low-speed wind tunnel, the present work has compared the performance of this system with four pads of differing geometry and thickness manufactured by two different companies. The results obtained show that the plastic packing in the cooling unit produces a pressure drop of 11. 05 Pa at 2 m·s− 1, which is between 51. 27 % and 94. 87 % lower than that produced by the cellulose pads. This pressure drop was not influenced by increases in the water flow. The evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>boxes</b> presented greater saturation efficiency at the same flow, namely 82. 63 %, as opposed to an average figure of 65 % for the cellulose pads; and also had a lower specific consumption of water, at around 3. 05 L·h− 1 ·m− 2 ·°C− 1. Consequently, we conclude that evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>boxes</b> are a good option for cooling non-hermetic greenhouses such as those most frequently used in the Mediterranean basin.

40|$|There {{are many}} changes in fruit quality during its {{ripening}} and storage. The following four apple varieties were studied: Champion, Glostr, Golden Delicious and Idaret. Amount of reducing sugars, {{total amount of}} sugars, quantities of acids, refractive solids and loss of starch were monitored. The changes of parameters, {{the differences between the}} varieties and differences in storage were compared. Parameters were monitored from mid-August 2008, when the apples ripened. After the harvest, apples were stored in a <b>cool</b> <b>box</b> at 2 - 3 ° C and at room temperature 20 - 23 ° C. Apples stored in the <b>cool</b> <b>box</b> were analyzed till the end of March 2009, and apples stored at room temperature until the beginning of January 2009. Total quantity of sugars in all varieties increases before harvest, while it decreases after picking the apples. The quantity of reducing sugars in apples rises gradually and after their picking it falls significantly in apples stored at 20 - 23 ° C. In apples stored in the <b>cool</b> <b>box</b> it continues rising until the end of November, and then it also decreases. Losses of starch are considerable and they are accelerated after the harvest. The quantity of acids also decreases throughout and amounts of refractive solids increases. For all varieties there are significant changes in storage at 20 - 23 ° C. Temperature, therefore, significantly affects processing of sugars and acids in fruit respiration...|$|R
