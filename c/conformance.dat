5|$|Because Acid2 {{is not a}} {{comprehensive}} test, it does not guarantee total <b>conformance</b> to any particular standard. A variant of the Acid2 test that does not test for data URI support is also available from the Web Standards Project.|$|E
5|$|COBOL 2002 {{suffered}} from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard. Micro Focus {{found that it}} was {{due to a lack of}} user demand for the new features and due to the abolition of the NIST test suite, which had been used to test compiler <b>conformance.</b> The standardization process was also found to be slow and under-resourced.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1995, Israeli troops {{withdrew from}} Bethlehem, {{and three days}} later the city came under the {{complete}} administration and military control of the Palestinian National Authority in <b>conformance</b> with the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Neither USB 1.0 nor 1.1 {{specified}} {{a design}} for any connector {{smaller than the}} standard type A or type B. Though many designs for a miniaturised type B connector appeared on many peripheral devices, <b>conformance</b> to the USB 1.x standard was fudged by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors {{as though they had}} a tethered connection (that is: no plug or socket at the peripheral end). There was no known miniature type A connector until USB 2.0 (rev 1.01) introduced one.|$|E
5|$|This {{rendition}} {{is fraught}} with many errors but the basic story line seems to fit the modern consensus. Father Queroz’s time line is also anachronistic. The Aryacakravarti dynasty came to power long before the ascendancy of the Madurai Nayaks {{as well as the}} Brahmins of Rameswaram had established a temple even longer before. Also the Gujarati origin of the Kings paternal line also in not in <b>conformance</b> with native claims of origin from the city of Varanasi which is in today's Uttar Pradesh not in the historical Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|Windle set {{world records}} in the 200m and 220yd {{freestyle}} in 1963, posting times of 2min 0.3s and 2min 1.1s respectively. He won three individual titles at the 1964 Australian Championships, the 200m, 400m and 1500m freestyle in times of 2min 0.0s, 4min 17.6s and 17min 9.4s respectively. As it was an Olympic year, the competition was held over metric distances, in <b>conformance</b> with Olympic standards. Windle {{was a member of}} all three New South Wales relay teams as they swept the relay events, winning the 400m and 800m freestyle and 400m medley relays.|$|E
5|$|With Jesse Beams {{from the}} University of Virginia, Lawrence {{continued}} {{to research the}} photoelectric effect. They showed that photoelectrons appeared within 2 x 10−9 seconds of the photons striking the photoelectric surface—close to the limit of measurement at the time. Reducing the emission time by switching the light source on and off rapidly made the spectrum of energy emitted broader, in <b>conformance</b> with Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.|$|E
25|$|Organizations can be {{certified}} for their <b>conformance</b> {{to the standard}} through the Open Group's Trusted Technology Provider Accreditation Program. <b>Conformance</b> to the standard is assessed by Recognized third party Assessors. Once an organization has been successfully assessed as conforming to the standard then the organization is publicly listed in the Open Group's Accreditation Register. The third party assessment process is governed by the Accreditation Policy and Assessment Procedures.|$|E
25|$|The O-TTPS Accreditation Program {{began in}} February 2014. IBM {{was the first}} company to achieve {{accreditation}} for <b>conformance</b> to the standard.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} ensure global {{interoperability}} of products, several organizations have set up additional standards for RFID testing. These standards include <b>conformance,</b> performance and interoperability tests.|$|E
25|$|CSS level 1 {{is fully}} supported. CSS level 2 is mostly supported, however several {{rendering}} bugs and regressions may affect <b>conformance.</b> CSS level 3 is partially supported.|$|E

25|$|The Latin text {{below is}} taken from the Requiem Mass in the 1962 Roman Missal. The first English version below, {{translated}} by William Josiah Irons in 1849, albeit from a slightly different Latin text, replicates the rhyme and metre of the original. This translation, edited for more <b>conformance</b> to the official Latin, is approved by the Catholic Church for use as the funeral Mass sequence in the liturgy of the Anglican ordinariate. The second English version is a more formal equivalence translation.|$|E
25|$|Even {{when the}} {{original}} client PXE firmware has been written by Intel and always provided at no cost as a linkable IA32 object code format module included in their Product Development Kit (PDK), the open source world has produced over the years non-standard derivative projects like gPXE/iPXE offering their own ROMs. While Intel based ROMs have always been rock solid implementing the client side of the PXE standard some people were willing to trade extra features for stability and PXE standard <b>conformance.</b>|$|E
25|$|In ObjC, {{and most}} other {{languages}} implementing the protocol concept, {{it is up to}} the programmer to ensure that the required methods are implemented in each class. Swift adds the ability to add these methods using extensions, and to use generic programming (generics) to implement them. Combined, these allow protocols to be written once and support a wide variety of instances. Also, the extension mechanism can be used to add protocol <b>conformance</b> to an object that does not list that protocol in its definition.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} his sacred music varies from simple homophony, {{designed}} for absolute clarity of textual expression in <b>conformance</b> with {{the dictates of}} the Council of Trent (as Mantua was a center of the Counter-Reformation, {{this was to be}} expected), to motet settings similar in expressive intensity to his madrigals including passages of surprising chromaticism not unlike that of Gesualdo. This is particularly true in the 1581 collections: Ascendente Jesu, for example, contains colorful examples of text-painting such as he used in the works he was composing for the Ferrarese court at the time.|$|E
25|$|The tower remained, {{its lower}} flight removed in 1993 to prevent public access. Hikers {{continued}} to climb {{it for the}} views from the steps, {{but it was no}} longer maintained and subject to deterioration. In 1990 George Profous, a DEC forester, wrote in a draft planning document that the Red Hill tower, one of the five left in the Catskill Park along with Balsam Lake, should be dismantled as no longer in <b>conformance</b> with state management guidelines for Forest Preserve lands. He hoped that public opposition would emerge and save the remaining towers, which it did.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Hopper {{advocated}} for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases {{located on the}} network. She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL. The Navy tests for <b>conformance</b> to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).|$|E
25|$|This {{work has}} been avoided in some {{discourse}} on Beuys {{because he has been}} put in artistically sacrosanct position and this is not in <b>conformance</b> with Beuys' other work. In choosing to do a piece in the form of popular music, Beuys demonstrated a commitment to his views and the most expansive ways of having them reach people. While it is easy to resist and ridicule Beuys' efforts in the pop arena, it does not change {{the fact that this is}} an important part of his collected works that needs to be acknowledged to better understand his scope, intention and own views of art.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the native computer software, there are online JavaScript IDEs, debugging aids that are themselves written in JavaScript and built to run on the Web. An example is the program JSLint, developed by Douglas Crockford {{who has written extensively}} on the language. JSLint scans JavaScript code for <b>conformance</b> to a set of standards and guidelines. Many libraries for JavaScript, such as three.js, provide links to demonstration code that can be edited by users. They are also used as a pedagogical tool by institutions such as Khan Academy to allow students to experience writing code in an environment where they can see the output of their programs, without needing any setup beyond a Web browser.|$|E
25|$|Software {{functional}} {{quality is}} defined as <b>conformance</b> to explicitly stated functional requirements, identified for example using Voice of the Customer analysis (part of the Design for Six Sigma toolkit and/or documented through use cases) {{and the level of}} satisfaction experienced by end-users. The latter is referred as to as usability and is concerned with how intuitive and responsive the user interface is, how easily simple and complex operations can be performed, and how useful error messages are. Typically, software testing practices and tools ensure that a piece of software behaves in compliance with the original design, planned user experience and desired testability, i.e. a piece of software's disposition to support acceptance criteria.|$|E

25|$|In 1893, Congress {{passed a}} law mandating that {{existing}} streets must be changed or moved {{in order to be}} in conformity with the District's street plan. Some property owners were upset that their private property would need to be seized without compensation in order to move streets in <b>conformance</b> with the street plan. The Supreme Court agreed, striking down the law as unconstitutional. In 1893, Congress mandated a new system of highways within the District that conformed to the City of Washington's street plan but left existing streets in place. A separate act of Congress in 1895 required that the street names in Georgetown be changed to conform to the street naming system used in the City of Washington. However, the old street names were shown on maps as late as 1899.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015, Republican State Senator Jill Holtzman Vogel of Winchester and Democratic State Senator Louise Lucas of Portsmouth {{sponsored}} a Senate Joint Resolution to establish additional {{criteria for the}} Virginia Redistricting Commission of four identified members of political parties, and three other independent public officials. The criteria began with respecting existing political boundaries, such as cities and towns, counties and magisterial districts, election districts and voting precincts. Districts are to be established {{on the basis of}} population, in <b>conformance</b> with federal and state laws and court cases, including those addressing racial fairness. The territory is to be contiguous and compact, without oddly shaped boundaries. The commission is prohibited from using political data or election results to favor either political party or incumbent. It passed with a two-thirds majority of 27 to 12 in the Senate, and was referred to committee in the House of Delegates.|$|E
25|$|Both states filed {{bills of}} equity with the Supreme Court in 1852, and after more {{surveying}} and negotiation, a decree was issued on December 16, 1861. On March 1, 1862, when the Supreme Court ruling became effective, {{the western part}} of Old Seekonk (all of which was on the eastern shore of the Blackstone River) was ceded by Massachusetts and incorporated as East Providence, Rhode Island. Part of North Providence, Rhode Island was also combined with the former Pawtucket, Massachusetts and a sliver of Seekonk to form the modern Pawtucket, Rhode Island. A small amount of land was also added to Westport, Massachusetts. The southern boundary of Fall River, Massachusetts was moved from Columbia Street to State Avenue, expanding its territory. The Supreme Court made these adjustments not in <b>conformance</b> with King George's instructions, but to unify the thickly settled areas of Pawtucket and Fall River under the jurisdiction of a single state.|$|E
25|$|The {{slope of}} the inner trench slope of an accretionary {{convergent}} margin reflects continuous adjustments to the thickness and width of the accretionary prism. The prism maintains a ‘critical taper’, established in <b>conformance</b> with Mohr–Coulomb theory, with slope determined by the material properties of the sediments. A package of sediments scraped off the downgoing lithospheric plate deforms until it and the accretionary prism {{that it has been}} added to attain the maximum slope supported by the sediments. Once this critical taper is attained, the wedge slides stably along its basal décollement. Strain rate and hydrologic properties also influence the strength of the accretionary prism and the angle of critical taper. Fluid pore pressures modify rock strength. Low permeability and rapid convergence may result in pore pressures that exceed lithostatic pressure and thus a relatively weak accretionary prism with a shallowly tapered geometry, whereas high permeability and slow convergence result in lower pore pressure, stronger prisms, and steeper geometry.|$|E
25|$|The Peruvian Constitution {{establishes}} {{equal protection}} for {{domestic and foreign}} investors who may enter into agreements with the Government and guarantees free access, possession, and disposal of foreign currency. Hydrocarbon Law No. 26844 of May 1997 eliminated the exclusive rights of the state-owned Petróleos del Perú S.A. to control the secondary recovery of crude oil, refining, and imports and subsequent resale of petroleum and byproducts. The Peruvian laws have attempted to ensure more-favorable minerals and crude {{oil and gas exploration}} and production contract terms for investors. Legal procedures to obtain mining rights were made easier by the enactment of complementary legislation Supreme Decree No. 018 of July 9, 1992. The Government relinquished exclusive control over exploration, mining, smelting, and refining of metals and fuel minerals. Individuals and private companies are allowed to hold mining permits in Peru. In the legal framework for investment and taxation, no distinction is made among domestic and foreign investors, corporations, joint ventures, and consortia formed in Peru or abroad. Municipalities and Regional governments in areas where mineral resources (metals and industrial minerals) are exploited will receive 50% of the taxes collected to be invested in education and social programs (health, housing, and others) in <b>conformance</b> with the Canon Minero (Ministry Resolution No. 266-2002-EF/15 of May 1, 2002). The remittance of dividends, depreciation, and royalties abroad has no restrictions. Contracts can be signed by investors, and the Government guarantees the stability of legal commitments and taxes. To increase protection of investors’ interests, Peru signed agreements with the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in April 1991, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25312 and with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in December 2002, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25809.|$|E
