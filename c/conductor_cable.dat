25|$|Some CFLs will flash {{every few}} seconds even when the room light switch is off. This caused by {{a small amount of}} current {{bypassing}} the switch either through a switch pilot light or through the capacitance of the two <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> connected between the switch and the CFL or the capacitance between this cable and other mains wiring. A few tens of microamps of current is enough to charge the storage in the CFL power supply up to a voltage sufficient for the CFL to light briefly, discharging the storage and starting the process again.|$|E

50|$|A {{traction}} current pylon is a railroad pylon carrying {{at least one}} circuit for {{traction current}}. In Germany, traction current lines with two systems (4 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables)</b> typically have a single level arrangement of the <b>conductor</b> <b>cables.</b> For traction current lines with four systems (8 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables),</b> the two-level arrangement (4 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> on each crossbar) is frequently used, except for traction current lines supplying high-speed railway lines are used. For these lines a three-level arrangement is used, in which the lowest cross bar has four <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> {{and each of the}} two highest cross bars have two <b>conductor</b> <b>cables.</b> The three-level arrangement is also used for traction current pylons with 6 electric circuits (12 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables).</b> For the supply of rapid-transit railways operated with alternating current, some overhead line pylons have cross bars for traction current lines above the contact wire. Other pylons carry electric circuits for traction current and also for three-phase alternating current.|$|R
50|$|Traction current {{lines are}} not usually laid {{parallel}} to the railway line, so as to minimise the line length and to avoid unnecessary influences of electrical system near the railway line. However, there are cases where this practice is not followed (for example, the current supply of some rapid-transit railways operating with alternating current in Germany). In this case, the traction current line is laid on special cross beams of the overhead wire pylons above the overhead line. Because overhead line pylons possess a smaller cross section than traction current masts, these cross beams have to be quite narrow, so the arrangement of four <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> in one level, which is standard at traction current lines, cannot be used. Where four conductors are needed, one approach is to employ a two-level arrangement of <b>conductor</b> <b>cables.</b> Alternatively, in cases of double-tracked railway lines, the overhead line pylons for both driving directions are equipped with cross beams for the traction current system (two <b>conductor</b> <b>cables).</b>|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} {{to lay out the}} traction current supply on special cross beams right on the overhead wire pylons above the catenary wire. Because the overhead line pylons have a smaller cross section than traction current supply masts, the cross beams cannot be too wide, so the standard arrangement of four <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> in one level cannot be used. In this case, a two-level arrangement is used, or with two electric circuits for double-railed lines the overhead line pylons for both directions are equipped with cross beams for their own traction current system of two <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> each.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> {{was laid}} {{in a trench}} between the rails. At [...] {{intervals}} a box was fitted between the rails that contained a stud (which protruded about [...] above the road) and a bell crank. A magnet on a passing tram attracted this crank which then moved to make contact between the <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> and stud; once the tram moved away the crank dropped away and the stud was no longer connected to the cable. A long skate was suspended beneath each tramcar which was magnetised by electro-magnets and so both operated the cranks and collected the current that both moved the tram car and powered the electro-magnets. A small battery was carried to charge the electro-magnets should the power be interrupted. The negative return current passed through the rails.|$|E

2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high ground conductivity. If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) <b>conductor,</b> <b>cable</b> radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [...] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.|$|E
