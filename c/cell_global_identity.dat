30|$|Handover {{measurements}} {{in mobile}} communications systems, i.e. measurements that are performed by UEs on neighbouring cells {{while they are}} connected to a serving cell, are typically related to the so-called Physical Cell ID (PCI) of a neighbour cell. PCIs are tightly coupled to the used radio technology and are relatively easy to detect (which is important so that such measurements do not unnecessarily interrupt the ongoing communication in the serving cell). Such PCIs are however never unique, i.e. the actual <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> of the <b>cell</b> (which is, e.g. needed to organise the handover within the network) cannot be directly derived from a PCI. Therefore, the network needs a mapping table which depending on the geographic location of a cell provides a mapping between measured PCIs and global identifiers of the neighbouring cells. The ANR function in LTE [25] automates the creation and maintenance of such mapping tables and frees the operator from this relatively trivial and cumbersome task. This is achieved by asking UEs to retrieve and report the <b>global</b> <b>cell</b> <b>identity</b> of neighbour cells in periods in which the UE has no data activity in the serving cell and therefore is able to temporarily abandon the serving cell {{to listen to the}} broadcasted system information of the neighbour cell (in which the <b>global</b> <b>cell</b> <b>identity</b> is contained). When an eNB has detected a new neighbour, it will not only update its internal mapping tables but will also establish a connection via the X 2 interface to the corresponding neighbour eNB which then enables exchange of information for other SON purposes like MRO and MLB. Furthermore, ANR provides the basis for self-configuration and self-optimisation of the PCI allocation to cells, i.e. PCI allocation (for new or already existing cells) can be adapted to the PCIs of the neighbour cells and to the PCIs of the neighbours of the neighbour cells.|$|R

Therefore, we hypothesized that higher levels of <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> would correlate with more positive sustainability-related attitudes and actions among adolescents. Public high school students (N = 152; mean ± standard deviation age = 15. 5 ± 0. 6 years) completed previously validated, self-report measures of <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> and sustainability-related attitudes and actions. Four randomly-selected classrooms of students (N= 76) also repeated the same measures 7 weeks later. The <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> measure demonstrated adequate internal consistency and moderate seven-week test-retest stability. As hypothesized, <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> was positively and statistically significantly correlated with reported importance of environmental sustainability attitudes and behaviors. <b>Global</b> <b>identity</b> also showed temporal precedence over the 7 weeks. The results suggest the potential usefulness of considering and measuring <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> as a factor promoting environmental sustainability-related attitudes and behaviors...|$|R

With the rigorous growth of cellular network many mobility datasets are available publically, which attracted researchers to study human mobility fall under spatio-temporal phenomenon. Mobility profile building is main task in spatio-temporal trend analysis {{which can be}} extracted from the location information available in the dataset. The location information is usually gathered through the GPS, service provider assisted faux GPS and <b>Cell</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Identity</b> (CGI). Because of high power consumption and extra resource installation requirement in GPS related methods, <b>Cell</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Identity</b> is most inexpensive method and readily available solution for location information. CGI location information is four set head i. e. Mobile country code (MCC), Mobile network code (MNC), Location area code (LAC) and Cell ID, location information is retrieved in form of longitude and latitude coordinates through any of publically available Cell Id databases e. g. Google location API using CGI. However due to of fast growth in GSM network, change in topology by the GSM service provider and technology shift toward 3 G exact spatial extraction is somehow a problem in it, so location extraction must dealt with spatial outlier's problem first for mobility building.

In the environment internet service provisioning cannot be expected executing in a single close organization [1]. Identity management in cross-organization becomes an issue for handling Internet service and distributive business process. The “identity ” in cross-organization web service is defined as <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> rather than private <b>identity</b> from client. <b>Global</b> <b>identity</b> searching table that registers all related service organization is the normal way we used to [2]. Through <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> searching table the target service organization can be looked up directly.

IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identification) registration in NP (Number Portability) Service [3], for instance. In NP Service each IMSI can be re-assigned to different mobile service provider if the IMSI apply the re-assignment. In the example about IMSI in NP service mentioned above, {{if there is an}} internet service will be executed according to identity management with IMSI, then it will be a challenge to find the organization for available IMSI in very short response time. To dynamically re-assign a IMSI in different mobile service provider, the traditional <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> searching table will not be practical due to frequently changing the registration of IMSI in different service provider.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial ful lment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyFemtocell is a small cellular base station used by operators to extend indoor service coverage and enhance overall network performance. In Long Term Evolution (LTE), femtocell works under macrocell coverage and combines with the macrocell to constitute the two-tier network. Compared to the traditional single-tier network, the two-tier scenario creates many new challenges, which lead to the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) implementing an automation technology called Self-Organising Network (SON) {{in order to achieve}} lower cost and enhanced network performance. This thesis focuses on the inbound and outbound handovers (handover between femtocell and macrocell); in detail, it provides suitable solutions for the intensity of femtocell handover prediction, Physical Cell Identity (PCI) allocation and handover triggering parameter optimisation. Moreover, those solutions are implemented in the structure of SON. In order to e ciently manage radio resource allocation, this research investigates the conventional UE-based prediction model and proposes a cell-based prediction model to predict the intensity of a femtocell's handover, which overcomes the drawbacks of the conventional models in the two-tier scenario. Then, the predictor is used in the proposed dynamic group PCI allocation approach in order {{to solve the problem of}} PCI allocation for the femtocells. In addition, based on SON, this approach is implemented in the structure of a centralised Automated Con guration of Physical Cell Identity (ACPCI). It overcomes the drawbacks of the conventional method by reducing inbound handover failure of <b>Cell</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Identity</b> (CGI). This thesis also tackles optimisation of the handover triggering parameters to minimise handover failure. A dynamic hysteresis-adjusting approach for each User Equipment (UE) is proposed, using received average Reference Signal-Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (RS-SINR) of the UE as a criterion. Furthermore, based on SON, this approach is implemented in the structure of hybrid Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO). It is able to off er the unique optimised hysteresis value to the individual UE in the network. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against existing methods, a System Level Simulation (SLS) tool, provided by the Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND) research group, is utilised, which models the structure of two-tier communication of LTE femtocell-based networks...|$|E

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} globalized world, global culture may constitute an alternative cultural resource, especially {{for members of}} ethnic minority groups who have often been described as marginalized in acculturation research. In the present study, we investigated the role that <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> may play for the self-concept and the psychological and sociocultural adaptation of ethnic minority members, especially those who score high on marginalization. We explored these relationships in 848 European Muslim minority members. Marginalized participants showed lower ethnic identity but the same or even stronger <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> compared with nonmarginalized participants. No difference in sociocultural adaptation was observed between nonmarginalized participants and marginalized individuals, when the latter expressed strong global identification. Moreover, in terms of ethnic discrimination, increasing one’s <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> was related to better psychological adaptation compared with increasing one’s ethnic identity, although coefficients remained small. Based on our results, we, in line with other researchers, argue for a reevaluation and differentiation of the concept “marginalization,” which has mostly been viewed in negative terms. Additional available cultural resources, such as <b>global</b> <b>identity,</b> may offset the negative relation between marginalization and adaptation and may mediate the effect of ethnic discrimination on psychological adaptation...|$|R

A total of 339 college students from two colleges in Belgium (Europe) completed both the Extended Objective Measure of Ego-Identity Status (EOM-EIS) and the Dellas Identity Status Inventory - Occupation, Religious Beliefs, Political Ideology (DISI-ORP). Four types of evidence argued in favour of domain-specific statuses (i. e. low convergence in identity status across domains, moderate convergence between <b>global</b> and domain-specific <b>identity</b> statuses, significant gender differences in domain-specific but not in <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> statuses, and significant associations between identity process and identity content in congruent but not in incongruent domains). In line with earlier research using identity status interviews, {{it was concluded that}} adolescent identity is not to be considered a unitary construct and the use of domain-specific identity statuses is recommended whenever possible. Theoretical implications of the findings are discussed in terms of adolescents' temporal spacing of identity concerns. Finally, the limitations of identity questionnaires (additive approach to <b>global</b> <b>identity</b> statuses) are pointed out.
