25|$|Staphylococcal {{resistance}} to penicillin is mediated by penicillinase (a form of β-lactamase) production: an enzyme that cleaves the β-lactam {{ring of the}} penicillin molecule, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. Penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotics, such as methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, <b>cloxacillin,</b> dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin, are able to resist degradation by staphylococcal penicillinase.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} with antibiotics taken by mouth, such as cephalexin, amoxicillin, or <b>cloxacillin.</b> In {{those who are}} seriously allergic to penicillin, erythromycin or clindamycin may be used. When methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a concern, doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may, in addition, be recommended. Concern {{is related to the}} presence of pus or previous MRSA infections. Elevating the infected area may be useful, as may pain killers.|$|E
2500|$|... β-Lactamase-resistant semisynthetic {{penicillins}} such as methicillin (and its successors, nafcillin and <b>cloxacillin)</b> {{were subsequently}} developed, which have better activity against non-MRSA staphylococci.|$|E
2500|$|Today, S. aureus {{has become}} {{resistant}} to many commonly used antibiotics. [...] In the UK, only 2% of all S. aureus isolates {{are sensitive to}} penicillin, with a similar picture {{in the rest of}} the world. The β-lactamase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, oxacillin, <b>cloxacillin,</b> and flucloxacillin) were developed to treat penicillin-resistant S. aureus, and are still used as first-line treatment. [...] Methicillin was the first antibiotic in this class to be used (it was introduced in 1959), but, only two years later, the first case of MRSA was reported in England.|$|E
2500|$|OXA beta-lactamases {{were long}} {{recognized}} as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze oxacillin and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d [...] The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and <b>cloxacillin</b> {{and the fact that}} they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae, the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in P. aeruginosa. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s to 1960s, Beecham, in consort with Bristol-Myers, {{developed}} penicillin derivatives: first phenethicillin, {{then the}} more potent methicillin (Celbenin). Later, these {{were followed by}} ampicillin, <b>cloxacillin</b> and others, as the group focused on pharmaceutical development.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cloxacillin</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes impetigo, cellulitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, and otitis externa. It is not effective for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It is used by mouth and by injection.|$|E
50|$|The {{first choice}} is {{amoxicillin}} with clavulanic acid, {{and if the}} person is penicillin-allergic, doxycycline and metronidazole. The antistaphylococcal penicillins (e.g., <b>cloxacillin,</b> nafcillin, flucloxacillin) and the macrolides (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) are not used for empirical therapy, because they do not cover Pasteurella species.|$|E
50|$|Side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and {{allergic}} reactions including anaphylaxis. Clostridium difficile diarrhea may also occur. It {{is not recommended}} in people who have previously had a penicillin allergy. Use during pregnancy appears to be relatively safe. <b>Cloxacillin</b> is in the penicillin family of medications.|$|E
50|$|It is Gram-negative, motile, and its {{rod-shaped}} {{cells are}} about 1 by 2 pm with rounded ends. Its metabolism is fermentative, and it produces catalase, oxidase, and arginine dihydrolase. It {{is susceptible to}} chlortetracycline, colistin sulfate, furazolidone, gentamicin, neomycin, nitrofurantoin, and tetracycline, but not to ampicillin, <b>cloxacillin,</b> novobiocin, or sulfafurazole.|$|E
50|$|It is semisynthetic and in {{the same}} class as penicillin. <b>Cloxacillin</b> is used against staphylococci that produce beta-lactamase, due to its large R chain, which does not allow the beta-lactamases to bind. This drug has a weaker {{antibacterial}} activity than benzylpenicillin, and is devoid of serious toxicity except for allergic reactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cloxacillin</b> was {{patented}} in 1960 {{and approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1965. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.16 USD per day for the pills. It is not commercially available in the United States.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a common}} side effect that can develop when other {{medications}} are used. This {{is the development of}} cross sensitivities to other antibiotics. If someone has developed side effects when taking penicillin, these side effects may develop with a new medication even though the person has not taken the new medication before. Those medications that may cause a cross sensitivity reaction are: carbapenems, ampicillin, cefazolin, cephalosporins and <b>cloxacillin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Oxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam. It {{is similar}} to methicillin, and has {{replaced}} methicillin in clinical use. Other related compounds are nafcillin, <b>cloxacillin,</b> dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin. Since it is resistant to penicillinase enzymes, such as that produced by Staphylococcus aureus, it is widely used clinically in the US to treat penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, with the introduction and widespread use of both oxacillin and methicillin, antibiotic-resistant strains called methicillin-resistant and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/ORSA) have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. MRSA/ORSA is treated using vancomycin.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{penicillins}} that face antimicrobial resistance due to β-lactamase, {{it is less}} active, can be administered only parenterally, and has a higher frequency of interstitial nephritis, an otherwise-rare adverse effect of penicillins. However, selection of meticillin depended {{on the outcome of}} susceptibility testing of the sampled infection, and since it is no longer produced, it is also not routinely tested for any more. It also served a purpose in the laboratory to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus to other penicillins facing β-lactam resistance; this role has now been passed on to other penicillins, namely <b>cloxacillin,</b> as well as genetic testing for the presence of mecA gene by PCR.|$|E
5000|$|Moraxella bovis is {{the cause}} of {{infectious}} bovine keratoconjunctivitis, known colloquially in the United Kingdom as New Forest eye. As a strict aerobe, M. bovis is confined to the cornea and conjunctiva, resulting in a progressive, nonself-limiting keratitis, ulceration, and - ultimately - rupture of the cornea. The disease is relatively common, infecting cattle only. Treatment is the use of either subconjunctival injection of a tetracycline, or topical application of <b>cloxacillin,</b> the former being more effective. The bacterium can be transmitted by flies, so fly control may be necessary on farms throughout the summer. Rupture of the eye is more serious, and requires immediate enucleation, though the procedure itself carries a good prognosis.|$|E
50|$|In E. coli multi-drug {{resistance}} develops from {{a variety}} of mechanisms. Particularly concerning is the ability of efflux mechanisms to confer broad band resistivity. RND efflux pumps provide extrusion for a range of compounds. Five protein transporters in E. coli cells that belong to the HAE-RND subfamily have been classified, including the multi-drug efflux protein AcrB, the outer membrane protein TolC and the periplasmic adaptor protein AcrA. The TolC and AcrA proteins are also utilized in the tripartite complex in other identified RND efflux proteins. The AcrAB-TolC efflux system is responsible for the efflux of antimicrobial drugs like penicillin G, <b>cloxacillin,</b> nafcillin, macrolides, novobiocin, linezolid, and fusidic acid antibiotics. Other substrates include dyes, detergents, some organic solvents, and steroid hormones. The ways in which the lipophilic domains of the substrate and the RND pumps is not completely defined.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "penam" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} the common core skeleton of a member of the penicillins. This core has the molecular formula R-C9H11N2O4S, where R is the variable side chain that differentiates the penicillins from one another. The penam core has a molecular weight of 243 g/mol, with larger penicillins having molecular weights near 450—for example, <b>cloxacillin</b> has a molecular weight of 436 g/mol. The key structural feature of the penicillins is the four-membered β-lactam ring; this structural moiety is essential for penicillin's antibacterial activity. The β-lactam ring is itself fused to a five-membered thiazolidine ring. The fusion of these two rings causes the β-lactam ring to be more reactive than monocyclic β-lactams because the two fused rings distort the β-lactam amide bond and therefore remove the resonance stabilisation normally found in these chemical bonds.|$|E

5000|$|Treatment of AIT {{involves}} antibiotic treatment. Based on {{the offending}} organism found on microscopic {{examination of the}} stained fine needle aspirate, the appropriate antibiotic treatment is determined. In {{the case of a}} severe infection, systemic antibiotics are necessary. [...] Empirical broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment provides preliminary coverage for a variety of bacteria, including S. aureus and S. pyogenes. [...] Antimicrobial options include penicillinase-resistant penicillins (ex: <b>cloxacillin,</b> dicloxacillin) or a combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. [...] However, in patients with a penicillin allergy, clindamycin or a macrolide can be prescribed. [...] The majority of anaerobic organisms involved with AIT are susceptible to penicillin. Certain Gram-negative bacilli (ex: Prevotella, Fusobacteria, and Porphyromonas) are exhibiting an increased resistance based on the production of beta-lactamase. [...] Patients who have undergone recent penicillin therapy have demonstrated an increase in beta-lactamase-producing (anaerobic and aerobic) bacteria. Clindamycin, or a combination of metronidazole and a macrolide, or a penicillin combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor is recommended in these cases. [...] Fungal thyroiditis can be treated with amphotericin B and fluconazole. [...] Early treatment of AIT prevents further complications. However, if antibiotic treatment does not manage the infection, surgical drainage is required. Symptoms or indications requiring drainage include continued fever, high white blood cell count, and continuing signs of localized inflammation. [...] The draining procedure is also based on clinical examination or ultrasound/CT scan results that indicate an abscess or gas formation. [...] Another treatment of AIT involves surgically removing the fistula. This treatment is often the option recommended for children. [...] However, in cases of an antibiotic resistant infection or necrotic tissue, a lobectomy is recommended. [...] If diagnosis and/or treatment is delayed, the disease could prove fatal.|$|E
40|$|Synergistic {{antibacterial}} {{effects of}} mixtures of ampicillin and <b>cloxacillin</b> and induced penicillinases were investigated in 48 strains of Proteus.

The 1 : 1 ampicillin-cloxacillin combination was synergistic against 13 of 17 P. morganii strains; the 2 : 1 combination was synergistic against only 9 strains. Penicillinases, demonstrated in all species except P. mirabilis, hydrolyzed penicillin G and cephalothin. Although only P. vulgaris hydrolyzed ampicillin, no species of Proteus hydrolyzed <b>cloxacillin</b> or the ampicillin-cloxacillin mixtures.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether half-udder intramammary infusion of <b>cloxacillin</b> results in transfer of <b>cloxacillin</b> from treated to untreated mammary gland quarters within nonlactating cows, and, if so, at what concentrations, and to {{determine whether}} selection of ipsilateral versus diagonal-contralateral quarters for treatment affects <b>cloxacillin</b> transfer among quarters. ANIMALS: 20 Holstein-Friesian cows from a dairy herd. PROCEDURES: A within-cow half-udder comparison trial was used in which 2 of 4 mammary gland quarters (ipsilaterally or diagonally) received an intramammary infusion of <b>cloxacillin</b> on day 1 of the nonlactating period. Three days later, milk samples were taken from all untreated quarters and high-pressure liquid chromatography was used to detect and quantify milk <b>cloxacillin</b> concentrations. RESULTS: <b>Cloxacillin</b> was detected in 25 % of all untreated mammary gland quarters. Mean <b>cloxacillin</b> concentration in untreated quarters was below minimum inhibitory concentrations for targeted mastitis pathogens. No significant difference in <b>cloxacillin</b> concentrations {{was found in the}} ipsilateral or diagonal treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Within-cow half-udder comparison trials are valid for antimicrobial trials in nonlactating cows, although transfer of antimicrobials does occur in trace concentrations. Ipsilateral or diagonal-contralateral treatment designs perform similarly. This type of design is economical for researchers, although care must be taken to account for within-cow clustering of mammary gland quarter data...|$|E
