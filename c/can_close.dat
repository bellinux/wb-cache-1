5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it <b>can</b> <b>close</b> its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{spend much}} of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They <b>can</b> <b>close</b> off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E
5|$|The Scotch bonnet is preyed upon by vertebrates, such as fish, and invertebrates, {{including}} crabs such as {{the blue}} crab and the Florida stone crab. Crabs can crush the snail's shell, eating the soft internal organs and muscle tissue. The snail's only defense mechanism against predation is to draw its body into the shell. By doing so, they <b>can</b> <b>close</b> the aperture using the operculum.|$|E

5|$|The body {{is divided}} into coeloms, {{compartments}} lined with mesothelium. The main body cavity, {{under the crown of}} tentacles, is called the metacoelom, and the tentacles and their base share the mesocoelom. Above the mouth is the epistome, a hollow lid which <b>can</b> <b>close</b> the mouth. The cavity in the epistome is sometimes called the protocoelom, although other authors disagree that it is a coelom and Ruppert, Fox and Barnes think it is built by a different process.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} {{displays}} numerous adaptations to its marine environment. The nostrils and small ears <b>can</b> <b>close.</b> The hind feet, which provide {{most of its}} propulsion in swimming, are long, broadly flattened, and fully webbed. The fifth digit on each hind foot is longest, facilitating swimming while on its back, but making walking difficult. The tail is fairly short, thick, slightly flattened, and muscular. The front paws are short with retractable claws, with tough pads on the palms that enable gripping slippery prey. The bones show osteosclerosis, increasing their density to reduce buoyancy.|$|E

25|$|Camels' mouths have a thick {{leathery}} lining, {{allowing them}} to chew thorny desert plants. Long eyelashes and ear hairs, together with nostrils that <b>can</b> <b>close,</b> form a barrier against sand. If sand gets lodged in their eyes, they can dislodge it using their transparent third eyelid. The camels' gait and widened feet help them move without sinking into the sand.|$|E
25|$|Unlike an option, {{both parties}} of a futures {{contract}} must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying {{asset to the}} buyer, or, {{if it is a}} cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures position <b>can</b> <b>close</b> out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss.|$|E
25|$|We risk {{erosion of}} First Amendment liberties unless we train our {{vigilance}} upon the methods whereby obscenity is condemned {{no less than}} upon the standards whereby it is judged. Questions of procedural safeguards loom large {{in the wake of}} an order such as the one before us. Among them are: (a) whether Congress <b>can</b> <b>close</b> the mails to obscenity by any means other than prosecution of its sender; (b) whether Congress, if it can authorize exclusion of mail, can provide that obscenity be determined in the first instance in any forum except a court, and (c) whether, even if Congress could so authorize administrative censorship, it has in fact conferred upon postal authorities any power to exclude matter from the mails upon their determination of its obscene character.|$|E

The answer to both questions is yes...|$|R
25|$|Telescopic {{fishing rods}} are {{designed}} to collapse down to a short length and open to a long rod. 20 or even 30ft rods <b>can</b> <b>close</b> to {{as little as a}} foot and a half. This makes the rods very easy to transport to remote areas or travel on buses, compact cars, or public buses and subways. Telescopic fishing rods are made from the same materials as conventional multi-piece rods. Graphite, carbon, and sometimes fibreglass, or composites of these materials, {{are designed to}} slip into each other so that they open and close. The eyes on the spinning rods are generally, but not always, a special design to aid in making the end of each section stronger. Various grade eyes available in conventional rods are also available in telescopic fishing rods. The eyeless Tenkara style rods are also of this type and are typically made from carbon and/or graphite.|$|E
25|$|All the storylines collide when Brad's house catches fire. While {{the fire}} trucks {{get stuck in}} a traffic jam, Tommy comes on his bicycle {{to put out the}} fire, which {{incidentally}} trapped Dawn inside. As he saves her life, the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Brad despairs at the destruction of his house, the symbol of his material success. Albert attains a sort of enlightenment when he synthesizes the two opposing outlooks of the Jaffes and Vauban to realize the cosmic truth of everything. Brad, meanwhile, is fired from Huckabees, leaving him rudderless. Albert reveals to Brad that he burned Brad's jet skis, and the fire spread to the house. Albert understands that he and Brad are no different, that everything really is inextricably connected, but that these connections necessarily arise from the often senselessly painful reality of human existence. Having realized this, he refers Brad to Caterine, hoping she will help him as she did Albert and Tommy. Albert and Tommy talk later about everything that has happened. As the two talk, Caterine and the Jaffes watch them, concluding that they <b>can</b> <b>close</b> both of their cases.|$|E
25|$|The player, {{who sits}} in an office, is {{given access to}} a network of {{security}} cameras throughout the facility to track {{the movement of the}} animatronics. Each character roams the restaurant and has distinct movement patterns, and most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The camera feeds are dimly lit and distorted, one of the rooms only contains an audio feed, and the cameras do not cover certain areas of the building, most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player. The player cannot leave the guard room, but <b>can</b> <b>close</b> the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics. Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and the lights go out. Once these things happen, the Toreador March will play, the screen will go pitch black, and the player will be jumpscared by Freddy, provided they do not reach {{the end of the night}} in the meantime. If the player is jumpscared by any of the animatronics, the game ends, and the player must restart from the beginning of the night.|$|E

500|$|Running {{through the}} head are two air passages.

[...] When the whale is submerged, it <b>can</b> <b>close</b> the blowhole, and air that passes through the phonic lips can circulate back to the lungs.
