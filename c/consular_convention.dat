The ruler decided to open a new page in Serbian foreign policy and arranged that a secret convention should be signed with the Habsburg Monarchy. Mijatović was gradually entrusted by the ruler to complete this task and on June 28, 1881 he signed the Secret Convention by which Serbia got the diplomatic and political backing of the Habsburg Empire but abandoned her independence in the field of Foreign Policy. When the two other most prominent members of the Cabinet, Prime Minister Piroćanac and Home Minister Garašanin learned about the exact contents of the Convention they decided to resign but had to accept the new reality in the end. In return Mijatović had to resign his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs and kept only his tenure at the Ministry of Finance. His last act as Minister of Foreign Affairs was to sign a <b>Consular</b> <b>Convention</b> and a Commercial Agreement with the United States of America on October 14. 1881. During talks that preceded the signing of the Secret Convention Mijatović was well received in Vienna by the Emperor Francis Joseph and other dignitaries of the Empire. The Emperor later decorated him with the first class of the Order of the Iron Crown, which entitled its bearer to become Austro-Hungarian count. Serbian citizens were banned by the Serbian constitution to accept any nobility titles. It is not clear if Mijatović ever officially submitted application to become an Austro-Hungarian count, yet he used this title openly since 1915, being the only Serb from the Kingdom of Serbia who did it.|$|E

On the 10th of September, 1857, a claims convention was concluded between the United States and the Republic of Granada. This convention is still in force, and has in part been executed. In May, 1858, the constitution of the republic was remodelled; and the nation assumed the political title of [...] "The Granadian Confederacy." [...] This fact was formally announced to this Government, but without any change in their representative here. Previously to the 4th day of March, 1861, a revolutionary war against the Republic of New Granada, which had thus been recognized and treated with by the United States, broke out in New Granada, assuming to set up a new government under the name of [...] "United States of Colombia." [...] This war has had various vicissitudes, sometimes favorable, sometimes adverse, to the revolutionary movements. The revolutionary organization has hitherto been simply a military provisionary power, and no definitive constitution of government has yet been established in New Granada in place of that organized by the constitution of 1858. The minister of the United States to the Granadian Confederacy, who was appointed on the 29th day of May, 1861, was directed, in view of the occupation of the capital by the revolutionary party and of the uncertainty of the civil war, not to present his credentials to either the government of the Granadian Confederacy or to the provisional military government, but to conduct his affairs informally, as is customary in such cases, and to report the progress of events and await the instructions of this Government. The advices which have been received from him have not hitherto, been sufficiently conclusive to determine me to recognize the revolutionary government.

In 1925 a Turkish consulate was opened in Vlorë, southern Albania and in 1926 a Turkish embassy was opened in Tirana, Albania and an Albanian ambassador was sent to Ankara. In 1929, prime minister Ahmet Zog declared and installed himself as king due to his concerns that republican governments were unstable to counter possible geopolitical threats of larger neighbours to Albanian sovereignty. The new regime was recognised by most countries while Turkey's republican leader Atatürk refused recognition due to hard won Turkish republicanism and condemned the Albanian move on grounds that it violated republican principles and went against {{the interests of the}} Albanian people. A crisis in bilateral relations between Tirana and Ankara occurred with most diplomatic staff recalled from Albanian consulates in Turkey and the Turkish embassy in Albania. Italy, friendly with Zog and increasingly influential in Albanian affairs under fascist leader Benito Mussolini along with Albania pressured Turkey to recognise the new monarchist regime. Attempted overtures by Albania were made to restore interstate relations with Turkey at various regional and other gatherings involving exchanges of letters and pleasantries invoking friendship and common interests of both countries by high ranking diplomatic staff. After previous agreements entered into were reinstated and others ratified by parliaments of both countries during 1933 state relations had been restored and conducted at an ambassadorial level. In 1936 a sister of Ahmet Zog married a son of former Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II and bilateral relations once again went into crisis after Turkey expressed its displeasure at the event by recalling its ambassador and Albania closed its embassy in Ankara claiming budgetary issues. With the Italian and later German occupation of Albania during the Second World War, the Turkish embassy remained closed while the consulate in Vlorë remained open until 1944 when Enver Hoxha, the Albanian communist leader (1944-1985) closed it down.|$|E

However, bilateral relations with Romaniabegan to improve in the early 1960s under Gheorghiu-Dej with the signing of an agreement providingfor partial settlement of Americanproperty claims.

Ceausescu’scalculated distancing of Romania fromthe Soviet foreign policy line, includingBucharest’s diplomatic recognition ofIsrael and denunciation of the 1968Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia pavedthe way for President Nixon’s officialvisit to Romania in August 1969. Despitepolitical differences, high-level contactscontinued between U.S. and Romanianleaders throughout the decade of the1970s, culminating in the 1973 state visitto Washington by the Ceausescus. In1972, a <b>consular</b> <b>convention</b> to facilitateprotection of citizens and their propertyin both countries was signed. OverseasPrivate Investment Corporation (OPIC) facilities were granted, and Romania became eligible for U.S.Export-Import Bank credits. A trade agreement signed in April 1975 accorded Most Favored Nation(MFN) status to Romania under section 402 of the Trade Reform Act of 1974 (the Jackson-Vanikamendment that links MFN to a country’s performance on emigration). This status was renewedyearly after Congressional review of a presidential determination that Romania was making progresstoward freedom of emigration.In the mid-1980s, criticism of Romania’s deteriorating human rights record, particularly regardingits mistreatment of religious and ethnic minorities, spurred attempts by Congress to withdraw MFNstatus. In 1988, to preempt Congressional action, Ceausescu renounced MFN treatment, calling JacksonVanikand other human rights requirements unacceptable interference in Romanian sovereignty. While political relations remained strained throughout this period, the U.S. worked to maintaincontacts through cultural and educational exchanges. The American Library in Bucharest, establishedin 1972 by the U.S. Information Service, offered a window to American culture throughout thisperiod, while visits by such preeminent artists as Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Dave Brubeck andArthur Rubinstein brought American music directly to the Romanian people.

40|$|Adjustment (Anpassung / Angleichung) is an {{institute}} of Private International Law which means non-application or modified application of substantive rules of applicable law. The method is mostly used in German scholarly writing and court practice. The need for adjustment is usually generated either {{by a lack}} of rules ‘Normenmangel’ or by an abundance of norms (Normenhäufung). It occurs if the conflict of law rules refer to the applicability of substantive law pertaining to two or even more legal orders which, when applied together, produce a result which is either contradictory or which is unintended by any of the applicable legal orders. The need for adjustment is deemed to be justified by the doctrine for grounds, such as the requirement for unity of legal order, the requirement for elimination of normative contradictions which are sometimes logically untenable, etc. The modern approach to the need for adjustment is depicted as accidental discrimination which contradicts the principle of equality before the law. By relying on provisions contained in the Russian-German <b>Consular</b> <b>Convention</b> of 1958, the author demonstrates that any method of adjustment violates the right to a fair trial and vested rights as well...|$|E
