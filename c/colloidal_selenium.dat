40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{associated}} {{high concentrations of}} lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a) ] with atherosclerosis. We developed a rapid, one-step competitive immunochromatographic assay to measure Lp(a) in plasma. The assay is per-formed on a nitrocellulose membrane strip {{and the result is}} determined by a visual readout of rust-colored <b>colloidal</b> <b>selenium.</b> The assay is based on the principle that Lp(a) in the sample will compete with Lp(a) -coated <b>colloidal</b> <b>selenium</b> for binding to the anti-Lp(a) monoclonal anti-body immobilized on the assay strip in the format of four ladder bars. The number of capture bars that appear {{as a result of the}} formation of <b>colloidal</b> <b>selenium</b> color is proportional to the concentration of the Lp(a) protein in the samples. The strip assay semiquantitatively measures Lp(a) concentrations ranging from 0 to 180 mg/L of Lp(a...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEven if {{photochemical}} {{deposition of}} nearly all types of materials {{has been used for}} decades to pattern almost any kind of substrate for various applications catalysis, chemical sensing, magnetic data storage, optoelectronics, spin-dependent electron transport, and solar cells, a rationalized description is still missing. This paper aims at fulfilling this lack by presenting a unified approach of the photodeposit growth initiated by a onephoton photochemical reaction. We experimentally investigate the robustness of growth scalings predicted for photochemical deposition driven by a continuous laser wave. Three types of one-photon photochemical reactions photoexcitation of chromates, photodissociation of permanganates, and photocondensation of <b>colloidal</b> <b>selenium</b> and three parameters solvent pH variations, concentration in photoactive reagent, and influence of the exciting optical wavelength were cross analyzed. In all the cases, including data taken from the literature, the same dynamic master behavior emerges from the data rescaling of measured deposit growth laws. The nice agreement observed between system-independent predictions and the whole data set strongly supports a universal description of the photodeposit growth whatever the photosensitive medium and the involved onephoton chemical reaction. Such an approach also points out the quantitative sorting of photochemical reactions in terms of deposition efficiency. This rationalization of the kinetics of photodeposition anticipates new methodologies to predict, design, and control substrate micropatterning for chemical, lithographic, and optoelectronic applications...|$|E
40|$|A medium was {{developed}} for the more rapid culture of Pityrosporum ovale. [35 S]Methionine was utilized preferentially as sole sulphur source from which cysteine/cystine were synthesized. Growth was less on cysteine, negligible on cystine and nil on inorganic sulphite and sulphate. Selenium disulphide, amorphous sulphur, stable <b>colloidal</b> (red) <b>selenium</b> and selenourea were extremely toxic, entering the organism by diffusion. Tellurium and seleno-methionine entered the organism, the latter by active transport, but were not toxic for up to I week of incubation although synthesis of [75 Se]seleno-methionine was demonstrated. Selenite and metallic (black) selenium were not toxic and did not enter the organism. Possible mechanisms of toxicity are discussed...|$|R

Excimer laser (248 nm) operating at low fluence (F ∼ 1 J/cm 2) {{was used to}} generate <b>colloidal</b> solutions of <b>selenium</b> nanoparticles. The obtained selenium nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering, and Transmission Electron Microscopy. We describe the multi-modal size distributions generated and use the centrifugation method to isolate the smallest nanoparticles (∼ 60 nm in diameter) ...|$|R
40|$|Hydrophobic <b>selenium</b> <b>colloidal</b> {{solutions}} {{prepared by}} Kruyt and Van Arkel's method {{were found to}} contain a large range of particle size, when very pure water was used. Moreover results were irreproducible. This is probably due to low and irregular nuclei content of the reagents used. By reducing the selenium oxide in presence of gold amicrons very homeodisperse and reproducible sols were obtained. The ionic content of the sols has been determined by a conductometric method. The sols were purified by electrodialysis using an original set up in which the water was continuously purified by ion exchange resins incorporated into the apparatus itself.

40|$|Bioalkylation and colloid {{formation}} of selenium during selenate removal in upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) bioreactors was investigated, The mesophilic (30 degrees C) UASB reactor (pH = 7. 0) was operated for 175 d with lactate as electron donor at an organic loading rate of 2 g COD L- 1 d(- 1) and a selenium loading rate of 3. 16 mg Se L- 1 d(- 1). Combining sequential filtration with ion chromatographic analysis for selenium oxyanions and solid phase micro extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) for alkylated selenium compounds allowed to entirely close the selenium mass {{balance in the}} liquid phase {{for most of the}} UASB operational runtime. Although selenate was removed to more than 98. 6 % from the liquid phase, a less efficient removal of dissolved selenium was observed due to the presence of dissolved alkylated selenium species (dimethylselenide and dimethyldiselenide) and <b>colloidal</b> <b>selenium</b> particles in the effluent. The alkylated and the colloidal fractions contributed LIP to 15 and 31 %, respectively, to the dissolved selenium concentration. The size fractions Of the colloidal dispersion were: 4 to 0. 45 mu m: up to 21 %, 0. 45 to 0. 2 mu m: up to 11 %, and particles smaller than 0. 2 mu m: up to 8 %. Particles of 4 to 0. 45 pin were formed in the external settler, but did not settle. SEM-EDX analysis showed that microorganisms form these Selenium containing colloidal particles extracellularly on their Surface. Lowering the temperature by 10 degrees C for 6 h resulted in drastically reduced selenare removal efficiencies (after a delay of 1. 5 d), accompanied by the temporary {{formation of}} all unknown, soluble, organic selenium species. This study shows that a careful process control is a prerequisite for selenium treatment in UASB bioreactors, as disturbances in the operational conditions induce elevated selenium effluent concentrations by alkylation and colloid formation...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{inorganic}} materials form crystals with chiral symmetry groups. Enantioselectively synthesizing nanostructures of such materials should lead to interesting optical activity effects. Here we report the synthesis of <b>colloidal</b> tellurium and <b>selenium</b> nanostructures using thiolated chiral biomolecules. The synthesis conditions are tuned to obtain tellurium nanostructures with chiral shapes and large optical activity. These nanostructures exhibit visible optical and chiroptical responses that shift with size and are successfully simulated by an electromagnetic model. The model shows that they behave as chiral optical resonators. The chiral tellurium nanostructures are transformed into chiral gold and silver telluride nanostructures with very large chiroptical activity, demonstrating a simple colloidal chemistry path to chiral plasmonic and semiconductor metamaterials. These materials are natural candidates for studies related to interactions of chiral (bio) molecules with chiral inorganic surfaces, with relevance to asymmetric catalysis, chiral crystallization {{and the evolution of}} homochirality in biomolecules...|$|R
40|$|Nanometer scale {{structures}} {{represent an}} exciting and rapidly expanding area of research. Studies on new physical/chemical properties and applications of nanomaterials and nanostructures are possible only when nanostructured materials are made available with desired size, morphology, crystal and microstructure, and composition. Thus, controlled synthesis of nanomaterials {{is the essential}} aspect of nanotechnology. This thesis describes the development of simple and versatile solution-based approaches to synthesize low-dimensional nanostructures. The first major goal {{of this research is}} to design and fabricate morphology-controlled alpha-Fe 2 O 3 nanoarchitectures in aqueous solution through a programmed microwave-assisted hydrothermal route, taking advantage of microwave irradiation and hydrothermal effects. Free-standing alpha-Fe 2 O 3 nanorings are prepared by hydrolysis of FeCl 3 in the presence of phosphate ions. The as-formed architecture of alpha-Fe 2 O 3 nanorings is an exciting new member in the family of iron oxide nanostructures. Our preliminary results demonstrate that sensors made of the alpha-Fe 2 O 3 nanorings exhibit high sensitivity not only for bio-sensing of hydrogen peroxide in a physiological solution but also for gas-sensing of alcohol vapor at room temperature. Moreover, monodisperse alpha-Fe 2 O 3 nanocrystals with continuous aspect-ratio tuning and fine shape control are achieved by controlling the experimental conditions. The as-formed alpha-Fe 2 O 3 exhibits shape-dependent infrared optical properties. The growth process of colloidal alpha-Fe 2 O 3 crystals in the presence of phosphate ions is discussed. In addition, through an efficient microwave-assisted hydrothermal process, self-assembled hierarchical alpha-Fe 2 O 3 nanoarchitectures are synthesized on a large scale. The second major goal of this research is to develop convenient microwave-hydrothermal approaches for the fabrication of carbon-based nanocomposites: (1) A one-pot solution-phase route, namely microwave-assisted hydrothermal reduction/carbonization (MAHRC), is developed to prepare coaxial Ag/amorphous-carbon (a-C) nanocables. The as-grown Ag/C nanocables can self-assemble in an end-to-end fashion. (2) A novel Se/C nanocomposite with core-shell structures is prepared. The new material consists of a trigonal-Se (t-Se) core and an amorphous-C (a-C) shell. The Se/C composite can be converted to hollow carbon capsules by thermal treatment. (3) A Fe 3 O 4 /C nanocomposite is synthesized by a green wet-chemical approach. The product possesses porous microstructures and exhibits superparamagnetic behavior. The third major goal of this research is develop facile solution-based methods for preparing carbonaceous nano test tubes, thin films of metal iodides, and spherical selenium spheres: (1) Carbonaceous nano test tubes are fabricated by a facile "decoring" route using a core-sheath Te carbon nanocomposite as the precursor. The as-formed carbonaceous material looks like a "test tube" with an average diameter of about 120 nm and lengths up to 5 mum. (2) Tetrahedral-shaped CuI crystals were formed on a variety of copper substrates (e. g. grids, flat/porous foils, and macro-/nano- wires) via an interfacial reaction between a copper substrate and iodine in water at room temperature. This preparation approach {{can also be used to}} grow PbI 2 and AgI nano- and micro-crystals with different morphologies on corresponding substrates. (3) <b>Colloidal</b> trigonal <b>selenium</b> (t-Se) microspheres are synthesized through a mild hydrothermal reduction reaction, using glucose as a reducing regent and water as an environmentally friendly solvent. Importantly, the resulting t-Se microspheres inherit functional groups from the starting materials and possess hydrophilic and biocompatible surfaces. Hu, Xianluo. "July 2007. "Adviser: Jimmy C. Yu.
