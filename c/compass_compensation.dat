50|$|Her {{passengers}} disembarked, Talamanca moored at a pier at the Moore Dry Dock Co. for overhaul. Overhaul {{and repairs}} were completed on 31 August, and after degaussing, <b>compass</b> <b>compensation,</b> and trials she began loading cargo on 3 September. On the 9th, she left San Francisco Bay for Pearl Harbor, where she {{arrived on the}} 14th. Two days later she left for Eniwetok where she stopped on the 23rd for fuel and water. From there she went to Guam, and thence to Iwo Jima where she unloaded cargo. On 8 October Talamanca left Iwo Jima with passengers for Saipan, where she arrived that afternoon. Her passengers disembarked that day and her cargo was unloaded the next day. After calling at Guam to embark passengers she left for Hawaii and the United States. She called at Pearl Harbor from 27 to 29 October and then continued to Panama.|$|E
40|$|This semestral thesis {{deals with}} {{development}} of electronic compass with three-axis magnetometer which eliminates deficiencies of magnetic compass {{and then the}} developed device is usable anywhere at Earth's surface around the world. A compass is able to measure the azimuth only if its position is horizontal. Bearing in mind that this condition cannot be satisfied in any case, the solution of <b>compass</b> tilt <b>compensation</b> using accelerometer {{is part of the}} project...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} the iconic fall {{migration}} of monarch butterflies have illuminated the mechanisms behind their southward navigation while using a time-compensated sun compass. Skylight cues, such as the sun itself and polarized light, are processed through both eyes and are probably integrated in the brain 2 Ì† 7 s central complex, the presumed site of the sun <b>compass.</b> Time <b>compensation</b> is provided by circadian clocks that have a distinctive molecular mechanism and that reside in the antennae. Monarchs might also use a magnetic compass because they possess two cryptochromes that have the molecular capability for light-dependent magnetoreception. Multiple genomic approaches are now being used {{with the aim of}} identifying navigation genes. Monarch butterflies are thus emerging as an excellent model organism in which to study the molecular and neural basis of long-distance migration...|$|R
