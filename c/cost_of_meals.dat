40|$|Tanzania, {{like other}} African countries, faces {{significant}} health workforce shortages. With advisory and partnership from Columbia University, the Ifakara Health Institute and the Tanzanian Training Centre for International Health (TTCIH) developed and implemented the Connect Project as a randomized cluster experimental {{trial of the}} childhood survival impact of recruiting, training, and deploying of a new cadre of paid community health workers (CHW), named "Wawazesha wa afya ya Jamii" (WAJA). This paper presents an estimation {{of the cost of}} training and deploying WAJA in three rural districts of Tanzania. Costing data were collected by tracking project activity expenditure records and conducting in-depth interviews of TTCIH staff who have led the training and deployment of WAJA, as well as their counterparts at Public Clinical Training Centres who have responsibility for scaling up the WAJA training program. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Register number (ISRCTN 96819844). The Connect training cost was US$ 2, 489. 3 per WAJA, of which 40. 1 % was for meals, 20. 2 % for accommodation 10. 2 % for tuition fees and the remaining 29. 5 % for other costs including instruction and training facilities and field allowance. A comparable training program estimated unit cost for scaling-up this training via regional/district clinical training centres would be US$ 833. 5 per WAJA. Of this unit cost, 50. 3 % would involve the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>meals,</b> 27. 4 % training fees, 13. 7 % for field allowances, 9 % for accommodation and medical insurance. The annual running cost of WAJA in a village will cost US$ 1. 16 per capita. Costs estimated by this study are likely to be sustainable on a large scale, particularly if existing regional/district institutions are utilized for this program...|$|E

Helping Hands: A Guidebook for Volunteer Meal Providers Author(s) : J. Jennings, 1 R. Ward, 2 K. Kolasa 3; 1 Nutrition Science, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, 2 East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, 3 Family Medicine and Pediatrics, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC Learning Outcome: Participants will be able to explain how to apply strategies to help food donors promote food safety practices and to prepare nutritional and cost-conscious meals. “Helping Hands” is a 32 -page practical resource for volunteer meal donors. The objective of this project was to develop a useful tool for volunteers providing prepared meals to soup kitchens, homeless shelters, Ronald McDonald House, and a cancer lodge. It was created in response to requests from local agencies that expressed concerns regarding the food safety practices and nutritional quality of meals being donated. They desired a document that would include basic nutrition and food safety principles for populations at risk for malnutrition and/or infection. Additionally, they desired recipes for budget-friendly meals that could be prepared by busy volunteers. A literature and internet search and a query to dietitians on several Listserves found no existing documents to fulfill these needs. The content was outlined, and food safety information and recipes were gathered from sources including the USDA and CDC websites. The guide includes over thirty recipes with nutrition information, basic food safety guidelines, time and cost-saving tips, components of healthy meals, and testimonials from volunteers and agency personnel. Nine food, nutrition, and food safety specialists on the FNSPEC Listserve responded to a request for reviewers and provided comments on accuracy, format, and readability. A two-page brochure was developed to promote the guide. The success of “Helping Hands” will be evaluated by the comparative number of nutritionally balanced meals served, the implementation of proper food safety practices, and the overall <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>meals</b> to volunteers.
