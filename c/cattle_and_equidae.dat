25|$|By {{the late}} Miocene, C4 {{metabolism}} was well established on the plains. In {{place of the}} prehistoric C3 grasslands (which are no longer extant) was the savanna, today's subtropical mixture of grasses and sedges. The deciding factors in this turn of evolution were a documented increase in temperature and aridity over the period. Faced with scant nutrition from browsing, the smaller Rhinocerotidae <b>and</b> <b>Equidae</b> declined in diversity, the gate in that direction, so to speak, now being closed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{evolution}} of Rhinocerotidae <b>and</b> <b>Equidae</b> in the Miocene grasslands proceeded along parallel lines from similar causes. Diminutive, cursorial, browsing, brachydont species expanded their ranges from the Oligocene forests into the nutritious C3 Miocene grasslands and there over {{the millions of}} years of the Miocene evolved diverse and flourishing populations on the ample food supply, gradually increasing in size. Some of these species exploited the grazing niche. Hispanotherium, Chilotherium and Teleoceras [...] "show a clear tendency to hypsodonty, and a grazing feeding adaptation has usually been attributed to them".|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} transboundary animal diseases (TADs) in the southern African region is foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). In this region, a pathway for spread of FMD virus is contacts between <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> certain species of wildlife. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate contacts between <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> wildlife in the Kruger National Park (KNP) and the adjacent Limpopo province for the time periods October 2006 to March 2007 and April to September 2007. In this study, 87 livestock owners and 57 KNP field rangers were interviewed. Fifteen (17 %) livestock owners reported contacts between wildlife <b>and</b> <b>cattle.</b> More livestock owners reported observing contacts between <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> all wildlife species during October-March than April-September (p = 0. 012). However, no difference was found between these periods for contacts between <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> individual wildlife species. A total of 18 (32 %) field rangers reported contacts between <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> wildlife. The most common species-specific contacts were between <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> buffalo (63 /year), <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> impala (17 /year) <b>and</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> lion (10 /year). There were no significant differences in rangers reporting observed contacts between <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> wildlife during October-March versus April-September or between rangers reporting observed contacts outside versus within the KNP. Overall, there was no evidence of higher contact rates between <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> wildlife in the study area during October-March compared to April-September. Contact data collected in this study can be used to better understand the transmission of FMD virus in this region. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|The {{specific}} gravities (SG) of bone {{samples taken}} from {{various parts of}} the skeleton of <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> sheep were determined gravimetrically in an effort to establish which sites give the most reproducible and uniform results, so that between animals, or sequential within animals, comparisons may be made with maximum sensitivity. Samples obtained from the mandible of sheep and the rib of <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> sheep were found to be too variable to be useful for most purposes. Best results were obtained using whole bones which are easily prepared, such as the tibial tarsal bones of <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> sheep and the fibular tarsal bone of cattle. These bones gave within animal deviations of 0. 012 - 0. 024 SG units, when comparing left bone with right bone. Slightly higher values were obtained for coccygeal vertebrae from <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> distal metacarpal condyles from sheep. SG was related to ash, calcium and phosphorus contents of coccygeal vertebrae of <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> it is considered that, for survey work on the mineral status of the bones of <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> sheep, the correlations are sufficiently high to make their determination unnecessary.

A total of 105 animals (37 <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> 68 buffaloes) were subjected to study. Based on the clinical and ultrasonographic examination, animals were classified into; acute local reticuloperitonitis (ALRP) (15 <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> 28 buffaloes), chronic local reticuloperitonitis (CLRP) (6 <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> 14 buffaloes), acute diffuse reticuloperitonitis (ADRP) (5 <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> 3 buffaloes), reticular abscesses (RA) (4 <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> 7 buffaloes), traumatic pericarditis (TP) (6 <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> 16 buffaloes) and liver abscess (one cattle). Results revealed that ALRP represented {{the highest percentage of}} 40. 5 % in <b>cattle</b> <b>and</b> 41. 2 % in buffalos between the different complications of TRP. TP represented the second complications of higher incidence (16. 2 % in cows and 23. 5 % in buffalos). Liver abscess represented the lowest percentage (2. 8 %) and was recorded in cows only. The pregnant animals were affected more than the non pregnant. Clinical findings represented in systemic reaction and pain tests were commonly encountered in TRP and its complications. Some of the affected animals were negatively respond to metal detector test. Results of the present study indicated that the ultrasonographic examination provide a specific echogenic pattern for the different complications of TRP.
