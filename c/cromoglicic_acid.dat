25|$|Omega-3 {{fatty acids}} (DHA and EPA reduce EIPH, presumably via {{increasing}} the functionality {{of the white}} blood cells (WBCs) in removing the blood from the lungs. Concentrated equine serum reduced EIPH by 53% through a combined mechanism of a 30% reduction in inflammation and an increased functionality of the WBCs. Other anti-inflammatory agents, such as hesperidin-citrus bioflavinoids, vitamin C, NSAIDs such as phenylbutazone, corticosteroids, heated water vapor therapy, <b>cromoglicic</b> <b>acid</b> or nedocromil, have no beneficial effects in reducing EIPH severity. Phenylbutazone can partially reverse the beneficial effects of furosemide.|$|E

50|$|Because {{of their}} {{convenience}} (and perceived safety), leukotriene receptor antagonists have largely replaced {{it as the}} non-corticosteroid treatment of choice {{in the treatment of}} asthma. <b>Cromoglicic</b> <b>acid</b> requires administration four times daily, and does not provide additive benefit in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cromoglicic</b> <b>acid</b> (INN) (also {{referred}} to as cromolyn (USAN), cromoglycate (former BAN), or cromoglicate) is traditionally described as a mast cell stabilizer, and is commonly marketed as the sodium salt sodium cromoglicate or cromolyn sodium. This drug prevents the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells.|$|E
5000|$|As of June 2017, {{isoprenaline}} was marketed under many {{brand names}} worldwide and as two different salts: Aleudrina, Asthpul, Iludrin, Isomenyl, Isoprenalin, Isoprenalina, Isoprenalina, Isoprenalina, Isoprenaline, Isoprenaline, Isoprénaline, Isoprénaline, Isoprenaline hydrochloride, Isoprenaline sulfate, Isoprenalinesulfaat, Isoprenalinsulfat, Isoprenalinum, Isopropydine, Isopropylnoradrenaline, Isoproterenol, Isoproterenol, Isoproterenol, Isoproterenol hydrochloride, Isoproterenol sulfate, Isuprel, Isuprel, Neo-Epinine, Neodrenal, Proternol, Saventrine, and Win 5162. [...] It was also marketed {{as a combination}} drug with <b>cromoglicic</b> <b>acid</b> as Frenal Compositum, in combination with pronase as Isopal P, and in combination with atropine as Stmerin D.|$|E

40|$|H 1 ‑receptor antagonists are drugs {{of choice}} to treat allergy. They work very fast as their {{therapeutic}} effect develops within 10 ‑ 15 min, have good tolerability {{and almost no}} adverse side-effects, and require no frequent instillations. Levocabastine quickly inhibits allergic reaction caused by specific allergen or histamine.  Levocabastine while being a highly-selective H 1 ‑receptor antagonist is the most perspective topical mono-drug used to treat acute allergic conjunctivitis. Levocabastine applied on a spot produces instant effect which persists for a long time so that instillations twice a day (BID) are enough. Levocabastine {{is more effective than}} other 15 antihistamines.  In contrast to previous antihistamines, levocabastine blocks vasodilatation and reduces vascular permeability increase.  Levocabastine eye drops have good tolerability comparable with <b>cromoglicic</b> <b>acid</b> eye drops and placebo. Levocabas tine is successfully used in allergic conjunctivitis (pollinosis, perennial, vernal, rhinoconjunctivitis) treatment in children. Its efficacy is the same or even higher than that of cromoglycate and azelastine. 20 clinical studies (more than 1200 patients) revealed that levocabastine eye drops are effective, work quickly and have good tolerability. This drug is efficient in allergic conjunctivitis treatment and acute infectious conjunctivitis complex therapy.  </p...|$|E
