2500|$|Quine {{argued that}} the {{solution}} to the paradox lies in the recognition that certain predicates, which he called natural kinds, have a distinguished status with respect to induction.

Quine's explanation is that [...] "blue" [...] is a natural kind; a privileged predicate which can be used for induction, while [...] "grue" [...] is not a natural kind and using induction with it leads to error.|$|E

2500|$|The {{answer is}} that {{nonlinearity}} enters because the Laplace-Beltrami operator depends upon the same function p which we used to define the metric. [...] But notice that the flat Euclidean plane is given by taking [...] [...] So if [...] is small in magnitude, we can consider it to define small deviations from the geometry of a flat plane, and if we retain only first order terms in computing the exponential, the Ricci flow on our two-dimensional almost flat Riemannian manifold becomes the usual two dimensional heat equation. [...] This computation suggests that, just as (according to the heat equation) an irregular temperature distribution in a hot plate tends to become more homogeneous over time, so too (according to the Ricci flow) an almost flat Riemannian manifold will tend to flatten out {{the same way that}} heat can be carried off [...] "to infinity" [...] in an infinite flat plate. [...] But if our hot plate is finite in size, and has no boundary where heat can be carried off, we can expect to homogenize the temperature, but <b>clearly</b> <b>we</b> cannot expect to reduce it to zero.

2500|$|Not every {{situation}} requires the {{axiom of choice}}. For finite sets X, the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory. In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box. <b>Clearly</b> <b>we</b> can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on. The number of boxes is finite, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end. The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on. (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of mathematical induction to prove [...] "for every natural number k, every family of k nonempty sets has a choice function.") This method cannot, however, be used to show that every countable family of nonempty sets has a choice function, as is asserted by the axiom of countable choice. If the method is applied to an infinite sequence (X'i : i∈ω) of nonempty sets, a function is obtained at each finite stage, {{but there is no}} stage at which a choice function for the entire family is constructed, and no [...] "limiting" [...] choice function can be constructed, in general, in ZF without the axiom of choice.|$|E
