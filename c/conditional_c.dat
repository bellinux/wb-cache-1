40|$|OBJECTIVE: How hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat {{expansions}} in C 9 ORF 72 cause {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) remains poorly understood. Both gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms {{have been}} proposed. Evidence supporting these mechanisms in vivo is, however, incomplete. Here we determined the effect of C 9 orf 72 loss-of-function in mice. METHODS: We generated and analyzed a <b>conditional</b> <b>C</b> 9 orf 72 knockout mouse model. C 9 orf 72 (fl/fl) mice were crossed with Nestin-Cre mice to selectively remove C 9 orf 72 from neurons and glial cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed to study motor neurons and neuromuscular integrity, {{as well as several}} pathological hallmarks of ALS, such as gliosis and TDP- 43 mislocalization. In addition, motor function and survival were assessed. RESULTS: Neural-specific ablation of C 9 orf 72 in <b>conditional</b> <b>C</b> 9 orf 72 knockout mice resulted in significantly reduced body weight but did not induce motor neuron degeneration, defects in motor function, or altered survival. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that C 9 orf 72 loss-of-function, by itself, is insufficient to cause motor neuron disease. These results may have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for C 9 orf 72 -associated ALS...|$|E

A distinctive feature of these Gram-positive bacteria is the presence of an outer membrane of unique struc-ture and composition. Recently, resistance–nodulation–division (RND) trans-porters (nicknamed MmpLs, Mycobacterial membrane protein Large) have emerged as major contributors to the biogenesis of the outer membranes in mycobacteria and as promising drug targets. In this study, we investigated the role of RND transporters in the physiology of Corynebacterium glutamicum and analyzed properties of these proteins.

A factorized expression for the cross section is derived and the conditions for factorization are studied. The A(e,e'pN) cross section is shown to be proportional to the conditional center-of-mass (c. m.) momentum distribution for close-proximity pairs in a state with zero relative orbital momentum and zero radial quantum number. The width of this <b>conditional</b> <b>c.</b> m. momentum distribution {{is larger than the}} one corresponding with the full c. m. momentum distribution. It is shown that the final-state interactions (FSIs) only moderately affect the shape of the factorization function for the A(e,e'pN) cross sections. Another prediction of the proposed factorization is that the mass dependence of the A(e,e'pp) [A(e,e'pn) ] cross sections is much softer than Z(Z- 1) / 2 [NZ].

To determine the functional relevance of CD 28 for peripheral Treg post thymic selection, we crossed the widely used Forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp 3) -CreYFP mice to mice bearing a <b>conditional</b> <b>Cd</b> 28 allele. Treg-specific CD 28 deficiency provoked a severe autoimmune syndrome {{as a result of}} a strong disadvantage in competitive fitness and proliferation of CD 28 -deficient Tregs. By contrast, Treg survival and lineage integrity were not affected by the lack of CD 28. This data demonstrate that, even after the initial induction requirement, Treg maintain a higher dependency on CD 28 signalling than conventional T cells for homeostasis. In addition, we found the Foxp 3 -CreYFP allele to be a hypomorph, with reduced Foxp 3 protein levels. Furthermore, we report here the stochastic activity of the Foxp 3 -CreYFP allele in non-Tregs, sufficient to recombine some <b>conditional</b> alleles (including <b>Cd</b> 28) but not others (including R 26 -RFP).

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the link between}} the variations in the cross-section of average returns and macroeconomic conditions. Instead of examining a specific factor, I ask which properties are needed for a factors to capture {{a large part of the}} cross-sectional variation of average return. I show that the return data of commonly used portfolios have few influential observations that are central in capturing this variation. The concentration of these observations around recession periods indicates a strong link between the cross-section of assets returns and the business cycle, providing support for <b>conditional</b> (<b>C)</b> CAPM models. However, the existence of influential observations and the small number of them also suggest that the power of the cross sectional tests is low, prohibiting any meaningful attempt to discriminate between different (macroeconomic) explanations. Any factor regression that loads on one or two of these observations is likely to exhibit large explanatory power. This concern is particularly important in the case of scaled factor regressions, commonly employed in the estimation of conditional models. As a principle solution, I advocate imposing restrictions on the test based on economic theory. In particular, instrumenting and hence modeling the first-stage betas as a function of firm characteristics mitigates the relation between the estimation error of the betas and average returns.

40|$|Current learner-centered trends, such as {{supplying}} {{students with}} content on demand (CoD), coupled with research findings that indicate distributed practice {{is superior to}} massed practice in terms of increased memory function and that the Personalized System of Instruction (PSI) is superior to traditional instruction in terms of academic achievement, content retention, and student satisfaction, prompted an investigation merging these two lines of research. Although PSI is more feasible today based on advances in technology and students prefer its self-paced component, they often procrastinate. In fact, this problem is resurfacing in distance education courses and is reflected in low completion rates {{as well as in}} the number of nonstarters. Numerous researchers have used deadline contingencies to reduce procrastination without adversely affecting student achievement and satisfaction, but few have considered the benefit of enhanced memory. It was hypothesized that, by providing students with CoD, a lesser form of self-pacing, and by using contingencies to regulate the pace of assignment submissions, procrastination would be reduced and content retention subsequently increased without detriment to immediate achievement and student satisfaction. To quantify differences in procrastination level, a comprehensive, sensitive, and reliable measure of procrastination, called the rate of relative digression from a target response (RDTR), was proposed. Undergraduate, preservice teachers in an instructional technology course were randomly assigned to one of three treatments. All groups were given the same deadlines. For one treatment, the deadlines were recommended (R) with one absolute deadline at the end of the treatment interval. For another they were <b>conditional</b> (<b>C)</b> with opportunities to earn bonus and penalty points for early and late work. For a third, they were all absolute (A) with no assignment accepted for credit after its due date. Although many problems experienced by students in A made findings for this group inconclusive, analysis of differences between students in R and C indicated that C was superior in reducing procrastination and enhancing memory function without detriment to immediate achievement, pacing preference, and course satisfaction. Although more research is needed to replicate, extend, and clarify findings, these results support using conditional deadlines for assignments when learners are supplied CoD...|$|E
