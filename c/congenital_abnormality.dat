5|$|As {{many as half}} of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a {{congenital}} blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers {{are the most common}} cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormality</b> found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormality.</b> Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormality</b> found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

METHODS: The large population-based dataset of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of <b>Congenital</b> <b>Abnormalities,</b> 1980 - 1996. RESULTS: A total of 156 cases with unclassified multiple <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities</b> including microtia and anotia were analyzed according to the number of 2 - 9 component <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> The comparison of the distribution and frequency of component <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in these cases showed significant differences from the data of other unclassified multiple <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Of the 156 cases, registry diagnosis was possible in 48 (30. 8 %) cases. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of available dataset of unclassified multiple anotia and microtia may help the delineation of new syndromes and associations with better prognosis and recurrence risk estimation, thus finally a better chance for their prevention...|$|R

25|$|In 1968, a Dr. Meadow {{encountered}} six {{babies with}} cleft lip and palate {{in addition to}} other congenital abnormalities whose mothers had been taking anticonvulsants. Meadow wrote a letter in The Lancet asking for cases of cleft lip and palate in babies whose mothers had taken anticonvulsants. That same year, Milunsky, Graef, and Gaynor reported cases of cleft lip and palate associated with attempted abortion with methotrexate and aminopterin, which are folic acid antagonists. While it was widely accepted by 1969 that these drugs could interfere with folic acid and that folic acid supplementation might have beneficial somatic effects, it was believed that folic acid supplementation could exacerbate seizures; this included the routine supplements given to pregnant women to prevent megaloblastic anemia. By 1970, the doctor had collected thirty-two cases. Sixteen of them were born to women taking primidone. 25% of the thirty-two cases had congenital heart defects; the reported rate in cleft lip and palate was 3-5%. Meadow emphasized that there was no proof of an association, the immense value of anticonvulsants and the probably small odds of any one epileptic woman having a child with a <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormality.</b> Roman and Caratzali reported in 1971 that the offspring of mice treated with primidone had more abnormal bone metaphases than controls; this was due to chromosomal lesions. By the mid-1970s, it was obvious that this antagonistic effect of primidone was not due to the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism.|$|E

2500|$|Craniosynostosis – Much less common, but {{potentially}} {{much more serious}} than plagiocephaly is craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis is a <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormality</b> originating from {{the central nervous system}} in which {{one or more of the}} fibrous joints in the skull close [...] prematurely. This fusion often requires surgical intervention to reconstruct the skull (see craniofacial surgery) either to bring it back to its normal position or to give it a more natural shape. It is believed that craniosynostosis occurs in 1 out of 1,800 to 2,200 live births, and is often a side effect of an associated syndrome.|$|E

In general, adult males are {{slightly}} larger than females. Compared to most snakes, they are heavy-bodied, although some African vipers are much thicker. Most forms are easily recognized by the characteristic rattle on the end of their tails, although a few island populations form exceptions to this rule: C. catalinensis has lost its rattle entirely, C. ruber lorenzoensis usually has no rattle, and both C. r. lucasensis and C. molossus estebanensis exhibit a tendency for rattle loss. The rattle may also be lacking in any species due to a <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormality.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background. With the {{introduction}} of three-dimensional (3 D) ultrasound it has become possible to measure volumes. The relative increase in embryonic volume (EV) is much larger {{than that of the}} crown-rump length (CRL) over the same time period. We examined whether EV is a better parameter to determine growth restriction in fetuses with structural <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Study Design, Subjects, and Outcome Measures. CRL and EV were measured using a Virtual Reality (VR) system in prospectively collected 3 D ultrasound volumes of 56 fetuses diagnosed with structural <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in the first trimester of pregnancy (gestational age 7 + 5 to 14 + 5 weeks). Measured CRL and EV were converted to z-scores and to percentages of the expected mean using previously published reference curves of euploid fetuses. The one-sample t-test was performed to test significance. Results. The EV was smaller than expected for GA in fetuses with structural <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities</b> (− 35 %[*][*]p< 0. 001, z-score − 1. 44 [*][*]p< 0. 001), whereas CRL was not (− 6. 43 %[*][*]p= 0. 118, z-score − 0. 43 [*][*]p= 0. 605). Conclusions. CRL is a less reliable parameter to determine growth restriction in fetuses with structural <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities</b> as compared with EV. By measuring EV, growth restriction in first-trimester fetuses with structural <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities</b> becomes more evident and enables an earlier detection of these cases...|$|R
