Models that turn on individuals’ cultivating reputations as moralistic punishers clearly predict that psychological systems should be designed to increase punishment in response to information that one’s decisions to punish will be known by others. We report two experiments in which we induce participants to commit moral violations and then present third parties with the opportunity to pay to punish wrongdoers.

40|$|Deindividuation {{is among}} the classic {{phenomena}} researched by the early pioneers of social psychology. Building on the theorizing of LeBon (1895 / 1985), deindividuation provided an explanation for aggression in the crowd, a concern as relevant {{today as it was}} in the previous two centuries. The theory predicts that behavior becomes more antinormative and aggressive under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>anonymity,</b> associated with group immersion, and that this occurs because of reduced self-awareness and deregulated behavior. However, close scrutiny of the deindividuation literature provides scant evidence for the deindividuation process. Revisiting the primary literature reveals at best mixed support for the original claims and many contradictions, often belied by accounts in secondary sources and textbooks.

40|$|Conventional value-elicitation {{experiments}} {{often find}} subjects provide higher valuations for items they posses than for identical items they may acquire. Plott and Zeiler (2005) find {{no difference in}} elicited valuations after implementing procedures that provide for anonymity and experience with the second-price mechanism. This paper investigates whether anonymity is a necessary for their result. Employing a similar design to theirs, we find their general result holds in conditions both with and without anonymity. Contrary to predictions of one theory—which suggest social pressures may cause differences in subject valuations—anonymous and non-anonymous subjects have nearly identical valuations. As a robustness check, we note the subjects across conditions give significantly different amounts in a dictator game, suggesting they were aware <b>of</b> the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> and sensitive to the accompanying social pressures. Together, these findings strongly suggest subject familiarity with elicitation mechanisms, not anonymity, {{is responsible for the}} variability in results across value-elicitation experiments. As an application to experimental design methodology, there appears to be little need to impose anonymity in the laboratory when using second-price mechanisms as we see negligible differences in elicited values with and without anonymity...|$|R

40|$|Estimates of {{population}} size for hidden and hard-to-reach individuals {{are of particular}} interest to health officials when health problems are concentrated in such populations. Efforts to derive these estimates are often frustrated by a range of factors including social stigma or an association with illegal activities that ordinarily preclude conventional survey strategies. This paper builds on and extends prior work that proposed a method to meet these challenges. Here we describe a rigorous formalization of a one-step, network-based population estimation procedure that can be employed under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>anonymity.</b> The estimation procedure is designed to be implemented alongside currently accepted strategies for research with hidden populations. Simulation experiments are described that test the efficacy of the method across a range <b>of</b> implementation <b>conditions</b> and hidden population sizes. The results of these experiments show that reliable population estimates can be derived for hidden, networked population as large as 12, 500 and perhaps larger for one family of random graphs. As such, the method shows potential for cost-effective implementation health and disease surveillance officials concerned with hidden populations.

40|$|We study {{political}} influence in institutions where members choose from among several options {{their levels of}} support to a collective goal, these individual choices determining {{the degree to which}} the goal is reached. Influence is assessed by newly defined binary relations, each of which compares any two individuals on the basis of their relative performance at a corresponding level of participation. For institutions with three levels of support (e. g., voting games in which each voter may vote "yes", "abstain", or vote "no"), we obtain three influence relations, and show that the strict component of each of them may be cyclical. The cyclicity of these relations contrasts with the transitivity of the unique influence relation of binary voting games. Weak <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> are sufficient for each of them to be transitive. We also obtain a necessary and sufficient <b>condition</b> for each <b>of</b> them to be complete. Further, we characterize institutions for which the rankings induced by these relations, and the Banzhaf-Coleman and Shapley-Shubik power indices coincide.
