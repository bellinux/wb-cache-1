500|$|Ayane {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a top-tier character {{in many of the}} games she is playable in, especially in the DOA fighting games where she was noted for being very unpredictable and confusing for the opponent as well as fast and hard to counter. Previewing the original Dead or Alive for the PlayStation, Computer & Video Games opined she [...] "has an unusual floaty kind of fighting style, but has some great moves. Her quick punches make stringing combos together easy, and her throws are great for hitting people into the Danger Zone" [...] (an interactive feature within some arenas). In Prima Games' official guide for Dead or Alive Ultimate (a remake version of Dead or Alive and Dead or Alive 2), Eric Mylonas declared Ayane the [...] "tougher of the two siblings" [...] as she [...] "brings strings of blindingly fast combos into play and has devastating holds and throws." [...] Mylonas wrote Ayane has a major weakness in that she <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> moving without becoming [...] "an easy prey," [...] and she may not be favored by those who prefer [...] "huge, over-the-top moves," [...] but for a [...] "more patient sort, there's probably no better character in the game." [...] According to GameSpy's guide to Ultimate by Andrew Alfonso, Ayane's key moves include her high kick—which is [...] "a lot" [...] better than Kasumi's—with another move so powerful [...] "it's almost unfair to use it." [...] He also noted how she can be actually more effective with her back turned towards her opponent, {{despite the fact that the}} characters cannot block when facing away from an enemy. In his guide to Dead or Alive 3, Alfonso wrote Ayane is a very unpredictable and quick attacker, even more than in the previous games in the series, and should be played primarily for her backwards position, hers being the best such stance of all the characters in the game. Ayane's speed and deceiving attacks make her a [...] "pretty good" [...] partner for slower fighters for tag team battles, but her primary partners are other ninja characters.|$|E

40|$|Habitual aspect can be {{represented}} by using various tense or aspect forms in English，such as the present，the past, the progressive，the perfect，used to，will and would. Mongolian，unlike English，has fewer means to express habituality. The most typical means is the suffix (-dag 4) ，which is added to a verb stem.

However，the explanation <b>can</b> <b>not</b> help <b>stopping</b> {{right in front of}} two problems. The first is that not all (repetitive) nor (durative) meanings entail (habitual).
