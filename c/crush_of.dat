5|$|No {{members of}} the general public were {{permitted}} on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.|$|E

A total of 173 people, including 62 children, died, making this both the worst civilian disaster of World War II, and the largest loss of life in a single incident on the London Underground network.|$|E

The New York Cosmos' home attendance tripled in just half the season Pelé was there, and on the road the Cosmos also played in front of huge crowds that came to watch Pelé play.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th we had not a moment of repose, as every moment we heard the loud <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> houses {{collapsing}} under of stones, mud, and ashes piled upon them, and feared that the turn of the convento and the church of Casasay would come in next. Shortly before daybreak of December 1 there was a tremendous crash as if the house were coming down on our heads: the roof of the apse of the church had caved in! Not long afterward, the roof of their kitchen gave away with a thud. Both were tile roofs.|$|E

25|$|At Astoria a {{peaceful}} celebration of Fidesz started. Despite their readiness (during the previous few days, hundreds of policemen {{were called in}} from {{the country to the}} city), police did little to defend the <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> radical anti-government protests that took place only 300–500 metres away and pressed nearer and nearer by police's gas attacks in the wide Erzsébet Boulevard. That night and the next day many political analysts and congressmen brought up the idea that this police behaviour was not by chance. Fidesz celebration, with a participation of thousands, ended at 18:00. That crowd could not be disbanded at all when police started a horse assault on Deák Square protesters. They used gun shells too.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the twenty}} {{who survived the}} sinking, only one was a female. Anna Boecker was a shy, quiet maid in the {{employment}} of an elderly lady, travelling with her employer to Southampton. In the panic and confusion of the collision she had been unable to save her employer. She joined the terrified <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> passengers lowered into the first lifeboat. When it capsized under the sheer weight of numbers, Anna ended up in the ocean. All the others from her lifeboat clambered back onto the sinking ship. Anna was alone in the treacherous sea until the survivors in the second lifeboat spotted her foundering in the water and pulled her up to safety.|$|E
25|$|Around 9:10p.m., power {{failed in}} the building, {{extinguishing}} the lights. Panic ensued, and even {{those who had been}} calmly moving toward exits in the Cabaret Room began to push and shove each other. The situation was made worse by the fact that of the three exits in the room, two were quickly blocked off by the fire, leaving the crowd to funnel through a single exit. Employees outside the exits attempted to pull guests to safety, but the <b>crush</b> <b>of</b> bodies as those behind pushed upon those in front became so solid that no amount of strength could free most of them. Many of those who escaped the crush blocking the northeast fire exit became lost trying to find other exits. Twists and turns in building design which led to a set of doors opening into a bar area funneled some into a dead end.|$|E
