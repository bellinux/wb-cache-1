25|$|The <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect</b> can be {{understood}} {{by the idea that}} the presence of conducting metals and dielectrics alters the vacuum expectation value of the energy of the second quantized electromagnetic field. Since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the conductors and dielectrics, the <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect</b> manifests itself as a force between such objects.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamical}} <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect</b> is {{the production}} of particles and energy from an accelerated moving mirror. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to quantum mechanics equations made in the 1970s. In May 2011 an announcement was made {{by researchers at the}} Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect.</b> In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified SQUID to change the effective length of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required relativistic velocity. If confirmed this would be the first experimental verification of the dynamical <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

40|$|Thermal effects {{contributing}} to the Casimir interaction between objects are usually small at room temperature and they are difficult to separate from quantum mechanical contributions at higher temperatures. We propose that the thermal <b>Casimir</b> force <b>effect</b> can be observed for a graphene flake suspended in a fluid between substrates at the room temperature regime. The properly chosen materials for the substrates and fluid induce a Casimir repulsion. The balance with the other forces, such as gravity and buoyancy, results in a stable temperature dependent equilibrium separation. The suspended graphene is a promising system due to its potential for observing thermal <b>Casimir</b> <b>effects</b> at room temperature. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, in APL production 201...|$|R
50|$|Both Harold White's and Mike McCulloch's {{theories}} {{of how the}} EmDrive could work rely on these asymmetric or dynamical <b>Casimir</b> <b>effects.</b> However, if these vacuum forces are present, {{they are expected to}} be exceptionally tiny based on our current understanding, too small to explain the level of observed thrust.

We work in the semi grand canonical ensemble, in slab geometry, in which the Casimir force appears as the excess of the generalized pressure, P_-nμ. The excesses of the perpendicular pressure, P_, and of nμ, are individually of much larger amplitude. A critical pressure anisotropy is observed between forces parallel and perpendicular to the confinement direction, which collapses onto a universal scaling function closely related {{to that of the}} critical Casimir force...|$|R

25|$|There are few {{instances}} wherein the <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect</b> can {{give rise to}} repulsive forces between uncharged objects. Evgeny Lifshitz showed (theoretically) that in certain circumstances (most commonly involving liquids), repulsive forces can arise. This has sparked interest in applications of the <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect</b> toward the development of levitating devices. An experimental demonstration of the Casimir-based repulsion predicted by Lifshitz {{was carried out by}} Munday et al. Other scientists have also suggested the use of gain media to achieve a similar levitation effect, though this is controversial because these materials seem to violate fundamental causality constraints and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium (Kramers–Kronig relations). Casimir and Casimir-Polder repulsion can in fact occur for sufficiently anisotropic electrical bodies; for a review of the issues involved with repulsion see Milton et al.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect</b> was {{measured}} more accurately in 1997 by Steve K. Lamoreaux of Los Alamos National Laboratory, and by Umar Mohideen and Anushree Roy of the University of California, Riverside. In practice, {{rather than using}} two parallel plates, which would require phenomenally accurate alignment to ensure they were parallel, the experiments use one plate that is flat and another plate that {{is a part of}} a sphere with a large radius.|$|E
25|$|Dutch {{physicists}} Hendrik Casimir and Dirk Polder at Philips Research Labs {{proposed the}} existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947, this special form is called the Casimir–Polder force. After a conversation with Niels Bohr, who suggested {{it had something to do}} with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948 which is called the <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect</b> in the narrow sense.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the dispersion {{energy of a}} pair of dipoles embedded in a metallic waveguide with transverse dimension $a$ smaller than the characteristic dipolar wavelength. We find that $a$ sets the scale that separates retarded, Casimir-Polder-like, from quasistatic, van der Waals-like, interactions. Whereas in the retarded regime, the energy decays exponentially with inter-dipolar distance, typical of evanescent waves, in the van der Waals regime, the known free-space result is obtained. This short-range scaling implies that the additivity of the dispersion interactions inside a waveguide extends to denser media, along with modifications to related <b>Casimir</b> <b>effects</b> in such structures.

5000|$|The {{basic idea}} {{here will be}} that the Casimir force may be derived from the source fields alone even in {{completely}} conventional QED, ... Milonni provides detailed argument that the measurable physical effects usually attributed to the vacuum electromagnetic field cannot be explained by that field alone, but require in addition a contribution from the self-energy of the electrons, or their radiation reaction. He writes: [...] "The radiation reaction and the vacuum fields are two aspects {{of the same thing}} when it comes to physical interpretations of various QED processes including the Lamb shift, van der Waals forces, and <b>Casimir</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Studies of the {{long-range}} interactions between cold atoms and surfaces are now of vital interest. The interest is partly driven by nanotechnology applications, partly by the exploding {{interest in the}} encompassing superfield of <b>Casimir</b> <b>effects,</b> and partly by the burgeoning overlap between atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter, and quantum optics. This tutorial lecture will address long-range atom-surface interactions for cold atoms, including an overview of Casimir-Polder interactions and their various manifestations. Some previous theoretical studies that are of particular relevance will be reviewed. In addition some different approaches to the problem and corresponding results, especially concerning the effects of substrate composition, geometry, and finite temperature, will be discussed. 1...|$|R
25|$|A {{phenomenon}} that is commonly presented as {{evidence for the}} existence of zero-point energy in vacuum is the <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect,</b> proposed in 1948 by Dutch physicist Hendrik Casimir, who considered the quantized electromagnetic field between a pair of grounded, neutral metal plates. The vacuum energy contains contributions from all wavelengths, except those excluded by the spacing between plates. As the plates draw together, more wavelengths are excluded and the vacuum energy decreases. The decrease in energy means there must be a force doing work on the plates as they move.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect</b> {{shows that}} {{quantum field theory}} allows the energy density in certain regions of space to be {{negative}} relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, {{and it has been}} shown theoretically that quantum field theory allows states where the energy can be arbitrarily negative at a given point, Many physicists such as Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne, and others therefore argue that such effects might make it possible to stabilize a traversable wormhole. Miguel Alcubierre has suggested using the effect to obtain the negative energy density required for his Alcubierre Drive.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{this and}} several similar peer {{reviewed}} papers, {{there is not}} a consensus as to whether such devices can produce a continuous output of work. Garret Moddel at University of Colorado has highlighted that he believes such devices hinge {{on the assumption that the}} Casimir force is a nonconservative force, he argues that there is sufficient evidence (e.g. analysis by Scandurra (2001)) to say that the <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect</b> is a conservative force and therefore even though such an engine can exploit the Casimir force for useful work it cannot produce more output energy than has been input into the system.|$|E
40|$|Casimir {{forces are}} {{a manifestation of}} the change in the zero-point energy of the vacuum caused by the {{insertion}} of boundaries. We show how the Casimir force can be computed by consideration of the vacuum fluctuations that are suppressed by the boundaries, and rederive the scalar <b>Casimir</b> <b>effects</b> for a series of geometries. For the planar case a finite universal force is automatically found. For curved geometries formally divergent expressions are encountered which we argue are largely due to the divergent self-energy of the boundary contributing to the force. This idea is supported by computing the effect for a fixed perimeter wedge-arc geometry in two dimensions. Comment: 4 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

The Nambu [...] Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type interaction {{is used to}} investigate the quark condensate in the chiral bag. Considering the strong meson-quark coupling, we solve the mean field solution to the scalar and pseudoscalar channels by including the chiral <b>Casimir</b> <b>effects.</b> The self-consistent equation allows a finite value of the quark condensate and hence a finite dynamical quark mass inside the bag. It is shown that an approximate Cheshire Cat picture holds for massive quarks...|$|R
40|$|We {{apply the}} Batalin, Fradkin and Tyutin (BFT) {{formalism}} to the SU(3) flavor Skyrmion model {{to investigate the}} Weyl ordering correction {{to the structure of}} the hyperfine splittings of strange baryons. Differently from the Klebanov and Westerberg’s standard rigid rotator approach to the SU(3) Skyrmion where the angular velocity of the SU(2) rotation was used, we have exploited the SU(2) collective coordinates which are naturally embedded in the SU(3) group manifold so that, as in the SU(2) flavor case, we can introduce the BFT scheme in the SU(3) Skyrmion to yield the modified baryon energy spectrum. The Berry phases and <b>Casimir</b> <b>effects</b> are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|More {{interesting}} is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the van der Waals force, {{to be understood as}} a variation on the theme of the <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect.</b> Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system {{as a function of the}} arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in configuration space. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.|$|E
25|$|In physics, the <b>Casimir</b> <b>effect</b> or Casimir-Polder {{force is}} a {{physical}} force exerted between separate objects due to resonance of vacuum energy in the intervening space between the objects. This is sometimes {{described in terms of}} virtual particles interacting with the objects, owing to the mathematical form of one possible way of calculating the strength of the effect. Because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is only measurable when the distance between the objects is extremely small. Because the effect is due to virtual particles mediating a static field effect, it is subject to the comments about static fields discussed above.|$|E
25|$|Actually, all {{bodies are}} {{electrified}}, but may appear not electrified {{because of the}} relatively similar charge of neighboring objects in the environment. An object further electrified + or – creates an equivalent or opposite charge by default in neighboring objects, until those charges can equalize. The effects of attraction {{can be observed in}} high-voltage experiments, while lower voltage effects are merely weaker and therefore less obvious. The attraction and repulsion forces are codified by Coulomb's law (attraction falls off at the square of the distance, which has a corollary for acceleration in a gravitational field, suggesting that gravitation may be merely electrostatic phenomenon between relatively weak charges in terms of scale).

It was proved that an exothermic reaction of collapse occurs and the dependence of energy release on temperature was observed. Critical Casimir energy of extensive line of constant curvature was also examined. It was shown that its critical Casimir energy is proportional to curvature that leads to the tendency to radius decreasing under Casimir forces.
