5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is a <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> that supplies the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. It {{is considered the}} eleventh of twelve pairs of cranial nerves, or simply <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> XI, as {{part of it was}} formerly believed to originate in the brain. The sternocleidomastoid muscle tilts and rotates the head, while the trapezius muscle, connecting to the scapula, acts to shrug the shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Trauma to the skull, {{disease of}} bone such as Paget's disease, and injury to nerves during {{neurosurgery}} (such as tumor removal) are other possible causes of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|Lack of CSF {{pressure}} and volume can allow {{the brain to}} sag and descend through the foramen magnum (large opening) of the occipital bone, {{at the base of}} the skull. The lower portion of the brain is believed to stretch or impact one or more <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> complexes, thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms. Nerves that can be affected and their related symptoms are detailed in the table at right.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> III-XII {{emerge from}} the brainstem. These <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> supply the face, head, and viscera. (The first two pairs of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> arise from the cerebrum).|$|R
25|$|Other <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> and meninges: About 50% of {{patients}} develop tumours in other <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> or meningiomas.|$|R
50|$|MMND affects many <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves,</b> {{particularly}} {{involving the}} 7th (facial nerve) and 9th to the 12th <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> (in order: glossopharyngeal nerve, vagus nerve, accessory nerve, spinal accessory nerve).|$|R
5|$|A further, albeit rare, {{complication}} of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia {{due to a}} sudden and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine. An extremely rare {{complication of}} SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where {{the ability to move}} one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Knox {{suffered}} {{a head injury}} during a match in Germany and was diagnosed with possible damage to her eighth <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve.</b> She was scheduled to return to wrestling in 2008, but no-showed the event, stating she no longer felt that wrestling was the right option for her at that time. She later returned to Shimmer as a manager in 2011, before signing a contract with WWE in 2013. Following her arrival on the main roster in July 2015, she became the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion at Backlash in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements of the eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> or its nuclei.|$|E
500|$|<b>Cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> are {{the nerves}} that emerge {{directly}} from the brain (including the brainstem), in contrast to spinal nerves (which emerge from segments of the spinal cord). 10 of 12 of the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> originate in the brainstem. [...] <b>Cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> relay information between the brain {{and parts of the}} body, primarily to and from regions of the head and neck.|$|R
5|$|Multiple sclerosis, an {{inflammatory}} process that may produce {{a loss of}} the myelin sheathes which surround the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves,</b> may cause a variety of shifting symptoms affecting multiple <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Central {{damage is}} {{damage to the}} trochlear nucleus. It affects the {{contralateral}} eye. The nuclei of other <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> generally affect ipsilateral structures (for example, the optic <b>nerves</b> - <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> II - innervate both eyes).|$|R
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve,</b> and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this {{is the result of a}} direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve),</b> which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Despite {{the recent}} {{progress}} of MR imaging, visualization of the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> within the brain stem {{has not been}} accomplished. Periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) multishot diffusion-weighted imaging, an effective method for compen-sating for motion and distortion, offers high-quality diffusion-weighted images. We succeeded in depicting the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> within the brain stem in some subjects by using this method with motion-probing gradient applied in the superior-inferior direction. There aremany disorders of the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves,</b> including neo-plasm, inflammation, and vascular compression. MR imag-ingwith gradient-echo or fast spin-echo sequences with 3 D Fou-rier transformation has recently enabled depiction of the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> in the cisterns around the brain stem. 1 - 5 However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, visualization of these nerves within the brain stem itself has not been accomplished. We succeeded in depicting the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> within the brain stem in some of the subjects in this preliminary study by using periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PRO-PELLER) multishot diffusion-weighted imaging. 6, 7 We present diffusion-weighted images that depict the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> and the rate of their visualization within the brain stem...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Conventional imaging {{protocols}} {{are unable}} to visualize the intraforaminal/canalicular seg-ments of the lower <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> (IX–XII). On the basis of previous successful demonstration of individual <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> within the cavernous sinus by constructive interference in steady-state MR imaging, we describe the use of contrast-enhanced 3 D fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition MR imaging to demonstrate normal in vivo intraforaminal and canalicular segments of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> IX–XII in 10 patients by using a standardized imaging protocol. The detection of individual <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> in the intrafo-raminal portion of the jugular foramen and hypoglossal canal is useful in diagnostic imaging 1; however, visualization by using conventionalMR imaging protocols does not provide adequate detail of individual nerves. 2, 3 Recently, contrast-enhanced 3 D constructive interference in steady state (CISS) MR imaging has successfully demonstrated the trigeminal ganglion and its divisions and individual <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> within the cavernous sinus. 4, 5 3 D fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) is a similar form of steady-state se...|$|R

5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on {{examination of}} the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E
5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve)</b> is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E
40|$|Neuro{{lymphoma}}tosis {{is a rare}} {{manifestation of}} non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by infiltration of peripheral nerves, nerve roots, plexus and <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> by malignant lymphocytes. This report presents positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging with 2 -deoxy- 2 - 18 F-fluoro-D-glucose (18 F-FDG) in 3 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with nerve infiltration, including one newly diagnosed lymphoma, one recurrent lymphoma in previous nerve lesions and one newly recurrent lymphoma. PET/CT could reveal the affected neural structures including <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves,</b> spinal nerve roots, brachial plexus, cervicothoracic ganglion, intercostal nerves, branches of the vagus nerve, lumbosacral plexus and sciatic nerves. There was relative concordance between PET/CT and MRI in detection of affected <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves.</b> PET/CT seemed {{to be better than}} MRI in detection of affected peripheral nerves. 18 F-FDG PET/CT was a whole-body imaging technique with the ability to reveal the affected <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves,</b> peripheral nerves, nerve roots and plexus in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A thorough understanding of disease and use of advanced imaging modalities will increasingly detect neurolymphomatosi...|$|R

5|$|During 2006, Knox {{competed for}} One Pro Wrestling. On 10 September, Knox {{wrestled}} for the International Wrestling Zone promotion, defeating Emil Sitoci and Robbie Mireno in a three-way match. On 26 September, Knox competed for German Stampede Wrestling, where she lost to Finnish wrestler Kisu in a singles match. During the match, Knox suffered a cut above her eye, {{for which she}} received stitches. Knox later posted on her website {{that she had been}} suffering from headaches, vision problems and loud buzzing in her left ear since receiving the injury, also being diagnosed with possible damage to her eighth <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve,</b> and as a result canceled all her bookings {{for the rest of the}} year. Knox was expected to participate at a ChickFight television taping on 4 May 2008, but she was removed from the show after no-showing a Shimmer Women Athletes show, stating that she did not believe that wrestling was the correct career choice for her at that time.|$|E

25|$|When {{the face}} is submerged, receptors that are {{sensitive}} to cold within the nasal cavity and {{other areas of the}} face supplied by the fifth (V) <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> (the trigeminal nerve) relay the information to the brain and then innervate the tenth (X) <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve,</b> (the vagus nerve), {{which is part of the}} autonomic nervous system. This causes bradycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction. Blood is diverted from the limbs and all organs but the heart and the brain (and lungs), concentrating flow in a heart–brain circuit and allowing the animal to conserve oxygen.|$|E
