5|$|After the <b>Cortex</b> Vortex, a {{space station}} owned by Doctor Neo <b>Cortex,</b> is {{destroyed}} by Doctor Nitrus Brio's laser beam device, pieces of the station crash into a tropical mountain. This sets free an entity known as Uka Uka, the mastermind behind Cortex's previous schemes. He derides <b>Cortex</b> for failing to retrieve the crystals and gems, {{both of which are}} vast sources of world energy. However, feeling generous after being freed from prison, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Nefarious Tropy to join him and <b>Cortex</b> in their latest plan. Tropy has created the Time-Twisting Machine, a time machine that allows the villains to travel through time to find more gems and crystals scattered across the timeline.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Neo <b>Cortex</b> and his {{assistant}} Doctor Nitrus Brio create the Evolvo-Ray, a device they use to mutate the various animals living on the islands into beasts with superhuman strength. They experiment on Crash, a peaceful bandicoot who <b>Cortex</b> intends {{to be the leader}} of his growing military of animal soldiers. Despite Brio's warnings, <b>Cortex</b> subjects Crash to the untested <b>Cortex</b> Vortex in an attempt to control him. The Vortex rejects Crash, allowing him to escape. After Crash leaps out a window and falls to the ocean below, <b>Cortex</b> prepares a female bandicoot named Tawna for experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal <b>cortex,</b> mid and anterior insula <b>cortex</b> and lateral prefrontal <b>cortex,</b> appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate <b>cortex</b> in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
50|$|The IT <b>cortex’s</b> {{neurological}} {{significance is}} not just its contribution to the processing of visual stimuli in object recognition but also {{has been found to}} be a vital area with regards to simple processing of the visual field, difficulties with perceptual tasks and spatial awareness, and the location of unique single cells that possibly explain the IT <b>cortex’s</b> relation to memory.|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{enlargement}} of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral <b>cortex,</b> especially the prefrontal <b>cortex</b> and {{the parts of the}} <b>cortex</b> involved in vision. The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy {{more than half of the}} total surface of the primate neocortex. The prefrontal <b>cortex</b> carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cortex</b> {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The <b>cortex</b> {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor <b>cortex</b> and a sensory <b>cortex.</b> The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual <b>cortex</b> of the occipital lobe, the auditory <b>cortex</b> in parts of the temporal lobe and insular <b>cortex,</b> and the somatosensory <b>cortex</b> in the parietal lobe. The primary motor <b>cortex,</b> which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the <b>cortex,</b> are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{elaboration}} of the cerebral <b>cortex</b> {{carries with it}} changes to other brain areas. The superior colliculus, which {{plays a major role}} in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral <b>cortex.</b> The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the cerebral <b>cortex,</b> which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.|$|E
50|$|Further {{research}} has shown that as humans age the volume of their prefrontal gray matter declines. This shrinkage in elderly cerebral <b>cortexes</b> could account for some of the mediated age-related influences on executive functions.|$|R
5|$|The boss {{characters}} of the game include Papu Papu, an obese and short-tempered chief of the native village; Ripper Roo, a demented kangaroo with razor-sharp toenails; Koala Kong, a muscular but unintelligent koala; and Pinstripe Potoroo, Doctor <b>Cortex's</b> tommy gun-wielding bodyguard.|$|R
40|$|Ghrelin is an {{endogenous}} ligand of {{the growth}} hormone secretagogue receptors (GHS-Rs), two subtypes {{of which have been}} recognized: the biologically active 1 a and the biologically inactive 1 b subtype. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated ghrelin and GHS-R 1 b mRNAs in eight human adrenal <b>cortexes,</b> and GHS-R 1 a mRNA only in six of the eight adrenal specimens. The GHS-R 1 a expression was absent in the two adrenal <b>cortexes</b> obtained from 76 - and 79 -year old male patients.

5|$|The {{human brain}} has many {{properties}} {{that are common}} to all vertebrate brains, and shares many features common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral <b>cortex</b> {{and a set of}} associated structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala. The <b>cortex</b> is proportionally larger in greater mammals and humans than many other animals. Humans have more association <b>cortex,</b> sensory and motor parts than other mammals such as the rat and the cat.|$|E
5|$|The prefrontal <b>cortex</b> plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal <b>cortex</b> correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal <b>cortex</b> (DLPFC), anterior cingulate <b>cortex,</b> angular prefrontal <b>cortex,</b> right prefrontal <b>cortex,</b> and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal <b>cortex.</b> Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal <b>cortex</b> as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal <b>cortex</b> and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral <b>cortex</b> in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal <b>cortex</b> and posterior parietal <b>cortex,</b> areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal <b>cortex</b> and parietal lobe.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of A.laevigatum, all species have a thin separating layer, the <b>cortex,</b> between the hymenium and the tomentum. A <b>cortex</b> is also present on many Stereum fungi (on a broader front) and serves to bend up the fruit body. As this <b>cortex</b> is missing on A.laevigatum, its fruit body lies flat on the bark.|$|E
50|$|The perirhinal <b>cortex's</b> {{role in the}} {{formation}} and retrieval of stimulus-stimulus associations (and in virtue of its unique anatomical position in the medial temporal lobe) {{suggest that it is}} part of a larger semantic system that is crucial for endowing objects with meaning.|$|R

50|$|Vernon Mountcastle's {{formulation}} of a cortical column {{is a basic}} element in the framework. Hawkins places particular emphasis {{on the role of}} the interconnections from peer columns, and the activation of columns as a whole. He strongly implies that a column is the <b>cortex's</b> physical representation of a state in a state machine.|$|R
5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral <b>cortex.</b> These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar <b>cortex</b> is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar <b>cortex</b> passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|As Crash gathers the {{remaining}} crystals, he is attacked by several mutated animals dispatched by Brio, including the demented kangaroo Ripper Roo, the scimitar-wielding Komodo Brothers Moe and Joe, and the musclebound Tiny Tiger. During Crash's progression, Coco occasionally hacks into his holograph projector and warns Crash of her uncertainty of Cortex's true intentions. It is not until Crash has gathered the crystals that Coco {{is able to}} reveal Cortex's ultimate plan: with the energy harnessed from the planetary alignment, <b>Cortex</b> will power the gigantic <b>Cortex</b> Vortex built onto his space station and brainwash everyone on Earth into serving his army. Crash manages to defeat <b>Cortex</b> before the crystals can be used, but leaves the <b>Cortex</b> Vortex drifting aimlessly into space. Crash redeems himself by collecting the world's gems for Brio, who reveals that the gems can harness planetary energy as well and invites him to the completion of his laser device; Crash activates the laser and destroys the <b>Cortex</b> Vortex, breaking the space station apart.|$|E
5|$|At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides <b>Cortex</b> {{for failing}} to destroy Crash and replaces <b>Cortex</b> with his niece, Nina <b>Cortex,</b> despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her {{participate}} {{in the construction of}} the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina <b>Cortex</b> inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, <b>Cortex</b> praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that acute aerobic exercise {{is associated with}} improved cognitive function. However, neural correlates of its cognitive plasticity remain largely unknown. The present study examined {{the effect of a}} session of acute aerobic exercise on working memory task-evoked brain activity as well as task performance. A within-subjects design with a counterbalanced order was employed. Fifteen young female participants (M = 19. 56, SD = 0. 81) were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a working memory task, the N-back task, both following an acute exercise session with 20 minutes of moderate intensity and a control rest session. Although an acute session of exercise did not improve behavioral performance, we observed that it {{had a significant impact on}} brain activity during the 2 -back condition of the N-back task. Specifically, acute exercise induced increased brain activation in the right middle prefrontal gyrus, the right lingual gyrus, and the left fusiform gyrus as well as deactivations in the anterior cingulate <b>cortexes,</b> the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the right paracentral lobule. Despite the lack of an effect on behavioral measures, significant changes after acute exercise with activation of the prefrontal and occipital <b>cortexes</b> and deactivation of the anterior cingulate <b>cortexes</b> and left frontal hemisphere reflect the improvement of executive control processes, indicating that acute exercise could benefit working memory at a macro-neural level. In addition to its effects on reversing recent obesity an...|$|R

5|$|From there, Crash {{crosses to}} the second of Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} {{and there is nothing}} more than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making his way across the islands, <b>Cortex</b> dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple at the start of a creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the <b>Cortex</b> Island. Crash then navigates the <b>Cortex</b> Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of <b>Cortex</b> Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E

5000|$|Much of {{the game}} {{takes place in the}} Time-Twisting Machine, which allows the {{characters}} to travel to different periods in time. The levels that take place in the Middle Ages are populated by wizards, rams, knights and frogs that transform into princes upon being kissed. The prehistoric levels take place in a Jurassic swamp and feature a Tyrannosaurus hatchling that can be mounted and ridden, restless pterodactyls and a gigantic triceratops that pursues Crash throughout the level. The Arabian levels take place on the rooftops and are overrun with swordsmen, scorpions and genies who seek to stuff Crash into their lamps. The Egyptian levels are set during the heyday of the Great Pyramids and are populated by mummies, pyramid construction crews, scarabs and cobras; in addition to the various enemies, the tombs are also overrun with traps. The future levels take place in [...] "Neo York", a city under <b>Cortex's</b> rule that features laser cannons, robots, flying saucers, force fields and moving platforms. The [...] "Lost Highway" [...] levels, in which Crash pilots a motorcycle, take place in a 1950s America highway, where Crash must race against <b>Cortex's</b> hot rodders to win Crystals, avoiding construction barricades and cops along the way. The World War I levels take place in the skies of Europe and alternatively feature Crash and Coco as the player character. In these levels, <b>Cortex's</b> fleet of dirigibles must be shot down to obtain the Crystal. The Atlantis levels feature Crash in scuba gear who must find the Crystals in the Atlantean ruins, which are rife with sharks, depth charges and poisonous blowfish. Another water-themed group of levels take place during the Golden Age of Piracy and feature Coco as the player character, who must ride a jetski and gather the Crystals {{on the surface of the}} water, avoiding pirates and water mines as she does so. The Great Wall of China levels feature Coco as the player character and are played riding on the back of a tiger cub while avoiding doddery pan carriers and Chinese dragons.|$|R
5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor <b>cortex,</b> divided into three parts: the primary motor <b>cortex,</b> found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor <b>cortex</b> travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the <b>cortex</b> and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
5|$|If Crash, Coco or Crunch win the race, Velo, {{having lost}} his {{influence}} over his subjects, dejectedly relinquishes his empire to the Bandicoots. Crash considers becoming the next emperor of the galaxy, but decides otherwise and gives control back to Velo {{in exchange for}} sending the Bandicoots back to Earth. If <b>Cortex,</b> N. Gin or Tiny win the race, Velo struggles with <b>Cortex</b> over the possession of his scepter, only to be stopped by Tiny. <b>Cortex</b> uses the scepter's power {{in an attempt to}} return to Earth, but the scepter breaks and sends <b>Cortex,</b> N.

Crash throws Coco's machine at Cortex's airship, severing the chain holding Aku Aku's cage, which causes the cage to fall into the nearby forest. After Crash rescues Aku Aku, they discover that <b>Cortex</b> and Uka Uka are stealing Mojo from a nearby temple and decide to stop them. Crash is unable to rescue his sister but manages to defeat <b>Cortex,</b> and he begins his search for Coco, interrogating Dingodile, Tiny Tiger, N. Gin, and Uka Uka on her whereabouts. Crash finally confronts and defeats Nina <b>Cortex</b> inside of the Doominator robot, liberates his sister, and averts the destruction of Wumpa Island. Feeling happy for themselves, Crash and his family decide to celebrate their victory with pancakes, which he blurts out (speaking for the first time) in joy. Soon after, in Crash: Mind over Mutant, the NV, a personal digital assistant that everyone must possess, is released to the public. However, this turns out to be a plot by Doctor <b>Cortex</b> and his old partner Doctor Nitrus Brio, who use the NV's Mojo-transmitting powers to control everyone who uses the device. Because Crash is unaffected by the NV, he is able to free his friends from the control of the NV and stop Cortex's and Brio's plot.|$|E
