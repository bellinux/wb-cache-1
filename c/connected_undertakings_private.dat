40|$|Statutory audit markets {{across the}} EU have {{recently}} been reformed, with new Regulation on the Statutory Audits of Public Interest Entities coming into force in June 2016. The Regulation imposes stricter requirements on the audits of Public Interest Entities, as originally defined in the Statutory Audit Directive 2006, with the option for Member States to designate additional entities as public interest. Thus, the exact definition of a Public Interest Entity applied varies across Member States. In the UK the definition has not been widely extended and includes listed firms, credit institutions, and insurance <b>undertakings.</b> <b>Private</b> firms in the UK are therefore currently exempt from the more stringent audit regulations. However, even based on the limited, and often mixed, evidence for the private company audit market, the decision to preclude most private companies from {{the definition of a}} Public Interest Entity, effectively excluding them from the new audit reforms, may not be appropriate. This thesis, therefore, undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the UK audit market for private companies, in addition to examining the auditing choices of private companies and the economic consequences of these choices. The UK is specifically examined because it is {{one of a number of}} countries that have chosen not to extend the scope of the definition of a Public Interest Entity beyond the one set at the EU level. The findings of this research show that, similar to the audit market for listed firms, the private company audit market in the UK is segmented with Big Four dominance among the largest firms and relatively low levels of auditor switching. As a result of this audit environment, private companies that do switch auditor are found to experience economic consequences in terms of a reduction in their credit ratings. Particularly when the reasons for a switch are unknown to investors. In addition, the thesis provides evidence to suggest that following an auditor switch, firms receive both physical and implicit discounts on their audit fees, with price recovery of these discounts over the following three years. Suggesting that low-balling is also present in this audit market, which in turn raises concerns regarding competitive pricing and levels of auditor independence. In sum, the results of the thesis provide strong support that the definition and scope of a Public Interest Entity needs revisiting both within the UK and across all EU Member States. Moreover, it reinforces the idea of extending some of the more stringent audit requirements introduced by the EU Regulation on the Statutory Audits of Public Interest Entities, to ensure that economically important private firms have sufficient oversight. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to examine the sphere of legitimate State measures. Member States intervene in many ways in the operation of the internal market and in the activities of <b>private</b> <b>undertakings.</b> When public authorities exercising public powers take measures, which can affect the competition between private entities, the pursuit may lead to the distortion of competition within the internal market. Similarly, fundamental freedoms can be restricted, if access to the market is prohibited or rendered less attractive. The main legal instrument of this study is Article 106 (1) TFEU, which prohibits Member States from circumventing Treaty rules by granting tasks of public authority to public or <b>private</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The provision will be assessed as regards to competition law (Article 102 TFEU) and fundamental freedoms (Article 49 TFEU regarding freedom of establishment and Article 56 TFEU regarding freedom to provide services). In addition, Article 106 (2) TFEU, which provides a derogation from Treaty rules for the Member States in certain situations, will be addressed. State measures which violate the above-mentioned Articles can in some cases be justified in order to pursue the Union’s objective of social market economy. They can be regarded legitimate when they are correcting market failures on areas where certain important activities or services would not be provided merely by the market mechanism. In addition, justifications based on overriding reasons of general/public interest, may materialize when restricting fundamental freedoms. In summary, the first research question is whether State measures create obstacles to the internal market. Additionally, it will be examined, when State measures can be justified. Often the CJEU carries out a balancing act between the restrictive measure and a possible justification. In the end, the fulfilment of fundamental freedoms will be assessed in cases related to State measures, by applying the market access test...|$|R
