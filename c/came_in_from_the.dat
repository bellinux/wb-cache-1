However, {{in the bottom of the}} third, the Red Sox scored three runs after seven consecutive batters reached base, giving them a five-run lead. Dan Haren <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cardinals' bullpen to replace Williams during the inning.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the {{original}} part of State Route 24 {{was replaced by}} U.S. Route 40 Alternate, which continued south on U.S. 99W from Woodland to Davis and southeast on U.S. 395 to Reno, Nevada to join U.S. 40 at both ends. A direct route from Marysville south to Sacramento {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1949 as Route 232, and later became part of a rerouted State Route 24. The U.S. 40 Alternate designation was short-lived, and was mostly replaced by State Route 70 in the 1964 renumbering. Southwest of Marysville, former U.S. 40 Alternate instead became State Route 113, and SR 70 ran south along former State Route 24 (Route 232) to a point north of Sacramento, where the new State Route 99 <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northwest and continued south. Despite SR 70 always ending at State Route 99, it was once signed along State Route 99 (El Centro Road, Garden Highway, and the Jibboom Street Bridge) to Sacramento.|$|E

25|$|British actor Rupert Davies {{had many}} roles in {{productions}} at the theatre in the camp; {{his most famous}} roles on film and TV may have been Inspector Maigret in the BBC series Maigret that aired over 52 episodes from 1960 to 1963 and George Smiley in the movie The Spy Who <b>Came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cold.|$|E
25|$|In {{the time}} of the Ukrainian Directorate government, with its {{dictator}} Symon Petlura, the city had periods of uncertain power. At times the anarchists of Nestor Makhno held the city, and at others Denikin's Volunteer Army. Military operations of the Red Army, which <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> North, captured the city in 1919, and despite attempts by Russian General Wrangel in 1920, he was unable to reach Yekaterinoslav.

25|$|The late 17th {{and early}} 18th centuries became the 'Golden Age of the Azulejo', the {{so-called}} Cycle of the Masters (Ciclo dos Mestres). Mass production was started {{not just because}} of a greater internal demand, but also because of large orders <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese colony of Brazil. Large one-off orders were replaced by the less expensive use of repetitive tile patterns. Churches, monasteries, palaces and even houses were covered inside and outside with azulejos, many with exuberant Baroque elements.|$|E
25|$|In Lancashire, as in Cheshire, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, and Lincolnshire, {{the cause}} of Parliament was in the ascendant. Resistance revived in the West Riding towns, Lord Fairfax was again {{in the field in}} the East Riding of Yorkshire, and even Newark was closely besieged by Sir John Meldrum. More {{important}} news <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north. The advanced guard of the Scottish army had passed the Tweed on 19 January, and Newcastle, with the remnant of his army, would soon be attacked in front and rear at once.|$|E
25|$|After the Spaniards {{conquered the}} Central American {{region in the}} 16th century, pirates began prowling Lake Nicaragua. They <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean Sea via the San Juan River. The {{inhabitants}} of Ometepe were hard hit. The pirates kidnapped women, stole the inhabitants' animals, possessions, and harvest, and erected settlements on the shore, making it their refuge. This made the local population move to higher grounds on the volcanoes in search of shelter. The island was finally settled by the Spanish conquistadors {{at the end of}} the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|Espionage novelist David John Moore Cornwell, {{better known}} as John le Carré, whose books include The Spy Who <b>Came</b> <b>in</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy has lived in St Buryan for more than forty years. Many of his novels have been adapted for film, the most recent being Our Kind of Traitor in 2016. The author Derek Tangye, who died in 1996, also lived and wrote in the parish for many years, writing over twenty books, the Minack Chronicles, about life in rural Cornwall (Minack {{deriving}} from Dorminack Farm). Sam Peckinpah's 1971 film Straw Dogs, starring Dustin Hoffman, was filmed in St Buryan.|$|E
25|$|Three documentaries on Roberts {{have been}} released. The {{first was the}} 1997 {{documentary}} BBC/PBS Monty Roberts: The Real Horse Whisperer.

Other documentaries include the 1999 film Shy Boy: The Horse That <b>Came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wild and a 2005 documentary on Roberts' work with wild horses and another about his work with aboriginal youth on Palm Island, Australia. In 2006, a DVD series with 17 episodes, named A Backstage Pass! was completed and broadcast in the UK. The series has also been broadcast in the US on the HRTV cable channel.|$|E
25|$|During the {{formation}} of the GLTZ, the MRV protocontinent consumed the Superior province's oceanic crust as the subprovince <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south. Suturing of one continental block onto another usually occurs because a subduction zone exists beneath one of the blocks. The subduction zone consumes the oceanic crust connected to the other block. After the oceanic crust is consumed, the two blocks meet and the subducting oceanic crust pulls the attached continental block under the other. During the collision with the Superior province, the MRV gneissic block was thrust up onto the Superior province's edge; this resulted in a thrusted crumpled fault tens of kilometers wide producing a mountain range, and a shear zone which defines the boundary between the two terranes. Tectonism along the zone began during the docking of the two terranes into a single continental mass, and culminated in the early Proterozoic, where deformation took place under low to intermediate pressures.|$|E
2500|$|Lewes, {{from its}} inception, {{has been an}} {{important}} transport hub. Its site as a bridging point was probably originally a ford: today the main routes avoid the town centre. The A27 trunk road [...] taking traffic along the south coast between Eastbourne and Southampton passes to the south of the town. <b>The</b> A26 <b>from</b> Maidstone to Newhaven; and the A275 (the London road) both <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north. The Brighton & Hove bus company and Compass Travel serve the town. The bus station was closed for a while but reopened in late 2008.|$|R
50|$|Another fish is the alewife and its cousin, the blueback herring, collectively {{known as}} river herring or simply herring. Both migrate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ocean into the fresh {{water of the}} Malden River every spring to spawn. Striped bass, a prized {{saltwater}} fish, also <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ocean to spawn and prey on the herring. Other fish, like bluegill, largemouth bass, and catfish, are less common.|$|R
30|$|This {{modelling}} seems unrealistic, as in {{real life}} <b>the</b> air <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> every direction and the material is air permeable. However, when there are slits in the water proof garments, {{the effect of the}} slit is much bigger than the material itself. As a first step to investigate the direction of air flow that <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hem line, it could be more useful to simplify the model as much as possible.|$|R
25|$|Soon, reports {{came in from}} Allied {{aircraft}} that German tanks were approaching and the order was given to clear the ridges to utilise its advantageous terrain for the upcoming tank battle. At 17:30 reports <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> forward observers that the defences were withdrawing from Hafid Ridge. This seemed like the ideal time to strike, so the order was given for Squadron B of the 6th Royal Tank Regiment to attack. After clearing the first ridge, {{it looked as though}} the reports were accurate, as German trucks and towed guns were seen moving away over the second crest. Pursuit began but upon the British forces clearing the second ridge, the Axis forces sprung their trap and fired on the Crusader tanks at near point-blank range with waiting guns; within minutes, 11 of the Crusaders were destroyed and six more heavily damaged. The Axis infantry and anti-tank guns, bereft of entrenchments, also took significant casualties. Over 30 German tanks from a battalion of the 5th Panzer Regiment, part of the 5th Light Division which had earlier been stationed north at Sidi Azeiz, were seen arriving from the west. As it was starting to grow dark, neither side closed with the other and the 7th Armoured Brigade slowly withdrew during long range fighting.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} the diner where the Observers discuss Peter's {{existence}} featured [...] "California Dreamin'" [...] by vocal group The Mamas & the Papas. Other songs featured in the episode included [...] "Rockin' Robin" [...] by Bobby Day and [...] "Cinderella in the Palace" [...] by Sergei Prokofiev, the latter performed by the National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine. Walter later quotes {{a line from the}} 1963 John le Carre novel The Spy Who <b>Came</b> <b>In</b> <b>From</b> <b>The</b> Cold.|$|E
500|$|... "The Pine Bluff Variant" [...] {{was based}} on the idea of Mulder going undercover, a topic that Shiban had wanted to work on for a {{majority}} of the fifth season. Shiban argued that the concept worked for the series because the theme of Mulder questioning his beliefs was a major element of the fifth season. The episode was indirectly influenced by the 1963 novel The Spy Who <b>Came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cold, written by John le Carré. The title is also a reference to the Pine Bluff Arsenal, a real United States military base with stockpiles of chemical weapons.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{air mass}} type brings in {{different}} temperature and moisture properties. The continental polar air mass brings in cold and dry air from central Canada, traveling south across the region. The continental tropical air mass <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, bringing in hot and dry air while moving north. The maritime tropical air mass comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southwest United States and Northern Mexico, and {{it tends to}} bring in warm and moist air, but sometimes the air that <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> is dry. The last air mass that affects this ecoregion is the maritime polar air mass. It <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean and moves east over the mountain regions. It brings in cool moist air that changes to warm dry air after moving over the mountains. These air masses cause the seasons to be very extreme and drastic. The winter time brings harsh and varied weather. The midsummer months bring in warm moist and dry air, depending on the area within the region and what air masses affect those areas.|$|R
5|$|Route22 {{continues}} heading northeast along {{a narrow}} strip of land between the East Branch and Bog Brook reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas {{of the town of}} Patterson, where two local state highways, NY312 and 164, <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, NY311, and passing another strip plaza, NY22 crosses into Dutchess County.|$|R
50|$|During Season 3, she {{and fellow}} detectives Stanley Bolander and Beau Felton are shot {{while trying to}} serve an arrest warrant on a suspect. Howard is struck in the heart, but {{eventually}} makes a full recovery and returns to work. Her family <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coast to visit her in the hospital; her father is especially concerned over how little information the doctors are willing to share.|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{influenced}} by the 1963 novel The Spy Who <b>Came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cold, written by John le Carré. Both the book and author are favorites of Shiban. Because the Cold War had been over, he used the opportunity to introduce a new [...] "bogeyman", in this case domestic terrorism. The writing staff used then-recent fears about Saddam Hussein's alleged production of biological weapons to craft the basic premise of the script. The title is also a reference to the Pine Bluff Arsenal, a real military base with stockpiles of chemical weapons. Shiban also recalled that the 1995 action film Heat was an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Reese, various other {{suggestions}} were made for the role including rock musician Sting. Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the film was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his [...] "feelings about the project changed". Hurd stated that [...] "almost everyone else who <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off." [...] To get into Kyle Reese's character, Biehn studied the Polish resistance movement in World War II.|$|E
500|$|When {{the tornado}} touched down, the winds had {{increased}} {{to at least}} [...] and were coming from the east, perpendicular to the bridge, which ran north–south. An investigation determined that Towers 10 and 11 had collapsed first, in a westerly direction. Meanwhile, Towers 12 through 14 had actually been picked up off of their foundations, moved slightly to the northwest and set back down intact and upright, held together by only the railroad tracks on the bridge. Next towers four through nine collapsed to the west, twisting clockwise, as the tornado started to move northward. As it moved north, inflow winds <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south and caused Towers 12, 13, and 14 to finally collapse towards the north, twisting counterclockwise.|$|E
50|$|Done by Mirrors is {{the second}} solo album of Andi Deris, vocalist of the power metal band Helloween. In Japan, it was {{released}} in 1999, but due to record company conflicts, had {{to be released in}} 2000 {{in the rest of the}} world. The sound is different from Helloween, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous album, <b>Come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rain, with the dark thematic who would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> 2000 with Helloween's album The Dark Ride.|$|R
25|$|Another short route, County Route 58, {{formerly}} NY456, <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{west and}} terminates at 9 {{shortly after the}} right turn for Point Au Roche State Park. Continuing northward, the road deviates to the east slightly in the Town of Chazy, but returns to its previous track by the interstate at the Little Chazy River bridge. Shortly afterwards, US 9 intersects County Route 23 (Miner Farm Road, formerly NY191 west of US 9).|$|R
