5|$|Due {{partly to}} the limited success of his latest book outside Indiana, Riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to attempt to form an {{association}} to promote their work. Popular Indiana writer Lew Wallace, author of , was a major promoter of the effort. During 1885, {{more than one hundred}} writers joined the group. They held their first meeting in July, naming themselves the Western Association of Writers. At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president, and Riley vice president. The association never succeeded in its goals of creating a powerful advertising force, but became a social club and a rival literary <b>community</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern writing establishment. Riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group, but came to depend on its regular meetings as a escape from his normally hectic schedule.|$|E
5|$|NY36 {{continues}} on, {{passing through}} the hamlet of Sonyea and serving the Groveland Correctional Facility on {{its way into the}} town of Mount Morris and the village of the same name, where it becomes Main Street in the latter. It continues through the mostly residential <b>community</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> business district {{in the heart of the}} village, which NY408 enters from the southwest on Chapel Street and leaves to the northeast on State Street. In between Chapel and State streets, NY36 and NY408 overlap for one block along Main Street. Immediately north of Mount Morris, NY36 passes through the northern tip of Letchworth State Park and crosses the Genesee River, which separates the towns of Mount Morris and Leicester. As the route heads north into Leicester, it begins to leave the flats in favor of a more northwesterly alignment that leads it into the village of Leicester.|$|E
5|$|NY43 was {{extended}} slightly following {{the construction of}} a new alignment for NY30 near Central Bridge in the early 1940s. NY30 now left its old alignment southeast of Central Bridge and bypassed the <b>community</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. The former routing of NY30 into Central Bridge became an extension of NY43, which overlapped NY30 between the new alignment and Schoharie. When NY30A replaced NY148 in the late 1950s, the short piece of NY43 near Central Bridge became part of NY30A and NY43 was truncated back to NY30 near Schoharie. In the late 1960s, NY43 was rerouted through downtown Rensselaer to follow 3rd Avenue (previously NY381) east to US4. From there, NY43 overlapped US4 northward to Defreestville, where it rejoined its previous alignment.|$|E

The school's ultimate goal is to produce competitive graduates who have an appreciation for scholarship, perform well on meaningful assessments, make meaningful contributions to society, behave with civility and respect, and perform as reasonable leaders.|$|E
5|$|Housing {{and social}} {{organization}} among the Mikea {{can vary from}} one individual or <b>community</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next. Some Mikea remain in the forest their entire lives, while others live {{part of their lives}} in villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of virgin forest in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of thatch and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for three to five years as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses. During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups that relocate deeper into the forest to settle near babo tuber patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and thatch sunshades, and some individuals not living in shelters at all. In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.|$|E

5|$|Naturalist {{and popular}} artist John Gould {{illustrated}} {{and described the}} koala in his three-volume work The Mammals of Australia (1845–63) and introduced the species, {{as well as other}} members of Australia's little-known faunal <b>community,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general British public. Comparative anatomist Richard Owen, in a series of publications on the physiology and anatomy of Australian mammals, presented a paper on the anatomy of the koala to the Zoological Society of London. In this widely cited publication, he provided the first careful description of its internal anatomy, and noted its general structural similarity to the wombat. English naturalist George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the Zoological Society of London, was the first to correctly classify the koala as a marsupial in the 1840s. He identified similarities between it and its fossil relatives Diprotodon and Nototherium, which had been discovered just a few years before. Similarly, Gerard Krefft, curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney, noted evolutionary mechanisms at work when comparing the koala to its ancestral relatives in his 1871 The Mammals of Australia.|$|E
