The elimination of the starter-sheet suspension loops also improved cathode quality. In SX-EW operations, the use of stainless-steel <b>cathode</b> <b>plates</b> eliminates lead flakes and other debris from the cathode copper.|$|R
50|$|The {{chloride}} in the {{leach solution}} at Port Pirie {{proved to be}} a problem for the stainless steel cathodes of the Isa Process. A small amount of the chloride ions in the leach solution passed through the solvent into the electrolyte, leading to a reported chloride concentration of 80 milligrams per liter (“mg/L”) in the electrolyte. The presence of the chloride in the electrolyte caused pitting corrosion of the stainless steel <b>cathode</b> <b>plates.</b> After trying other types of stainless steel, BHAS switched to using titanium <b>cathode</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Isa Process {{technology}} used the waxed edge {{at the bottom}} of the <b>cathode</b> <b>plate</b> to stop the copper depositing around the plate’s bottom to form a single mass of copper running from the top of one side of the <b>cathode</b> <b>plate</b> around the bottom to the top of the other side. The copper was stripped from the cathode plates as two separate sheets. The Kidd Process technology did not use wax, as it was thought that it could exacerbate the impurity problems with which the plant had been struggling. At Kidd, the stripping approach was to remove the copper from the <b>cathode</b> <b>plate</b> as a single “V”-shaped cathode product, akin to a taco shell.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} cathode {{stripping machine}} {{was based on}} that used at the Hikoshima plant of the Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company of Japan. However, considerable development work was necessary to modify the design to handle the copper cathodes, which were heavier than those at Hikoshima, and to process the <b>cathode</b> <b>plates</b> without damaging them. The machines also had to be redesigned to allow for waxing the sides and bottoms of the <b>cathode</b> <b>plates</b> to allow the next copper cathode sheets to be removed easily.|$|R
50|$|The Kidd Process {{development}} team modified its <b>cathode</b> <b>plates</b> to {{cope with}} high-corrosion environments, such as the liberator cells used to remove contaminants in refineries and some high-corrosion environments in electrowinning plants.|$|R

50|$|This was {{achieved}} by machining a 90° “V”-groove into the bottom edge of the cathode. The groove weakens {{the structure of the}} copper growing at the bottom edge of the <b>cathode</b> <b>plate</b> because the copper crystals grow perpendicular to the <b>cathode</b> <b>plate</b> from opposite sides of the groove, causing them to intersect at right angles to each other. A discontinuity in the structure is formed at the intersection that results in a weak zone, along which the copper splits during stripping.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for high-velocity gas flow sputtering, said device {{consisting of a}} hollow cathode, an anode and a gas inlet device for inert gas, whereby the outlet opening of the gas and material particle flow out of the hollow cathode is arranged opposite the substrates. The hollow cathode according to the invention consists of two <b>cathode</b> <b>plates</b> arranged axially at a distance to each other, said <b>cathode</b> <b>plates</b> having central boreholes, and an anode and a gas inlet device which are all arranged centrally or coaxially {{in relation to the}} hollow cathode. The device according to the invention can also consist of several hollow cathodes which are arranged axially in a row. In the latter case, single anodes can be allocated centrally or coaxially to the single hollow cathodes as anodes...|$|R

Xstrata Technology worked with a manufacturer to produce sheets that did meet the required flatness tolerance.|$|R

50|$|The {{stripping}} wedges {{are mounted}} on two robotic arms, {{one for each}} side of the <b>cathode</b> <b>plate.</b> These arms strip the copper from the plate and lay the sheets of cathode copper onto conveyors for them to be taken away for bundling.|$|E
50|$|The {{stripping}} machines included receiving and discharge conveyors, washing, separation, cathode stacking and discharging, <b>cathode</b> <b>plate</b> separation for refurbishing, and the wax {{applications for}} the sides and bottoms of the cathode plates. The original CRL stripping machine had the capability of stripping 250 cathode plates per hour.|$|E
50|$|In the refinery, copper anodes {{coming from}} the smelter are electro-refined to produce cathodes having 99.99% Cu and {{conforming}} to LME grade A. This is done by putting anodes and cathodes alternately in a cell, in which copper sulphate electrolyte solution is circulated and current is passed. Copper ions thus generated from anodes move towards cathode and get deposited on starter <b>plates</b> <b>cathodes.</b> The <b>cathode</b> <b>plates</b> are taken out from the cells at a certain interval. The cathodes thus produced are bundled and are mostly exported.|$|R
50|$|From 2001 to 2007, nickel {{prices rose}} {{from an average}} of US$5945 to US$37,216. Nickel is a key {{constituent}} of 316L stainless steel. This, combined with increases in some of the other constituents of the 316L alloy, prompted Xstrata Technology (by then the marketing organisation for the Isa Process technology) to seek an alternative material for the <b>cathode</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{lower cost}} of the <b>cathode</b> <b>plates</b> {{compared}} to starter sheets means that shorter cathode cycle times are possible. The cycle time can range from 5 to 14 days, but a seven-day cathode cycle is common. This shorter cycle time improves current efficiency as less short circuits occur and there is less nodulation of the cathode surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the Isa Process tank house technology had its beginning in the zinc industry. During the mid-1970s, MIM Holdings Limited (“MIM”) was considering building a zinc refinery in Townsville to treat the zinc concentrate produced by its Mount Isa operations. As a result, MIM staff visited the zinc smelters using the best-practice technology and found that modern electrolytic zinc smelters had adopted permanent <b>cathode</b> <b>plate</b> and mechanised stripping technology.|$|E

50|$|The {{new design}} improved, among other things, the {{discharge}} {{area of the}} stripper. This had been a problem area for the carousel stripping machines, in which copper released from the <b>cathode</b> <b>plate</b> fell into an envelope and was then transferred to a material handling device. Copper that misbehaved and failed to transfer often required manual intervention. The new robot discharge system eliminated the free falling of the copper and physically transferred the released copper to the discharge location.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} integration of design patterns and mobile applications, {{in the development of}} software management of plates (SIGEP) that allows to support in the solutions to problematics that they appear in the process of maintaining of <b>plates</b> copper <b>cathodes</b> of a Mining Company, in our case for Quebrada Blanca S. A. (CMQB S. A.). These problematics mainly are related to the little control over the tasks carried out in the maintaining to the cathodic plates, and the lack of information that leads to this practice, originates a deficient management and it does not allow to make opportune decisions referring to these elements, and therefore it does to project and to administer the life utility of the <b>plates</b> of <b>cathodes,</b> generating lifted costs associated to this process. As the process of maintaining a <b>cathode</b> <b>plates</b> constantly changing process, with respect to maintenance strategies in the system design SIGEP recognizing the flexibility and reuse in the design of system components, this achieved through design patterns used. The SIGEP implementation of the system and the incorporation of a mobile application, meant for CMQB S. A. increase control of the tasks carried out <b>plates</b> <b>cathodes,</b> allowing the company to detailed information on the maintenance of these elements, allowing among other things, identify <b>cathode</b> <b>plates</b> which are more expensive, and therefore knowing what must be replaced.

50|$|Electrodeposited copper adheres quite {{firmly to}} the {{stainless}} steel {{so that it does}} not detach during refining. The vertical edges of {{the stainless steel}} plates are covered with tight-fitting polymer edge strips to prevent copper depositing {{around the edge of the}} <b>cathode</b> <b>plate</b> and so make it easier to strip the cathode copper from them. The bottom of the cathode plates were masked with a thin film of wax, again to prevent the copper depositing around the bottom edge. Wax was used rather than an edge strip to avoid having a ledge that would collect falling anode slimes and contaminate the cathode copper.|$|E
50|$|The {{variation}} in copper deposits on the cathode plates {{was one of}} the difficulties encountered with the earlier stripping machines. Areas of thin copper on the cathode plates, which are caused by short circuits, are difficult to separate from the stainless steel plate due to their lack of rigidity. Plates bearing such areas generally had to be rejected from the stripping machine and stripped manually. Similarly, sticky copper deposits (generally related to poor surface condition on the <b>cathode</b> <b>plate,</b> such as corroded surfaces or improper mechanical treatment), heavily nodulated cathode and laminated copper caused problems for stripping.|$|E
5000|$|Calcium {{and other}} alkali {{precipitate}} buildup will occur naturally on the <b>cathode</b> <b>plate,</b> {{and sometimes in}} the pool itself as [...] "scaling". Regular maintenance of the cell is necessary; {{failure to do so}} will reduce the effectiveness of the cell. Certain designs of saline chlorinators use a [...] "reverse-polarity" [...] design that will regularly switch the roles of the two electrodes between anode and cathode, causing this calcium buildup to dissolve off the accumulating electrode. Such systems reduce, but do not eliminate, the need to clean the electrolytic cell and the occurrence of calcium scale in the water.|$|E
