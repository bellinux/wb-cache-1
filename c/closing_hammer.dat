5000|$|In modern catch wrestling circles, {{the term}} [...] "sleeper hold" [...] {{refers to a}} {{variation}} of the rear naked choke in which the individual performing the hold snakes the leverage arm across the opponent's throat (in the same manner as the traditional rear naked choke) and grasps their opposite shoulder, rather than the biceps. The opposite hand is also placed against the base of the opponent's skull {{in the form of a}} <b>closed</b> <b>Hammer</b> Fist, or on top of the head. The attacking wrestler then squeezes his/her elbows together, pushes forward with the hammer fist (if used), and crunches forward with the abdominal muscles, producing an extremely tight and fast-acting choke.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, British League Division Two {{speedway}} {{returned to}} Hull {{for the first}} time since 1949 and proved to be exceedingly popular with large crowds cheering on the Hull Vikings each Wednesday. Hull had the dubious distinction of being the very last league speedway team ever to appear at the famous West Ham Stadium, on 23 May 1972, when they beat the <b>closing</b> <b>Hammers</b> 40-38. Subsequent years saw their promotion to the first division and the inclusion of world champions Barry Briggs, Ivan Mauger and Egon Müller to ride for the team. Promotional changes, falling crowds and financial problems eventually saw the Vikings demise until their resurrection some years later at Hull's other rugby league and speedway stadium, Craven Park.|$|R

5000|$|In 2010, Pioneer Arms, of Radom, Poland, began {{producing}} a semi-auto only {{version of the}} PPS design, called the PPS-43c. The gun, sold with its stock fixed in the closed position, is legally considered a pistol in the United States. The gun is of a <b>closed</b> bolt, <b>hammer</b> fired, blow back operated design {{as opposed to the}} open-bolt design of the PPS-43. According to a report in the July 20, 2012 edition of Shotgun News, the PPS-43C utilizes many parts from unissued PPS-43 submachine guns mounted on new PPS-43C receivers.|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{production}} of Inconel 718 (IN- 718) hemispherical domes by <b>closed</b> die <b>hammer</b> forging is proposed. Different combination of operations employed for production are as follows: (i) preforging + final forging + air cooling, (ii) preforging + final forging + controlled cooling, (iii) direct forging + controlled cooling, and (iv) direct forging + air cooling. Last three combinations yielded a crack free hemispherical dome. The forged hemispherical domes were solution annealed at 980 °C for 1 [*]h and air cooled. The grain size of the domes at all locations was finer than ASTM No 4. Mechanical properties of the forged dome in solution treated and aged condition (STA) were better than feedstock used...|$|R
5000|$|Most hammers follow Marin le Bourgeoys's design, {{and have}} a [...] "half-cocked" [...] {{position}}, which is the [...] "safe" [...] position since pulling the trigger from this position does not cause the gun to fire. From this position, the frizzen can be opened, and powder can {{be placed in the}} pan. Then the frizzen is <b>closed,</b> and the <b>hammer</b> is pulled back into the [...] "full cocked" [...] position, from which it is fired.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of the model 1870, the Governor of New York ordered 15,000 Remington rolling block rifles and bayonets for his state's militia. These model 1871 rifles were very similar to the model 1870 rifles, but {{differed}} in some details. Field experience with the model 1870 showed that the mechanism jammed too easily in dusty conditions. Users also did not like loading the weapon at full cock. The model 1871 included a locking bolt in the breech mechanism. The user pulled the hammer to the full cock position, retracted the breech block spur to expose the chamber, and inserted the cartridge. When the breech block <b>closed,</b> the <b>hammer</b> automatically fell to the half cock position, and the weapon could not be fired until the hammer was once again pulled to the full cock position.|$|R
50|$|Montal's {{patented}} inventions included double escapement (repetition) action {{designs for}} both grands and upright; a grand piano with inverted soundboard (the soundboard above the strings); a transposition system whereby the piano keyboard could be shifted sharp or flat by several semitones; {{a system of}} adjustable iron bars (contre-tirage/counter-tension) to allow for adjustment of the case to match environmental condition; a soft pedal (pédale d’expression) that moved the <b>hammers</b> <b>closer</b> to the string and reduced key dip proportionally; and others.|$|R
2500|$|According {{to musical}} {{instrument}} scholar Grant O'Brien, the inverted wrestplank is [...] "still {{to be found}} in pianos dating from a period 150 years after [...] death." [...] (...) [...] In modern pianos, the same basic principle is followed: the contact point for the vibrating length of the string that is <b>close</b> to the <b>hammers</b> is either an agraffe or the capo d'astro bar; these devices pull the string in the direction opposite to the hammer blow, just as in Cristofori's original arrangement.|$|R
60|$|Night {{had long}} fallen; long ago the lamps and the shop-fronts {{had begun to}} glitter down the endless streets; the lobby was pitch-dark; and, as the devil would have it, Morris barked his shins and sprawled all his length over the {{pedestal}} of Hercules. The pain was sharp; his temper was already thoroughly undermined; by a last misfortune his hand <b>closed</b> on the <b>hammer</b> as he fell; and, in a spasm of childish irritation, he turned and struck at the offending statue.

50|$|The {{straight}} claw {{serves the}} dual purpose of removing nails and {{acting as a}} crow bar to pry apart (rip) lumber. It does not have as much leverage for removing nails as a curved claw hammer when using {{the face of the}} claw as the fulcrum, but the handle can be pulled to the side to greatly increase leverage by using a very short fulcrum. For pulling nails, a wooden block can be placed under the head of the <b>hammer</b> <b>close</b> to the nail to increase leverage.|$|R

Molinar, listening in, sees no further use for Gredson and has him killed. Then he and his goons go to the office. A fight breaks out, during which Molinar finally spots the map. He hastens away with it in a taxi driven by Pop (Percy Kilbride), <b>Hammer's</b> <b>close</b> friend. Molinar takes Pop's suggestion to hide out for a while, {{only to find that}} the driver's directions lead him straight to police headquarters.|$|R
50|$|Fazioli {{currently}} offers six {{models of}} grand pianos, the largest being the Fazioli F308, which at 3.08 m (10 ft 2 in) in length {{is the longest}} piano available on the general market. The Fazioli is noted for its inclusion of a fourth pedal on the F308. This pedal brings the <b>hammers</b> <b>closer</b> to the strings, decreasing the volume while maintaining a normal tone, functioning just like the soft pedal on an upright piano. Camerata Tokyo released a Blu-ray named The Sound of the Concert Grand Fazioli F278: Costantino Catena plays Debussy and Schumann (Camerata Tokyo 2013, CMBD-80005).|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{non-standard}} variants. On some pianos (grands and verticals), the middle pedal {{can be a}} bass sustain pedal: that is, when it is depressed, the dampers lift off the strings only in the bass section. Players use this pedal to sustain a single bass note or chord over many measures, while playing the melody in the treble section. On the Stuart and Sons piano {{as well as the}} largest Fazioli piano, there is a fourth pedal {{to the left of the}} principal three. This fourth pedal works in the same way as the soft pedal of an upright piano, moving the <b>hammers</b> <b>closer</b> to the strings.|$|R

25|$|When done in high productivity, {{press forging}} is more {{economical}} than hammer forging. The operation also creates <b>closer</b> tolerances. In <b>hammer</b> forging {{a lot of}} the work is absorbed by the machinery; when in press forging, the greater percentage of work is used in the work piece. Another advantage is that the operation can be used to create any size part because there is no limit {{to the size of the}} press forging machine. New press forging techniques have been able to create a higher degree of mechanical and orientation integrity. By the constraint of oxidation to the outer layers of the part, reduced levels of microcracking occur in the finished part.|$|R
50|$|The {{main road}} through the Emmental passed through Oberburg and brought {{businesses}} and industry to the village. It {{was home to}} a hammer mill in the 17th century, wire mills in 1672 and 1761, a scythe factory in 1771 and a fulling factory in 1787. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Burgdorf made {{it very difficult for}} non-citizens of the town to settle or open businesses, so many entrepreneurs settled in Oberburg instead. In response, Burgdorf attempted to suppress businesses and industry in Oberburg. In 1698 they tried to <b>close</b> the <b>hammer</b> mill and in 1736 and 1752 they prohibited a butcher's shop and a general store, respectively, from opening. However, in the 19th century a number of new factories opened, including weaving factories, foundries, a paint factory, a machine factory, a furniture factory and a brickyard. In 1881, the Emmental Railway opened a station between Oberburg and Burgdorf which further encouraged development. By the 21st century it was a mostly commercial and industrial village surrounded by small hamlets and individual farms which remained primarily agricultural. Starting in the 1960s many residents commuted to jobs in Burgdorf or Bern.|$|R

50|$|Occidental's coal {{interests}} were represented {{for many years}} by attorney and former U.S. Senator Albert Arnold Gore, Sr., among others. Gore, who had a longtime <b>close</b> friendship with <b>Hammer,</b> became {{the head of the}} subsidiary Island Creek Coal Company, upon his election loss in the Senate. Much of Occidental's coal and phosphate production was in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in the Senate, and Gore owned shares in the company. Former Vice President Albert Arnold Gore, Jr. received much criticism from environmentalists, when the shares passed to the estate after the death of Albert Gore, Sr., and Albert Gore, Jr. was a son and the executor of the estate. Albert Gore Jr. did not exercise control over the shares, which were eventually sold when the estate closed.|$|R
50|$|The {{soft pedal}} or una corda pedal is placed leftmost {{in the row}} of pedals. In grand pianos it shifts the entire action/keyboard {{assembly}} to the right (a very few instruments have shifted left) so that the hammers hit {{two of the three}} strings for each note. In the earliest pianos whose unisons were bichords rather than trichords, the action shifted so that hammers hit a single string, hence the name una corda, or 'one string'. The effect is to soften the note as well as change the tone. In uprights this action is not possible; instead the pedal moves the <b>hammers</b> <b>closer</b> to the strings, allowing the hammers to strike with less kinetic energy. This produces a slightly softer sound, but no change in timbre.|$|R

40|$|High {{levels of}} noise usually occur {{in olive oil}} mills because of the {{machines}} used to extract olive oil with a continuous plant. In Italy Law Decree 81 / 2008 defined the requirements for assessing and managing noise risk, identifying a number of procedures to be adopted at different noise levels to limit workers exposure. This study aims at evaluating the equivalent and peak noise levels inside a modern oil mill plant area in Sicily, south Italy. Twenty measurement points were identified inside the oil mill plant area where the machines for olive oil extraction were located (about 200 m 2). The instrument used for the measurements was a precision integrating portable sound level meter, class 1, model HD 2110 L by Delta OHM, Italy. The measured sound levels exceeded the limits allowed by the regulations in all the measurement points inside the working area; values exceeding the threshold limit of 80 dB(A) were recorded coming up to a maximum value of 93. 3 dB(A) <b>close</b> to the <b>hammer</b> crusher. The operators involved are consequently obliged to wear the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversityBased on {{the field}} of {{cultural}} economics and economics of the visual arts, this dissertation focuses on microeconomics application to the market for fine arts. The first chapter investigates the relationship between the market value of a painting and the attributes of the painting and its artists. The artist's attributes are represented by the primary style and primary object of the artist significantly used in the artist's paintings. The results of the hedonic regression confirm that the market values the primary style and objects. The second chapter focuses on art museums and analyzes the effect of different types of art museums in terms of the admission policies on state residents and art visits in U. S. The study concludes that while free art is attractive for local participation, it might {{have a negative impact on}} tourist attendance. The results also show the importance of location for art museums. Finally, the third chapter analyzes premium rates and art investment by using auction sales data on impressionist and contemporary paintings. The study shows that paintings which are <b>close</b> to limit <b>hammer</b> prices tend to end up with high premium rates and low hammer prices. The art indexes that are captured from hedonic regressions show how investment on art changes with market in London and New York. Investment on impressionist and contemporary art between 2000 and 2012 in New York was relatively less risky than the market. However, investment on impressionist and contemporary art in London has no evidence for a risky investment. School of Economic Sciences, Washington State Universit...|$|R
5000|$|Arriving at the {{werewolf}} base, {{they see}} their ship near the hideout. Thor sends Hermoid and Heimdall (Raicho Vasilev) to secure it for departure, while the rest sneak in the back door. Ulfrich is waiting for them, and he and Thor fight as Sif, Freyja and Vali sneak inside. Ulfrich boasts about the power he now has. Thor thrusts his sword through Ulfrich's chest, but Ulfrich simply laughs, and begins to morph into a werewolf. Ulfrich throws Thor's sword up into a tree. Thor jumps, grabs his sword, and slices Ulfrich in two in one movement. Inside, Sif, Freyja, and Vali kill the captured and mortally wounded Viking, Aegir, to free him from his own pain, and are then confronted by Hel. She says Vali is also after the Hammer, but he disappears. Sif and Freyja do battle with Hel. Thor arrives, but is told {{to go after the}} hammer, which he does. Thor finds Fenris, who tells him he had waited a long time for Thor's return. He calls Thor, [...] "Son of Odin", implying Odin is Thor's father. Thor asks Fenris why he keeps the <b>hammer</b> <b>close.</b> Fenris replies that it is because Thor's lust for the hammer draws him to it. Thor says he'll need it back now, and Fenris tauntingly tells him to try to take it. They fight. Meanwhile, Hel kills Freyja; then Sif kills Hel. Sif promises the dead Freyja they will meet again, on the plains of Asgard. Sif goes to aid Thor; she distracts Fenris, allowing Thor time to grab the Mjölnir, with which he hammers Fenris's head. With Fenris dead, Thor and Sif briefly embrace and leave.|$|R
60|$|In one {{of those}} corners of our land canopied by the fumes of blind industry, there was, on that day, a lull in darkness. A fresh wind had split the {{customary}} heaven, or roof of hell; was sweeping long drifts of creamy clouds across a blue still pallid with reek. The sun even shone--a sun whose face seemed white and wondering. And under that rare sun all the little town, among its slag heaps and few tall chimneys, had an air of living faster. In those continuous courts and alleys, where the women worked, smoke from each little forge rose and dispersed into the wind with strange alacrity; amongst the women, too, there was that same eagerness, for the sunshine had crept in and was making pale all those dark-raftered, sooted ceilings which covered them in, together with their immortal comrades, the small open furnaces. About their work they had been busy since seven o'clock; their feet pressing the leather lungs which fanned the conical heaps of glowing fuel, their hands poking into the glow a thin iron rod till the end could be curved into a fiery hook; snapping it with a mallet; threading it with tongs on to the chain; <b>hammering,</b> <b>closing</b> the link; and; without a second's pause, thrusting the iron rod again into the glow. And while they worked they chattered, laughed sometimes, now and then sighed. They seemed {{of all ages and}} all types; from her who looked like a peasant of Provence, broad, brown, and strong, to the weariest white consumptive wisp; from old women of seventy, with straggling grey hair, to fifteen-year-old girls. In the cottage forges there would be but one worker, or two at most; in the shop forges four, or even five, little glowing heaps; four or five of the grimy, pale lung-bellows; and never a moment without a fiery hook about to take its place on the growing chains, never a second when the thin smoke of the forges, and of those lives consuming slowly in front of them, did not escape from out of the dingy, whitewashed spaces past the dark rafters, away to freedom.|$|R
