5000|$|Since the 1950s, {{the name}} [...] "fondue" [...] has been {{generalized}} to other dishes {{in which a}} food is dipped into a communal pot of liquid kept hot in a fondue pot: chocolate fondue, in which pieces of fruit or pastry are dipped into a melted <b>chocolate</b> <b>mixture,</b> and fondue bourguignonne, in which pieces of meat are cooked in hot oil or broth.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "shell" [...] {{effect in}} Magic Shell {{is due to}} the {{presence}} of coconut oil and sunflower oil, both of which contain high amounts of saturated fat, and sugar which produces a <b>chocolate</b> <b>mixture</b> which is solid at higher temperatures than would otherwise be the case with normal ice cream topping. Contrary to what many people believe, paraffin wax is not an ingredient of Magic Shell.|$|E

50|$|To {{make up the}} pudding, {{layers of}} a {{prepared}} <b>chocolate</b> pudding/icing <b>mixture</b> are alternated in a serving dish with layers of Marie biscuits dipped in warm milk. Usually, the pudding will consist of five to seven layers in total. This pudding does not require any heating, baking, or steaming.|$|R

Bentinck tours a one-man show, Love Your <b>Chocolates,</b> - a <b>mixture</b> of stories, comedy songs and multi-media, and played Frank in Educating Rita [...] at the Watermill Theatre, Newbury, Berkshire, in 2009.|$|R
50|$|The Whippet cookie is a {{distinct}} part of Quebec culture {{because it does not}} travel well outside its area of production. This is partly because the pure chocolate melts very easily (compared with a <b>chocolate</b> <b>mixture)</b> and therefore they require refrigerated transport in summer. Furthermore, the combination of the hard chocolate shell and the air-filled inner marshmallow make them self-destruct when placed in the unpressurised or semi-pressurised cargo section of an airplane. However, they are currently available at various grocery locations throughout Canada and the US.|$|E
50|$|In {{the center}} of the city of Oaxaca, various {{businesses}} grind and prepare cacao for hot chocolate drinks, moles, and more. The best known of these businesses is El Mayordomo. Inside, there large mills grind beans that are then mixed with sugar and other flavorings such as almonds and cinnamon. Most of the cacao is processed for drinking. Hot chocolate is prepared with the <b>chocolate</b> <b>mixture</b> with water or milk and heated in a pot or pitcher. Before serving, a froth is created with a special instrument is twirled rapidly by rubbing the handles between the palms. The resulting cacao beverage with the froth is named Pozonque.|$|E
50|$|The {{chocolate}} {{process begins}} by sorting and roasting the beans {{to develop a}} specific flavor. Each load of roasted beans is different and needs different roasting times to achieve the correct taste for that specific batch of chocolate. After reaching their correct sweetness, the beans are milled into broken down bits; this {{is the foundation of}} the chocolate. The next step in the process is called milling. This is where the broken bits go through a series of milling that separates cocoa butter from cocoa solids. After 12 hours, mixing begins. Sugar and non-alcoholic cocoa liquor are added to the <b>chocolate</b> <b>mixture</b> and then refined to make sure it is the correct texture and taste. This mixture is then conched. Once the chocolate develops its flavor, organic ingredients such as fruit, nuts, chilies, bread, and salt are added to make specific batches of Theo Chocolate bars. Once the chocolate is fully roasted and milled, and appropriate ingredients are added, the chocolate is then molded and packaged. Liquid chocolate is poured into molds then hand-checked by factory workers before it is wrapped and shipped.|$|E
5000|$|Catànies ( [...] , singular: catània) is a {{chocolate}} sweet typical of Vilafranca del Penedès {{and some other}} near towns made with marcona, a prestigious Catalan almond type. They are toasted and covered first by caramel and then by {{a thick layer of}} white <b>chocolate</b> or a <b>mixture</b> of almond, hazelnut and milk. Finally, they are covered by a thin layer of powdered black chocolate, sometimes mixed {{with a little bit of}} icing sugar. They are often offered as a gift or served alongside coffee after a meal.|$|R
40|$|Rheological {{properties}} {{are very important}} parameters {{in the production of}} products with high-quality and desirable texture. So far, many attempts to produce low-calorie milk chocolate have not succeeded. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the effects of sugar substitutes on rheological characteristics of prebiotic milk <b>chocolate</b> using Simplex-lattice <b>mixture</b> design. For doing this, a prebiotic compound (inulin) with two bulking agents (polydextrose and maltodextrin) at different levels (0 – 100 %) along with sucralose were used. Fifteen formulations covering the entire range of a triangular simplex were examined in order to find the optimum levels. All chocolates showed thixotropic and shear thinning behaviour and among the evaluated mathematical models, Casson model showed the best fitting for predicting rheological properties. According to our findings, chocolate formulations containing high levels of sugar substitutes (where a single component predominated) had higher moisture content, Casson viscosity and yield stress than others, including the control. In contrast, the lowest moisture content, Casson viscosity and yield stress were observed at medium levels. Therefore, the optimum values for substitution of sucrose and production of a low-calorie prebiotic milk chocolate are 8 – 28 % and 67 – 86 % for inulin, 0 – 19 % and 31 – 69 % for polydextrose and 0 – 47 % for maltodextrin, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Structured {{phospholipids}} with conjugated {{linolenic acid}} were produced for potential applications in nutraceuticals and functional foods. Structured phospholipids were synthesized with conjugated linolenic acid (CLnA) from natural sources by catalytic enzymatic reaction. Pomegranate seed oil, {{as a natural}} source of CLnA, and an isomerized-concentrated mixture (ICM) of CLnA from flaxseed oil {{were used for the}} enzymatic reaction with phosphotidylcholine (PC) using Liposyme TL IM for fatty acid modification at 57 ?C for 96 h. The enzymatic process was an effective way to produce structured phospholipids with CLnA. The maximum incorporation of CLnA from pomegranate seed oil and ICM from flaxseed oil into PC was 11. 3 % and 4. 9 % after 72 h, respectively. Structured lysophospholipids were also obtained {{as a result of the}} enzymatic reaction. The maximum incorporation of CLnA from pomegranate oil and ICM from flaxseed oil into lysophospholipids was 17. 2 % and 13. 5 % after 72 h, respectively. Physical properties such as dropping point and viscosity at 40 and 50 ?C of the structured phospholipids produced were measured when they were added to a <b>chocolate</b> <b>mixture</b> (unsweetened chocolate 94. 6 %, coconut oil 5 % and 0. 4 % phospholipids). Two controls were used for comparison: the <b>chocolate</b> <b>mixture</b> without phospholipids and the <b>chocolate</b> <b>mixture</b> with Lipoid S 100 (phosphatidylcholine 94 %). Structured phospholipids with CLnA showed lower dropping point and viscosities than the controls. Oil-in-water emulsions were prepared with whey protein (1 %), soy bean oil (10 %) and phospholipids (0. 5 %) in a high pressure homogenizer at 20 MPa. The emulsion stability of the emulsions prepared, control (without phospholipids), Lipoid S 100 and structured phospholipids with CLnA were determined by visual observation of phase separation. The structured phospholipids emulsion showed higher emulsion stability than the controls. This emulsion was stable up to 108 h while the emulsion without phospholipid and Lipoid S 100 were 48 h and 96 h stable, respectively. Oxidative stability of the emulsions prepared was determined by measuring the peroxide value and p-anisidine value after 1, 3 and 7 days at 50 ?C. Oil was extracted from the emulsions using isooctane:isopropanol (3 : 2 v/v). The structured phospholipid emulsions showed lower oxidative stability than the controls...|$|E
