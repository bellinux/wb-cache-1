50|$|In a 1997 study, the University of Florida {{found that}} a poorly-ventilated office where large amounts of <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> were used had {{significant}} levels of volatile organic compounds present in its air, whereas a well-ventilated office where little such paper was used did not. The {{study also found that}} there were higher rates of sick leave and illness complaints at the office using large amounts of <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper.</b> Another study, which was published in Environmental Health Perspectives, connected chronic occupational exposure to <b>paper</b> dust and <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> with an increased risk of adult-onset asthma.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 the Company was {{acquired}} by BAT Industries {{who went on to}} acquire Appleton Papers of the US in 1978.

5000|$|Multipart or {{multi-part}} stationery is {{paper that}} is blank, or preprinted {{as a form}} to be completed, comprising a stack of several copies, either on <b>carbonless</b> <b>paper</b> or plain paper interleaved with carbon paper. The stationery may be bound into books with tear-out sheets to be filled in manually, continuous stationery (fanfold sheet or roll) for use in suitable computer printers, or as individual stacks, usually crimped together. The purpose is to produce multiple simultaneous copies of a document produced by handwriting with a pen that applies pressure, such as a ballpoint pen, or with an impact printer. [...] The pressure of writing or impact printing on the carbon or <b>carbonless</b> <b>paper</b> transfers the content to the copy sheets. Depending upon requirements, up to typically four copies of the original can be made, with the quality and readability decreasing towards the bottom copies.This type of stationery can be used whenever multiple copies are required, of quality adequate for the purpose, usually noticeably inferior to, for example, laser-printed output. Typically a company may need a document such as an invoice to give to a customer (original), with a copy for their own accounting department (first copy), and possibly further copies for other purposes. The paper stock used is typically of low weight—thin—to transfer more printing pressure. The different copies can be on paper of different colour to distinguish them, and preprinted content may vary between copies.|$|E

50|$|Until the 1970s, {{when the}} use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was banned due to health and {{environmental}} concerns, PCBs were used as a transfer agent in <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper.</b> PCBs are readily transferred to human skin during handling of such papers, {{and it is difficult}} to achieve decontamination by ordinary washing with soap and water. In Japan, <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> is still treated as a PCB-contaminated waste.|$|R
50|$|Carbonless {{copy paper}} was first {{produced}} by the NCR Corporation. Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use carbon paper, which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the copy. <b>Carbonless</b> <b>paper</b> was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The copies were often paper of different colors (e.g. white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless copy paper can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as continuous stationery for printers designed to use it.|$|E
50|$|There {{was some}} limited secure communication: One method valid for sending {{classified}} information {{was a pair}} of one-time pads. These pads were each made of twin sets of pages, the top one of which had all letters and numbers on a line, perhaps 40 lines to a page. The top sheet was <b>carbonless</b> <b>paper.</b> To use the sheets, one circled each letter or number row-by-row on the top sheet. This marked the second sheet, which had all the letters and numbers scrambled. The scrambled version could then be transmitted by teletypewriter or telephone to the recipient who, using his matching set of one-time pads, could reverse the process and read the secure message.|$|E

50|$|Exposure {{to certain}} types of <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> or its {{components}} has resulted, under some conditions, in mild to moderate symptoms of skin irritation and irritation of the mucosal membranes of the eyes and upper respiratory tract. A 2000 review found no irritation or sensitization on contact with <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> produced after 1987. In most cases, good industrial hygiene and work practices should be adequate to reduce or eliminate symptoms. These include adequate ventilation, humidity, and temperature controls; proper housekeeping; minimal hand-to-mouth and hand-to-eye contact; and periodic cleansing of hands.|$|R

40|$|The paper industry's {{experiences}} with PCBs were chronologically reviewed {{at a recent}} "PCB Workshop " sponsored by the Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. (1). This history goes back somewhat over a year, at which time two paperboard manufacturers were apprised {{of the presence of}} PCBs in folding cartons for packaging dried fruit. These two manufacturers immediately began searching for the source of the PCB contamination, screening all converting materials used in making cartons from the paperboard. These materials, including printing inks, varnishes and adhesives, proved not to be the source of the contamination. Examination of the fibrous materials used in the paperboard showed the source of PCB contamination to be some of the paperstocks used in manufacturing the paperboard. Certain high quality white and colored paperstock grades, such as ledger papers, were found to contain <b>carbonless</b> carbon <b>papers</b> which were the source of the PCBs. PCBs at that time were used as one component of the dye carrier in the <b>carbonless</b> carbon <b>paper</b> system. The American Paper Institute, the industry association, alerted the paper industry to this source of PCB contamination. Combination paperboard manufacturers, those who use recycled fibers in paperboard manufacture, immediately adopted operating procedures to eliminate the use of <b>carbonless</b> carbon <b>papers</b> and thus to minimize the PCBs in the paperboard. This action unquestionably was essential. Yet, in one respect, it does run counter to the national interest and the goals of the solid waste progra...|$|R
50|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls {{constitute}} {{a wide array}} of now-banned organic chemicals with a variety of industrial applications. At the Kalamazoo River site, most PCBs are a result of the recycling of <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> during the 1970s, the waste products from which were dumped into the river. PCBs were produced from 1929 to 1979, when they were banned by the Toxic Substances Control Act.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> (CCP), non-carbon copy paper, or NCR paper (No Carbon Required, {{taken from}} the {{initials}} of its creator, National Cash Register) {{is a type of}} coated paper designed to transfer information written on the front onto sheets beneath.

50|$|The use {{of carbon}} copies {{declined}} {{with the advent}} of photocopying and electronic document creation and distribution (word processing). Carbon copies are still sometimes used in special applications: for example, in manual receipt books which have a multiple-use sheet of carbon paper supplied, so that the user can keep an exact copy of each receipt issued, although even here <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> is often used to the same effect.|$|R
50|$|The first dye used commercially in this {{application}} was crystal violet lactone, which {{is widely used}} today.

The dyes in <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>papers</b> may cause contact dermatitis in sensitive persons.|$|R
50|$|Dot matrix {{printers}} {{are still}} {{commonly used in}} low-cost, low-quality applications such as cash registers, or in demanding, very high volume applications like invoice printing. Impact printing, unlike laser printing, allows {{the pressure of the}} print head to be applied to a stack of two or more forms to print multi-part documents such as sales invoices and credit card receipts using continuous stationery with <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper.</b> Dot-matrix printers were being superseded even as receipt printers {{after the end of the}} twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> {{consists}} of {{sheets of paper}} that are coated with micro-encapsulated dye or ink or a reactive clay.

The lowermost sheet is coated on the top surface with a clay that quickly reacts with the dye to form a permanent mark (Coated Front, CF). Any intermediate sheets are coated with clay on top and dye on the bottom (Coated Front and Back, CFB).|$|R
50|$|The {{long-chain}} alkylphenols {{are used}} extensively as precursors to the detergents, as additives for fuels and lubricants, polymers, and as components in phenolic resins. These compounds {{are also used}} as building block chemicals that are also used in making fragrances, thermoplastic elastomers, antioxidants, oil field chemicals and fire retardant materials. Through the downstream use in making alkylphenolic resins, alkylphenols are also found in tires, adhesives, coatings, <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> and high performance rubber products.

30|$|Some {{manufacturing}} industries used PCBs for {{the production}} of transformers, capacitors, paints, sealants, flooring, paper or textiles. Such companies have used PCBs in the 100 – 1000 tonne range, with associated releases and contamination. In two factories in East Germany, manufacturing capacitors containing PCBs, approx. 580  t of PCBs from the 11, 243  t used in production has been lost during handling [65]. A company producing PCB-containing <b>carbonless</b> copy <b>paper</b> has released more than 50  t of PCBs into the environment [84].
