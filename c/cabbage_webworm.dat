40|$|AREA CONDITIONS. The {{impact of}} the release of {{irradiated}} Diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L) with a dose of 200 Gy was studied in field cage experiments by releasing of irradiated and untreated DBM at a 9 : 1 ratio. Releasing male and female (F- 1) of irradiated DBM caused a considerable level of sterility in the subsequent generations. The sterility level in those respective generations were 73. 03 % and 73. 30 %,while {{the release of the}} F- 1 male only induced a level of sterility of about 55. 40 % and 56. 44 %. Inundative releases of irradiated males caused the level of sterility to reach about 44. 78 % and 68. 01 % in F- 1 and F- 2 respectively. The effect of the release of irradiated male <b>Cabbage</b> <b>webworm</b> (CWW) moths Crocidolomia binotalis (Z), and the release of both sexes on the population were studied under laboratory cage conditions. There was a significant difference between the) effects of releasing irradiated male only and both sexes at a level of F ≤ 0. 001,where the percentage of egg hatch were 22. 78 % and 24. 75 % respectively in the F- 1 and F- 2 generations. The effects of combining two tactics, inherited sterility and the release of parasitoid Diadegma semiclausums (H) for controling DBMs were studied. The pupal viability in the F- 1 generation was 32. 5 % as compared to the untreated DBMs. The impacts of respective single tactic the release of F-...|$|E
30|$|Cabbage {{plants were}} {{assessed}} for pest infestation {{before and after}} heading, while the wrapper leaves were monitored regularly for symptoms of pest damage. Five randomly selected plants were tagged on each plot, and visible signs of damage and occurrence of insect pest larvae were assessed and data presented as number of larvae per plant (mean[*]±[*]SD). Cabbage plants were identified as infested based on observation of diamondback moth, looper and webworm larvae or their damage, and reported as number of infested plants per treatment (mean[*]±[*]SD). Diamondback moth (P. xylostella) is an important cabbage pest with average development time of 25 – 30  days from egg to pupal stage depending on weather conditions, and a complete cycle of 17 – 51  days from egg to adult. The annual number of generations varies from four in cold climates to 12 in warm climates. Diamondback moth was assessed on wrapper leaves and identified as small round holes, scratches or skeleton damage on leaves with partially damaged epidermis that gives cabbage leaves a windowpane appearance. An adult female cabbage Looper (T. ni) moth lays from 300 to 600 eggs pale yellow and round eggs in 10 – 12  days adult lifespan that hatch in 3 – 10  days, with a more rapid pupal stage in warmer temperatures. The occurrence of webworm larvae and plant damage was identified as leaves held together with silk. Each female <b>cabbage</b> <b>webworm</b> (H. undalis) lays about 75 – 250 eggs singly or in groups of 2 – 3 on the inner tissues of host plants. The hatching larvae bore into stems of growing points, weaving webs into which they place their frass. Webworm pupates in soil within webbed cocoons that include soil particles as a generation develops in about 4 – 5  weeks at 27  °C, with short-lived adults and the potential to complete 7 – 8 generations annually.|$|E
40|$|In 2003 the Collaboration on Insect Management for Brassicas in Asia and Africa (CIMBAA) public/private {{partnership}} {{selected the}} Cry 1 B/Cry 1 C Bt protein combination {{as having the}} potential to provide effective and sustainable control of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella. Following transformations and extensive plant selection, insect efficacy trials were undertaken in 2008 to 2010 in north India (Murthal near New Delhi) and south India (near Bengaluru) in large scale screen-house experiments using artificial infestations on the best performing (Elite Event) plant lines and on hybrids produced from them. Plant damage was scored {{on a scale of}} 0 (no visible damage) to 4 (plant effectively destroyed). For DBM, cabbage cluster caterpillar (Crocidolomia binotalis), <b>cabbage</b> <b>webworm</b> (Hellula undalis) and semi-looper (Trichoplusia ni) there was zero insect survival and a zero damage score on the Elite Event lines and on their hybrids, while control plants had 50 to 100 % insect survival (depending on species, life stage and trials) and damage scores of 3. 3 to 4. Cabbage white (Pieris brassicae) and common army worm (Spodoptera litura) showed some larval survival and damage scores up to 1. 4 (especially in early trials) but no survival to pupation. Screening of DBM populations worldwide (inc. 18 populations for Cry 1 B and 13 for Cry 1 C from India) showed mean LC 50 s close to that of international susceptible strains. To date F 2 screening has not identified the presence of resistance genes in DBM in the field. Cry 1 B resistance was slowly developed artificially in the laboratory but 1 C resistance and resistance to the Cry 1 B/ 1 C combination was harder to develop and had higher fitness costs. The ‘resistant’ lines showed some extended survival of stunted DBM larvae on dual gene Bt plants but no survival to pupation. There was no cross-resistance between Cry 1 B and Cry 1 C. Resistance to both genes was autosomal and recessive. Beneficial insects were demonstrated to have the potential to provide additional mortality on rare surviving insects in Bt fields. Aphids were well controlled for the first 40 days post-transplanting using imidacloprid pelleted onto seed and, if necessary, by 1 - 2 Verticillium lecanii sprays thereafter. Surviving S. litura and Helicoverpa armigera in Bt sprayed fields were well controlled by one or two application...|$|E
