5|$|The {{capacitor}} is {{a development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the <b>capacitance.</b> The unit of <b>capacitance</b> is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is the <b>capacitance</b> that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{this article}} the letters R,L and C are used with their usual {{meanings}} to represent resistance, inductance and <b>capacitance,</b> respectively. In particular {{they are used}} in combinations, such as LC, to mean, for instance, a network consisting only of inductors and capacitors. Z is used for electrical impedance, any 2-terminal combination of RLC elements and in some sections D {{is used for the}} rarely seen quantity elastance, which is the inverse of <b>capacitance.</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{presented}} an RF MEMS tuneable lowpass filter. Both distributed transmission lines and RF MEMS <b>capacitances</b> {{were used to}} replace the lumped elements. The use of RF MEMS <b>capacitances</b> gives the flexibility of tuning the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter. We have designed a low-pass filter at 9 – 12 [*]GHz cutoff frequency using the theory of stepped impedance transmission lines. A prototype of the filter has been fabricated using parallel plate <b>capacitances.</b> The variable shunt <b>capacitances</b> are formed {{by a combination of}} a number of parallel plate RF MEMS <b>capacitances.</b> The cutoff frequency is tuned from C to X band by actuating different combinations of parallel capacitive bridges. The measurement results agree well with the simulation result...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} duality and asymptotic {{stability of}} the positive linear electrical circuits are addressed. The specific duality of positive linear electrical circuits composed of resistances, inductances, <b>capacitances</b> and source voltages is established. 1) The linear electrical circuits are positive {{if and only if}} the common branches between meshes with resistances and inductances and meshes with resistances and <b>capacitances</b> contain only source voltages; 2) In linear electrical circuits the interchanges of the inductances by the <b>capacitances</b> and the <b>capacitances</b> by inductances do not change the asymptotic {{stability of the}} electrical circuits. The asymptotic stability of the positive and nonpositive electrical circuits is analyzed...|$|R
50|$|The only {{intrinsic}} limitation in commutation {{speed is}} due to the internal <b>capacitances</b> of the MOSFET (see figure 4). These <b>capacitances</b> must be charged or discharged when the transistor switches. This can be a relatively slow process because the current that flows through the gate <b>capacitances</b> is limited by the external driver circuit. This circuit will actually dictate the commutation speed of the transistor (assuming the power circuit has sufficiently low inductance).|$|R
5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier, but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the <b>capacitance</b> of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick.|$|E

It also changed CEC <b>capacitance</b> limits, and CEC commands for timer control were brought back in an altered form, with audio control commands added. It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than uncompressed raw DSD.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} practical {{techniques for}} determining stray <b>capacitances</b> in a two-winding high frequency transformer for circuit simulation and computer-aided design purposes. These techniques {{fall into two}} categories: 1) the two-port network approach; 2) the step-response approach. The first approach can be employed for high frequency transformer circuit models with the effect of stray <b>capacitances</b> modeled as a π-shape network of three lumped stray <b>capacitances.</b> The second approach is useful for the transformer circuit model with the overall effects of stray <b>capacitances</b> modeled as lumped stray-capacitance connected cross the primary side. These techniques have been verified in the modeling and numerical simulation of a 500 W 25 kHz two winding E-core transformer. The merits and limitations of these techniques are also discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Helmholtz {{explained}} why the oscillation decayed {{but he had}} not {{explained why}} it occurred in the first place. This was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was inductance present in the circuit as well as the <b>capacitance</b> of the jar and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the jar was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E
5|$|However, power {{consumption}} P by a chip {{is given by}} the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the <b>capacitance</b> being switched per clock cycle (proportional {{to the number of}} transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor {{power consumption}} led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E
5|$|Resonance was noticed {{early on}} in {{experiments}} with the Leyden jar, invented in 1746. The Leyden jar stores electricity due to its <b>capacitance,</b> and is, in fact, an early form of capacitor. When a Leyden jar is discharged by allowing a spark to jump between the electrodes, the discharge is oscillatory. This was not suspected until 1826, when Felix Savary in France, and later (1842) Joseph Henry in the US noted that a steel needle placed close to the discharge does not always magnetise in the same direction. They both independently drew the conclusion {{that there was a}} transient oscillation dying with time.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION With the {{decrease}} of feature sizes {{and the increase}} of chip dimensions in integrated circuit (IC) technology, the influence of interconnect <b>capacitances</b> on circuit performance is becoming more prominent. Therefore, the need for accurate prediction of interconnect <b>capacitances</b> [...] - to verify correct functionality of the chip before circuit fabrication, [...] - increases. At the same time, however, this problem becomes more difficult because lateral dimensions decrease more rapidly than vertical dimensions. As a result, traditional heuristic approaches to estimate the <b>capacitances</b> become inaccurate. Instead, rigorous mathematical techniques are required to model and determine interconnection <b>capacitances.</b> Possible techniques for this include the finite difference method [1, 2, 3, 4], the finite element method in which the finite elements model the electrical field [5], and the boundary or Green's function finite element method [6, 7, 8, 9], in which the finite elements...|$|R
5|$|The {{electrostatic}} design does {{away with}} two major weaknesses of boxed speakers: enclosure colourations and signal degradation {{due to the}} crossover. The crossover in the ESL consists merely of resistors which work with the inherent <b>capacitance</b> of the speaker elements to obtain a first-order response. Because it is bipolar, {{both sides of the}} elements are not enclosed, but radiate directly into the air. Thus, colourations due to crossover components and box-induced reflections are minimised.|$|E
5|$|The {{presented}} {{plots of}} image impedance, attenuation and phase change correspond to a low-pass prototype filter section. The prototype has a cut-off frequency of ωc = 1 rad/s and a nominal impedance k = 1 Ω. This {{is produced by}} a filter half-section with inductance L = 1 henry and <b>capacitance</b> C = 1 farad. This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows that}} the total <b>capacitance</b> of the {{capacitor}} Ce-cap is mainly determined by the anode <b>capacitance</b> CA when the cathode <b>capacitance</b> CK is very large compared with the anode <b>capacitance</b> CA. This requirement is given when the cathode <b>capacitance</b> CK is approximately 10 {{times higher than the}} anode <b>capacitance</b> CA. This can be easily achieved because the natural oxide layer on a cathode surface has a voltage proof of approximately 1.5V and is therefore very thin.|$|E

For predicting the values of the parasitic capacitors without building the transformer different approaches for calculating these <b>capacitances</b> are compared. A systematic summary of the known approaches is given and missing links between the different theories and missing equations are added. Furthermore, a new simple procedure for modelling parasitic <b>capacitances</b> which is based on the known approaches is proposed.
