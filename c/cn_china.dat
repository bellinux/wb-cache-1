30|$|Although {{there is}} no {{specific}} nanoparticle regulation, there are some food industry patent documents deposited in different countries. WO 2018029626, a patent application from Argentina, focused on chia oil with an edible nanoemulsion. It described a chia oil nanoemulsion comprising between 10 and 20 % of chia oil (Salvia hispanica L.), between 2 and 5 % of polysorbate, between 0.5 and 5 % {{of at least one}} emulsifier other than the polysorbate, between 0.05 and 0.2 % of at least one antioxidant, and water. Formulations of edible chia oil nanoemulsions used in transparent drinks and desserts, such as juices and jellies, were disclosed [95]. A patent application from the Republic of Korea, KR 20160005182, focused on cinnamon oil nanoemulsions to inhibit the development and increase of dangerous food microorganisms. Furthermore, this invention could not only be used for food additives, food packaging materials, preservatives, etc. but also be utilized in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries [96]. A mustard oil nanoemulsion application patent from <b>China,</b> <b>CN</b> 103315956, was prepared to alleviate the pungent smell of mustard oil to avoid volatilization, and the mustard oil may be used for bacterial resistance in food and drugs [97]. Wang Weichun Feng Wei submitted an application patent from <b>China,</b> <b>CN</b> 103750050, describing a palm oil nanoemulsion that solved the problems of high grease costs, low absorption rates, low oil content in the existing prepared palm oil nanoemulsions, large granularity, poor stability, long production periods, high equipment investments, and high production costs in existing young animal feeds. The palm oil nanoemulsion was prepared by mixing an emulsifier with palm oil, cutting and emulsifying the mixture, and ultrasonically performing cell breaking in the mixture. The process was simple, the entire reaction process was easily controlled, the entire process production period was short, the equipment investment and production costs were low, the oil content of the produced nanoemulsion was high, the distribution granularity was small, the stability was good, and the digestion by livestock increased [98].|$|R

Very low level of genetic diversity was detected (polymorphic band Conclusion Our study confirmed climate and practice independent differences in agronomic performance among jatropha collections. Such agronomic trait variations, however, were matched by very low genetic diversity and medium level but significant epigenetic diversity. Significant difference in inner cytosine and double cytosine methylation at CCGG sites was also found among populations. Most epigenetic differential markers can be inherited as epialleles following Mendelian segregation. These results suggest possible involvement of epigenetics in jatropha development. </p...|$|R

40|$|Conference Theme: East Meets West: Expanding Frontiers and DiversityOral Presentation: Session - Deaths Reported in Social MediaBackground: Controversial practices, such as faking identities, badgering unwilling {{informants}} {{to get a}} story, {{making use}} of personal documents without permission, paying people for confidential information, and so on, are in a grey zone for journalism worldwide. Objectives: To understand media professionals’ experiences with applying controversial practices when reporting suicide news in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Methods: Face-to-face interviews with 33 journalists working at popular and representative media outlets in Mainland <b>China</b> (<b>CN),</b> Hong Kong (HK), and Taiwan (TW) were conducted. Grounded theory method was used for data analysis. Results: Controversial practices were commonly and consciously adopted by journalists in the three regions when reporting suicide news. To gather suicide news tips, the journalists in the three regions commonly wrote their suicide news articles {{based on what they}} overheard. Some journalists would fake their identities to gather information and some even stole photos or documents. Many CN journalists and some HK and TW ones secretly paid money to key informants. Some TW journalists obtained information leaked from their police contacts. At a suicide scene, HK and TW journalists often neglected surviving family members’ requests to stop taking photos and continued to do so. Conclusion: Journalists’ controversial practices violate suicidal individuals and their families’ privacy. More studies are needed to investigate how suicide survivors perceive and are influenced by these practices. Social services are also needed to alert suicide survivors with these practices and empower them to reject undesirable media intrusion...|$|R

The experiment was designed to take place during school holidays (July 2015) to ensure a large and diverse number of participants, and was carried out over 3  days. At the end of their visit to the exhibition, respondents encountered a table with museum volunteers, who invited them to sample 8 unidentified smells [which were ‘chocolate’, ‘coal fire’, ‘old inn’, ‘fish market’, and ‘dirty linen’, coffee and HP sauce, sourced, respectively, from Dale Air (first five smells), the local coffee shop and Sainsbury’s supermarket] and to complete a short questionnaire, including a question that prompted them to describe the smell {{of historic}} book. This was presented using a piece of sterile gauze (9  ×  7  cm, Sterile Absorbent Gauze BP, Boots Pharmaceuticals, Nottingham NG 2 3 AA, UK) soaked in 5  mL of the book extract, left to evaporate for 1  h due to the potential toxicity of the solvent base, and placed in a metal canister (9  ×  5.5  cm, from homesale_estore Xin Zou, Qi Fu Road Baiyun District No. 5, Guangzhou, <b>CN,</b> Guangdong, 510405, <b>China)</b> with a metal mesh as a lid. The container was closed and the lid secured to the canister with a small metal screw (not included in the original container) to prevent the visitors from opening it. When the container was closed, the book aroma was detectable by the human nose from around a 7 – 10  cm distance from top of the canister. The container was labeled with a letter and no indication was given, verbally or visually, about the nature of the smell.|$|R
40|$|Web {{crawling}} {{refers to}} the process of gathering data from the Web. Focused crawlers are programs that selectively download Web documents (pages), restricting the scope of crawling to a pre-defined domain or topic. The downloaded documents can be indexed for a domain specific search engine or a digital library. In this paper, we describe the focused crawling technique, review relevant literature, and report novel experimental results. Crawling is often started with URLs that point to the pages of central North-American and European universities, research institutions, and other organizations in North-America and Europe. In the experiments we investigated, first, how strongly this central region of the Web is connected to three other large geographical regions of the Web: Australia (top level domain. au), <b>China</b> (. <b>cn),</b> and five South-American countries (. ar,. br,. cl,. mx, and. uy). Test topics were selected from the domains of genomics and genetics which are typical scientific fields. We found that two focused crawling processes, one started from the central region and the other from the region of Australia / China / South-America, overlap only to a small extent, identifying mainly different relevant documents. Document relevance was assessed (1) by a human judge and (2) by assigning probability scores to documents using a search engine. Second, we investigated the coverage (number) of relevant documents obtained for different focused crawling processes started with URLs from the four different geographical regions. The results showed that all regions considered in this study are good starting points for focused crawling in the domains of genetics and genomics since each of them yielded a high coverage. As genomics and genetics are typical scientific domains we assume the obtained results to be generalizable to other scientific domains. We discuss what implications the observed results have for the selection of crawling approach in scientific focused crawling tasks. 1...|$|R
