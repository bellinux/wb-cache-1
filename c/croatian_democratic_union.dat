5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs worsened. Serbian President Slobodan Milošević used Franjo Tuđman's actions to his advantage, portraying the Croatian leader and his <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (HDZ) as a reincarnation of the Ustaše, a fascist movement that had ruled Croatia during the Second World War.|$|E

Čandić also testified that the railway bombing near Vinkovci was intended to implicate Croatian President Franjo Tuđman.|$|E
5|$|The {{elections}} held in 1990 {{were the}} first multi-party elections after 45 years of Communist rule; candidates vied for all 80 seats in the Social-Political Council of Croatia, all 116 seats in the Municipalities Council of Croatia and all 160 seats in the Associated Labour Council of Croatia (since Parliament had three chambers at the time). The {{first round of the}} election saw a turnout of 85.5 percent, and the runoff-election turnout was 74.8 percent. The <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (HDZ) won 205 seats, and the Social Democratic Party of Croatia won 107.|$|E
5|$|After Yugoslavia's leader Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, long-suppressed ethnic {{nationalism}} revived and {{the individual}} republics began to assert their authority more strongly {{as the federal government}} weakened. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy and economic reform, but Serbia's authoritarian communist President Slobodan Milošević opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the communist Yugoslav government. In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (HDZ) party of Franjo Tuđman took office, with Tuđman as President.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1990 {{parliamentary}} election, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (HDZ) had {{a majority}} in six municipalities of Bosanska Posavina. However, the political situation in the region, especially {{by the end of}} 1991, was marked with obstructions by the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) that established parallel authorities. Throughout 1991, the SDS established six autonomous regions (SAOs) in Serb-inhabited municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The SAO Northern Bosnia, proclaimed in Doboj in November, covered 17 municipalities, including Derventa, Bosanski Brod, Odžak, Bosanski Šamac, Modriča, Gradačac and Orašje. These SAOs were joined into Republika Srpska on 9 January 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia decided to tolerate political parties in response to growing demands to allow political activities outside the Communist party. The first political party founded in Croatia {{since the beginning of the}} Communist rule was the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), established on 20 May 1989, followed by the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> on 17 June 1989. In December 1989, Ivica Račan became the head of the reformed Communist party. At the same time, the party cancelled political trials, released political prisoners and endorsed a multi-party political system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow political parties on 11 January 1990, legalising the parties that were already founded.|$|E
5|$|Since 30 May 1990 (the first multi-party {{parliamentary}} election held following the 45-year Communist rule), the Republic of Croatia {{has had a}} total of twelve governments headed by ten different prime ministers. The prime minister in the first government after the first multi-party election was Stjepan Mesić, who would later go {{on to become the}} President of Croatia. That government was formed by the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (HDZ), as were seven other governments of Croatia. Three governments have been formed by the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), and one was a national unity government (representing a wide coalition of political parties) formed during the Croatian War of Independence's peak, between July 1991 and August 1992, with Franjo Gregurić as the prime minister.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Croatian</b> Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (Hrvatska kršćanska demokratska unija or HKDU) {{is a minor}} {{right wing}} Christian {{democratic}} political party in Croatia. It was founded in 1992 after the merger of <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party (HDS) and the <b>Croatian</b> Christian <b>Democratic</b> Party (HKDS).|$|R
50|$|In the 1992 presidential {{elections}} in Croatia he ran as a candidate, finishing 7th. This, and failure of HKDS to enter Croatian Parliament led to HKDS uniting with <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party (HDS) {{into a new}} party called the <b>Croatian</b> Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Croatian {{parliamentary}} election, 1992, HKDS, {{running on}} its own ticket, failed to enter Croatian Parliament, while its leader Ivan Cesar finished seventh in presidential race. This fiasco led HKDS to unite with <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party (HDS) into <b>Croatian</b> Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union.</b> Dissident faction of HKDS continued to operate under the party's old name.|$|R
5|$|After the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> won 1990 {{parliamentary}} {{elections in the}} Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs within the Republic worsened. The ethnic groups are also divided along religious lines as the Croats are Catholics while the Serbs are Orthodox Christians. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) forces to minimize resistance. On 17 August, tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, {{and parts of the}} Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. This revolt was followed in January 1991, by two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia {{is elected}} for a five-year term by a direct vote of all {{citizens}} in a majority system, requiring runoff elections if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of {{votes in the}} first round. Members of Parliament are elected for a four-year term in ten multi-seat constituencies, with additional members elected in special constituencies reserved for the Croatian diaspora and national minorities. As of November 2011, legislation provides for the election of 151 members of the unicameral parliament (including three representatives of the Croatian diaspora and eight representatives of national minorities). Out of 31 political parties which won seats in Croatian parliamentary elections held since 1990, only six have won ten seats or more in any one parliamentary election. Those were the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union,</b> the Croatian Peasant Party, the Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats, the Croatian Social Liberal Party, Social Democratic Party of Croatia and the Bridge of Independent Lists. The county prefects, city/town mayors and municipality presidents are elected for four-year term {{by a majority of}} votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} voting. Members of county, city/town and municipal councils are elected for a four-year term through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency.|$|E

In December, Ivica Račan became {{the head of the}} reformed Communist party. At this time, the Communist party decided to cancel political trials, release political prisoners and endorse a multi-party political system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow multiple political parties on 11 January 1990, legalising the new parties. By {{the time of the first}} round of the first multi-party elections, held on 22 April 1990, there were 33 registered parties. There were single-seat constituencies for half of the seats and a single nationwide constituency (through election lists) for the remaining seats. Still, the most relevant parties and coalitions were the renamed Communist party (the League of Communists of Croatia— Party of Democratic Changes), the HDZ and the Coalition of People's Accord (KNS), which included the HSLS, led by Dražen Budiša, and the HSS, which resumed operating in Croatia in December 1989. The runoff election, open to any candidate receiving at least 7% of the vote, was held on 6 May 1990. The HDZ led by Franjo Tuđman won ahead of the reformed Communists and the KNS. The KNS, led by the former leaders of the Croatian Spring (Savka Dabčević-Kučar and Miko Tripalo), soon splintered into individual parties. On 8 October 1991, Croatia's declaration of independence took effect. The HDZ maintained a parliamentary majority until the 2000 parliamentary elections when it was defeated by the SDP led by Račan. The HDZ returned to power in the 2003 elections, while the SDP remained the largest opposition party.|$|E
5000|$|Within the alliance, the Croatian Peasant Party won 10 seats (+7), the Istrian Democratic Assembly won 3 (no change), the Croatian People's Party won 2 (-4), the <b>Croatian</b> Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> won 1 (+1) and the Slavonia-Baranja Croatian Party won one (+1).|$|R
