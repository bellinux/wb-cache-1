40|$|Maize breeding, {{on which}} the future of maize {{production}} is based, {{can be expected to}} undergo further important developments in the 21 st century. Opportunities for development are latent in a more scientific approach to production methods and in the better exploitation of the available genetic resources. There is no lack of favourable gene combinations contributing to higher yield (e. g. 20 – 22 t/ha). However, the genes and gene combinations controlling the improvement and stabilisation of performance are unfortunately scattered over various different races, varieties and individual plants, where they occur at low frequency. <b>Combination</b> <b>breeding</b> and, more recently, cumulative source management are designed to collect these genes and concentrate them in special parental lines and heterosis sources. The pure line method has been a basic procedure in maize breeding for the last 100 years, and is likely to remain so for the next 100 years. <b>Combination</b> <b>breeding</b> and cumulative source management {{are an integral part of}} this method. The concentration of favourable genes has been facilitated to an unexpected extent by the use of this method. When breeding open-pollinated varieties all the gene combinations required had to be collected into a single population, while in the case of heterosis breeding it is sufficient if the male and female parents each contain half the required gene combinations. These are then combined automatically in the course of crossing. Over the last 20 years too little attention has been paid to the breeding of basic material, so the number of heterosis sources has declined and some have become eroded due to unsupervised mixing. There have been few reports on the development of new heterosis sources vying in quality with earlier sources. In the course of hybrid maize breeding, closely related pedigrees have been crossed to develop new elite lines in the hope of quick results. Due to the lack of substantial initial divergence this is unlikely to result in any great increase in yield. Authoritative opinions consider this to be the reason for the slower rate of yield increase, and for the very small differences now existing between the yield levels of rival hybrids. There is no lack of genetic resources, but more attention should be paid to the careful breeding of basic materials. The future of maize breeding will depend on the discovery of new gene combinations more efficient than those currently available, and on their successful concentration in different sources of heterosis...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To reveal {{breeding}} and genetic peculiarities of modern spring barley varieties for the “number of grains per main ear” trait and identify genetic sources of increased combining ability for involving in hybridization. Methods. Investigations {{were carried out}} at the V. M. Remeslo Myronivka Institute of Wheat of NAAS of Ukraine. Modern varieties of domestic (‘Virazh’, ‘Talisman Myronivskyi’, ‘Komandor’) and foreign (‘KWS Aliciana’, ‘KWS Bambina’, ‘Zhana’, ‘Explorer’) breeding were involved in crossing for a full (7 ´ 7) diallel scheme. Parents and F 1 were studied in field conditions during 2014 – 2016. Results. The analysis of variance of combining ability has shown a significant advantage in varying of general combining ability (GCA) effects. The mean square of specific combining ability (SCA) was significantly less than the GCA, but reliable throughout the years. The reciprocal effect was reliable only in 2014. Stably high effects of GCA during all years of investigations were noted in the varieties ‘KWS Aliciana’ (1. 18 – 1. 62) and ‘Virazh’ (1. 33 – 1. 48). The variety ‘KWS Bambina’ was characterized by lower but reliable positive effects of GCA (0. 43 – 0. 99) as compared to mentioned above. Non-allelic gene interaction was not found, that allowed to calculate the basic parameters of genetic variation. During all years of investigations, dominant effects of genes (H 1 and H 2) prevailed over the additive (D) ones in phenotypic expression of grain number per main ear. Mean degree of dominance in the experiment (H 1 /D) has shown overdominance. The same pattern was also distinctive for the index of mean degree of dominance in the loci. The dominance was reliably directed. Dominant effects of genes increased grain content, and recessive ones reduced it. At least 3 – 4 genes (groups of genes) have been revealed which determined the effects of dominance. At the same time, recessive genes (F< 0) or gene effects were prevailed quantitatively in the varieties investigated. A high coefficient of heritability in broad sense (H 2 = 0. 98) has shown a significant determination of phenotypic variability with genetic factors. The coefficient of heritability in narrow sense (h 2 = 0. 66 – 0. 68) confirmed that despite the advantage of dominant effects over the additive ones, {{the contribution of the}} latter was also significant. Conclusions. The prevalence of dominant effects of genes in the phenotypic expression of the number of grains per main ear causes the need for sufficient sample size of hybrid material and points to the expediency of conducting a more “rigid” selection for phenotype in later generations. At the same time, the considerable contribution of additive effects and high values of heritability indices give reason to predict the efficiency of selections aimed at increasing the trait in created hybrid material. The varieties ‘Virazh’, ‘KWS Aliciana’, ‘KWS Bambina’ should be used as effective genetic sources to increase grain content in <b>combination</b> <b>breeding...</b>|$|E

40|$|The <b>combination</b> of <b>breeding</b> for {{increased}} {{production and the}} intensification of housing conditions have resulted in increased occurrence of behavioral, physiological, and immunological disorders.

Selective breeding should not only be defined in terms of production, but should also include traits related to animal health and welfare. For this we like to introduce the concept of robustness. The concept of robustness includes individual traits of an animal that are relevant for health and welfare. Improving robustness by selective breeding will increase (or restore) the ability of animals to interact successfully with the environment and thereby to make them more able to adapt to an appropriate husbandry system.

A total of 1, 218 individuals from a commercial population of Ulu Remis x AVROS (UR x AVROS) were genotyped using the OP 200 K array. The traits of interest included: shellto- fruit ratio (S/F, %), mesocarp-to-fruit ratio (M/F, %), kernel-to-fruit ratio (K/F, %), fruit per bunch (F/B, %), oil per bunch (O/B, %) and oil per palm (O/P, kg/palm/year).

40|$|Life-history {{traits in}} wild populations are often {{regarded}} as being subject to directional selection, {{and the existence}} of substantial variation and microevolutionary stasis of these characters is therefore a problem in need of explanation. Avian clutch size is an archetypal life-history trait in this context, and many studies have sought to test explanations for stasis in clutch size. Surprisingly, there are many fewer studies that used long-term data to ask how selection acts on clutch size, particularly in a multivariate framework. In this article, we report selection, inheritance, and evolution of clutch size over 25 years in a colony of mute swans using a multivariate quantitative genetic framework to control for correlations with breeding time. We show that clutch size is influenced by both additive genetic and permanent environmental effects and that selection acts on clutch size in <b>combination</b> with <b>breeding</b> time. Natural selection on clutch size is strongly directional, favoring larger clutches, and we observe an increase in clutch size of 0. 35 standard deviations, consistent with the expected response based on selection and inheritance of clutch size.

40|$|The {{present day}} hybrid seed corn {{industry}} {{is based upon}} the development and utilization of inbred lines in hybrid <b>combination.</b> Current <b>breeding</b> procedures are largely predicated {{on the assumption that the}} actions of complementary, dominant or partially dominant favorable genes are responsible for the heterosis observed in the hybrids produced.

They were developed from crossing and backcrossing 64 varieties as donor parents to Yanzhan 1 as recurrent parent. The effects of the 18 alleles on nine dough quality parameters were evaluated in a similar background using these lines. The results showed that Glu-A 1 a produced the highest SDS-sedimentation volume (Ssd), midline time x= 8 width (MTxW), mixing tolerance (MT) and the lowest weakening slope (WS). At the Glu-B 1 locus, Glu-B 1 f produced the highest values for all quality parameters but WS. At the Glu-D 1 locus, Glu-D 1 d was the best for Ssd, grain hardness (GH), midline peak width (MPW), MTxW and MT. The positive effects of Glu-B 1 f on GH and Glu-B 3 b on Ssd were mainly from the effect of GPC. Overall, 5 interactive loci and 13 interactive alleles {{were found to be}} significant.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} of rising concern {{especially}} due to how {{and if this}} changing climate affects individual species and their fitness. Migratory species, especially long-distance migrants, are ideal models for exploring the relationship between warming temperatures on temperate breeding grounds and decreased precipitation on tropical wintering areas. Few studies have long term data sets to observe species-specific assessments of fitness in relation to changing precipitation and temperature patterns, and those that have assessed these relationships show inconsistent results. We analyzed long-term data of a neo-tropical migratory songbird (Protonotaria citrea) to assess the potential relationships between indices of reproductive success and variation in tropical rainfall and breeding season temperature. We found that the species tended to have longer breeding seasons in years with increased annual temperatures and increased rates of double brooding with increased precipitation in the wintering grounds.

The J 20 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a transgenic overexpresser of human APP with familial AD mutations and has been extensively utilised in preclinical studies and our aim was to determine the genomic location of the J 20 transgene insertion. Methods: We used a <b>combination</b> of <b>breeding</b> strategy and Targeted Locus Amplification with deep sequencing to identify the insertion site of the J 20 transgene array. To assess RNA and protein expression of Zbtb 20, we used qRT-PCR and Western Blotting.

40|$|A strict {{gluten-free}} diet {{is currently}} the only treatment for the 1 - 2 % of the world population who suffer from coeliac disease (CD). However, due {{to the presence of}} wheat and wheat derivatives in many food products, avoiding gluten consumption is difficult. Gluten-free products, made without wheat, barley or rye, typically require the inclusion of numerous additives, resulting in products that are often less healthy than gluten-based equivalents. Here, we present and discuss two broad approaches to decrease wheat gluten immunogenicity for CD patients. The first approach is based on food processing strategies, which aim to remove gliadins or all gluten from edible products. We find that several of the candidate food processing techniques to produce low gluten-immunogenic products from wheat already exist. The second approach focuses on wheat breeding strategies to remove immunogenic epitopes from the gluten proteins, while maintaining their food-processing properties.

Several other species were recorded post-wildfire in sections of the property that were severely burnt. Numerous species appear to have survived the wildfire due to their ability to shelter underground, whilst others may have sheltered under large logs that were only partially burnt.
