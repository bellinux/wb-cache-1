Had there been {{a large group of}} Muslim immigrants their numbers would have caused an unusual increase in the population and this would have appeared in the calculated rate of increase from one registration list to another... Such an increase would have been easily noticed; it was not there.|$|E
25|$|The riders {{of early}} domesticated horses {{probably}} used {{some type of}} bitless headgear made of sinew, leather, or rope. Components of the earliest headgear {{may be difficult to}} determine, as the materials would not have held up over time. For this reason, no one <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> certainty which came first, the bitted or the bitless bridle. There is evidence of the use of bits, located in two sites of the Botai in ancient Kazakhstan, dated about 3500-3000 BC. Nose rings appear on the equids portrayed on the Standard of Ur, circa 2600 BC - 2400 BC. To date, the earliest known artistic evidence of use of some form of bitless bridle comes in illustrations of Synian horseman, dated approximately 1400 BC.|$|E
25|$|From the {{descriptions}} {{that have come}} down to us through the writings of those such as Plato, Aristoxenus and, later, Boethius, we <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> some caution that the ancient Greeks, at least before Plato, heard music that was primarily monophonic; that is, music built on single melodies based on a system of modes/scales, themselves built on the concept that notes should be placed between consonant intervals. It is a commonplace of musicology to say that harmony, {{in the sense of}} a developed system of composition, in which many tones at once contribute to the listener's expectation of resolution, was invented in the European Middle Ages and that ancient cultures had no developed system of harmony—that is, for example, playing the third and seventh above the dominant, in order to create the expectation for the listener that the tritone will resolve to the third.|$|E

25|$|On August 6 and August 7, the Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader visited Dubrovnik, {{which was}} {{followed}} by fires in that area. It prompted some county officials to make arson accusations against {{the nearby town of}} Trebinje in the neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mario Magud, the firefighting commander in Konavle, said: There are no firemen on the Trebinje side. Everything indicates that they set the fire themselves with the intention to burn Konavle and beyond. It's not a coincidence that, as soon as we localize one fire, a new fire breaks out.. Luka Korda, the chief of Konavle municipality, made similar accusations. The Bosnian civil defense secretary Stanko Slišković said it was not true that the Bosnian firemen did not do anything to prevent fires in the border area near Dubrovnik: Our people made the greatest effort to fight every fire where it was possible. Nobody <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> certainty where a fire started... I'm sorry this happened and I understand the indignation of the citizens of Dubrovnik, but it's not our fault. He claimed that the Bosnian civil defense cooperated well with their Croatian counterparts and said that the Bosnian forces could not fight the fires in the inaccessible or mined areas.|$|E

500|$|During 1936 and 1937, the Air Staff {{had been}} {{fighting}} with the Cabinet over the rearmament plans; the Air Staff wanted a substantial bomber force and only minor increases in fighters, whilst the Minister for Defence Co-ordination, Sir Thomas Inskip, successfully pushed for a greater role for the fighter force. Newall was promoted {{during the middle of}} this debate, and proved perhaps more flexible than might have been expected. In 1938 he supported sharp increases in aircraft production, including double-shift working and duplication of factories, and pushed {{for the creation of a}} dedicated organisation to repair and refit damaged aircraft. He supported expenditure on the new, heavily armed, Hurricane and Spitfire fighters, essential to re-equip Fighter Command. He even began to distance himself, albeit slightly, from orthodox bomber philosophy, noting to the Minister for Air that [...] "no one <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> absolute certainty that a nation can be knocked out from the air, because no-one has yet attempted it". Discussing plans for reacting to a war with Italy, in early 1939, he opposed a French proposal to force Italy's surrender by the use of heavy bombing raids against the north, arguing that it would be unlikely to force the country out of the war without the need for ground combat.|$|E
500|$|More than {{a century}} after his death, {{literary}} critics such as G. Birkbeck Hill and T. S. Eliot came to regard Johnson as a serious critic. They began to study Johnson's works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and Lives of the Poets. Yvor Winters claimed that [...] "A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson". F. R. Leavis agreed and, on Johnson's criticism, said, [...] "When we read him we know, beyond question, {{that we have here}} a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature. This, we <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> emphatic conviction, really is criticism". Edmund Wilson claimed that [...] "The Lives of the Poets and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare are among the most brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism". The critic Harold Bloom placed Johnson's work firmly within the Western canon, describing him as [...] "unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him...Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know, emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an activity, one that will turn to destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour." [...] It is no wonder that his philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid-20th century.|$|E
500|$|One of the film's key contentions is {{that the}} private media aired footage {{selectively}} {{to make it look}} like the violence of 11April was caused by Chávez's supporters, portraying them as an [...] "irrational and uncivilized mob". Private television repeatedly showed Chávez's supporters on [...] as they shot at Baralt Avenue below, an area purportedly full of opposition marchers. The film says this footage was edited to show the gunmen but not the people near them who were ducking to avoid being shot. It follows with images taken from above the bridge showing an empty Baralt Avenue, claiming that [...] "the opposition march had never taken that route" [...] and that Chávez's supporters were only returning fire. Gunson charges that this edit is itself a misrepresentation, stating that the film does not mention that both sets of marchers were fired upon, and taking issue with the implication that [...] "coup plotters" [...] were the shooters. In response, the filmmakers say, [...] "Nowhere in the film did we say that only [...] were shot... Nobody <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> certainty who orchestrated the shootings." [...] Gunson also asserts that the footage of the empty street was taken earlier that day, citing an [...] "analysis of the shadows" [...] by Schalk, who created a counter-documentary, X-Ray of a Lie, to examine The Revolution Will Not Be Televised [...] "scene by scene to uncover [...] narrative strategies and use of artifice". Brian A. Nelson agreed with the analysis, claiming that Baralt Avenue was not as empty as the film portrays and that the filmmakers [...] "put a black bar at the top of the frame to hide the Metropolitan Police trucks that were still there". Bartley and ÓBriain reaffirmed their claim that the opposition did not pass below the Puente Llaguno bridge, citing eyewitness statements—including one from Le Monde Diplomatiques deputy editor—and an Australian documentary, Anatomy of a Coup, that [...] "came to conclusions similar to our own". A Venezuelan documentary, , also supported Bartley and ÓBriain's view.|$|E

2500|$|Westmoreland's {{view has}} been heavily criticized by Nick Turse, {{the author of}} the book Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam.

2500|$|Many {{consider}} Shakespeare's Cleopatra, whom Enobarbus {{describes as}} having [...] "infinite variety", {{as one of}} the most complex and fully developed female characters in the playwright's body of work. She is frequently vain and histrionic enough to provoke an audience almost to scorn; at the same time, Shakespeare invests her and Antony with tragic grandeur. These contradictory features have led to famously divided critical responses. It is difficult to classify Antony and Cleopatra as belonging to a single genre. It can be described as a history play (though it does not completely adhere to historical accounts), as a tragedy (though not completely in Aristotelian terms), as a comedy, as a romance, and according to some critics, e.g. McCarter, a problem play. All one <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>with</b> certainty is that it is a Roman play, even a sequel to another of Shakespeare's tragedies, Julius Caesar.|$|E
