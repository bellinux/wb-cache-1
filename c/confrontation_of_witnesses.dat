40|$|The {{right to}} {{represent}} oneself at trial is well-established, but not absolute. Recently, in Indiana v. Edwards, the United States Supreme Court considered whether states may demand {{a higher standard}} of competence for criminal defendants seeking to represent themselves at trial than that necessary for standing trial with attorney representation. Ultimately, the Court ruled that the Constitution allows states to employ a higher competency standard for pro se defendants. In this analysis of the Court’s decision, the authors describe the facts of this case, the legal precedents framing the issues facing the Court, and the Court’s rationale for its opinion. The ruling is considered in light of available research involving pro se defendants and whether this ruling is consistent with professional guidelines related to forensic psychiatric practice. Implications of the decision for forensic clinicians and limitations of the decision are discussed.

50|$|Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that reformulated {{the standard for}} determining when the admission of hearsay statements in criminal cases is permitted under the <b>Confrontation</b> Clause <b>of</b> the Sixth Amendment.

40|$|It is {{of great}} {{significance}} for witnesses {{to appear in court}} in criminal cases so as to safeguard the right <b>of</b> <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the defendant and achieve judicial justice. However, the witnesses in criminal cases refuse to appear in court and only give written testimony, and this has become a long-standing problem in the judicial practice of China. To solve this problem, the Criminal Procedure Law of China, amended and improved the system <b>of</b> the <b>witness</b> appearing in court in 2012. Nevertheless, if the underlying problems in the judicial system of China are not settled, the system <b>of</b> the <b>witness</b> appearing in court in criminal cases still cannot turn into practicable measures...|$|R
40|$|In handing {{down its}} {{decision}} in In Re Gault, the Supreme Court extended to youths accused of delinquent acts certain constitutional rights heretofore reserved for adults in criminal proceedings, i. e., the right against self-incrimination {{and the rights}} to timely notice of charges, counsel and <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnesses.</b> In arriving at its far-reaching decision, the Court confirmed what many critics of the juvenile court movement had been saying for years: that this nation 2 ̆ 7 s juvenile courts are beset with serious problems in handling the task {{for which they were}} specifically created- the 2 ̆ 2 non-criminal 2 ̆ 2 adjudication and treatment of delinquent children. The Gault opinion reveals that the majority decision was apparently founded as much on social science 2 ̆ 2 fact 2 ̆ 2 as it was on more fundamental principles of legal reasoning. Indeed, it is apparent that the Court was in somewhat of a dilemma in trying to prove that juvenile courts were, in fact, not fulfilling the promise of their founders. Paramount among the Court 2 ̆ 7 s considerations in this regard were the observations: l) that juvenile crime has increased, not decreased, since the establishment of the juvenile justice system; 2) that a 2 ̆ 2 delinquency 2 ̆ 2 label is inherently stigmatizing; 3) that the manner in which a youth perceives the legal system has profound effects on his future development as an adult member of society and; 4) that institutionalization, even for treatment purposes, is nonetheless involuntary deprivation of liberty...|$|E

40|$|The Indonesia-Malaysia {{confrontation}} between 1963 - 1966 {{was an important}} event attracting the attention of politicians and scholars alike as the conflict had threatened the long existing {{relations between the two}} countries. Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia was due to its refusal to accept the formation of the new federation of Malaysia, founded on 16 th September 1963. Sukarno’s confrontational stand on this had broken the long-standing sentiments of regional brotherhood or “saudara serumpun” that had nurtured between the two countries for many years. The conflict also saw the involvement of major powers like the United States (U. S.), Britain, China and Russia in the midst of bipolar power struggle between the communist and the anti-communist as part of the ongoing Cold War. The three years <b>of</b> <b>confrontation</b> <b>witnessed</b> great attempts at peace efforts by U. S. Although U. S. involvement in the conflict was merely as a moderator for both countries it was also fueled by its efforts of containment of communism in the Southeast Asian region. The U. S. viewed that the conflict should be resolved in the context of “Asian solution” as it involved two Asian countries A settlement to the Malaysia-Indonesia confrontation was finally achieved through the Bangkok Agreement, signed in August 1966. This paper discusses the role of U. S. in its attempts at finding an amicable settle to the confrontation in the form of “Asian solution. ...|$|R
