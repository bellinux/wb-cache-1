25|$|Of {{paramount}} {{importance to the}} designers was {{that the story of}} the film be treated as sacrosanct – nothing the player <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game can ever alter, contradict or in any way run contrary to what happens in the film. David Yorkin, Bud's son, and David Leary worked on the game's script, initially writing it as a linear game. However, the designers wanted the game to feature a great deal of random elements, with the idea being that no two playthroughs would be the same, and no walkthrough would be able to cover every possible eventuality or every possible combination of random events. The game presents the player with fifteen suspects, but only two are always replicants (Clovis and a cook named Zuben). Which of the other thirteen characters is a replicant is randomized every time the player plays the game, and their behavior is different each playthrough based upon {{whether or not they are}} human. Due to the random nature of the game, the script swelled to 500 pages, and the quality assurance people had to play through the game 2,500 times to experience every possible variation.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

[...] Pogba was promoted to the club's reserve team permanently for the 2011–12 season and made his first appearance of the season on 15 August 2011 in the team's opening Premier Reserve League match against Arsenal. On 25 August, in the team's second league match against Swansea City reserves, Pogba scored the second goal in a 6–0 rout. On 19 September, he was named to the first team to participate in their Football League Cup tie against Leeds United the following day, with Ferguson proclaiming, [...] "I intend to play him [...] against Leeds United."
