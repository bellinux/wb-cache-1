40|$|The {{ability of}} {{persistent}} midlatitude <b>convective</b> <b>regions</b> to influence hemispheric circulation patterns during the Northern Hemisphere summer is investigated. Global rainfall data over a 15 -yr period indicate anomalously large July total rainfalls occurred over mesoscale-sized, midlatitude regions of North America and/or Southeast Asia {{during the years}} of 1987, 1991, 1992, and 1993. The anomalous 200 -hPa vorticity patterns for these same years are suggestive of Rossby wave trains emanating from the regions of anomalous rainfall in the midlatitudes. Results from an analysis of an 11 -yr mean monthly 200 -hPa July wind field indicate that, in the climatological mean, Rossby waveguides are present that could assist in developing a large-scale response from mesoscale-sized regions of persistent convection in the midlatitudes. This hypothesis is tested using a barotropic model linearized about the 200 -hPa July time-mean flow and forced by the observed divergence anomalies. The model results are in qualitative agreement in the observed July vorticity anomalies for the four years investigated. Model results forced by observed tropical forcings for the same years do not demonstrate any significant influence on the midlatitude circulation. It is argued that persistent midlatitude <b>convective</b> <b>regions</b> {{may play a role in}} the development, maintenance, and dissipation of the large-scale circulations that help to support the <b>convective</b> <b>regions.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Context. <b>Convective</b> <b>regions</b> in stellar {{models are}} always {{associated}} with uncertainties, for example due to extra-mixing or the possible inaccurate {{position of the}} transition from convective to radiative transport of energy. These have a strong impact on stellar models and their fundamental parameters. The most promising method to reduce these uncertainties is to use asteroseismology to derive diagnostics probing the structural characteristics of these regions. Aims. We wish to use custom-made integrated quantities to improve the capabilities of seismology to probe <b>convective</b> <b>regions</b> in stellar interiors. We hope {{to increase the number}} of indicators obtained with structural seismic inversions to provide additional constraints on stellar models and the fundamental parameters determined from theoretical modeling. Methods. First, we present new kernels associated with a proxy of the entropy in stellar interiors. We then show how these kernels can be used to build custom-made integrated quantities probing <b>convective</b> <b>regions</b> inside stellar models. We present two indicators suited to probe convective cores and envelopes, respectively, and test them on artificial data. Results. We show that it is possible to probe both convective cores and envelopes using appropriate indicators obtained with structural inversion techniques. These indicators provide direct constraints on a proxy of the entropy of the stellar plasma, sensitive to the characteristics of <b>convective</b> <b>regions.</b> These constraints can then be used to improve the modeling of solar-like stars by providing an additional degree of selection of models obtained from classical forward modeling approaches. We also show that in order to obtain very accurate indicators, we need l = 3 modes for the envelope but that the core-conditions indicator is more flexible in terms of the seismic data required for its use.

The southward moisture flux east of the Andes also increases, bringing humidity to central and southeast Brazil.|$|E

[...] Prior to 1958, the mechanism driving the global-scale circulation pattern called Hadley cells was poorly understood. Riehl and Simpson {{proposed that the}} energy feeding these convective cells was supplied by the release of latent heat during condensation and subsequent freezing of warm, moist air in areas of convection about 5 km wide. The large horizontal extent of these convective cells provides a buffer from the dry air surrounding the <b>convective</b> <b>region</b> that allows the parcel to rise at nearly the moist adiabatic lapse rate.

50|$|Stars {{more massive}} than the sun have a {{convective}} core {{on the main}} sequence. They develop a more massive helium core, taking up a larger fraction of the star, before they exhaust the hydrogen in the entire <b>convective</b> <b>region.</b> Fusion in the star ceases entirely and the core begins to contract and increase in temperature. The entire star contracts and increases in temperature, with the radiated luminosity actually increasing {{despite the lack of}} fusion. This continues for several million years before the core becomes hot enough to ignite hydrogen in a shell, which reverses the temperature and luminosity increase and the star starts to expand and cool.

40|$|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) {{data are}} used in {{conjunction}} with a radiative transfer model to estimate the effect of various cloud types on the top-of-atmosphere radiation budget in <b>convective</b> <b>regions</b> of the Tropics. This analysis shows that individual convective cloud elements can have strongly positive or negative effects on the radiation balance. Nonetheless, the ensemble of cloud types that occurs in association with deep convection in the Tropics arranges itself so that the individual positive and negative contributions cancel each other when averaged over the convective cloud system. This behavior of the cloud ensemble is extremely interesting, and the authors speculate that it is indicative of feedbacks in the climate system that have not been explored adequately. A simple model is introduced that includes feedbacks that drive the net radiation in <b>convective</b> <b>regions</b> toward the net radiation in adjacent nonconvective areas. If the nonconvective regions have small cloud forcing, then this model predicts small net radiative forcing by the convective cloud ensemble.

40|$|Information {{about the}} {{location}} of enhanced <b>convective</b> <b>regions</b> and super-cooled water droplet clouds is one major task of aviation meteorology. Deep convective cores are mainly responsible for an increasing amount of delayed flights during the last years leading to enormous economical losses (Evans 2002). Moreover, the majority of aviation accidents is caused by turbulences connected with deep <b>convective</b> <b>regions</b> (Proctor et al. 2002). Super-cooled cloud droplets are on their part responsible for wing glaciation. According to Mingione (1998), wing glaciation was the main cause for about 800 serious incidents and plane crashes between 1975 and 1988. While jet planes produce enough heat to stoke their wings properly, small and medium planes with energy-saving engines and carbon fibre cabins often have no adequate exterior shell heating and moreover {{are not able to}} climb above the critical height for wing glaciation of about 5000 meter. Therefore an operational cloud process identification tool (CPI) for retrieving and visualising cloud processes for general aviation using multispectral data is developed. The successive identification of critical areas uses VIS, NIR, WV and IR data from e. g. Meteosat- 8, several radiative transfer model based look-up tables and actual atmospheric vertical profiles from radiosonde or analyse data.

40|$|A new {{framework}} for interpreting {{the origin of}} the tropical intraseasonal oscillation (TISO), which avoids the speed and scale selection problems in the previous theories, is proposed in this study. In this interpretation TISO is viewed as an oscillation driven by an eastward moving <b>convective</b> <b>region.</b> This <b>convective</b> <b>region</b> consists of one or more super cloud clusters originating in the Indian Ocean and terminating in mid-Pacific, and is then followed by another <b>convective</b> <b>region</b> arising in the Indian Ocean in a period of 40 - 50 days.

This study includes a simulation of TISO in a 2 D model to support our interpretation. Experiments were conducted with four different convection schemes. The authors advocate that the successful simulation of TISO depends on the successful simulation of super clouds cluster, which in turn depends on the successful simulation of the life cycle of cloud clusters, which further in turn depends on the choice of cumulus convection scheme.

The diurnal oscillation of areal extent of the hurricane cirrus canopy, as documented {{in a number of}} previous studies, is clearly identified but often found to vanish near the <b>convective</b> <b>region</b> of the hurricane eyewall. While a significant diurnal oscillation is generally absent near the storm center, a powerful and highly significant semidiurnal oscillation is sometimes revealed in that region. This result intimates that convection near the center of tropical storms and hurricanes may not be diurnally forced, but might, at times, be semidiurnally forced. A highly significant semidiurnal oscillation is also often found in the near environment beyond the edge of the hurricane cirrus canopy. The phase of the semidiurnal oscillations in both the central <b>convective</b> <b>region</b> and the region beyond the canopy remains relatively fixed during the lifetime of each storm and is not found to vary much between individual storms. This fixed phase near the central <b>convective</b> <b>region</b> insinuates a mechanistic link between hurricane central convection and the semidiurnal atmospheric thermal tide S 2. Two hypotheses are constructed. The first is offered to explain the diurnal oscillation of the canopy {{in the absence of a}} diurnal oscillation of the convective regions.

Comparing cloud forcing estimates obtained from the ISCCP-ERBE regression with those derived from the ERBE scene identification shows generally good agreement except over snow, in tropical <b>convective</b> <b>regions,</b> and in regions that are either nearly cloudless or always overcast.

Using a full nuclear reaction network, we show that the maximum vertical extent of the <b>convective</b> <b>region</b> during photospheric radius expansion (RE) bursts can be sufficiently great that: (1) some ashes of burning are ejected by the radiation driven wind during the RE phase and, (2) some ashes of burning are exposed at the neutron star surface following the RE phase.

As the ejected material cools during the RE phase some of the ejected heavy-element ashes cease to be fully ionized. In addition, those ashes that remain bound to the neutron star will temporarily reside in the photosphere after it has settled back down to the neutron star surface. Some of these surface ashes are of high enough proton number Z that they are not fully ionized. We calculate the expected column density of ejected and surface ashes in hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths of the resulting photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron star surface.

They found that individually each cloud type had a large impact on the radiation at the TOA, but collectively the effect was small. From the analyses of the ERBE data, they claimed that the net CRF at the TOA is small not only over deep <b>convective</b> <b>regions</b> but also over the nonconvective re-gions.
