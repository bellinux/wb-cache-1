25|$|A <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> and {{structurally}} perfect diamond {{is perfectly}} transparent with no hue, or color. However, in reality almost no gem-sized natural diamonds are absolutely perfect. The {{color of a}} diamond may be affected by chemical impurities and/or structural defects in the crystal lattice. Depending on the hue and intensity of a diamond's coloration, a diamond's color can either detract from or enhance its value. For example, most white diamonds are discounted in price when more yellow hue is detectable, while intense pink diamonds or blue diamonds (such as the Hope Diamond) can be dramatically more valuable. Of all colored diamonds, red diamonds are the rarest. The Aurora Pyramid of Hope displays a spectacular array of naturally colored diamonds, including red diamonds.|$|E

40|$|Monolayers of the {{phospholipid}} dimyristoyl {{phosphatidic acid}} {{on the surface}} of water have been studied by a combination of the new techniques of synchrotron x-ray diffraction and fluorescence microscopy with classical surface pressure data. The pressure vs. area isotherm changes slope at the surface pressures pi c and pi s. The optical technique demonstrates that between pi c and pi s the fluid phase coexists with a denser "gel" phase. Electron diffraction data have shown that the gel phase has bond orientational order over tens of micrometers. However, the x-ray data demonstrate that positional correlations extend only over tens of angstroms. Thus, the gel phase is not crystalline. Above pi s a solid phase is formed with a positional correlation range that is eight times longer for the <b>chemically</b> <b>purest</b> films...|$|R
25|$|As the Earth’s {{most common}} organic material, {{cellulose}} {{can be classified}} into plant cellulose and bacterial cellulose, {{both of which are}} naturally occurring. Plant cellulose, which makes up the cell walls of most plants, is a tough, mesh-like bulkwork in which cellulose fibrils are the primary architectural elements. While bacterial cellulose has the same molecular formula as plant cellulose, it has significantly different macromolecular properties and characteristics. In general, microbial cellulose is more <b>chemically</b> <b>pure,</b> containing no hemicellulose or lignin, has a higher water holding capacity and hydrophilicity, greater tensile strength resulting from a larger amount of polymerization, ultrafine network architecture. Furthermore, bacterial cellulose can be produced on a variety of substrates and can be grown to virtually any shape due to the high moldability during formation. Additionally, bacterial cellulose has a more crystalline structure compared to plant cellulose and forms characteristic ribbon-like microfibrils. A hallmark of microbial cellulose, these thin microfibrils are significantly smaller than those in plant cellulose, making bacterial cellulose much more porous.|$|E

2500|$|Producing a fission chain {{reaction}} in natural uranium fuel {{was found to}} be far from trivial. Early nuclear reactors did not use isotopically enriched uranium, and in consequence they were required to use large quantities of highly purified graphite as neutron moderation materials. Use of ordinary water (as opposed to heavy water) in nuclear reactors requires enriched fuel— the partial separation and relative enrichment of the rare 235U isotope from the far more common 238U isotope. Typically, reactors also require inclusion of extremely <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> neutron moderator materials such as deuterium (in heavy water), helium, beryllium, or carbon, the latter usually as graphite.

30|$|In {{the present}} paper, we have studied a new {{approach}} to the description ofcorrelation between the optical and structural properties of ZnO thin films withdoping levels of Al, Co, and In. The doped zinc oxide thin films were depositedusing ultrasonic spray technique on a glass substrate at 350 °C. Thecorrelation between structural and optical properties with doping level suggeststhat the crystallite size of the films is predominantly estimated by the bandgapenergy and the concentration of Al, Co, and In. Also, the gap energy of dopedfilms was estimated by the crystallite size and doping level. The measurement inthe crystallite size and optical gap energy of doped films with correlation isequal to the experimental data. The minimum error value was estimated in dopedZnO thin films with indium and cobalt. Thus, results indicate that such Co-dopedZnO thin films are <b>chemically</b> <b>purer</b> and have many fewer defects and lessdisorder, owing to an almost complete chemical decomposition.|$|R

40|$|The {{oxidation}} behaviour of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Fe 40 Al- 1 Y 2 O 3 foils of about 300 μm thickness {{was investigated in}} air at 1100 °C {{for up to about}} 300 h exposure. Additional information on the oxidation process and dimensional stability of oxidised specimens was obtained during isochronal tests (45 h) in the temperature range of 1025 - 1125 °C. For comparative purposes, foils of a Fe 40 Al intermetallic alloy without yttria and of the alloy PM 2000, a commercial alumina forming Fe-base alloy, were also investigated. Oxidation kinetics reveal that the scale growth rate of the intermetallic alloys are considerably lower than for PM 2000, which is a consequence of the development of a <b>chemically</b> <b>purer</b> alumina scale. Comparative analysis of the oxidation kinetics of the intermetallic alloys indicates a slightly lower oxidation rate for the material having 1 % yttria. A major characteristic of the {{oxidation behaviour}} of the Fe 40 Al- 1 Y 2 O 3 is the tendency for partial scale spallation after relatively short exposures. This has been attributed to the elevated residual compressive stresses induced by the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the alumina scale and the substrate. Changes {{in the area of the}} specimens after oxidation (up to about 3 % increase) provides evidence of the relaxation by creep of the substrate induced by those residual compressive stresses existing at the scale. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
