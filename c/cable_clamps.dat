50|$|Furthermore, {{the most}} of the {{available}} <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> are not very flexible when it comes to routing lines with varying diameters. That causes higher acquisition and storage costs. The installation of the single <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> can take a lot of mounting time, depending on the laying length of the lines. Strain relief plates are therefore a more flexible solution which allows a parallel routing of several lines with varying diameters.|$|E

50|$|A more cable-friendly {{alternative}} is attaching the lines to special strain relief plates using common cable ties.

50|$|Bad {{contacts}} are {{the cause}} of failure or poor performance {{in a wide variety}} of electrical devices. For example, corroded jumper <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> can frustrate attempts to start a vehicle that has a low battery. Dirty or corroded contacts on a fuse or its holder can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial heating in a high current device. Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{connector}} contacts {{are typically}} Beryllium copper (BeCu) or Phosphor bronze {{which is then}} plated with gold or some other non-corrosive, highly-conductive metal. The contacts are contained by a dielectric insulator (typically a layered construct of various polymers or glass depending upon connector series and manufacturer, and often known as the insert) and are housed in an enclosure (i.e., shell), that is often die-cast aluminum and plated or anodized for corrosion protection. The contacts may be captive or removable using a special tool. The electrical connection into the system at the contact terminal is either a soldered or crimped connection. The seal between the shell and insert may be moisture resistant or a hermetic seal. The inserts in each connector half must be oriented for correct mating, and the shell or insert usually contains a keying feature to prevent mis-mating that could damage the connector or result in an electrical problem. <b>Cable</b> <b>clamps</b> and other mounting hardware may be provided, and the mated halves are usually secured by a locking mechanism to prevent disengagements.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the area}} {{along the line}} became more urbanized, {{objections}} to the soot and noise produced by the locomotives increased, and transport was switched to cars that were powered by horses and mules.

40|$|Abstract- The {{technique}} of inductive contactless energy transfer (CET) has found its application in specific industrial applications where an (air) gap between energy source and load is preferable or even required. A relative new application area of CET is where CET {{is part of}} a general energy distribution network. As an example, electrical sockets might give problems in bathrooms for safety reasons: CET provides a solution because of inherent electrical isolation between source (grid) and loads (e. g. hair dryer or electrical shaver). For such application this paper reports on the design of a contactless power system that is able to supply to multiple users simultaneously, analogously to the regular plug-and-socket network. The proposed contactless system consists of a special energy supply <b>cable</b> where <b>clamps</b> (each maximum 240 W) can be mounted on at arbitrary locations along the cable while electrical isolation is maintained between <b>cable</b> and <b>clamps.</b> Result is a supply cable design and a prototype with 2 clamps, which are compared by means of analytical calculations, simulations and experimental results.

There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph.

40|$|The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute’s (MBARI’s) 4000 meter {{remotely}} operated vehicle (ROV), Tiburon operates directly off a double helically wound steel cable {{without the use of}} a clump weight. On dives between 1500 and 4000 meters, rotationally induced hockles or tight bends in the umbilical cable have intermittently occurred. The hockles have the potential to disable and possibly even lose Tiburon. In an effort to compensate for this problem, MBARI engineers are designing a rotation sensor that <b>clamps</b> on the <b>cable</b> near the sections where hockles have occurred. A magnetic compass will take the heading of the cable and send the processed information acoustically back to the ship or vehicle. This information will appear on the ROV pilot’s display screen so that the ROV pilot can compensate for any rotation or misalignment before hockles occur. This paper describes the mechanical design and analysis of the umbilical cable rotation sensor. The goals of the mechanical design are to house the electronics and batteries in a safe and clean environment, incorporate the housings in a hydrodynamically balanced <b>cable</b> <b>clamp</b> assembly and allow for easy attachment and removal from the umbilical. The final design met all of the necessary mechanical and operational requirements {{with the exception of the}} size and weight of the assembly, which was dictated largely by the Sonardyne acoustic hardware. The 60 lb final weight of the assembly was over twice the desired weight, which greatly complicates the cable attachment procedure.

50|$|Investigation {{revealed}} that the Redstone's engine shutdown was caused by two of its electrical cables separating in the wrong order. These cables were a control cable, which provided various control signals, and a power cable, which provided electrical power and grounding. Both cables were plugged into the rocket at the bottom edge {{of one of its}} tail fins and would separate at liftoff. The control cable was supposed to separate first, followed by the power cable. However, for this launch, the control cable was longer than expected—it was one designed for the military PGM-11 Redstone missile rather than the shorter cable designed for Mercury-Redstone. This control <b>cable</b> had been <b>clamped</b> to compensate for its greater length, but when the vehicle lifted off, the clamping did not work as planned and the control cable separation was delayed, eventually occurring about 29 milliseconds after the power cable had separated.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to obtain {{experimental}} information about the load-deflection behavior under monotonic and reversed lateral loading of simple one-bay, one-story steel frames with corner-to-corner bracing. Model frames with pinned and with rigidly welded joints are considered. Slowly applied lateral loads that carry the structures well into the inelastic range of deformation are included, but vertical loading is not considered. The primary test variables are the stiffnesses and strengths of the bracing members and of the frames. It is found that diagonal members composed of <b>cables</b> with standard <b>clamps</b> cannot be counted upon to maintain their strength beyond the elastic limit but that mild steel diagonal members with larger effective areas at the ends than in the middle do provide useful strength and ductility in the inelastic range. For a pinned frame with diagonals of the latter type, the idealized elastoplastic "slip" model provides a good approximation to the load-deflection relationship of the structure, so long as strain-hardening effects are neglected and the compressive buckling loads of the diagonals are small compared to the tensile yield loads. For a rigid-jointed frame a more complicated idealized diagram made up of the "slip" model for the diagonals plus a conventional bilinear hysteretic model for the frame is found to provide somewhat less accuracy due to gradual yielding in the frame. It is found that in most practical cases the diagonals in a rigid-jointed structure of this type will yield at a lower deflection than the frame and will limit the deflection at which both components remain active. However, if the joints are welded, then local stresses in the welds may cause earlier fracture in the frame with cyclic loading...|$|R
5000|$|The ride {{consists}} of two continuous cable loops, held up by six evenly-dispersed support towers. The cars hang from this moving cable, each one carrying up to four passengers (or 680 pounds). These are open cars with four seats (two rows of two, facing each other). At each station (one at Fantasy Forest, one at Frontier Adventures), a large bullwheel with a pulley-like groove rotates {{the direction in which}} the cable is moving. Incoming cars are transferred from the moving cable to a stationary steel track, along which the wheels of each car glide. As each car enters the station, it is [...] "caught" [...] and brought to a stop by a park employee, who then holds the car in place and opens the door for the passengers to exit. The car is then pushed around {{to the other side of}} the wheel, where another employee steadies the car for new passengers to enter. The door is closed and locked and the car is moved into the launcher. This holds the car in place until the proper launch interval has passed. The rides computer dispatches the cars at an appropriate interval or the employee can pull a cord which allows the car to roll down a ramp (accelerating the car to the same speed as the <b>cable)</b> and automatically <b>clamp</b> onto the <b>cable.</b> 2 safety sensors check to make sure the car is properly <b>clamped</b> onto the <b>cable.</b> If they fail the check the ride automatically shuts down and maintenance checks the latch before restarting the ride.

With this model {{is it possible to}} predict how intensive an inductive coupling affect a coaxial cable at his ends. Hence to draw conclusions from, if the device that is connected {{at the end of the}} cable, ensure the complete operability. Modelling Based on measurements of a coaxial cable over a ground plane an advanced model was build, that used an classical approach with T- equivalent circuit. The enhancements are described below. The internal- and external conductor described each with a classical conductor model. To ensuring the symmetry a T-equivalent circuit model is used. Rinnen and Raußen are the DC-resistance of the internal- and external conductor. Linnen and Laußen represent the inductance of the internal- and external conductor. Cinmasse and Cmasse are described the capacitive coupling of each conductor with the ground plane. Additionally to the already used conductor sizes of the coaxial cable the transfer impedance are also used. These transfer impedance was realised with a current-controlled-current-source, a coil, a resistor and a voltage-controlled-voltage-source. With the help of current-controlled-current-source the current through the external conductor are gripped and than routed through the resistor RS with the in series connected coil LS. The resistor RS and the coil LS together build the transfer impedance. Due to the current through the transfer impedance a voltage across the transfer impedance exist. With the voltage-controlled-voltage-source this voltage are given to the internal conductor. This transfer impedance described the complete coupling between internal- and external conductor. The model is shown in figure 1. Final BCI Model To model the complete coaxial cable repeated segments of the visualized equivalent circuit from figure 1 connected together. To complete the model, additionally the BCI clamp is modelled. It is adequate to measure the current at the input of the clamp. To model the clamp a voltage-source is used, that provide a voltage that are equivalent according to amount the lowest measured current. After that a frequency depending voltage-controlled-voltage-source is connected following of a coil. This coil is coupled with the coil of the external conductor at the coupling point (clamp position in reality) of the coaxial cable. figure 1 : Conductor segment of the BCI Modell Comparison between Simulation and Measurement In the frequency range between 10 MHz and 160 MHz measurements was made. In figure 2 is presented a comparison between measurements and simulation. figure 2 : Comparison between simulation and measurements The comparison shows, that the model warranted a good worst-case estimation. Conclusion In the future experiments and simulation with different cable lengths will be made and compared. Also a accurate analysis of the coupling between <b>cable</b> and <b>Clamp</b> is preferable. For that, the transfer impedance of the BCI clamp must be determined. Literature S. Caniggia; L.

40|$|Downhole {{monitoring}} {{is valuable}} {{to the oil}} and gas industry due to the advantages knowledge brings when it comes to well optimisation. The more information available about an individual well strengthens the understanding of the total field dynamics, making it possible to maximise a field's productivity. An evaluation of applying one of two types of temperature monitoring systems, Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Wellwatcher Flux to the Valhall field has beenconducted. The two systems have been evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:Instillation complexity, operational reliability after instillation, cost of instillation including rig time, contingency plan, experience and the different features the system provides. DTS consists of either a prefabricated ber optic cable or a hollow steel <b>cable</b> that is <b>clamped</b> to the outside of the liner, where an optical ber is pumped in place after the completion string is installed. Due to the well design on Valhall, only the pumpable system is applicable for implementing to the Valhall eld. The fiber itself serves as the temperature sensors, enabling a continuous thermal prole of the well to be measured. The upper and lower completions are mated by a control line wet mate (CLWM), which allows for the fiber to be pumped from the upper to the lower completions. With the pumpable DTS system, it is currently not possible to incorporate pressure sensors. BP has relatively good experience with DTS in Azerbaijan, where improvements have been made to the system. It has continuous sensors, is more cost effective and is also able to monitor the effect of gas lift valves. However, the system has a slightly higher risk of failure during installation due to the CLWM. Once installed however, DTS has abetter contingency plan in the case of failure. Well watcher Flux is an electric cable that has up to 50 temperature point sensors attached. Pressure sensors are most likely available in 2014 and can be spliced directlyon to the cable. The upper and lower completions are connected through an inductive coupler, which allows communication between the two completions. Wellwatcher Flux is relatively new on the market. The system has only had 6 trialruns in India. The Wellwatcher Flux system has a maximum amount of sensors, is more expensive than DTS, and appears to be slightly less complicated to install due to the simplicity and reliability of the inductive coupler connecting the upper and lower completions. Based on the evaluation of the set criteria for the two systems, Wellwatcher Flux is determined to be a better candidate for implementing permanent temperature monitoring on Valhall. </p...|$|R
