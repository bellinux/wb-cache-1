Curs 2013 - 2014 Tutor: Ángel José Rodrigo HernándezThe {{issue of}} the {{attribution}} of international responsibility to States for conduct {{of a group of}} individuals within the territory of another State has become a question of control. International jurisprudence has addressed this question by advancing several different <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> that allegedly better resolve the attribution question. The ICJ put forward two <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> in the Nicaragua case, the so-called strict <b>control</b> or agency <b>test</b> and the effective <b>control</b> <b>test.</b> The Appeals Chamber of the ICTY found it unpersuasive and used instead what named the overall <b>control</b> <b>test.</b> Moreover, the ECtHR has developed yet another test: the effective overall <b>control</b> <b>test.</b> These <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> will be set out explaining the different rationales that argue for and against their adoption and it will be seen that they show a tension between the need for what has been called “real accountability” of States and the attribution of responsibility to States only for their own conduct. It will be argued that while accountability is an important purpose, especially /nwhen dealing with international humanitarian law, it is necessary to ensure that States are only held responsible for conduct with which there is a sufficient close link so as to be considered its own...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{enterprises}} {{are highly}} dependent on Information Technology (IT) for accomplishing their objectives. In {{order to try to}} ensure that IT is aligned with the business objectives, an enterprise should ensure that it has effective IT controls for supporting its IT environment. Therefore, for checking the effectiveness of its IT environment, the enterprise’s IT environment is tested against the enterprise’s IT controls. So it is correct to state IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing</b> plays a crucial role in trying to ensure that the IT environ-ment of an enterprise is reliable for achieving the business goals. But it should be kept in mind that IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing</b> is a very challenging process. For instance, some of the challenges are the work effort required to complete the test, the speed of the test, accuracy, etc. Another challenge is the high cost of IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing.</b> During the accomplishment of the thesis, it has been observed that to solve the above-mentioned challenges, a lot of enterprises rely on Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques (CAAT) tools available in the market. After analyzing {{some of the most popular}} and widely used CAAT tools, it has been found out that such tools are helpful, but they are having their own challenges. For in-stance, they are not able to address all the requirements of IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing.</b> Further-more, CAAT tools are capable of performing specific tasks; they are not able to address all the issues related to IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing.</b> Their main challenge is the insufficient use of existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) data. The solution for having an effective IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing</b> process could be the appropriate use of enterprise’s existing ERP data which is of high quality. In fact, the data should be measured and analyzed appropriately, and it should be mapped to the IT controls in a correct way. Actually, it might be challenging and even expensive to implement such a system, but if such system is implemented once, and it could be used for several years with minor updates, then it would be worthy to implement it for a reliable IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing</b> in an enterprise environment...|$|R

The breathing pattern was evaluated at rest (standing and supine position during both relaxed breathing and deep breathing) and while performing clinical motor <b>control</b> <b>tests,</b> i. e. bent knee fall out and active straight leg raise. A blinded observer analyzed the breathing pattern of the participants using visual inspection and manual palpation. Costo-diaphragmatic breathing was considered as optimal breathing pattern. Subjects filled in visual analog scales for the assessment of pain intensity during the tests. At rest, no significant differences were found between the breathing pattern of patients and healthy subjects (P >  0. 05). In contrast, significantly more altered breathing patterns were observed in chronic LBP-patients during motor <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> (P =  0. 01). Changes in breathing pattern during motor <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> were not related to pain severity (P >  0. 01), but were related to motor control dysfunction (P =  0. 01) ...|$|R

In physiotherapeutic practice observational tests are frequently {{used to assess}} the impaired abilities. Several <b>tests</b> for movement <b>control</b> {{abilities are}} available, but no evidence exists on how to combine and interpret them. Objective: The aim was to investigate structural validity of a set of movement <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> with Rasch analysis. Design: Cross-sectional study Methods: Thirty persons with and thirty without neck pain were recruited for this study. All persons performed ten movement <b>control</b> <b>tests.</b> A partial credit model was applied to investigate item fit, ordering of the item response functions, dimensionality and hierarchy of the tests. Results: The majority of persons with neck pain had moderate disabilities and the mean value in the Neck disability index was 10. 7. Functioning of the movement <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> to measure the construct “movement control abilities” was adequate for the majority of <b>tests.</b> Three movement <b>control</b> <b>test</b> showed considerable misfit. Possible explanations were a reactive movement control instead of an active control and a more challenging test position. Test difficulties and person abilities could be estimated for the complete sample. The most difficult test was “sitting rocking forward” (1. 13 logits) and the least difficult test was “lifting the right arm” (- 1. 30 logits). The highest person ability estimate was 3. 61 logits indicating that movement <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> are missing to evaluate persons with moderate neck disabilities.
