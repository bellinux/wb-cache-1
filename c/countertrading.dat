40|$|This {{empirical}} {{exploratory study}} {{is part of}} a larger comprehensive study of countertrade practices in the Asia-Pacific region. A mail survey of 600 Australian international trading firms reveals that a positive attitude toward countertrade exists among both countertraders and non-countertraders in Australia. Further the study reveals the major motivating factors, the benefits derived difficulties faced and reasons for not <b>countertrading</b> by Australian firms. In addition, the study identifies the forms of countertrade used, the countries sewed, and the product and service categories countertraded. The results are compared to earlier studies of UK and Canadian firms, and the implications for international marketing managers are discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997...|$|E
40|$|The {{horizontal}} {{integration of the}} energy market {{and the organization of}} transmission services remain two open issues in the restructured European electricity sector. The coupling of the French, Belgian and Dutch electricity markets (the trilateral market) in November 2006 was a real success. The extension of the system to Germany in November 2010 also proceeded smoothly and the intent is to continue with the same market architecture. But Market Coupling is based on a zonal system which has often failed in meshed grids. This may cast doubts on what will happen in the future when electricity demand picks up again and wind develops. The nodal system has generally been more successful than zonal architectures but its implementation is not currently foreseen in the EU. This paper analyzes versions of Market Coupling that differ by the organization of counter-trading. While underplayed in current discussions, counter-trading could become a key element of Market Coupling as its geographic coverage expands and wind penetrates. We simplify matters by assuming away strategic behavior between the energy and counter-trading markets and conduct the analysis on a stylized six node example taken from the literature. We simulate Market Coupling for different assumptions of zonal decomposition and coordination of Transmission System Operators (TSOs). We show that these assumptions matter: {{even in the absence of}} strategic behavior, Market Coupling can be quite vulnerable to the particular situation on hand; <b>countertrading</b> can work well or completely fail and it is not clear beforehand what will prevail. Our analysis relies on standard economic notions such as social welfare and Generalized Nash equilibrium, but the use of these notions is probably novel. The nodal organization is the reference first best scenario: different zonal decompositions and degrees of coordination are then studied with respect to this first best solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiences}} {{and the practice}} of many countries show that <b>countertrade</b> could be used as the significant method for incensement of the export {{as well as for the}} promotion of the foreign investments even in the period of deep financial crises. Contemporary governments' pro-active <b>countertrade</b> orientation in USA, Israel, Sweden, Norway, Japan and other developed countries highlights the inadequacy of the obsolete and stereotypical concept of the <b>countertrade</b> as the compensation transaction based on the 'trade without money' concept. Besides this, the practices proved that <b>countertrade</b> transactions are the consequence and the indicator of economic shocks. Therefore, the study of the special legal issues that may arise in <b>countertrade</b> transactions will be very important not only for the domestic legal doctrine but also for the commercial practice. As national laws do not contain provisions specific for <b>countertrade,</b> it is of particular importance to analyze legal question such as structuring and drafting of <b>countertrade</b> arrangements as well as to study the question of the legal nature of the contractual link between legal instruments which form multicontractual mechanism of <b>countertrade</b> transactions. The character of the legal connection among the legal instruments in <b>countertrade</b> arrangement, as well as the legal nature of the <b>countertrade</b> commitment, strongly influence the <b>countertrade</b> agreement's legal nature. The economic reality of a group of contracts joined by the common goal of the transaction (consideration) and the <b>countertrade</b> commitment has to be followed by the legal reality which will recognize the legal interdependence of the obligation deriving from the legally independent <b>countertrade</b> arrangement...|$|R

40|$|<b>Countertrade</b> {{is a form}} of {{international}} trade which involves payment partially or in full with goods rather than with money. It is clearly growing and becoming an increasingly important part of the international business environment. Although many do not prefer to do business through <b>countertrade,</b> trade experts have concluded that world economic conditions have made <b>countertrade</b> a necessary financing mechanism for countries that cannot pay cash for their imports. In order to trade with these countries and to open up new markets in countries with limited resources, United States companies must educate themselves about the advantages and drawbacks of <b>countertrade.</b> <b>Countertrade</b> by United States firms raises a host of legal issues, including the application of United States trade laws, antitrust laws, and other federal regulatory concerns. <b>Countertrade</b> arrangements are subject to the application of United States trade laws.

40|$|Abstract: We {{maintain}} that <b>countertrade</b> presents an emerging opportunity for entrepreneurial firms. That is, {{the trend toward}} more and smaller <b>countertrade</b> exchanges {{opens the door to}} small firms, and the flexibility and creativity of entrepreneurial firms may indeed represent advantages for these smaller competitors. We unfold our theory via three important considerations. First, we explain the concept of <b>countertrade</b> and describe its sophisticated variations. Second, we discuss the factors that are driving the trend toward increasing <b>countertrade,</b> lending confidence to the prediction that the trend toward increasing <b>countertrade</b> will continue. Finally, from a resource-based perspective, we describe the fundamental characteristics of the entrepreneurial firm, thus explaining why these firms may be uniquely positioned to exploit disproportionately the potential of <b>countertrade</b> in the future. With this as background, we develop a model integrating described constructs in a way that demonstrates the usefulness of the practice of <b>countertrade</b> for entrepreneurial firms...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} towards <b>countertrade</b> view it {{in terms}} of the characteristics of isolated actors engaging in different forms of <b>countertrade.</b> An alternative approach for understanding <b>countertrade</b> is provided by the network paradigm. <b>Countertrade,</b> because of its complexity, reciprocity and government involvement, involves connected relationships in which the core transaction impinges on related transactions in various ways. Networks of actors are formed to undertake <b>countertrade</b> activities which involve the transforming of resources. This transformation occurs in an atmosphere which influences the nature of the relationships and the transaction is influenced by factors in the environment which gives rise to the need for <b>countertrade.</b> In this paper, three case studies of networks of relationships in <b>countertrade</b> transactions involving Australian organisations are described. These descriptions in each case are at the negotiation/early implementation stage and then six to ten years later {{at the point where the}} transaction is completed or nearing completion. The changes which have taken place in the network during this period are discussed in terms of actors, activities, resource transformation, atmosphere, relationships and structure. Applying the network approach to analysing <b>countertrade,</b> sharpens the focus on a number of characteristics of <b>countertrade</b> which distinguish it from other forms of international business behaviour. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Countertrade</b> - or {{reciprocal}} buying - {{is defined}} as a transaction involving (at least) a two-way transfer of goods, rather than a singular transfer of goods for money. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} explain the extensive use of <b>countertrade</b> both between countries and between firms within one country. In a simple game-theoretic model it is shown that <b>countertrade</b> may be a rational business strategy for firms with buying power, and that the impact on welfare is negative, even in the case where no firm exists. The model is consistent with the observations that <b>countertrade</b> occurs mainly in homogeneous goods industries, that trades are relatively balanced and that the practice is more widespread during recessions than during booms. <b>Countertrade,</b> reciprocal buying, two-way transfer of goods, game-theoretic model, rational business strategy, homogeneous goods industries. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} range of <b>countertrade</b> {{activities}} taking place in international trade and the existing hypotheses that purport to explain their existence. <b>Countertrade</b> may be attractive {{in the short run}} in response to some pre-existing market distortion, impediment or disequilibrium.

40|$|This paper sees <b>countertrade</b> as a {{means by}} which the PCPEs (previously {{centrally}} planned economies) and LDCs extract some of the monopoly profits from firms in OECD countries to subsidize their exports. Viewed in this way, <b>countertrade</b> is an exchange of market entry for marketing assistance in which the PCPEs and LDCs effectively shift the terms of trade in their favour. Based on a new sample of 230 <b>countertrade</b> contracts, which have been signed between firms in OECD countries and PCPEs and LDCs in the period between 1984 and 1988, the paper estimates the likelihood of such terms-of-trade change {{as a function of the}} market power of OECD firms, the extent to which goods offered by the PCPEs/LDCs in the contract reflect comparative advantage, and the information available in the bargaining over the terms of the contract. The data are consistent with the view that <b>countertrade</b> is used by the PCPEs/LDCs as a vehicle to reduce the effective price of their imports. Since it is equivalent to an import tax cum export subsidy in the presence of foreign market power, <b>countertrade</b> raises the welfare of the PCPEs/LDCs by allowing them to recapture some of the monopoly rents the OECD firms are extracting from their consumers in PCPEs/LDCs.
