40|$|The use of Nitrile Butadiene Rubber NBR as seal in {{machines}} {{has increased}} in recent years. NBR is considered as the standard material for sealing and NBR owes its many applications {{to a range of}} special mechanical properties. However, the non-linear mechanical properties and incompressible behaviour of NBR make the analysis of NBR very difficult. The literature review highlighted the fact that the most common technical cause of hand pump failures was the wear of the <b>piston</b> <b>seals.</b> The contact surface of the <b>piston</b> <b>seals</b> with the bore surface (Brass) of the cylinder and the <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> contact area are the key to calculating and determining seal friction force and seal wear rate. Several researchers carried out modelling of friction and wear processes, though little of these focused on the wear of NBR seals, and very limited research has been conducted on the wear of <b>piston</b> <b>seals</b> in the presence of water, and a very few has been reported regarding how to determined and calculating the wear rate of removal material of <b>piston</b> <b>seals</b> used in water hand pump...|$|R

40|$|Large {{numbers of}} rural {{populations in the}} {{developing}} world rely on the handpump for access to drinking water from ground sources. The functional sustainability of handpumps is affected by the low availability of handpumps at any given period of time. The wear of the nitrile rubber <b>piston</b> <b>seals</b> contribute significantly towards this low availability accounting for a significant percentage of maintenance interventions. In this study a novel approach is used to improve the wear resistance of the nitrile rubber <b>piston</b> <b>seals.</b> Hybrid coatings of diamond-like carbon (DLC) and silicon doped diamond-like carbon (Si-DLC), with and without Si-C interlayers, were deposited onto both sample nitrile rubber substrates and actual <b>piston</b> <b>seals.</b> The deposition was done using a combination of closed field unbalanced magnetron sputtering ion plating (CFUBMSIP) and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) in Ar/C 4 H 10 plasma. Film characterisation was carried out using visible (488 nm) and UV (325 nm) Raman spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface profilometry, hardness measurements, hydrophobicity and surface energy analysis, adhesion and flexibility analysis, and tribological investigations under dry and wet conditions for normal loads of 1 N and 5 N. A <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> wear test rig was used to test the wear resistance of the coated <b>piston</b> <b>seals.</b> Experimental results show a dense, non-columnar microstructure with a dendritic morphology. This dendritic crack-like structure promotes film flexibility. The G peak position for the coatings was centred approximately around 1580 cm- 1. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) generally tended to increase for coatings with Si-C interlayer. Full width at half maximum, FWHM(G), was observed to reduce for coatings with Si-C interlayers. Calculated hydrogen values for all of the films were between 24 % and 31 %. The internal compressive residual stress in the coatings was reduced. The contact angle of water droplets showed that the coatings were hydrophobic. The deposited coatings showed excellent adherence with an adhesion rating of 4 A for films with a Si-C interlayer. The composite micro-hardness was highest for DLC coatings at 15. 5 GPa for indentation load of 147. 1 mN using a Vickers micro-hardness tester. Nano-indentation results show that all of the coatings tested had the same order of nano-mechanical properties with hardness values of approximately 3. 6 GPa and Elastic modulus values of 35 GPa. XPS survey scans showed the contributions from C 1 s (~ 285 eV), O 1 s (~ 531 eV), Si 2 p (~ 100 eV) and Si 2 s (~ 151 eV). C-Si (C 1 s) and Si-C (Si 2 p) configurations corresponding to bonding between carbon and silicon atoms in SiC were observed. The sp 3 /sp 2 ratio increased for the Si-DLC and DLC with Si-C interlayer coating compared to the DLC coating. All of the coatings showed excellent tribological results with an over 50 % reduction in the coefficient of friction compared to uncoated nitrile rubber. There was no penetration of the coatings for normal loads of 1 N and 5 N under wet sliding and 1 N normal load under dry sliding, which is important for potential application onto <b>piston</b> <b>seals...</b>|$|R

The hydraulic hybrids utilize a high and low pressure accumulator system with a pump and motor to store and transfer energy to the vehicle.

50|$|<b>Piston</b> <b>seals</b> were a {{perennial}} problem at this time. Those for large stationary engines, working at low pressures, were sealed {{by a variety}} of methods including leather cup washers, pools of standing water and even a poultice of cow dung. As working pressures increased, which had been an essential part of turning the steam engine into the steam locomotive, demands on the <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> increased further. <b>Pistons</b> were now mostly sealed by having oakum rope wrapped around them in a groove, often smeared with tallow. Keeping the rope seal moist, thus swollen, was recognised as an important factor in achieving a good seal. As the steam spring cylinders were in {{the lower part of the}} boiler, below the water line, it was expected that they would seal well. Despite this, they continued to give trouble with leakage and were eventually removed and replaced with iron or steel leaf springs. Wood in 1831 illustrates one of the Killingworth locomotives, now fitted with metal leaf springs and also coupling rods.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} the gas seals used in {{centrifugal}} compressors and axial turbines requires to consider not only their aptitude to reduce leakage, but also their contribution to the overall dynamics of the machine. Honeycomb and hole pattern annular seals are often employed in compressors for the end balance <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> or as the central balance <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> in a back-to-back arrangement. In contrast to labyrinth seals, they show a beneficial damping effect. In order to obtain an effective tool for predicting the leakage and the dynamic response of honeycomb seals, a bulk flow model has been devised in the past and, implemented in numerical codes, it is presently used in the design process. This kind of codes, however, require simplifying assumptions: in particular, one reference code available to the authors adopts the hypothesis of isothermal process. As the required level of confidence in seal design is increasing, an experimental validation and possibly some refinement are needed. In this work, the bulk flow model was reviewed and the sensitivity to different hypotheses was explored.
