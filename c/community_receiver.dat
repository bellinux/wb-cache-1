50|$|Years ago, {{to receive}} APT images, a {{specialized}} decoder was required {{in addition to}} the receiver to display or print images, much like HF WEFAX (serving the maritime <b>community).</b> Often both <b>receiver</b> and decoder were combined into one unit.|$|R
25|$|The {{television}} programmes {{prepared by}} the Indian government at the four studios were transmitted at 6GHz to ATS 6 from one of two ground stations located in Delhi and Ahmedabad. These signals were then re-transmitted at 860MHz by the satellite, which were directly received in 2000 villages by <b>community</b> television <b>receivers</b> with 3m parabolic antennas. Regular television stations also received the signals and broadcast them to another 3000 villages in the standard VHF television band. Each television signal had two audio channels to carry audio in two major languages of each cluster. This setup was called the Direct Reception System (DRS). Apart from the direct broadcasts, the earth station at Ahmedabad was micro-wave linked to the TV transmitter built {{in the village of}} Pij. The Delhi studio was linked to the terrestrial TV transmitters of AIR. A receive-only station was built in Amritsar and linked to the local TV transmitter.|$|R
30|$|During {{the current}} period of solar maximum, {{there is concern}} within the GPS <b>community</b> {{regarding}} GPS <b>receiver</b> performance during periods of intense geomagnetic substorms. Such storms are common in the high latitude auroral region, and are associated with small-scale scintillation effects, which can cause receiver tracking errors and loss of phase lock. The auroral oval can extend many degrees equatorward under active ionospheric conditions, with an impact on precise positioning applications in Canada, the United States and Northern Europe. In this paper, a study of receiver tracking performance is conducted during periods of auroral substorm activity. Dual frequency observations are obtained using codeless and semicodeless GPS receivers (Trimble 4000 SSi, NovAtel MiLLennium and Ashtech Z- 12), and performance comparisons are established and interpreted with respect to GPS availability at solar maximum and the years beyond.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} court judge, now retired, continues {{his interest in}} the community sometimes visiting the <b>community.</b> The court-appointed <b>receiver,</b> speaking in 2010, reported considerable progress in mitigating conditions, for example, 400 dogs were neutered or spayed and 145 adopted. Efforts by the community with outside assistance have greatly improved conditions, however, raw sewage still drains directly from a system of plastic pipes into an open lagoon. Riverside County plans to use federal and state redevelopment funds to facilitate better mobile home facilities nearby, collapsed in 2012 due to loss of funds resulting from the 2008-12 California budget crisis. California redevelopment agencies, which sometimes used funds for unnecessary projects but also for badly needed housing, had been shut down. Plans for relocation are further complicated by the illegal status of some of the workers and reluctance by the Purépecha people to break up their community.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{construct}} validity and clinical application of the Pediatric Sleep Survey Instrument (PSSI) as a tool to screen for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in children. Methods: Polysomnography (PSG) outcomes and PSSI subscale scores were compared between a clinical cohort (N[*]=[*] 87, 5 – 10 years, 62 M/ 25 F) and a nonsnoring community sample (N[*]=[*] 55, 5 – 10 years, 28 M/ 27 F). Group comparisons assessed the ability of the PSSI subscales to discriminate between the clinical and <b>community</b> cohorts. <b>Receiver</b> operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessed construct validity, with the Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) > 5 events/h, OSA- 18 score > 60, and Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) above the 70 th percentile as the target references. Results: The clinical group had more respiratory events, respiratory-related arousals, fragmented sleep, and lower oxygen saturation nadir than the community group (p[*] [*] 5 events/h (area under the curve (AUC) [*]=[*] 0. 7), an OSA- 18 score > 60 (AUC[*]=[*] 0. 7), and a PDSS score in the 70 th percentile (AUC[*]=[*] 0. 8). The Morning Tiredness subscale accurately predicted a PDSS score in the 70 th percentile (AUC[*]=[*] 0. 8). A cutoff score of 5 on the SDB subscale showed a sensitivity of 0. 94 and a specificity of 0. 76, correctly identifying 77 and 100 % of the clinical and community cohorts, respectively. Conclusion: The PSSI Sleep Disordered Breathing subscale is a valid tool for screening SDB and daytime sleepiness in children aged 5 – 10 years. Sarah N. Biggs, Gillian M. Nixon, Margot J.

40|$|Background/purposeSuicide is a {{major concern}} in public health worldwide. Early {{identification}} of individuals at risk is critical for suicide prevention. The present study revised the 5 -item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS- 5) to a checklist format (BSRS- 5 R) and validated the BSRS- 5 R into a screening tool for psychiatric morbidity and suicide ideation in the general public. MethodsThe study participants consisted of two subsets of sample from community residents and psychiatric patients. The community subjects were recruited from stratified proportional randomization sampling in a nationwide community survey, while the psychiatric patients were from psychiatric outpatient service and psychiatric daycare unit in a teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. All participants responded to the questionnaire investigating the BSRS- 5, personal experience with suicide, and demographic information. ResultsIn total, 2147 community respondents and 700 respondents from psychiatric settings completed the survey questions. The BSRS- 5 R was highly correlated to BSRS- 5 with good internal consistency in our study sample. For the <b>community</b> subjects, <b>receiver</b> operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an optimal cutoff of 2 / 3 for BSRS- 5 R to discriminate psychiatric morbidity or suicide ideation. The BSRS- 5 R could also identify psychiatric morbidity in psychiatric outpatients and daycare patients. In addition, the cutoff of 4 / 5 for BSRS- 5 R to determine suicide ideation yielded moderately good predictive validity in psychiatric outpatients and in daycare patients. ConclusionThe BSRS- 5 R was validated as an efficient checklist to screen for psychiatric morbidity and suicide ideation in the general public. The result is valuable in translating into general medical and community settings for early detection of suicide ideation...|$|R
40|$|The Grahamstown, South Africa (33. 3 °S, 26. 5 °E) ionospheric {{field station}} {{operates}} a UMass Lowell digital pulse ionospheric sounder (Digisonde) and an Ashtech geodetic grade dual frequency GPS receiver. The GPS receiver {{is owned by}} Chief Directorate Surveys and Mapping (CDSM) in Cape Town, forms {{part of the national}} TrigNet network and was installed in February 2005. The sampling rates of the GPS receiver and Digisonde were set to 1 s and 15 min, respectively. Data from four continuous months, March–June 2005 inclusive, were considered in this initial investigation. Data available from the Grahamstown GPS receiver was limited, and, therefore, only these 4 months have been considered. Total Electron Content (TEC) values were determined from GPS measurements obtained from satellites passing near vertical (within an 80 ° elevation) to the station. TEC values were obtained from ionograms recorded at times within 5 min of the near vertical GPS measurement. The GPS derived TEC values are referred to as GTEC and the ionogram derived TEC values as ITEC. Comparisons of GTEC and ITEC values are presented in this paper. The differential clock biases of the GPS satellites and receivers are taken into account. The plasmaspheric contribution to the TEC can be inferred from the results, and confirm findings obtained by other groups. This paper describes the groundwork for a procedure that will allow the validation of GPS derived ionospheric information with ionosonde data. This work will be of interest to the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) <b>community</b> since GPS <b>receivers</b> are becoming recognised as another source for ionospheric information...|$|R
40|$|The FAA is {{currently}} leading a team consisting of members from Industry, Government, and Academia {{to evaluate the}} future of Loran-C in the United States as an alternative or backup to the Global Positioning System (GPS) as a national navigation system. For Loran-C {{to be considered a}} viable back-up system to GPS it is must be able to meet Required Navigational Performance accuracy requirements for aircraft Non-Precision Approach of 309 m and Harbor Entrance and Approach accuracy requirements of 8 - 20 m for the maritime <b>community.</b> Current Loran <b>receivers</b> which use a weighted least-squares solution to compute a position from Time of Arrival (TOA) or Time Difference measurements cannot meet new Coast Guard and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) accuracy requirements. ^ In the past 10 years advances in DSP hardware and algorithms have allowed for improvements to Loran receivers. This has led to performance improvements, especially in the accuracy of the navigation position solution. The current limitation now appears to be the difference between the assumed all-seawater propagation paths and the actual propagation path which has varying ground conductivities. This difference is called the Additional Secondary Factor (ASF). A description of various tests and analysis conducted to understand the spatial, temporal, and directional variations in the ASF values as well as a proposed method to incorporate ASFs for both maritime and aviation users is provided. A solution methodology for each user community is provided to meet both spatial and temporal ASF variations. ^ A proposed integrated Loran/IMU/GPS receiver is described, where an IMU is used to improve the performance of Loran in the absence of GPS. The proposed solution is to track and integrate information such as course and speed from an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU), Additional Secondary Factor (ASF) grid data, and ASF temporal corrections into the position solution to allow the position solution to meet the accuracy requirements. This Kalman filter integrated receiver appears to work fairly well (perhaps 25 m accuracy). The position accuracy is still not quite as good as needed (8 - 20 m); however, improvement will come with a better ASF grid as the ASF is the largest source of error. ...|$|R
40|$|Irritability is a {{mood that}} most people {{experience}} {{as part of a}} normal, healthy life. It is also a symptom or associated feature of a number of psychological disorders. There is a general belief that adolescents experience irritability to a greater degree than other age groups and high levels of irritability during adolescence are independently predictive of suicide risk and the development of internalising disorders. Irritability research has however been hampered by a lack of appropriate measures, to address this issue Stringaris et al. (2012) created the Affective Reactivity Index which {{has been shown to be}} a reliable and valid measure of irritability in adolescents in both the US and UK. Irritability is a psychological symptom that is thought to be developmentally sensitive. For example, in the DSM- 5 irritability is a symptom of depressive disorders for children and adolescents but not for adults. Yet little research has been conducted examining the developmental trajectory of irritability, and no peer reviewed publications were found that compared irritability in the context of depressive disorders or other depressive symptoms between adolescence and adulthood. The present thesis, prepared as a thesis by publication, aimed to determine whether the ARI was a psychometrically sound tool for use with Australian adults and adolescents. The thesis used the ARI to investigate the associations irritability has with mental health problems, as well as any differences in irritability or its associations with mental health problems between adults and adolescents. The first paper entitled ‘Psychometric properties of the Affective Reactivity Index in Australian adults and adolescents’ has been resubmitted to Psychological Assessment after reviewer’s comments were addressed. This paper reports that the ARI is a reliable measure in both Australian adults (α = 0. 80) and adolescents (α = 0. 85). The measure conforms to the single factor structure proposed by Stringaris et al. (2012), although there may be some item redundancy. The validation analyses are promising with moderate correlations between the ARI and measures of psychopathology, demonstrating convergent validity. The second paper entitled ‘Irritability and psychopathology: A comparison between adolescents and adults’ has been submitted to The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry. This paper directly compares the level of irritability and the association irritability has with depressive symptoms between adolescents and adults. Adults had higher mean irritability scores than adolescents and also higher mean depressive symptom scores. Adults who reported they experienced impairment due to their irritability were more likely to score above the clinical cut off on measures of depression and anxiety. Irritability was strongly associated with depressive symptoms in both adults and adolescents, and with anxiety symptoms in adults. The results reported in this paper indicate that the belief that adolescents are more irritable than adults may not be true, though adolescents may be more prone to experiencing impairing irritability in the absence of categorical mental health disorders than adults. Additionally there was little difference in the level of association between irritability and depressive symptoms between adolescents and adults indicating the need for further research to determine if irritability is also a salient feature of adult depressive disorders. The third paper entitled ‘Can irritability act as a marker of psychopathology?’ is under review by Journal of Adolescence. This paper examines how irritability differs between a community sample of adolescents and a clinical sample of adolescents diagnosed with psychological disorders. As expected the clinical sample reported significantly higher mean irritability scores than the community sample. The clinical sample also had a greater degree of impairment associated with their irritability than the <b>community</b> sample. A <b>receiver</b> operating characteristic (ROC) analysis found that according to self report a score of 4 on the ARI was the optimum cut off point for distinguishing between those with and without a DSM-IV diagnosis. This value resulted in an area under the curve of 0. 86 (95 % CI 0. 76 to 0. 95) with a sensitivity of 77. 4 % and a specificity of 77. 4 %. The data reported in this paper demonstrates that irritability is strongly associated with mental health problems in adolescents and due to this it may be possible to use the ARI as a screen for psychological disorder. The results presented in this thesis call into question the widely held belief that adolescents are more irritable than adults. However, the adult sample comprised mostly young adults so any conclusions drawn can only be made in terms of young adults. The results presented here also provide initial evidence that the relationship between irritability and depression may continue into adulthood. These results cannot be extrapolated to the entirety of adulthood but for young adults at least, irritability may continue to be a relevant symptom of depressive disorders...|$|R
