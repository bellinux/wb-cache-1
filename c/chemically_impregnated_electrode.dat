Devices exploiting this concept were fabricated using carbon and metal oxides (Pinnacle Research) as the electrodes and sulfuric acid as the electrolyte.

The challenge is to form a solid electrode-solid ionomer electrolyte composite which has a high capacitance per geometric area.

30|$|The <b>chemically</b> <b>impregnated</b> AC, AC 3 (Fig.  5 a, b) and AC 4 (Fig.  6 a, b) {{showed a}} {{negative}} trend of porosity development. It {{may be attributed}} to the damage of the morphological structure of the activated carbon. Besides that, these results are possible because some of the pores were clogged with H 3 PO 4 even after undergoing washing process. The reaction of H 3 PO 4 with the lignocellulosic material gave a burn-out sponge-like structure as shown in Fig.  6 a [13]. It displays the similar results and also shows the collapsed morphology structure [18, 26]. With excessive impregnation with H 3 PO 4, it might form an insulating layer which inhibits the activation process [27]. Besides, it was found that washing process played a crucial role for the development of pore in activated carbon. This is because after activation at high temperature, most of the chemical activator remains in the particle and intense washing eliminates the chemical. Thus, it produces more porous AC. However, polyphosphate that is being entrapped in AC appears in the form of ash content or gave the final product with acidic character [26]. Therefore, to ensure that the acid content is successfully removed from the AC, the washing process is repeated until a near neutral pH is obtained. The overall micrographs for AC 2, AC 3 and AC 4 showed an irregular and heterogeneous surface morphology with moderately developed porous structure. The external surface of the AC is full of cavities and with irregular shape distributed. The formation of these cavities resulted from the evaporation of the dehydrating agent (H 3 PO 4) during carbonization, leaving the space previously occupied by the reagent [28]. Chemical AC seems to be clearer and smoother compared to physical AC due to the removal of volatile compounds and impurities during the activation process [18].|$|R

In this case, silanol groups from ash content may affect the extraction efficiency for 4 -NPs. The ACs made from RHs were <b>chemically</b> <b>impregnated</b> with ZnCl 2 and carbonized at 800 o C. To investigate the role of silica, three types of ACs were prepared, i. e., untreated ACs (AC–Si, contain silica), base treated ACs (AC–B–Si, remain some silica inside), and ACs made by base treated RHs (AC–B, no silica), the surface area obtained from these treatments were 1352 m 2 /g, 1666 m 2 /g, and 1712 m 2 /g respectively.   ACs made by base treatment has the highest surface area (related to BET), which indicat that silica removal process promotes the formation of open pore system on ACs and enhances the surface area of ACs. However, extraction efficiency measured by GC-MS in SPE process showed the reversal trends (i. e., AC–Si= 32. 08 %, AC–B–Si= 82. 63 %, AC–B= 51. 78 %), among them the AC–B–Si sorbent reveal the best performance in SPE process.

40|$|Abstract: The {{potential}} use of termite-termite agonism in {{pest control}} is explored and evaluated. Intra- and interspecific encounters among termites from different colonies {{are known to}} result in aggressive or avoidance behaviors {{in a variety of}} species. Recent studies suggest, however, that intraspecific confrontations only rarely evoke aggressive responses in several economically important termite genera in the United States (Coptotermes, Reticulitermes, and Zootermopsis). Thus the most promising applied use of natural agonistic behaviors among termites appears to be in research on individual- and colonyrecognition systems in the Isoptera. Artificial manipulation of recognition and response cues might facilitate novel control methodologies based on masking or interfering with natural stimuli. Directions for future research are discussed. Insect behaviors are diverse, and knowledge of the behaviors of a species has always been a key element in pest management. Basic knowledge of activity periods, diet preferences, and mating behaviors can be central in determining an approach toward deterring a pest species. Taking advantage of behavioral patterns or interfering with natural repertoires or both can produce very effective control methodologies. Understanding the foraging behavior of subterranean termites is crucial to prevention of damage to buildings (Beal and others 1989; Su and Scheffrahn 1990). Preventative techniques include proper construction practices to exclude or deter foraging and feeding by subterranean termites and application of large volumes of chemical insecticides as soil drenches to kill or repel foraging subterranean termites. Existing and future methods for remedial control of subterranean termites will also rely on knowledge of the foraging behavior of these insects (Su and Scheffrahn 1990). Two promising future control methods involve the use of physical barriers and the use of nonrepellent, slow-acting insecticides. Physical barriers will consist of a substrate that has a particle size impenetrable to subterranean termites (Su and Scheffrahn 1990). Nonrepellent, slow-acting insecticides will be used in baits or in baiting systems. Subterranean termites will recruit to the bait stations through natural foraging behaviors and feed on the <b>chemically</b> <b>impregnated</b> wood. It is then hoped tha...|$|R
50|$|Commercial EDLCs {{are based}} on two {{symmetric}} <b>electrodes</b> <b>impregnated</b> with electrolytes comprising tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate salts in organic solvents. Current EDLC with organic electrolytes operates at 2.7 V, reach energy densities around 5-8 Wh/kg and 7 to 10 Wh/l. The specific capacitance {{is related to the}} Specific Surface Area (SSA) accessible by the electrolyte, its interfacial double-layer capacitance, and the electrode material density. Graphene-based platelets with mesoporous spacer material is a promising structure for increasing the SSA of the electrolyte.|$|R
40|$|Methods that rapidly detect, characterize, quantify, and decontaminate {{surfaces}} are essential following {{chemical or biological}} incidents. Our work focused on developing a Ã¢Â€ÂœsmartÃ¢Â€Â surface, one that monitors itself and the overlying atmosphere and triggers a decontamination step when surface contamination is detected. Titanium dioxide was used to coat a ceramic surface containing skeletal <b>impregnated</b> platinum <b>electrodes.</b> The electrical resistance of the surface became altered {{by the introduction of}} a contaminant into the overlying atmosphere and its chemisorption to the surface. This change in resistance in turn initiated illumination by an external ultraviolet lamp to induce photocatalytic oxidation of the sorbed contaminant. Film resistance was concentration-dependent, allowing self-decontamination to be triggered at set pollutant levels. Preliminary results suggest that advanced surfaces and films can be developed to identify contaminant type and concentration and to initiate photocatalytic decontamination to meet regulatory or safety standards...|$|R
5000|$|Lanthanum {{strontium}} manganate (LSM) is {{the most}} common oxygen electrode material. LSM offers high performance under electrolysis conditions due to generation of oxygen vacancies under anodic polarization that aid oxygen diffusion. [...] In addition, <b>impregnating</b> LSM <b>electrode</b> with GDC nanoparticles was found to increase cell lifetime by preventing delamination at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The exact mechanism by how this happen needs to be explore further. In a 2010 study, it was found that neodymium nickelate as an anode material provided 1.7 times the current density of typical LSM anodes when integrated into a commercial SOEC and operated at 700 °C, and approximately 4 times the current density when operated at 800 °C. The increased performance is postulated to be due to higher [...] "overstoichimoetry" [...] of oxygen in the neodymium nickelate, making it a successful conductor of both ions and electrons.|$|R
