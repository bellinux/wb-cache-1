5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the wars, tragedy struck Gifu once again. On September 12, 1976, Typhoon 17 (Super Typhoon Fran) struck the city, killing five people and affecting over 40,000 families. Gifu recovered, however, through the establishment of various local industries. The city's growth reached such a point that it was designated a <b>core</b> <b>city</b> by the national government in 1996. As its fashion industry has declined, however, {{the city has been}} looking towards manufacturing to revive the economy. A recent construction boom, much of which has occurred around JR Gifu Station, has improved the city's economy. Both public construction projects (station area renovations and elevated walkways) and private efforts are revitalizing the city of Gifu. Gifu City Tower 43 is an example of cooperation between the public and private sectors, with part of the building belonging to the city and the remainder privately owned. Gifu expanded its size in 2006 by merging with the neighboring town of Yanaizu (from Hashima District) during the great Heisei merger.|$|E

The paper provides empirical evidence on changes in employment specialization patterns of nine different types of German districts (ranging from <b>core</b> <b>cities</b> of agglomerations to low density rural districts) for the period 1976 to 2002.

25|$|The {{average age}} of onset of alcohol abuse was 29 years for the <b>Core</b> <b>City</b> men and 41 years for the College men. Full blown alcoholism, where it appeared, usually lasted {{a decade or two}} before sobriety was attained. The number of alcoholics {{increased}} steadily until age 40 and then began to decline at a rate of stable remission of 2 to 3% per year. Older alcoholics are relatively rare because of the rate of remission and a higher mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|In the Clinic sample, 48% of the 29 alcoholics who {{achieved}} sobriety eventually attended 300 or more AA meetings, and AA {{attendance was}} associated with good outcomes in patients who {{otherwise would have been}} predicted not to remit. In the <b>Core</b> <b>City</b> sample the more severe alcoholics attended AA, possibly because all other avenues had failed—after all, AA meetings are rarely attended for hedonistic reasons. The implication from all three samples was simply that many alcoholics find help through AA.|$|E

To the east, A2-E70 links it with the Croatian capital Zagreb, from where one can go to Hungary or important cities of the former Yugoslavia, such as Belgrade. To the northwest, A2-E61 goes to the Austrian towns of Klagenfurt and Salzburg, making it an important entry point for northern European tourists. A toll sticker system has been in use on the Ljubljana Ring Road since 1 July 2008. The center of the city is more difficult to access especially in the peak hours due to long arteries with traffic lights and a large number of daily commuters. The <b>core</b> <b>city</b> center has been closed for motor traffic since September 2007 (except for residents with permissions), creating a pedestrian zone around Prešeren Square.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaders of}} the Fourth Crusade (1202–04) {{contracted}} with Venice to provide a fleet for transportation to the Levant. When the crusaders were unable {{to pay for the}} ships, Doge Enrico Dandolo offered transport if the crusaders were to capture Zara, a city that had rebelled years ago and was a concurrent to Venice. Upon the capture of Zara, the crusade was again diverted, this time to Constantinople. The capture and sacking of Constantinople has been described {{as one of the most}} profitable and disgraceful sacks of a city in history. The Venetians claimed much of the plunder, including the famous four bronze horses that were brought back to adorn St Mark's Basilica. Furthermore, in the subsequent partition of the Byzantine lands, Venice gained a great deal of territory in the Aegean Sea, theoretically amounting to three-eighths of the Byzantine Empire. It also acquired the islands of Crete (Candia) and Euboea (Negroponte); the present <b>core</b> <b>city</b> of Chania on Crete is largely of Venetian construction, built atop the ruins of the ancient city of Cydonia. The Aegean islands came to form the Venetian Duchy of the Archipelago.

25|$|From 1940 {{and until}} 1980, Greater Mexico City {{experienced}} an intense rate of demographic growth concurrent {{with the economic}} policy of import substitution. Mexican industrial production was heavily centralized in Greater Mexico City during this period which produced intense immigration to the city. Close to 52% of the economically active population of Greater Mexico City worked in the industry sector in 1970. This situation changed drastically {{during the period of}} 1980 to 2000, in which the economic based shifted to the service sector which in 2000 employed close to 70% of the economically active population in the conurbation. The annual rate of growth decreased sharply as well as the regional and national patterns of immigration: residents are moving out of the <b>core</b> <b>city</b> to the suburbs or to nearby cities, whereas the northern states now receive a larger number of immigrants as new hubs of industrial production. Greater Mexico City's main industries are now related to trade, financial services, insurance companies, telecommunications, informatics and transportation. In spite of the recent shifts in economic production and the decentralization of the economic activity promoted by the government, Greater Mexico City's share of total economic activity in the country is still high, though decreasing. Mexico City proper alone produces 15.8% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product, larger than any of the states.|$|E
500|$|... {{is a city}} {{located in}} the south-central portion of Gifu Prefecture, Japan, and serves as the prefectural capital.

Gifu continued to flourish even after Japan's unification as both an important shukuba along the Edo period Nakasendō and, later, as one of Japan's fashion centers.
