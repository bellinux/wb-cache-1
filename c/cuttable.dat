In OBPP-d solvers two subproblems are crucial: Calculating lower bounds and solving the decision problem (OPP-d) of determining if a set of boxes can be orthogonally packed into a single container. This thesis focuses on these two subproblems with an extra requirement attached: All packings must be guillotine <b>cuttable.</b> That is, the containers must be able to be split into n pieces, each holding a box, by recursively cutting them with face orthogonal cuts.

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} and characterize a {{new class}} of polygons that models wood, stone, glass and ceramic shapes that can be cut with a table saw, lapidary trim saw, or other circular saw. In this model, a circular saw is a line segment (in projection) that can move freely in empty space, but can only cut straight into a portion of material. Once a region of material is separated from the rest, it can be picked up and removed to allow the saw to move more freely. A polygon is called <b>cuttable</b> by a circular saw if it can be cut out of a convex shape of material by a sufficiently small circular saw. We prove that a polygon has this property precisely if it does not have two adjacent reflex vertices. As a consequence, every polygon can be modified slightly to make it <b>cuttable</b> by a circular saw. We give a linear-time algorithm to cut out such a polygon using a number of cuts and total length of cuts that are at most 2. 5 times the optimal. We also study polygons <b>cuttable</b> by an arbitrarily large circular saw, which is equivalent to a ray, and give two linear-time recognition algorithms...|$|E

The most frequently seen polymorphism within the CTR gene is Alu 1, which has been suggested as a genetic marker in search for the cause of urolithiasis. We evaluated the association between calcium oxalate stone disease and the Alu 1 polymorphism in North Indian patients. Blood samples from a control group of 105 healthy individuals and a group of 100 patients were taken. The CTR gene polymorphism was determined using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction digestion. Associations between calcium oxalate stone disease and Alu-I polymorphism of CTR gene were evaluated statistically. The distribution of leucine (<b>cuttable)</b> homozygote in the stone patients though higher (13 %) as compared to the control group (5. 7 %) was not statistically significantly (p= 0. 185). The Odds ratio for the leucine allele of calcitonin receptor gene in calcium oxalate stone disease was 0. 795 (95 % CI; 0. 095 - 6. 591). No significant association between Alu 1 polymorphism of CTR gene and calcium oxalate stone formation was observed. Therefore Alu 1 polymorphism of CTR gene at 1377 th nucleotide position may not authenticate as a suitable marker for risk assessment of urinary stone disease...|$|E

In our study we investigated the correlation between CDH 1 gene polymorphism and endometriosis in two groups of pre-menopausal Taiwanese women, group 1 (n = 150) consisting of women with severe stage IV endometriosis and group 2 (n = 159) of women with no endometriosis. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the <b>cuttable</b> (C) and uncuttable (T) polymorphism of the CDH 1 -Pml I gene (rs 1801026) located on the 3 ’-untranslated region (3 ’-UTR) of chromosome 16 and compare the genotypes and allelic frequencies of this gene in both groups. We found that the genotype and allele distributions of the CDH 1 -Pml I C/T polymorphism were significantly different in both groups.

40|$|The {{inherent}} open-ended {{nature of}} socio-cultural phenomena makes {{it necessary to}} create new theoretical frameworks that enable us to understand the fluidity of the relations between {{different parts of the}} dynamic system. Recent advance in modern biology seems to provide a set of heuristic concepts useful to investigate the complexity and fluidity of the relationship between different contexts. One of these is the Rayner’s logic of natural inclusionality. According whit Rayner’s evolutionary standpoint any living system is constantly in dialogue with its natural neighbourhood on the basis of an interdependent and co-evolutive process involved both the context and the organism. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the model proposed by Rayner in light of contextual perspective in development and educational psychology arguing as the space in between is neither a <b>cuttable</b> and divisible presence into discrete things, nor a mere “nothing” that could be cut off our conceptualization. Rather, it’s a ground (for a figure) in which flow and counter-flow in a fluid interplay amidst a distinct bounded context takes place. The interest for the boundary conditions calls for focusing on what happened on the border. By adopting a simultaneous perspective from two standpoints we are able to constantly focus on both aspects—what happens inside and outside different social settings—we became aware that the “walls” of the context of our living are much more permeable than has been until now theorized by psychological research.

40|$|Glass-Reinforced Polymer (GRP) bolts, {{commonly}} known as Fibre Glass (FG) dowels or plastic dowels are increasingly applied for strata reinforcement in mines {{as well as in}} concrete reinforcement in civil engineering. The most popular dowels used in Australian coal mines are the 22 mm diameter fully threaded type. FG bolts are <b>cuttable,</b> easy to handle, lightweight and corrosion resistant. The tested dowels were all black in colour, which is a favoured colour in coal mines. A series of tests were undertaken to evaluate various strength properties of FG dowels. These tests include the tensile failure test by the double-embedment method, single guillotine shear test, double shear test both in steel frame and in concrete blocks, and finally the punch shear test. The study found that the tensile strength by pull testing of the 22 mm diameter fibre glass dowels was in the order of 27 t. The shear strength testing of dowels in both single guillotine and double shear steel frames were in agreement with each other. In general the shear strength values of dowels tested, using single shear guillotine testing, were around 20 % of the axial strength in comparison with 70 % in the same diameter steel rebar tests. The peak shear load values obtained from double shear tests in concrete blocks was influenced by the encapsulation grout type and the level of fibre glass axial pre-tension. The punch shear tests revealed that there was a more than threefold increase in the punch shear strength value of fibre glass dowels tested perpendicular as against parallel to the dowel axis...|$|E
40|$|Using {{simplified}} model systems, {{the effects}} of salts and oil on enzymatic texturisation of protein isolates from soy (Glycine max (L.) Merr.; SPI), pea (Pisum sativum L.; PPI) and sweet lupine (Lupinus albus L.; LPI) were evaluated. In aqueous systems, protein cross-linking by microbial transglutaminase (MTG) was significantly improved when NaCl (1 - 2 g hg- 1) was added, but respective doses of CaCl 2 reduced gel strengths. As shown by emulsion model systems of PPI and SPI with oil/protein ratios of 1 and 2 g g- 1, emulsification of corn oil into aqueous protein suspensions prior to enzymatic cross-linking enhanced gel formation depending on the emulsification technique. The impact of NaCl and oil varied among the protein isolates as to obtainable maximum gel strengths and optimum doses of these ingredients. The applicability of MTG to leguminous proteins in complex plant foodstuffs was finally deduced from their performance in complex food models of the liquid (thickened s oup), foamed (mousse) and solid (sausage-like substitute) type, respectively. The sensory characteristics of the latter were evaluated by trained panellists relative to their milk-, gelatin- and meat-based counterparts. Texture was appealing in the foamed and solid food models, but the liquid soup model suffered from unfavourable grittiness. Without masking their beany off-flavour, the food models containing leguminous proteins deviated from the reference products. On the whole, MTG-catalysed cross-linking rendered the leguminous proteins suitable for the food applications in terms of visual appearance, texture and colour. Especially, the gels representing mousse-type foams and <b>cuttable</b> sausage-like vegetarian substitutes were very promising...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{strength}} and low density, the corrugated fibreboard (CFB) box {{is one of}} the most popular types of packaging all over the world. This packaging device is able to fulfil a huge number of requirements of the logistic process, during the phases of handling, shipping and storage. In addition to this, corrugated packaging is easily machinable, so it is also suitable for special supply chains and products. These special needs include the requirement to fit to the inner measurements of the shipping device, e. g. the shipping container. This is particularly expected in case of less than container-load (LTL) shipments, where the shipping cost is usually based on the required area (m 2) or cubic capacity (m 3) of the container, so the useful filling of the shipping device is a very strong advantage. Naturally, this is easily solvable with different CFB boxes which have different heights, but this way the user needs to stock a high variety of boxes, requires a good relationship and cooperation between the parties and also a proper knowledge of product organisation in each box version. The multi-depth corrugated boxes are a suitable solution for resolving this problem. These boxes are creased at multiple intervals, so they are easily <b>cuttable</b> to the desired various heights. But the pre-scored lines can cause a loss of the compression strength capability of the box and thereby can lead to damages. The aim of this paper is to determine the effect of multiple creasing lines on the compression strength of the CFB box. This paper does not focus on the effect of either different creasing parameter, such as depth and width, nor on the distances between each creasing. Based on the test results, the compression strengths are decreased nearly significantly due to the additional creasing line(s) ...|$|E
40|$|The novel {{temperate}} bacteriophage Lula, contaminating laboratory Escherichia coli strains, {{turned out}} to be the well-known lambdoid phage phi 80. Our previous studies revealed that two characteristics of Lula/phi 80 facilitate its spread in the laboratory environment: cryptic lysogen productivity and stealthy infectivity. To understand the genetics/genomics behind these traits, we sequenced and annotated the Lula/phi 80 genome, encountering an E. coli-toxic gene revealed as a gap in the sequencing contig and analyzing a few genes in more detail. Lula/phi 80 ’s genome layout copies that of lambda, yet homology with other lambdoid phages is mostly limited to the capsid genes. Lula/phi 80 ’s DNA is resistant to cutting with several restriction enzymes, suggesting DNA modification, but deletion of the phage’s damL gene, coding for DNA adenine methylase, did not make DNA <b>cuttable.</b> The damL mutation of Lula/phi 80 also did not change the phage titer in lysogen cultures, whereas the host dam mutation did in-crease it almost 100 -fold. Since the high phage titer in cultures of Lula/phi 80 lysogens is apparently in response to endogenous DNA damage, we deleted the only Lula/phi 80 SOS-controlled gene, dinL. We found that dinL mutant lysogens release fewer phage in response to endogenous DNA damage but are unchanged in their response to external DNA damage. The toxic gene of Lula/phi 80, gamL, encodes an inhibitor of the host ATP-dependent exonucleases, RecBCD and SbcCD. Its own antidote, agt, apparently encoding a modifier protein, was found nearby. Interestingly, Lula/phi 80 lysogens are recD and sbcCD phenocopies, so GamL and Agt are part of lysogenic conversion.

40|$|Conventional {{machining}} processes for cutting {{of ceramic materials}} due to the material are very time consuming and expensive, while {{some of them have}} limited geometrical flexibility. Laser beam cutting offers itself as an alternative, while the ND:YAG laser, contrary to CO_ 2 lasers, warrants expectations of reduced thermal impact and hence improved machining qualities. Similarly foreseeable are advantages for the cutting of light metals and super alloys using the Nd:YAG laser, which among others are due to their wavelengths and high pulse powers. Only little experience with regard to solid state laser cutting is available for the above materials. The objective of this project is to develop fundamental knowledge concerning the suitability of various Nd:YAG laser systems for the cutting of light metals, super alloys and ceramics, and concerning their influence on process efficiency and machining quality. For this purpose, extensive cutting tests were carried out using representative materials, and the results were assessed with regard to the objectives stated. Improved absorption of the Nd:YAG radiation for TiAl 6 V 4 and various aluminum alloys of small sheet thicknesses observed during laser beam cutting using Nd:YAG lasers was due to the shorter wavelength as compared to the CO_ 2 laser. With an optimized ratio of the Rayleigh length to the sheet thickness and with an identical cutting gap width, the Nd:YAG laser produces high cutting speeds in the sheet thickness range up to 2 mm. The stated cutting method produces lower cutting surface roughnesses in the cw mode than it does in the pulsed mode. The cutting efficiency, i. e. the maximum achievable cutting speed as a function of mean laser power, can be optimized by adaptation of the laser/optical fiber system. The applicable variation ranges of process parameters were determined for the ceramics under investigation. Purposeful adaptation of these parameters permits a sufficient cutting quality for almost all engineering ceramics in pulsed mode of operation under the condition that fixed lens systems are used for beam guidance. The degraded beam quality {{associated with the use of}} optical fibers having a core diameter of 600 #mu#m limits the cuttability to tough ceramics such as Si_ 3 N_ 4. Similarly, the high thermal load during cw operation limits the range of <b>cuttable</b> materials. Laser induced crack damage can be reduced by appropriate adjustment of the pulse parameters. The results with regard to industrial application show the capabilities and limitations of Nd:YAG laser cutting with different beam guidance systems for the materials under investigation. (orig.)

40|$|Mestrado em Decisão Económica e EmpresarialO problema de corte guilhotina e empacotamento bidimensional {{rectangular}} consiste em alocar múltiplas peças pequenas - itens - numa ou mais placas de tamanho maior -objectos - num padrão que minimize o desperdício de matéria-prima. A motivação para a realização deste projecto é resolver um problema real de uma empresa portuguesa tentando, ao mesmo tempo, propor algo novo. Para isso, desenvolvem-se e apresentam-se duas novas heurísticas, a Guillotinable Bottom-Left First Fit Decreasing Height (BLFFDHG) e a Bottom-Left First Fit Decreasing Height (BLFFDH), baseadas na First Fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) e Bottom-up left-justified (BL), em que, após um nível ter sido preenchido com a abordagem da FFDH, e antes de se abrir um novo nível para o próximo rectângulo, o nível actual é exaustivamente examinado, usando a heurística BL, de modo a tentar alocar itens no espaço que sobra entre dois níveis consecutivos. A diferença entre as novas heurísticas reside no facto de uma impor o corte guilhotina. Em ambas nenhuma das peças pode ser rodada ou sobreposta. Só depois de explorado o nível actual é aberto um novo. Os resultados são comparados com heurísticas da literatura, num conjunto de instâncias reais, em corte de roupeiros, e da literatura. As heurísticas propostas são comparadas entre si em termos de tempos de execução e é determinada a complexidade empírica da programação. Os resultados obtidos indicam que os algoritmos BLFFDHG e BLFFDH proporcionam quase sempre melhores soluções que os algoritmos que lhe deram origem e são bastante competitivos em relação às outras heurísticas usadas nos testes. Em termos de tempo de execução, a BLFFDHG revelou-se mais rápida que a BLFFDH, e a complexidade empírica da programação é, para ambas, 0 (n 3). The guillotine cutting {{problem with}} two-dimensional rectangular packaging consists of allocating small items {{in one or}} more bins - objects - with a pattern that minimize the waste of raw materials. The motivation for this project is to solve a real problem of a Portuguese company and, at the same time, try to propose something new. To this aim, two new heuristics are it developed and presented, the Guillotinable Bottom-Left First Fit Decreasing Height (BLFFDHG) and Bottom-Left First Fit Decreasing Height (BLFFDH), based on First Fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) and Bottom-up left-justified (BL), in which, after a level has been filled with the approach of FFDH, and before opening a new level to the next item, the current level is thoroughly examined, using the BL heuristic, so trying to allocate items in the space left between two consecutive levels. The difference between the new heuristics is that one ensures a pattern that is guillotine <b>cuttable,</b> but in none of them the items can be rotated or overlapped. Only after exploring the current level a new one is open. The results are compared, in terms of solution, with heuristics presented in the literature, using a set of real based instances from a wardrobe cutting and literature instances. The proposed heuristics are compared in terms of execution times and its empirically complexity of programming is estimated. The results indicate that the algorithms BLFFDHG and BLFFDH usually provide better solutions than the algorithms FFDH and BL and are quite competitive when compared with other heuristics used in the tests. In terms of execution time, the BLFFDHG proved to be faster than BLFFDH and empirically they both have a complexity of 0 (n 3) ...|$|E
