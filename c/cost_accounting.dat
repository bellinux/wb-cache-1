25|$|Standard <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> {{can hurt}} managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy {{decision}} to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's performance evaluation. Increasing inventory requires increased production, {{which means that}} processes must operate at higher rates. When (not if) something goes wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.|$|E

25|$|In the 1919 <b>Cost</b> <b>Accounting</b> Nicholson and Rohrbach again {{deal with}} the admittedly {{controversial}} {{question as to whether}} it is proper to treat normal interest return on passive investment as a part of manufacturing costs, the position is taken that interest on fixed assets should be so charged, but not interest on floating capital investment. The charging of some interest item is considered necessary to the successful distribution of overhead. Or, more exactly, normal return on passive investment is regarded as overhead to be distributed among the factory products. The authors in chapter IV considers that the opposition argument is directed chiefly at the practice of making these charges as part of the regular costs, not at the mere calculation thereof for use in statistical report form in the quotation of prices. He therefore suggests (p.140) an accounting procedure supposed to meet this objection.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems that}} around 1880 {{there was a}} change in {{manufacturing}} practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information {{on the effect of}} product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for audited accounts that sealed the fate of managerial <b>cost</b> <b>accounting.</b> The dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{of nuclear}} power argue that in {{comparison}} to {{any other form of}} power, nuclear power is the safest form of energy, accounting for all the risks from mining to production to storage, including the risks of spectacular nuclear accidents. Accidents in the nuclear industry have been less damaging than accidents in the hydro industry, and less damaging than the constant, incessant damage from air pollutants from fossil fuels. For instance, by running a 1000-MWe nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal, the radiation dose is 136 person-rem/year, the dose is 490 person-rem/year for an equivalent coal-fired power plant. The World Nuclear Association provides a comparison of deaths from accidents in course of different forms of energy production. In their comparison, deaths per TW-yr of electricity produced from 1970 to 1992 are quoted as 885 for hydropower, 342 for coal, 85 for natural gas, and 8 for nuclear. Nuclear power plant accidents rank first in terms of their economic <b>cost,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 41 percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents.|$|E
25|$|Set goals: Groups {{that set}} clear, {{challenging}} goals outperform groups whose members have {{lost sight of}} their objectives. The group's goals should be relatively challenging, instead of being too easily accomplished. The advantages of working in a group are often lost when a task is so easy {{that it can be}} accomplished even when members of the group socially loaf. Thus, groups should ensure to set their standards high, but not so high that the goals are unattainable. Latham and Baldes (1975) assessed the practical significance of Locke's theory of goal setting by conducting an experiment with truck drivers who hauled logs from the woods to the mill. When the men were initially told to do their best when loading the logs, they carried only about 60% of the weight that they could legally haul. When the same drivers were later encouraged to reach a goal of hauling 94% of the legal limit, they increased their efficiency and met this specific goal. Thus, {{the results of this study}} show that performance improved immediately upon the assignment of a specific, challenging goal. Company <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> procedures indicated that this same increase in performance without goal setting would have required an expenditure of a quarter of a million dollars on the purchase of additional trucks alone. So this method of goal setting is extremely effective. Other research has found that clear goals can stimulate a number of other performance-enhancing processes, including increases in effort, better planning, more accurate monitoring of the quality of the groups work, and even an increased commitment to the group.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of cities each {{inhabited}} by two agents, one specializing in manufacturing, the other in distribution. The distribution sector represents the physical transformation of all internationally traded goods from the factory gate to the final consumer. Using a panel of micro-prices at the city level, we decompose the long-run variance of LOP deviations into the fraction due to distribution costs, trade costs and a residual. For the median good, trade <b>costs</b> <b>account</b> for 50 {{percent of the variance}}, distribution <b>costs</b> <b>account</b> for 10 percent with 40 percent of the variance unexplained. Since the sample of items in the data are heavily skewed toward traded goods, we also decompose the variance based on the median good on an expenditure-weighted basis. Now the tables turn, with distribution <b>costs</b> <b>accounting</b> for 43 percent, trade costs 36 percent and 21 percent of the variance unexplained. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{possibility}} to produce hydrogen without {{greenhouse gas emissions}} is to couple a thermochemical cycle with a nuclear reactor. Among the various thermochemical cycles, the Sulphur/Iodine process is currently the most studied. The production cost of hydrogen from this process {{is the sum of}} several <b>cost</b> <b>accounts</b> which are not at present known in any satisfactory way. In this paper we present an approach to estimate the total production cost of 1 kg of hydrogen. In order to overcome the problem of uncertain information associated with each <b>cost</b> <b>account,</b> we model them as fuzzy sets. We designed a software tool which enables us to easily define the necessary sets and computes reasonable results including the overall cost. Based on the assumed values given by recent research papers for the specific <b>cost</b> <b>accounts,</b> we were able to estimate the cost of being in the interval between 1. 7 and 9. 4 e/kg, but most certainly between 3. 0 e/kg and 6. 8 e/kg. ...|$|R
