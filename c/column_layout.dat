It is customary to have stations in the centre of a city built very deep, not only to minimise disruption, but also, because of the Cold War threat, they were built to double as bomb shelters, and many old stations do feature provisions such as blast doors and air filters. In most cities, the lines become shallow or even begin to run above ground as they reach the city's outer residential districts. However, {{this is not the case}} in Saint Petersburg. The difficult geology means that 56 out of 63 stations are at a deep level. The design and architecture went through numerous phases. The original stations were predominantly of the pylon type, of which there are 15 stations. Also popular was the <b>column</b> <b>layout,</b> and there are 16 such stations in the system.|$|E

50|$|In web design, columns {{are often}} used to {{separate}} primary content from secondary and tertiary content. For example, a common two <b>column</b> <b>layout</b> may include a left column with navigation links, and a right column for body text. One method of creating columns for the web is to place text within an HTML table element, often with the border set to zero. However, this method is considered outdated and inaccessible to some. Another method includes using CSS to either float or position the corresponding text. These methods were not as straightforward as using HTML tables, which made a tableless three <b>column</b> <b>layout</b> a sort of holy grail once these techniques were discovered in the early 2000s. More recent levels of CSS have addressed column behaviors, and web browser support for these behaviors continues to improve.|$|E

These sections are usually printed on a smaller type of broadsheet and different newsprint than the actual paper, along with different fonts and <b>column</b> <b>layouts.</b> Many newspapers and magazines will assign staff writers or freelancers to write advertorials, usually without a byline credit. A major difference between regular editorial and advertorial is that clients usually have content approval of advertorials, a luxury usually not provided with regular editorial.|$|R

50|$|Six-column engines {{were most}} popular {{for the smaller}} sizes of engine. They were all {{rotative}} beam engines, with a flywheel and rotating output shaft. These were used to drive machinery, as diverse as sugar cane crushing mills, winding engines in coal mines and sawmills.

5000|$|Special Design FeaturesThe {{design program}} asked for 8 office floors with a column-free area around a compact center core below 48 {{apartment}} floors. Due {{to the narrow}} tower, {{it was necessary to}} provide three lines of [...] "couple" [...] shear walls to maintain acceptable stiffness. The shear walls, however, could not be permitted within the 8 commercial floors at the lower level of the tower where only the shaft could be accommodated. By modifying the [...] "coupled-shear wall" [...] design, it was possible to determine the effect of the [...] "outriggers," [...] resulting in a moment diagram for the shear wall, center core. These moments were readily handled by the shear wall system. The slabs were designed as a combination of oneway-banded design post-tensioned slabs. The architectural layout did not lend itself to a straight and disciplined <b>column</b> <b>layout.</b> This, however, was easily overcome by deflecting the banded-tendon runs in the traverse direction laterally to correspond to the <b>column</b> <b>layout.</b> The longitudinal tendons were generally uniformly spaced except where they had to be deflected laterally around slab openings and mechanical obstructions.|$|E

This is seen as a CSS-based alternative to using HTML tables for <b>column</b> <b>layout.</b> The term was coined by Dan Cederholm in his article for A List Apart, Faux Columns. The application of faux columns has been extended through a method called liquid faux columns, which allows faux columns to adapt and re-proportion themselves to the browser height.|$|E

40|$|Large mass bolometers {{are used}} in {{particle}} physics experiments to search for rare processes. By operating at low temperature, {{they are able to}} detect particle energies from few keV up to several MeV, measuring the temperature rise produced by the energy released. This study was performed on the bolometers of the CUORE experiment. The response function of these detectors is not linear in the energy range of interest, and it changes with the operating temperature. The non-linearity is found to be dominated by the thermistor and its biasing circuit. A method to obtain a linear response is the result of this work. It allows a great simplification of the data analysis. Comment: 7 pages, 13 figures.

We first present a volume-of-fluid simulation, which {{is able to}} predict {{the surface of the}} droplets during coalescence. However, a fast and efficient model is needed for the simulation of a liquid-liquid extraction column due to the high number of occurring droplets. To simulate the velocity and droplet size in a DN 32 extraction column, a coupled computational fluid dynamic-population balance model solver is used. The simulation is analyzed using path-line based visualization techniques. A novel semi-automatic re-seeding technique for droplet path-line integration is proposed. With our technique, path-lines of fluid droplets can be re-initialized after contact with the stirring devices. The droplet breakage is captured, allowing the engineer to improve the design of liquid-liquid <b>columns</b> <b>layout...</b>|$|R

In this article, the performances of various 3 D detector structures are simulated with up to 1 × 1016 1 MeV-neq/cm 2 radiation damage. The simulations show that 3 D detectors have higher collection efficiency and lower depletion voltages than planar detectors due to their small electrode spacing. When designing a 3 D detector with a large pixel size, such as an ATLAS sensor, different electrode <b>column</b> <b>layouts</b> are possible. Using {{a small number of}} n+ readout electrodes per pixel leads to higher depletion voltages and lower collection efficiency, due to the larger electrode spacing.

In addition to new and supplemental rules for the game, the book goes into great detail discussing what the world would (potentially) be like if biotechnology were to continue to advance. Anti-aging treatments, human (and nonhuman) augmentation and enhancement, chemical warfare, cloning, and many other subjects are detailed, along with advise for game-masters should they wish to implement such things into their games. Because GURPS {{is meant to be}} open ended for the game-master to develop their own setting, many possibilities are left open for their interpretation, such as potential social and political ramifications of these advancements. How does the general public react to extreme modification? What religious concerns does it bring up? How does humanity deal with the population increase caused by anti-aging treatments?

Design systems to help designers with conceptual building design have, over the last decade, been developed using evolutionary algorithms.

A method of determining column layouts for orthogonal buildings is developed using the sweep line algorithm coupled to an adjacency graph.

40|$|Pool of {{knowledge}} {{available to the}} mankind depends on the source of learning resources, which can vary from ancient printed documents to present electronic material. The rapid conversion of material available in traditional libraries to digital form needs {{a significant amount of}} work if we are to maintain the format and the look of the electronic documents as same as their printed counterparts. Most of the printed documents contain not only characters and its formatting but also some associated non text objects such as tables, charts and graphical objects. It is challenging to detect them and to concentrate on the format preservation of the contents while reproducing them. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm using local thresholds for word space and line height to locate and extract all categories of tables from scanned document images. From the experiments performed on 298 documents, we conclude that our algorithm has an overall accuracy of about 75 % in detecting tables from the scanned document images. Since the algorithm does not completely depend on rule lines, it can detect all categories of tables in a range of scanned documents with different font types, styles and sizes to extract their formatting features. Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to locate tables in multi <b>column</b> <b>layouts</b> with small modification in layout analysis. Treating tables with their existing formatting features will tremendously help the reproducing of printed documents for reprinting and updating purposes.
