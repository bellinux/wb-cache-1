40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{market integration}} between fish species in Europe, taking international market integration into account. Based on Juselius (2006), market integration is found {{both on the}} fresh and frozen markets. The Law of One Price is in force on the fresh market within the segments of flatfish and pelagic fish. Assuming transitivity, a loose form of market integration is identified between 13 fresh and seven frozen fish species, and the relative prices are found fairly stable. The policy implication is that <b>catch</b> <b>limitation</b> measures implemented through the Common Fisheries Policy have limited and conditional effects on prices, {{because of the large}} size of the market and varying market integration. Therefore, many fishermen are not ¿compensated¿ by price increases as a result of <b>catch</b> <b>limitation</b> measures. JRC. G. 4 -Maritime affair...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{implications}} of climate change for fishery governance using seven international fishery case studies in low, mid and high latitudes, including eastern Australia, the western Pacific Ocean, Alaska, west coast United States, Hawaii, west coast Canada and France. Climate change adds uncertainty about fish stock productivity, migratory patterns, trophic interactions and vulnerability of fish populations to fishing pressure. Fishery governance has to address additional uncertainty from climate change in both the system being governed and the governance systems. The case studies reveal governance issues that indicate adaptation will involve more flexible fishery management regimes, schemes for capacity adjustment, <b>catch</b> <b>limitation</b> and alternative fishing livelihoods for fishers. Where fishery governance systems have been less developed, fisheries are less able to adapt to climate change impacts. Adaptation involves addressing {{some of the most}} intractable allocation issues of fisheries management. Climate change Fishery governance...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of fleet characteristics and catch composition in Mediterranean fisheries, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean has placed emphasis on the direct control of fishing capacity and effort rather than <b>catch</b> <b>limitation.</b> This paper aims to analyse the evolution of fishing effort, landings and métiers in three trawling ports of the western Mediterranean between 2002 and 2011. Four métiers were identified, using multivariate techniques, in the fishery: Red mullet, European hake, Norway lobster and Red shrimp. The mean catch composition within the same métier was similar between ports, although {{the relative importance of}} species differed slightly from one port to another. Variation in fishing effort exerted was observed between métiers reflecting differences in the importance and usage of each métier by port. Temporal variations were found among different métiers at seasonal and annual scales. These temporal variations showed that métiers Red mullet and European hake were alternated. Positive significant correlations were observed between landings and different fishing effort variables with an exception of the relation between landings and engine power in the Norway lobster métier with negative significant correlations. Significant differences in total vessel length, gross tonnage, total CPUE and total income were detected among the four métiers depending on each port with few exceptions. These findings are considered a keystone for more practical implications and to assist fisheries' managers in the decision-making process. As demonstrated in the current paper, the management of multi-specific fisheries should start off considering the characteristics of each métier separately. In the sound of métier-based management, the patterns observed in the effort temporal distribution between métiers can indicate the most suitable time to reduce effort on specific target species. This study was supported by a grant of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) MAEC-AECID (Nº 0000593564) ...|$|E

40|$|Though {{economic}} research {{is not one}} of the tasks of the German Federal Research Centre for Fisheries, basic in-formation for such work is available from biologic studies on fish biomass, discards and seasonal abundance of species. Results from EU-studies on brown shrimp fisheries show the effect of discarding juvenile fish, especially plaice, the possibly lost numbers and value of this fish as well as chances of reducing these losses by a timely effort reduction in summer and the use of selective nets throughout most parts of the year. However, it is also made clear, that these costly measures may have no effect on the stocks due to biological compensatory effects observed in strong year classes of plaice e. g. 1996, with high landings and collapsing prices. Therefore sound biological and economic data and methods are needed to assess the economic effects of management measures on fishermen’s situation and markets.

40|$|Fisheries {{throughout}} the world have long been subject to overfishing and excess capacity, which has generated substantial and increasing concern about biological and economic performance ramifications. These problems in part stem from substantial investment in technical improvements to boats and equipment in fishing fleets. Such technical change exacerbates the extent of excess fishing capacity, as well as low returns to fishing effort and investment due to <b>catch</b> <b>limitations</b> from both regulatory constraints and overfished stocks. However, economists have not yet attempted to quantify the extent or effects of technical change in fisheries. In this paper we use detailed data on innovation patterns for 19 vessels in the Sete trawl fleet of Southern France to evaluate the contributions of embodied and disembodied technical change to catch rates. We find that embodied technical change enhanced productivity by approximately 1 percent per year between 1985 - 99, but that external (disembodied) events counteracted this by causing a net output decline of about 3 percent a year. Neither efficiency nor output composition changes appear {{to have had a}} substantive effect on observed performance levels...|$|R
40|$|These Guidelines {{have been}} {{produced}} to support the implementation of Article 7 of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, with some reference to Article 12. They are addressed primarily to the decision-makers within fisheries management authorities and other interest groups, including fishing companies, fishers' organizations, concerned non-governmental organizations and others. The Guidelines provide a background {{to the need for}} fisheries management and an introduction to the activities encompassed by fisheries management. They introduce the major constraints experienced in fisheries and fisheries management and some of the fundamental concepts related to these. Biological, environmental, technological, socio-cultural and economic constraints and concepts are examined. Information is fundamental to responsible fisheries management and these Guidelines put emphasis on the range of data required for informed decisionmaking and examine aspects of the collection and interpretation of these data. Data are discussed in terms of three suggested scales in fisheries management: fisheries policy and development planning, formulation of management plans and implementation of management action. The range of possible management actions is outlined. This includes technical measures, such as gear restrictions, and more direct approaches in the form of direct <b>catch</b> <b>limitation</b> or effort limitation. The problems associated with open access fisheries are explained and comments made on the means to limit access and obstacles which may be encountered in this process. Finally, the Guidelines examine the management process. This section covers the process of agreeing on a management plan for a fishery, including the need for consultation and, where appropriate, cooperative decision-making. The need for periodic review of management plans is stressed. The importance of an effective legal framework, institutional and administrative structures and monitoring control and surveillance are described. (PDF contains 91 pages...|$|E
40|$|Research PaperScallop {{fisheries}} {{are often}} characterized by variable abundance and periodic mass mortality occurrences. Area rotation is a respected management tool for sedentary species. A bioeconomic simulation model that incorporates the {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of scallop beds and fishing effort is presented. The model is user-friendly and was designed for use by fisheries managers and shareholders of the New Zealand Challenger Scallop Enhancement Company Inc. The model combines twenty-one biological models representing rotated and enhanced subareas of various size and productivity, with economics of the scallop fishery. The bioeconomic simulation model is used to evaluate various management strategies including geographic area rotation, daily <b>catch</b> <b>limitations</b> and fleet size. Results indicate that a mixed rotation schedule is optimal but that subarea specific growth rate {{studies are needed to}} implement it. Results also indicate that vessels numbers may be higher than needed to take the same amount of fish and that low daily catch limits result in the highest level of NPV but increase effort. In addition, the model is used to evaluate the impact of various types of mass mortality occurrences on the net present value of individual quota under two different rotation schedule scenarios. These simulations suggest that the relatively shorter rotation schedule is preferable in that {{the time it takes to}} recover from a mass mortality occurrence is shorter than otherwise. Future research endeavors are described. This research is expected to be useful to scallop and other sedentary species-based fisheries considering area rotation as a key management tool...|$|R
40|$|The oceans around Alaska {{are home}} to at least 40 species of {{rockfishes}} (Sebastidae). A number of these species are commercially important and are subject to strict <b>catch</b> <b>limitations.</b> However, regulators are hindered {{by the fact that}} some species are difficult to distinguish based on external characteristics and can only be conclusively identified using genetics. The rougheye (S. aleutianus) and blackspotted (S. melanostictus) rockfishes are one such example. Survey evidence suggests that these species segregate by depth, and that the shallower blackspotted is more prevalent in the fishery, raising concern that managing the species as a mixed stock might mask detrimental effects to the blackspotted population. This study examines otolith shape and morphometric analysis as tools for distinguishing these closely related species. Seven hundred and thirty-eight rockfish specimens were collected, their identity verified via genetic analysis, and their ages read. We then analyzed the data using several procedures including simple morphometrics and non-dimensional shape indices. We found that simple logistic regression across eight parameters was sufficient to correctly identify the species for more than 90 % of the specimens. The use of shape indices did not improve prediction accuracy, but did eliminate allometric correlations among the predictor variables, which may be useful in some cases. A crucial aspect of the analysis is the inclusion of interactions with age in the model, which improved discrimination success. This may suggest an unrecognized difference in the growth rates of these species. Overall, we are capable of predicting species identity with fewer than 5 % errors, which is sufficient to allow for separate management plans for the species. As such, we recommend that otolith stock discrimination techniques like these could provide an easy and effective way to discriminate many difficult-to-identify stocks, and further recommend that age data may be a useful addition to standard morphometric analyses...|$|R
40|$|The Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine haddock {{resource}} and fishery is reviewed. Nominal catches for Georges Bank averaged 46, 000 metric tons annually during 1935 - 60 and then increased to {{a peak of}} 150, 000 tons in 1965 as Canadian and distant water (European) fleets entered the fishery. Catches subsequently declined {{to an average of}} 5, 000 tons during 1974 - 76 under quota and incidental <b>catch</b> <b>limitations</b> and then increased rapidly to an average of 21, 000 tons in 1978 - 79. Nominal catches for the Gulf of Maine averaged 5, 000 tons during 1935 - 66, declined to less than 1, 000 tons during 1972 - 74 and increased to an average of 5, 000 tons in 1978 - 79. Minor recreational catches have also been reported from the western Gulf of Maine in recent years. Total stock size (age 2 and older haddock) for Georges Bank, determined from virtual population analysis, averaged 140 million fish (153, 000 tons) during 1935 - 60, increased to 530 million fish (427, 000 tons) in 1965 and declined precipitously to 8 million fish (22, 000 tons) in 1972. Subsequently, there was a substantial increase in stock size due to recruitment of the 1975 year-class. The 1978 year-class appears to be comparable in size to that of 1975. Instantaneous fishing mortality (F) for age 3 and older fish averaged 0. 44 during 1935 - 60, increased to a peak of 0. 79 in 1966 and subsequently declined as abundance decreased and fishing effort was diverted to other species. Trends in abundance and mortality evidenced by data from research vessel surveys since 1963 have been generally consistent with those indicated by virtual population analysis. Variability in growth of Georges Bank haddock during 1931 - 65 and pronounced <i;,anges in the late 1960 's and early 1970 's appear primarily attributable to changes in abundance.

40|$|Catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) is a {{quantitative}} method {{used to describe}} fisheries worldwide. CPUE can be presented as number of fish per 1000 hooks, number of fish per amount of fishing time, or with any unit of effort that best describes the fishery (e. g., search time, hooks per hour, number of trawls). CPUE is commonly used as an index to estimate relative abundance for a population. These indices are then applied within stock assessments so that fisheries managers can make justified decisions for how to manage a particular stock or fishery using options such as quotas, <b>catch</b> <b>limitations,</b> gear and license restrictions, or closed areas. For commercial pelagic longline (PLL) fisheries, onboard observer data are considered the only reliable data available due to the large-scale movements of highly migratory species (HMS) like tunas {{and because of the}} high costs associated with fisheries independent surveys. Unfortunately, fishery-reported logbook data are heavily biased in favor of the target species and the expense of onboard observers results in a low percentage of fleet coverage. Subsequently, CPUE derived from fishery-dependent data tends to overestimate relative abundance for highly migratory species. The spatial distribution of fish and fishing effort is essential for understanding the proportionality between CPUE and stock abundance. A spatial metric was created (SCPUE) for individual gear deployments using observer-based catch and effort data from the western North Atlantic PLL fleet. SCPUE was found to be less variable than CPUE when used as an index of relative abundance, suggesting that SCPUE could serve as an improved index of relative abundance within stock assessments because it explicitly incorporates spatial information obtained directly from the fishing location. Areas of concentrated fishing effort and fine-scale aggregations of target and non-target fishes were identified using the optimized hot spot analysis tool in ArcGIS (10. 2). This SCPUE method describes particular areas of fishing activity in terms of localized fish density, thus eliminating the assumption that all fish in a population are dispersed evenly within statistical management zones. The SCPUE metric could also assist fisheries management by identifying particular areas of concern for HMS and delineating boundaries for time-area closures, marine protected areas, and essential fish habitat...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{discussing}} about the urban screen phenomena {{and its influence}} to spatial dimension in urban space. The visual characteristics which are forming a spatial dimension will be an emphasis to be presented. Urban screen as a visual intervention has an impact to spatial configuration in urban space. The space dimension was not dominated with materiality limitation, but also images. We have to consider that people senses can measure a spatial dimension, knowing as a perception. That is a human visual and mind relation. The spatial dimension has no longer tangible boundary, but also has intangible ones. Spatial dimension in urban screens phenomena is not merely mathematics, nor spatial dimension in physics {{which are based on}} a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Movement can be expressed in other terms, by how far we can move depends on our eyes to <b>catch</b> that space <b>limitation,</b> and how fast we can move is depends on our mind to perceive some visual phenomenon, that is a spatial dimension. So, the dimension will depend on a visual quality that we perceived. The movement of the body and people’s thought will be an important term to generate the space dimension in urban screen phenomenon.

40|$|Since the mid 1990 s, {{the use of}} {{drifting}} Fish Aggregating Devices (dFADs) by purse seiners, artificial objects {{specifically designed}} to aggregate fish, has become an important mean of catching tropical tunas. In recent years, the massive deployments of dFADs, {{as well as the}} massive use of tracking devices on dFADs and natural floating objects, such as GPS buoys, have raised serious concerns for tropical tuna stocks, bycatch species and pelagic ecosystem functioning. Despite these concerns, relatively {{little is known about the}} modalities of dFAD use, making it difficult to assess and manage the impacts of this fishing practice. The present paper provides an overview of a 4 -year research on the use of dFADs by tropical tuna purse seiners in the Western Indian Ocean. Though our primary objective was to derive information on dFAD fisheries from a large variety of quantitative sources of information (GPS buoy positions, onboard observers, logbooks and VMS), a multi-disciplinary approach was adopted throughout our research. Quantitative results (estimates of dFAD use, fishing efficiency and impacts of dFAD use) were discussed with French purse seine skippers during semi-structured interviews to understand their perception of the impacts of dFAD use and to propose adapted management options for tropical tuna purse seine dFAD fisheries. Interviews with French purse seine skippers revealed the existence of a competition between EU purse seine fleets, encouraging the recent increase in the use of dFADs. They underlined the need for a more efficient management of the fishery, including the implementation of <b>catch</b> quotas, a <b>limitation</b> of the capacity of purse seine fleets and a regulation of the use of support vessels...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a widely}} held {{paradigm}} that mangroves are critical for sustaining production in coastal fisheries through their role as important nursery areas for fisheries species. This paradigm frequently forms the basis for important management decisions on habitat conservation and restoration of mangroves and other coastal wetlands. This paper reviews {{the current status of}} the paradigm and synthesises the information on the processes underlying these potential links. In the past, the paradigm has been supported by studies identifying correlations between the areal and linear extent of mangroves and fisheries catch. This paper goes beyond the correlative approach to develop a new framework on which future evaluations can be based. First, the review identifies what type of marine animals are using mangroves and at what life stages. These species can be categorised as estuarine residents, marine-estuarine species and marine stragglers. The marine-estuarine category includes many commercial species that use mangrove habitats as nurseries. The second stage is to determine why these species are using mangroves as nurseries. The three main proposals are that mangroves provide a refuge from predators, high levels of nutrients and shelter from physical disturbances. The recognition of the important attributes of mangrove nurseries then allows an evaluation of how changes in mangroves will affect the associated fauna. Surprisingly few studies have addressed this question. Consequently, it is difficult to predict how changes in any of these mangrove attributes would affect the faunal communities within them and, ultimately, influence the fisheries associated with them. From the information available, it seems likely that reductions in mangrove habitat complexity would reduce the biodiversity and abundance of the associated fauna, and these changes have the potential to cause cascading effects at higher trophic levels with possible consequences for fisheries. Finally, there is a discussion of the data that are currently available on mangrove distribution and fisheries <b>catch,</b> the <b>limitations</b> of these data and how best to use the data to understand mangrove-fisheries links and, ultimately, to optimise habitat and fisheries management. Examples are drawn from two relatively data-rich regions, Moreton Bay (Australia) and Western Peninsular Malaysia, to illustrate the data needs and research requirements for investigating the mangrove-fisheries paradigm. Having reliable and accurate data at appropriate spatial and temporal scales is crucial for mangrove-fisheries investigations. Recommendations are made for improvements to data collection methods that would meet these important criteria. This review provides a framework on which to base future investigations of mangrove-fisheries links, based on an understanding of the underlying processes and the need for rigorous data collection. Without this information, the understanding of the relationship between mangroves and fisheries will remain limited. Future investigations of mangrove-fisheries links must take this into account {{in order to have a}} good ecological basis and to provide better information and understanding to both fisheries and conservation managers...|$|R
40|$|Although {{information}} on the spawning seasons of commercially important snappers (Lutjanidae) and groupers (Serranidae, subfamily Epinephelinae) is available for the north and central west Atlantic, there is little information for the tropical western South Atlantic (Brazil). As a consequence, there are few fishery regulations in this entire region that take into consideration such information. In this study, we characterized the reproductive cycles of three Epinephelinae serranids (Epinephelus morio, Mycteroperca bonaci and Cephalopholis fulva) and five lutjanids (Lutjanus synagris, L. jocu, L. analis, Ocyurus chrysurus and Rhomboplites aurorubens) {{that occur in the}} Abrolhos Bank, Brazil, the largest reef complex in the tropical western South Atlantic. A total of 3528 gonads were collected from May 2005 to October 2007. Temporal variability in spawning patterns was evaluated using the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) and macroscopic analyses. The peak of reproductive activity for the three grouper species occurred between July and August. Snappers exhibited two peaks of reproductive activity, the more intense of which occurred between September and October. The other peak occurred between February and March, {{with the exception of the}} deep-dwelling species R. aurorubens, which only reproduced between February and March. Seasonal patterns were consistent over the two consecutive years that we studied, and these patterns are equivalent to those observed for the Northern Hemisphere, as are the sizes at maturity and at the time of sexual change (for the three protogynous hermaphrodite groupers). Fisheries management in this region could be significantly improved by a combination of <b>catch</b> and effort <b>limitations</b> being imposed during spawning seasons and by overall size limitations, particularly considering that most of the fish caught are generally below size at maturity. The proposed buffer zones for the marine areas that are presently protected in Abrolhos represent an opportunity for implementing both spatial (e. g. setting no-take zones that cover spawning sites) and temporal (e. g. seasonal closures during spawning peaks) management tools, using a participatory approach at the regional scale...|$|R
