The Sydney Mardi Gras has {{commenced}} each February since 1979. Sydney's Chinatown has had numerous locations since the 1850s. It moved from George Street to Campbell Street to its <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> in Dixon Street in 1980. The Spanish Quarter is based in Liverpool Street whilst Little Italy is located in Stanley Street. Popular nightspots are found at Kings Cross, Oxford Street, Circular Quay, and The Rocks. The Star is the city's only casino and is situated around Darling Harbour.|$|E
25|$|Consider {{the case}} of using gold as the source (mp = 1063°C). In this technique, the current through the {{filament}} of the pyrometer is adjusted until the light intensity of the filament matches that of a black-body at the melting point of gold. This establishes the primary calibration temperature and can be {{expressed in terms of}} current through the pyrometer lamp. With the same <b>current</b> <b>setting,</b> the pyrometer is sighted on another black-body at a higher temperature. An absorbing medium of known transmission is inserted between the pyrometer and this black-body. The temperature of the black-body is then adjusted until a match exists between its intensity and that of the pyrometer filament. The true higher temperature of the black-body is then determined from Planck's Law. The absorbing medium is then removed and the current through the filament is adjusted to match the filament intensity to that of the black-body. This establishes a second calibration point for the pyrometer. This step is repeated to carry the calibration to higher temperatures. Now, temperatures and their corresponding pyrometer filament currents are known and a curve of temperature versus current can be drawn. This curve can then be extrapolated to very high temperatures.|$|E

2500|$|Considerable {{activity}} was observed {{on the beaches}} and the [...] "Jig Green" [...] beach area was under fire from a German [...] gun situated west of Arromanches-les-Bains. British cruisers lying about [...] off shore carried out a naval bombardment of that area. At 11:46 shells from another German 8.8cm gun began falling near ships {{in the area and}} a British destroyer north of LST-21 engaged the shore battery. The first load was taken into the beach at 15:40 by Rhino ferry and at 19:15 LST-21 got underway toward the beach to meet the Rhino ferry which was laboring through tidal <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> due east. The seas were choppy and the wind freshening. The LST took on 13 casualties from a DUKW and the Rhino ferry returned at 21:45 and departed at 22:40 with the remaining vehicles disembarked from LST-21. The LST then got underway for her assigned anchorage. Ten minutes later ships began making smoke on a red alert, followed nine minutes later by a second red alert. Two minutes later, amidst anti-aircraft fire from the west three bombs successively hit the water on the port beam, a fourth hitting [...] off the starboard bow. At 22:30 a stick of four bombs hit the water from broad on the port bow to dead ahead, [...] and at 23:42 a stick of four bombs hit the water [...] off the port bow. No damage to LST-21 resulted from any of these attacks. There were intermittent alerts and anti-aircraft fire during the morning of 7 June 1944, and in the dive-bombing attack that followed, , [...] north of LST-21, received a bomb hit on the forecastle. At 11:20 on 7 June 1944, the LST got underway in convoy for Southampton, arriving at East Solent at 20:55.|$|E

60|$|January 14.-This {{morning we}} reached the western {{extremity}} of the field which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open sea, without a particle of ice. Upon sounding with two hundred fathoms, we here found a <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> southwardly {{at the rate of}} half a mile per hour. The temperature of the air was forty-seven, that of the water thirtyfour. We now sailed to the southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude 81 degrees 21', longitude 42 degrees W. We here again sounded, and found a <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> still southwardly, and at the rate of three quarters of a mile per hour. The variation per azimuth had diminished, and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant, the thermometer being as high as fifty-one. At this period not a particle of ice was to be discovered. All hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole.|$|E

This day we rigged some sounding gear, using a large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons, and a line of two hundred fathoms. We found the <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> to the north, {{about a quarter of a}} mile per hour. The temperature of the air was now about thirty-three.

60|$|After {{they had}} feasted {{themselves}} here for some days, they resolved {{to begin their}} new kind of navigation, and {{to see what they}} could make of it; but they went very heavily along, and every now and then, as I have said, the water was too rough for them, and they were fain to put into harbour, and sometimes lie there two or three days. However, they plyed their time as well as they could, and sometimes the <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> over to their side, and running strong by the shore, they would go at a great rate, insomuch that one time they said they went about thirty miles in a day, having, besides the current, a little gale of wind right astern.|$|E
60|$|In fact, Pompey {{found the}} <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> every where {{strongly}} against him. Some recommended that commissioners {{should be sent}} to Caesar to make proposals for peace. The leading men, however, knowing that any peace made with him under such circumstances would be their own ruin, resisted and defeated the proposal. Cato abruptly left the city and proceeded to Sicily, which had been assigned him as his province. Others fled in other directions. Pompey himself, uncertain what to do, and not daring to remain, called upon all his partisans to join him, and set off at night, suddenly, and with very little preparation and small supplies, to retreat across the country toward the shores of the Adriatic Sea, His destination was Brundusium, the usual port of embarkation for Macedon and Greece.|$|E
60|$|This was a {{discovery}} {{too great to}} be omitted, so I ordered the brigantine to stand in with an easy sail, and see what account could be had of the place; accordingly they stood in, and we followed about a league, and then lay by, waiting their signals. I had particularly ordered them to keep two boats ahead to sound the depth all the way, and they did so; and how it happened we knew not, but on a sudden we heard the sloop fire two guns first, and then one gun; {{the first was a}} signal to us to bring to, and come no farther: the next was a signal of distress. We immediately tacked to stand off, but found a strong <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> directly into the bite, and there not being wind enough for us to stem the current, we let go our anchors in twenty fathoms water.|$|E

60|$|Ere quitting Rodondo, it {{must not}} be omitted that here, in 1813, the U.S. frigate Essex, Captain David Porter, came near leaving her bones. Lying {{becalmed}} one morning with a strong <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> her rapidly towards the rock, a strange sail was descried, which--not out of keeping with alleged enchantments of the neighborhood--seemed to be staggering under a violent wind, while the frigate lay lifeless as if spell-bound. But a light air springing up, all sail {{was made by the}} frigate in chase of the enemy, as supposed--he being deemed an English whale-ship--but the rapidity of the current was so great, that soon all sight was lost of him; and, at meridian, the Essex, spite of her drags, was driven so close under the foam-lashed cliffs of Rodondo that, for a time, all hands gave her up. A smart breeze, however, at last helped her off, though the escape was so critical as to seem almost miraculous.|$|E
60|$|This was, {{you will}} conclude, a very joyful night, {{and the next}} morning they went all hands to work at the boats, getting out of the creek early, and made the best of their way. However, with all they could do, they could not go above twelve miles that day, for the <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> over to the other shore, had left them, and in some places, they would rather have an eddy stream against them, and this {{discouraged}} them a little, but, depending that they were near their port, and that their friends were not far off, they were very cheerful. At night they looked out again for rockets, the sight of which failed not to rejoice their hearts again, and with this addition, that it appeared their friends were not above four or five miles off; they answered the rockets punctually, and proceeding early the next day, they met in the morning joyfully enough, as has been said.|$|E
60|$|Normandy {{takes its}} name from the Northmen. It was the {{province}} of France which the Northmen made peculiarly their own. They gained access to it from the sea by the River Seine, which, as will be seen from the map, flows, as it were, through the heart of the country. The lower part of this river, and the sea around its mouth, are much choked up with sand and gravel, which the waves have been for ages washing in. Their incessant industry would result in closing up the passage entirely, were it not that the waters of the river must have an outlet; and thus the <b>current,</b> <b>setting</b> outward, wages perpetual war with the surf and surges which are continually breaking in. The expeditions of the Northmen, however, found their way through all these obstructions. They ascended the river with their ships, and finally gained a permanent settlement in the country. They had occupied the country for some centuries at the time when our story begins--the province being governed by a line of princes--almost, if not quite, independent sovereigns--called the Dukes of Normandy.|$|E
