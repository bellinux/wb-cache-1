40|$|Vibrio cholerae non-O 1 / non-O 139 serogroups {{have been}} {{reported}} to cause sporadic diarrhoea in humans. <b>Cholera</b> <b>toxins</b> have been mostly implicated for hypersecretion of ions and water into the small intestine. Though most of the V. cholerae non-O 1 / non-O 139 strains lack these <b>cholera</b> <b>toxins,</b> several other innate virulence factors contribute towards their pathogenicity. The environmental isolates may thus act as reservoirs for potential spreading of these virulence genes in the natural environment which may cause the emergence of epidemic-causing organisms. The environmental isolates of vibrios were obtained from water samples, zooplanktons and phytoplanktons, from a village pond in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. They were confirmed as Vibrio cholerae non-O 1 / non-O 139 using standard biochemical and serotyping tests. PCR experiments revealed that the isolates lacked ctxA, ctxB, tcpA, zot and ace genes whereas other pathogenicity genes like toxR, rtxC, hlyA, hapA and prtV were detected in these isolates. Compared with epidemic strain V. cholerae O 1 El Tor N 16961, culture supernatants from most of these isolates caused higher cytotoxicity to HT 29 cells and higher hemolytic, hemagglutinin and protease activities. In rabbit ileal loop assays, the environmental isolates showed only 2 - 4 folds lesser fluid accumulation in comparison to N 16961 and a V. cholerae clinical isolate IDH 02365 of 2009. Pulsed Field Gel electrophoresis and Random amplification of Polymorphic DNA indicated that these isolates showed considerable diversity and did not share the same clonal lineage even though they were derived from the same water source. All the isolates showed resistance to one or more antibiotics. Though these environmental isolates lacked the <b>cholera</b> <b>toxins,</b> they seem to have adopted other survival strategies by optimally utilising a diverse array of several other toxins. The current findings indicate the possibility that these isolates could cause some gastroenteric inflammation when ingested and may serve as progenitors for overt disease-causing organisms...|$|R
25|$|Cholera: ADP-ribosylation {{caused by}} <b>cholera</b> <b>toxin</b> results in {{increased}} production of cyclic AMP {{which in turn}} opens the CFTR channel which leads to oversecretion of Cl−.

Following separation, the A1 domain unfolds and is redirected back to the cytosol where it refolds and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of certain G protein alpha subunits. In doing so, the downstream effects of the G protein signal transduction pathway is disrupted by activating adenylate cyclase. This causes a higher concentration of cAMP in the cell, which disrupts the regulation of ion transport mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|The <b>cholera</b> <b>toxin</b> (CTX or CT) is an {{oligomeric}} complex {{made up of}} six protein subunits: {{a single}} copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a disulfide bond. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to GM1 gangliosides {{on the surface of}} the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that ADP-ribosylates G proteins, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6). Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the Gs alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. This results in constitutive cAMP production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the <b>cholera</b> <b>toxin</b> was introduced into V. cholerae by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of V. cholerae carry a variant of a temperate bacteriophage called CTXφ.|$|E

The eluted protein was heat labile, was inactivated at either pH 3. 0 or 9. 0, was sensitive to trypsin, and was lethal for fertile chicken eggs. It also had toxic effects on chicken embryo fibroblast, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), and intestinal 407 (Int 407) cells. A monoclonal antibody (CETPMAb 4) raised to this eluted toxic protein (ETP) from C. jejuni abolished these toxic activities. Homology between C. jejuni ETP and Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> <b>toxin</b> was not observed in that specific antisera to each did not block their respective toxic activities. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, ETP, unlike chlorea enterotoxin, did not bind to GM 1 ganglioside. Furthermore, the C. jejuni toxin had cytotoxinlike properties and induced rounding of CHO cells. Binding of ETP to Int 407 and primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells was maximal after 2 h as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and this toxin adherence to host cell membranes was significantly reduced by prior treatment of the cells with proteolytic enzymes, neuraminidase, or glutaraldehyde but not by treatment with beta-galactosidase, lipase, Nonidet P- 40, or sodium metaperiodate. In competitive binding assays, sugars, lectins, or GM 1 ganglioside did not adversely influence uptake of ETP by these cells.

Hypersensitive mutants revealed cytoprotective pathways, including stress-activated signaling and protein degradation. Resistant mutants clustered to endocytic, lipid organization, and cell wall biogenesis pathways. Furthermore, GPI anchors and transcriptional regulation are important for K 28 -cell binding. Strikingly, the AP 2 complex, which in metazoans links endocytic cargo to the clathrin coat, but had no assigned function in yeast, was critical for K 28 toxicity.

In contrast, the respective binding components (B oligomers) did not affect leukotriene formation.

In addition, pertussis and <b>cholera</b> <b>toxins</b> reduced the specific binding of [3 H]fMLP.
