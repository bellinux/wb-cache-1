40|$|A <b>compound</b> <b>process</b> is a sum of {{a random}} number of random variables. It has wide {{applications}} in business, finance, and engineering. In the insurance industry, it plays {{a fundamental role in}} risk modeling to characterize claims. Simulating a <b>compound</b> <b>process</b> is sometimes mishandled {{as a product}} of random variables. This mistake is common when using a spreadsheet tool like Crystal Ball ® software. This article investigates the underlying reason of the misuse, analyses its consequences and proposes a correction. The correct way to perform a <b>compound</b> <b>process</b> simulation requires sampling each i. i. d. random variable under the random sum separately. This task is challenging to Crystal Ball users who don’t want turn to VBA programming and may impede a wider use of Crystal Ball. This paper solves the issue by using Microsoft ® Excel® worksheet functions creatively. The approach makes it possible to perform a serious, complicated <b>compound</b> <b>process</b> simulation using a spreadsheet without MACRO or VBA coding thus taking full advantage of Crystal Ball’s flexibility and simplicity. An example of a claims model with deductibles and reinsurance structures is shown. The efficiency of the approach is also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{continuous}} <b>compounding</b> <b>process</b> of silica-based rubber compounds with in-situ silanization {{was investigated in}} co-rotating twin screw extruders. In regards to achieving better silica dispersion and {{a high degree of}} silanization as well as the removal of the condensation products from the <b>compounding</b> <b>process,</b> the twin-screw extruder has great advantages {{as an alternative to the}} internal mixer for the preparation of silica compounds. For a simplified recipe, which contains only silica and no carbon black as filler, the question of the completeness of the silanization can be answered positively for the Ø 44 mm extruder. Time and temperature control are the crucial factors in the mixing process. The optimization process is strongly determined by trade-offs. In {{the continuous}} compounding with extruder cascades, complete silanization and good silica dispersion must be ensured. The sequence of compounding stages has a strong influence on the properties of the mixture. It is technologically important that the silanization reaction begins promptly at the start of the mixing process. A complete silanization is the prerequisite for a low viscosity of the silica compound and for the formation of a strong polymer-filler interaction. Shorter residence time, lower energy consumption and comparable mixture properties are the notable advantages of the <b>compounding</b> <b>process</b> in the twin screw extruder. In order to obtain a better understanding of the continuous <b>compounding</b> <b>process,</b> a simulation program, MOREX, is being employed parallel to the extrusion experiments. It can be shown that simulation calculation is very helpful in optimizing the screw configuration and reducing the experimental effort...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A facile <b>compounding</b> <b>process,</b> which com-bined {{nanocomposite}} {{process with}} electrospinning for pre-paring novel polyamide 6 /organic modified montmorillon-ite (PA 6 /O-MMT) composite nanofibers, is reported. In this <b>compounding</b> <b>process,</b> the O-MMT slurry was blended into the formic acid solution of PA 6 at moderate tempera-tures, where the nanosized O-MMT particles were first dis-persed in N,N-dimethyl formamide solvent homogene-ously via ultrasonic mixing. Subsequently the solution via electrospinning formed nanofibers, which were collected onto aluminum foil. The O-MMT platelets were detected to be exfoliated at nanosize level and dispersed homogene-ously along {{the axis of}} the nanofibers using an electron transmission microscope. Scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope were used to analysis the size and surface morphology of polyamide 6 /O-MMT composite nanofibers. The addition of O-MMT reduced the surface ten-sion and viscosity of the solution, leading to the decrease in the diameter of nanofiber {{and the formation of}} rough and ridge-shape trails on the nanofiber surface.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to examine how the moisture content of wood flour affects the degree of crosslinking during the fabrication of silane-crosslinked wood-thermoplastic composites. Crosslinked composites were produced by adding a silane solution to the <b>compounding</b> <b>process</b> of wood flour and polyethylene. Crosslinked composites of pre-dried as well as non-dried wood flour were prepared and their degree of crosslinking at various storage conditions was determined. Mechanical properties and the creep response of the crosslinked composites were tested {{in order to establish}} structure-properties relations. The results showed that all crosslinked composites displayed higher strengths and significantly lower creep responses as opposed a non-crosslinked control sample. However, the degree and rate of crosslinking proved to be lower when a larger amount of moisture was present in the <b>compounding</b> <b>process.</b> It was concluded that the silane-grafting yield was lower when wood flour of a higher moisture content was used, and a possible reason for this was that the radicals necessary for grafting the silanes to the polyethylene had been consumed in the process.

It {{is very important to}} understand the processing effect on the natural fibre-reinforced composites mechanical properties because of the natural fibre degradation characteristics. Optimizing the fabrication process, especially the <b>compounding</b> <b>process,</b> is effective to achieve the optimal properties of the composites. In this research a natural fibre, noil hemp fibre, was applied to reinforce polypropylene with internal mixing process. The influence of compounding parameters, such as mixing temperature, mixing time and rotor speed, on the mechanical properties (tensile strength, flexural strength and impact strength) of the noil hemp fibre/polypropylene composites was investigated using orthogonal method and the evidence of thermogravimetric analysis test of fibre and the observation of fibre dispersion in resin. The range analysis and variance of analysis demonstrated that the mixing temperature has significant effect on the three mechanical properties, mixing time has minor influence on the tensile and flexural strengths, and rotor speed mainly affects the impact strength. The thermogravimetric analysis test of noil hemp fibre and the fibre dispersion in resin show that a combination of low mixing temperature, short mixing time and high rotor speed of <b>compounding</b> <b>process</b> is helpful to achieve certain fibre dispersion without serious thermal degradation of fibre. Noil hemp fibre/polypropylene composites with the best comprehensive mechanical properties could be obtained at 165 degree C for 12 min with rotor speed 50 r/min. ...|$|E

Despite the massive literature about nanocomposites and microinjection molding process, few articles focus on the interaction between the <b>compounding</b> <b>process</b> and the following micro-injection molding transformation processes.

The nanofiller dispersion has been evaluated via light and transmission electron microscopy. The results confirm that, the screws show different capacity at promoting the dispersion of the nanofiller, which affects the moldability of micro-injected CNT nanocomposites.
