5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide {{made their way to}} the pavement from high up. Police started to block off areas where the ice was falling, however one man was hit in the head by the falling ice and was knocked to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The show's title {{character}} is {{portrayed in the}} two pilots by Pal, the MGM film Lassie. Thereafter, five of his male descendants played the role. His son Lassie Junior performed through the Jeff years and first two Timmy years before retiring in 1959 to battle cancer. Though he recovered, Lassie Junior never worked the show again. His son Spook was rushed into the series while his brother Baby was in training for the role. Spook was inadequately prepared and never became comfortable on the set after an overhead light <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor on his first day. Weatherwax, however, coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the frightened dog, and some regard Spook's portrayal as Weatherwax's finest work. Spook played the role {{in the spring and}} fall of 1960. Baby, son of Lassie Junior and brother to Spook, worked the show for six years. He appeared in the last Timmy years, and two of the Forest Service seasons. Baby died at eight years of age, the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years. He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years. He portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons.|$|E

25|$|The aircraft, a four-engined, propeller-driven Douglas DC-6, had {{departed}} from Newark Airport's runway 24 at 00:18 EST and was observed by {{personnel in the}} control tower suddenly losing altitude, while veering to the right. Two minutes later, the plane clipped an apartment building in Elizabeth, setting it on fire; it then <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground and burst into flames, narrowly missing an orphanage.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{and devotion}} to duty when engaging hostile aircraft. Within {{a week he}} <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground four enemy machines, and at all times, when on patrol, he never hesitated to attack any enemy in sight. His consistent dash and great fearlessness have been worthy of the highest praise. In all he has ten hostile machines to his credit.|$|E
25|$|A {{continued}} {{commercial success}} of rolinga and suburban rock. In {{the early part}} of the current decade the so-called '2nd wave of suburban' <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scene: Guasones, Jovenes Pordioseros, La 25, Cielo Razzo, Black Roses, Hijos Del Oeste, El Bordo, Callejeros and Casi Justicia Social. Their fan base is somewhat younger than those of the 1st wave, and their music is derivative of the 1st but with a slightly pop, more teen oriented approach.|$|E

25|$|From the Festival of Latin American Solidarity emerged solo {{artists that}} {{would go on to}} delve into a more adult {{oriented}} form of rock and pop music, with the Argentine youngsters of the 1960s now mature adults. Some of these names were Juan Carlos Baglietto (who was optimistic about a young musician from Rosario named Fito Páez), Alejandro Lerner, and Celeste Carballo. In heavy metal, Pappo founded his new band Riff, and newcomers V8 and La Torre would emerge. New witty rock bands like Los Twist, Suéter, and the riot grrrl group Viuda e hijas de Roque Enroll <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scene infusing Argentine rock with needed dosages of humor and self-deprecation. On the gothic side of rock, La Sobrecarga and Euroshima would carry the torch.|$|E
25|$|Both {{aircraft}} collided in cloud at {{an altitude}} of 8400 meters, approximately over Dniprodzerzhynsk. Flight 7880's right wing sliced through Flight 7628's forward fuselage, tearing off part of 7880's right wing, the debris of which was ingested by 7880's right engine. The impact spun 7628 to the right, causing the tails of both aircraft to collide at which time the left engine of 7628 struck the keel of 7880, and 7628's right wing was torn off. Flight 7628 tumbled out of control and broke up, with debris scattered over an area measuring 16 by 3 kilometers. Damage to 7880 included the loss of most of the empennage, one of the engines and a section of the right wing. The pilots of 7880 attempted an emergency landing, but {{at an altitude}} of approximately 4000 meters they lost control and at 13:38 <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground north-east of Kamianske, completely destroying the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{credentials}} as a player, {{there was some}} concern raised that Kubik had no real history as a coach, and he did little to endear himself to fans by bringing in Richard Hancox as coach. Torquay's dire form continued, and the club <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the table on Boxing Day; they would ultimately never leave {{the foot of the}} table after that. After the worst run of form in the club's history, Kubik eventually quit on 5 February, having won just one of his matches in charge, and Colin Lee was soon after appointed as the new director of football and Keith Curle was appointed as Head Coach on 7 February 2007. Roberts resigned amid growing pressure from supporters and the board of directors, all of whom were unhappy with his conduct as chairman, on 21 February 2007. Local hotel owner Keith Richardson was announced as the new chairman the following day. However, on 7 March 2007, former chairman Mike Bateson was reappointed as chairman, the move coming about due to Chris Roberts' company, Torquay United Holdings, being unable to meet the next payment to purchase the club from Bateson.|$|E
50|$|Commander Spock is in command, but {{is unable}} to do much. Mysterious tentacles have ensnared the ship, {{draining}} power. Spock finds himself with few options, remaining on board and eventually <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planetoid surface or beaming inside <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> Captain.|$|R
50|$|In theory, {{issues and}} {{problems}} of land-based airports could be minimized by locating airports several miles off the coast. Takeoffs and landings would be over water, not over populated areas, thereby eliminating noise pollution and reducing risks of aircraft <b>crashes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land-locked population.|$|R
50|$|On 3 September 1986, a Cessna 402 air {{ambulance}} aircraft crashed shortly after {{taking off from}} Essendon airport with six on board. All six were killed after the aircraft burst into flames upon <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground in what is today the suburb of Gowanbrae.|$|R
25|$|There were {{problems}} with the innovative use of blue reflective glass in a steel tower: Entire 4' × 11', 500-lb (1.2 × 3.4 m, 227kg) windowpanes detached from the building and <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk hundreds of feet below. Police closed off surrounding streets whenever winds reached 45mph (72km/h). Under the direction of Frank H. Durgin of MIT's Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel a scale model of the entire Back Bay and an aeroelastic model of the John Hancock Tower were built and tested in the wind tunnel to identify the problem. The research {{raised questions about the}} structural integrity of the entire building (due to unanticipated twisting of the structure), but did not account for the loss of the glass panels. An independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated thermal stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of the air between the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window; the resilient bonding between the inner glass, reflective material, and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass (instead of absorbing it), thus causing the glass to fail.|$|E
500|$|During a {{training}} mission, an F-22 <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of Tyndall AFB, on 15 November 2012. The pilot ejected safely and no injuries were {{reported on the}} ground. The investigation determined that a [...] "chafed" [...] electrical wire ignited the fluid in a hydraulic line, causing a fire that damaged the flight controls.|$|E
500|$|Inspiration for {{the plot}} of [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] was derived from creator-producer Gerry Anderson's {{memories}} of his National Service. While stationed at RAF Manston in Kent from 1947 to 1949, the young Anderson had witnessed a Battle of Britain-themed air show coming to a fateful end: a Mosquito fighter {{had gone out of}} control and <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, resulting in 20 fatalities. A few months after the Mosquito disaster, he saw a Spitfire with a damaged undercarriage make a successful emergency landing at the airbase. During the pre-production of Thunderbirds, Anderson used his recollections of the events as the foundation of the bomb plot surrounding the Fireflash airliner. Anderson dictated the script to his wife, Sylvia, for typing at their villa in Portugal; it was completed in four sessions during the spring of 1964. As an in-joke, the character of Lieutenant Meddings is named after Bob Bell, the AP Films art director, and Derek Meddings, the director of special effects.|$|E
2500|$|On , an AW109 on {{charter to}} Rotormotion clipped a {{construction}} crane attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> St George Wharf Tower in Vauxhall, London, before <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground and bursting into flames, killing {{the pilot and}} a person on the ground. The helicopter was completely destroyed and the crane was also seriously damaged.|$|R

500|$|At one point, {{shooting}} {{was to take}} place at a bridge overlooking the Detroit River, which was frozen at the time. The script, however, called for clear and running water, meaning that the crew had to brave dangerously low temperatures and conditions to clear the ice; finally they blew up the ice with dynamite. At another time, the crew spent a week filming on a Detroit street after dark, directly under a nursing home, with huge wind machines blowing for long hours. One evening a glass bottle with a note in it <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground from an upper floor. The note inside read, [...] "The noise is keeping me awake all night long and I am getting sick. I am dying because of you." [...] John Cameron, second assistant director on the film, would later remark, [...] "I see Crimewave as a real turning point in a certain way, because if you survived that experience, nothing in the business could ever be as hard again." [...] Raimi cited the experience {{as one of the}} least favorite moments of his career.|$|E
500|$|Destructive winds {{continued}} into central Maryland. A report from Sandy Spring estimated that 20% {{of trees in}} the region were uprooted, splintered, or violently twisted, often falling on utility wires and roads. Some of the trees left standing were stripped of their limbs and reduced to bare trunks. Telegraph poles <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground in large numbers. In some cases, damage patterns and eyewitness accounts suggested the formation of tornadoes embedded within the larger storm system. As in northern Virginia, churches, homes, and businesses incurred significant damage, some being wholly destroyed. Montgomery County was hit particularly hard; the storm wrecked an amusement park in Bethesda, forcing it to permanently close, while Gaithersburg was [...] "most disastrously wrecked". Several individuals {{lost their lives in}} Montgomery County, including one man who died of a stress-induced heart attack. Most of the farms in central Maryland were affected to some degree. Periods of exceptionally heavy rainfall, amounting to [...] in Flintstone and [...] in Cumberland, caused rapid rises along waterways in the Potomac River watershed, inundating adjacent low-lying areas. The Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad line in Cumberland was washed out.|$|E

50|$|A morning {{commuter}} train, {{inbound to}} Boston, was passing over the Bussey Bridge, a Howe truss, at South Street in the Roslindale neighborhood {{a half mile}} from the Forest Hills station, when it suddenly collapsed, sending several cars <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> street below. Twenty-four commuters were killed and another 125 were seriously injured.|$|R
2500|$|Two years later, its {{original}} steeple, at [...] the tallest {{in the state}} at that time, <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground when the roof collapsed during a Christmas Eve windstorm. The cause was traced to the 50 tons (46 tonnes) of slate roofing the church elders had substituted for Lafever's tin, creating a load greater than the structure was intended to support.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{suffered a}} deep stall {{in the third}} minute of its flight and <b>crashed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, narrowly missing a busy main road. The ensuing inquest principally blamed the captain for failing to maintain airspeed and configure the high-lift devices correctly. It also cited the captain's heart condition and the limited experience of the co-pilot, while noting an unspecified [...] "technical problem" [...] that the crew apparently resolved before take-off.|$|E
