[...] Many types of selvages have been developed, with different elastic and ornamental properties.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{hundreds}} of different knitting stitches used by hand knitters. A piece of hand knitting begins {{with the process of}} casting on, which involves the initial creation of the stitches on the needle. Different methods of casting on are used for different effects: one may be stretchy enough for lace, while another provides a decorative edging. [...] Provisional cast-ons are used when the knitting will continue in both directions from the <b>cast-on.</b> There are various methods employed to cast on, such as the [...] "thumb method" [...] (also known as [...] "slingshot" [...] or [...] "long-tail" [...] cast-ons), where the stitches are created by a series of loops that will, when knitted, give a very loose edge ideal for [...] "picking up stitches" [...] and knitting a border; the [...] "double needle method" [...] (also known as [...] "knit-on" [...] or [...] "cable cast-on"), whereby each loop placed on the needle is then [...] "knitted on," [...] which produces a firmer edge ideal on its own as a border; and many more. The number of active stitches remains the same as when cast on unless stitches are added (an increase) or removed (a decrease).|$|E
5000|$|Provisional chain <b>cast-on</b> : Simply the crochet chain <b>cast-on</b> using waste yarn; {{this is also}} an [...] "invisible cast-on" [...] {{that can}} be pulled out later to allow {{knitting}} in the opposite direction. Work a crochet chain in waste yarn, loosely fastening the tail end. With working yarn, pick up the chain-bumps, as for the crochet chain <b>cast-on,</b> to create the working stitches. To take out the <b>cast-on,</b> simply pull out {{the tail of the}} waste yarn at the fastened end and [...] "zip off" [...] the crochet chain. Pick up the now loose loops and work from the opposite direction of previous work. This is done in toe-up socks and shawls or scarves with directional patterns that need to start from a center edge.|$|E
50|$|Casting on {{can also}} be {{decorated}} with various stitch patterns, especially picots. The <b>cast-on</b> stitches {{can also be}} twisted clockwise or counterclockwise as they {{are added to the}} needle; this is commonly done for the single <b>cast-on</b> described below to give it a neater, more uniform look.|$|E
5000|$|Circular <b>cast-on</b> : Popularized by Elizabeth Zimmermann as [...] "Emily Ocker's Circular Beginning." ...|$|E
5000|$|Double needle <b>cast-on</b> : First, {{you must}} {{put all of}} your {{stitches}} on one needle.|$|E
5000|$|Single <b>cast-on</b> : An even simpler method, {{also called}} the simple <b>cast-on</b> or [...] "backward loop cast-on," [...] which {{involves}} adding a series of half hitches to the needle. This creates a very stretchy, flexible edge. It is a common approach for adding several stitches to the edge {{in the middle of}} a knitted fabric, but it is difficult to knit from and make even. A variation is the twisted simple cast on, where you twist the new loop around your thumb, with the yarn going around the back of your thumb to the front as in the simple <b>cast-on,</b> but picking up the new loop from the back side of the loop. This is tighter and neater, but has less elasticity.|$|E
5000|$|One-row {{buttonhole}} (horizontal) -- Work {{to where}} you want the buttonhole to be. Slip next stitch, move yarn {{to the back of}} work, slip second stitch, pass first slipped stitch over the second, slip next stitch, pass second stitch over the third, and repeat until desired width of buttonhole is reached. Turn work and, by using the cable <b>cast-on</b> or backward loop cast on, cast on the number of stitches bound off plus one. Turn work again. Slip the next stitch to the right-hand needle and pass the extra <b>cast-on</b> stitch over the slipped stitch.|$|E
50|$|The color release can {{be applied}} {{in one of two}} {{procedures}} based on the two forms it is manufactured in: powdered (<b>cast-on</b> color release made up of calcium-releasing powders that repel water); or liquid - which is a light aromatic-based solvent, spray-on color release. <b>Cast-on</b> color release is a procedure where the powder color release is applied by spreading the color release {{on the surface of the}} concrete before the concrete is stamped. Spray-on color release is a procedure where liquid color release is sprayed on the bottom of the concrete stamps before the concrete is stamped.|$|E

50|$|The color {{hardener}} can {{be applied}} using one of two procedures; integral color or <b>cast-on</b> color. Integral color is the procedure where the entire volume of concrete is dyed the base color. The entire volume of concrete is colored by adding the color hardener to the concrete truck, and allowing all the concrete in the truck to be dyed. <b>Cast-on</b> color is the procedure where {{the surface of the}} concrete is dyed the base color. The surface of the concrete is colored by spreading the color hardener onto the surface of the wet concrete and floating the powder into the top layer of the wet concrete.|$|E
5000|$|Magic <b>cast-on</b> : Developed by Judy Becker; {{also known}} as the [...] "magic toe-up cast-on," [...] due to its popular use in {{beginning}} toe-up sock construction. Instructions were first published in an issue of the on-line knitting magazine knitty.com http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEspring06/FEATmagiccaston.html.|$|E
5000|$|Cable <b>cast-on</b> : A {{closely related}} technique, {{in which a}} new loop is drawn through {{the space between the}} two {{previous}} loops and then added to the needle. This edge is firm and has a neat, corded look; although it may be too bulky with thick yarns.|$|E
5000|$|Knit-on <b>cast-on</b> : Perhaps {{the most}} {{straightforward}} method, {{in which a}} new loop is drawn through the previous loop and then added to the needle. However, this method is deprecated for giving an untidy edge. It can also {{be done in a}} purl version, or even a rib version.|$|E
5000|$|Provisional <b>cast-on</b> : Also {{known as}} an [...] "invisible cast-on," [...] since the waste yarn used can be pulled out later to allow the knitter to {{continue}} the knitting in the opposite direction. This <b>cast-on</b> is also the best method for double-knit fabrics, since the knitting has no boundary; the knitting is continuous {{from one side of}} the fabric to the other. Holding the ends of a waste yarn and the working yarn, make an overhand knot. Place a needle held in the left hand between the two yarns, with the knot below, the waste yarn held underneath and parallel to the needle out to the right, and the working yarn up and in front of the needle. Bring the working yarn down behind the needle and in front of the waste yarn; up behind the waste yarn and over-and-up then down in front of the needle; down behind the waste yarn; then up in front of the needle. Repeat for each two stitches. When desired number of stitches is reached, loosely fasten the waste yarn and work as usual with the working yarn. To take out the provisional <b>cast-on,</b> unfasten the end of the waste yarn and carefully pull it out, picking up the now loose loops on a needle and working from the opposite direction of previous work.|$|E
5000|$|Chain <b>cast-on</b> : Uses a {{crochet hook}} or two {{knitting}} needles. To execute, hold a knitting needle in {{left hand and}} crochet hook or second knitting needle in right hand. Make a slip-knot in yarn {{and put it on}} the crochet hook or right-hand needle. Wrap the yarn from the back of the left-hand needle and over to the front, over the crochet hook or right needle, pass the slip-knot loop over the wrap, leaving the new loop on the crochet hook or right needle. Repeat, wrapping the yarn over the left-hand needle before passing it over the crochet hook or right needle to make a new loop, until you have one less stitch than required. Place the last loop on the left-hand needle as the first stitch that will be worked. This <b>cast-on</b> creates an edge that mimics a standard bind-off edge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{initial and}} final edges of a knitted fabric {{are known as}} the <b>cast-on</b> and bound/cast-off edges. The side edges are known as the selvages; the word derives from [...] "self-edges", meaning that the {{stitches}} {{do not need to}} be secured by anything else. Many types of selvages have been developed, with different elastic and ornamental properties.|$|E
5000|$|Tubular <b>cast-on</b> : Involves {{knitting}} onto a cast on row knitted in a contrasting yarn {{with half}} as many stitches. Each knit stitch into the contrasting stitches {{is followed by a}} yarn-over to double the number of stitches. After several rows, a tuck is formed by knitting together the first and third rows, forming a tube through which elastic can be pulled. A neat edge, nicely suited for 1x1 ribbing.|$|E
50|$|Drop-stitch {{knitting}} is a knitting {{technique for}} producing open, vertical stripes in a garment. The basic {{idea is to}} knit a solid fabric, then (deliberately) drop one or more stitches (i.e., draw a loop out from the loop below it, and so on repeatedly), producing a run (or ladder) in the fabric. The run will continue to the bottom (i.e., <b>cast-on)</b> edge of the garment, or until it encounters an increase, at which it stops.|$|E
5000|$|Crochet chain <b>cast-on</b> : For {{this you}} {{need to know how to}} do a simple crochet chain. Once you have chained enough to equal the number of {{stitches}} you need, plus a few extra, turn the chain over so that you see the bumps that were forming as you pulled the yarn through the hole. Put your knitting needle through those bumps and knit through it as normal. This produces the same edge as knitting on.|$|E
5000|$|Turkish <b>cast-on</b> : Used for {{circular}} beginnings, {{often for}} {{the toes of}} socks made toe-up. It is invisible (as with the provisional <b>cast-on).</b> You begin with two circular needles held one above the other {{as you look at}} them (Upper called A, lower called B). Place a slip-knot on B, and wrap the yarn up behind A. Then begin wrapping it around both needles, down in front and up in back, until the number of wraps equals half the number of stitches needed. Slide B along, through the wraps, until they sit on the cable, and the ends dangle on either side. Then bring the other, loose, end of A up, and knit into the wraps still on A. Once you've knit all of those wraps, pull A until the wraps are on the cable, and pull B so that the tip of the needle holds the wraps, pointed to the end with the working yarn. Bring up the other end of B and knit across the wraps again. This completes one round. From here, you can continue to work around the stitches on the two circular needles, increasing as desired, or switch to double pointed needles or a single circular needle for the Magic Loop method of knitting circularly.|$|E
5000|$|Double <b>cast-on</b> : A common method, {{in which}} all the loops are made with one yarn, while the other end (the {{dangling}} end from the original slip knot) is used to secure the base of each loop. This method is also called the [...] "knit half-hitch cast on" [...] or the [...] "long-tail cast on." [...] Although popular, this method requires that the knitter estimate the length of the dangling yarn before the stitches are cast on; if the dangling yarn is too short, the knitter will run out of yarn with which to secure the stitches before the full number of stitches have been cast on. In that case, the knitter will have to pull everything out, re-position the slip knot to give a longer tail, and begin anew. Despite this shortcoming, it's a good all-around method for casting on. Another variation for this method is to use two different yarns, one the main yarns that you are using for your project, and the second a piece of contrasting waste yarn. You attach the two with a slip knot, and then using the waste or contrast yarn as your long tail, start your row. This is useful if you need to pick up stitches on your cast on edge in order to knit in the opposite direction. You can also use it decoratively, making the contrast or waste yarn a part of your pattern design. To execute it, you start by figuring out how much yarn you expect your <b>cast-on</b> row to require and pulling out that amount of yarn. Once you have that, put a slip knot on the needle (this is not absolutely necessary, since the first <b>cast-on</b> stitch will create a slip knot for you in the process, but it is generally more secure to start with a slip knot). Hold the needle in your right hand and the yarn in your left, with the long tail pulled around your thumb and hanging in front, and the yarn from ball around your first or second finger, with the ball tail heading toward the back. Once you have that, take the needle under the front of the long tail, picking up a half hitch, then back to the yarn over your finger from the top side of the yarn, pulling the loop through the half hitch you had formed. This cast on can also be done in a purl and a twisted stitch version as well.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cast-on</b> lugs {{tended to}} make unsound {{castings}} (Cochrane {{said he had}} seen examples in the bridge ruins) and had prevented facing of the outer side of flanges. Cochrane added that their use meant that columns had had to be cast horizontally rather than vertically, thus giving less satisfactory castings; and unless lugs were carefully packed during bolting up they could be damaged or strained. For so tall a pier Gilkes would have preferred some other means of attaching the ties to the columns [...] "knowing how treacherous a thing cast iron is, but if an engineer gave me such a thing to make I should make it without question, believing that he had apportioned the strength properly". A letter Bouch-Gilkes 22 January 1875 had noted that Gilkes was [...] "inclined to prefer making the joints of the metal columns the same as on the Beelah and Deepdale".

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} misfit alterations at the implant/abutment interface of external and internal connection implant systems when subjected to cyclic loading. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Standard metal crowns were fabricated for 5 groups (n= 10) of implant/abutment assemblies: Group 1, external hexagon implant and UCLA <b>cast-on</b> premachined abutment; Group 2, internal hexagon implant and premachined abutment; Group 3, internal octagon implant and prefabricated abutment; Group 4, external hexagon implant and UCLA <b>cast-on</b> premachined abutment; and Group 5, external hexagon implant and Ceraone abutment. For groups 1, 2, 3 and 5, the crowns were cemented on the abutments and in group 4 crowns were screwed directly on the implant. The specimens were subjected to 500, 000 cycles at 19. 1 Hz of frequency and non-axial load of 133 N in a MTS 810 machine. The vertical misfit (&# 956;m) at the implant/abutment interface was evaluated before (B) and after (A) application of the cyclic loading. Data were analyzed statistically by using two-away ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Before loading values showed no difference among groups 2 (4. 33 ± 3. 13), 3 (4. 79 ± 3. 43) and 5 (3. 86 ± 4. 60); between groups 1 (12. 88 ± 6. 43) and 4 (9. 67 ± 3. 08), and among groups 2, 3 and 4. However, groups 1 and 4 were significantly different from groups 2, 3 and 5.

40|$|The Bronze equestrian {{statue of}} Bartolomeo Colleoni by Andrea del Verrocchio, cast between 1466 and 1490 by Alessandro Leopardi in Venice, is {{composed}} of several parts connected together availing of casts-on. The statue was analysed using a transportable EDXRF system in situ during {{the restoration of the}} monument, applied to 21 chosen areas, with the aim of characterising the alloys that compose the different parts of the statue. The areas to be measured were chosen so as to include every sub-section of the statue, therefore every part underwent at least one quantitative analysis. The metal used in the casts-on is a quaternary copper, tin, lead, zinc alloy, {{while the rest of the}} sculpture does not contain any trace of zinc, composed as it is of the classic ternary (copper, tin, lead) bronze alloy. Considering the amount of metal required to make the casts-on, the shapes into which they were moulded and, therefore, the economic cost of every single <b>cast-on,</b> the artist’s intention to exploit the strength of the copper alloys containing zinc to obtain sufficiently strong soldering between pairs of different casts is clear.

40|$|Background. The {{clinical}} {{application of}} prosthetic components obtained by different manufacturing processes lacks technological foundation: the dimensional tolerance of individual parts and their assembly accuracy are not known. The rotational misfit of the hexagonal connection {{is critical in}} single tooth implant restorations, but no standard control procedures are available for its evaluation. Purpose. The research aimed at proposing a new protocol for the dimensional assessment of implant-abutment connections, based on non-contact measurement and statistical data processing. The procedure was applied to machined- and <b>cast-on</b> abutments, as well of the matching implants. Materials and Methods. Three groups of 5 abutments each were studied: machined titanium abutments, premachined calcinable abutments before casting procedures and the same specimens after casting. A group of 5 corresponding implants was considered as well. Twice the apothem was measured on each hexagon through an optical measuring microscope. The data were processed to obtain the international tolerance (IT) grade. The rotational misfit was then calculated using the apothems of the external and the internal hexagon. Results. All the components were classified between IT 8 and IT 9 and the maximum rotational misfit was around 3 - 4 ° for all the assemblies, inferior to the critical limits for the screw joint stability. Conclusion. An original measuring protocol was developed, independent of parts assembly and based on international tolerances. An objective dimensional characterization of prosthetic components and assemblies has been achieved, which {{is the basis for}} their reliability in clinical applications...|$|E
