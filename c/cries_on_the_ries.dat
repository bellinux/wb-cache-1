50|$|In {{recent years}} <b>the</b> <b>Ries</b> Railway has been {{interrupted}} repeatedly by landslides at different points.

In the same period, from February 2003 to July 2003, a large slip occurred on a flood embankment between Ebermergen and Donauwörth, bringin traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line almost to a complete halt. These circumstances prompted considerations of closing the track. Before the blocking the route, many trains ran continuously from the Rems Railway to Donauwörth.
