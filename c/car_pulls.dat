5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets up {{from his}} chair and starts leaving out the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then turns around and sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the elevator doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two set out to find out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A <b>car</b> <b>pulls</b> up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the blind}} lady points Manni towards the {{homeless}} {{man with his}} money, who passes on the cyclist's bike. Manni chases him with a gun, inadvertently causing a head-on collision between the white BMW, Mr. Meier, {{and the man who}} stole Lola's moped. Mr. Meier, Lola's dad and the thief apparently die in the crash. Manni manages to retrieve his money, trading it for his gun. Lola reaches the supermarket, but cannot find Manni. She shouts his name but there is no response. A little farther away, a <b>car</b> <b>pulls</b> up with Manni and Ronnie inside, who shake hands. Manni, no longer in need of the 100,000 marks, asks Lola what is in the bag she is carrying, only for the film to end in a freeze-frame on Lola's reaction.|$|E
500|$|After raising $40,000 in donations, volunteers {{refurbished}} car 300 and repainted it {{from the}} yellow paint scheme it had worn in Portland (inherited from San Antonio) to a new red-and-green livery, with [...] "Astoria Riverfront Trolley" [...] lettered along the side, above the windows.

2500|$|Furthermore, {{two other}} rule {{changes have been}} implemented. Since 2000, with one lap to go before going back to green, the pace <b>car</b> <b>pulls</b> off the track in turn one rather than in turn four. The current leader of the race is then {{assigned}} the task of pacing the field back to the green flag. After much consideration, this rule was added to prevent a situation {{much like the one}} that happened in the 1995 Indianapolis 500, when Scott Goodyear passed the pace car going back to green. In 2002, another rule was added. With one lap to go before the green, the pace car waves by all cars (if there are any) between the pace car and the actual leader of the race. This allows for the leader to control the restart without lapped cars being in front of him. It also creates a strategy for cars to gain laps back, loosely resembling the [...] "Lucky dog" [...] rule. However, the cars who get waved around are not allowed to pit until the green flag restarts the race (so they do not get the advantage of getting their lap back AND a free pit stop).|$|E
2500|$|Victoria Louise [...] "Vicki" [...] Fowler is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Emma Herry from the character's birth in 1986 to 1988, Samantha Leigh Martin from 1988 to 1995, and Scarlett Alice Johnson from 2003 to 2004. She {{is the daughter}} of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). The character is born in the serial, conceived in a controversial storyline about teenage pregnancy. Exploiting a whodunnit angle, {{at the time of the}} first showing, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 in episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Early suspects were Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), but then four possible suspects are seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts. As Michelle waits by their rendezvous point, a <b>car</b> <b>pulls</b> up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leap out of a car to give it all away: Den Watts is the father of Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream.|$|E
