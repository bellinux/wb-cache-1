40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the coordination of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in humanitarian relief, we propose a theoretical framework {{for the emergence of}} <b>collaborative</b> <b>projects</b> and corresponding coalitions. In this framework, NGOs are represented as autonomous and heterogeneous agents who are embedded in social networks. They interact with each other in various ways, deliberatively identify <b>collaborative</b> <b>projects</b> they would like to work on, and form coalitions for <b>collaborative</b> <b>projects.</b> The impacts of several social network factors are also incorporated into the coordination framework. ...|$|R

5|$|Kilburn {{anticipated}} {{a return}} to Malvern but Williams persuaded him to stay {{to work on the}} university's <b>collaborative</b> <b>project</b> developing the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial computer. Max Newman withdrew from the project, believing that the development of computers required engineers and not mathematicians at this point, but Williams preferred to return to electrotechnics, leaving Kilburn in charge. He was assisted by Alan Turing, who arrived at Manchester in 1948. The Mark I incorporated innovations such as index registers, and combined CRTs with magnetic drum storage. Nine Mark I computers were sold by between 1951 and 1957.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} modular space station called Freedom as a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a <b>collaborative</b> <b>project.</b> In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E
