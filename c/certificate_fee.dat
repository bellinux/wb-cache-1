5000|$|Due to {{the complex}} history of the Macanese people, a group of mixed-race people with Chinese and Portuguese ancestry and their {{residential}} ties with Macau, the DSI allows a special naturalization process known as [...] "selection of Chinese nationality". The applicant must prove {{he or she has}} Chinese ancestry in addition to Portuguese ancestry. Renunciation of Portuguese nationality, however, is not required, so the applicant will usually have dual nationality after the selection. The cost is MOP 200 for main applicant and MOP 100 for each additional family member, plus a <b>certificate</b> <b>fee</b> of MOP 150 per person.|$|E
5000|$|The Hong Kong Immigration Department and the DSI of Macau allow {{persons who}} have {{acquired}} additional citizenship or nationalities other than their Chinese nationality to make a [...] "declaration of change of nationality" [...] should they wish to terminate their Chinese nationality and {{be recognized as a}} foreign citizen pursuant to Article 9. The cost is cheaper than renunciation under Article 10, but this route is only available for people who have already (legally) lost their Chinese nationality under Article 9. Therefore, notable exceptions to the eligibility of declaration would be persons with dual BN(O) or status and Chinese nationality in Hong Kong (because the acquisition of BN(O) does not involve being [...] "settled" [...] in another country), and those who wish to naturalize in a country which requires the renunciation of foreign nationalities prior to approval (e.g. Japan) (because such persons have not yet acquired foreign nationality). In the latter case, the person must make a renunciation rather than a declaration. The cost for the declaration is HK$145 in Hong Kong and, in Macau, a processing fee of MOP 200 for the main applicant and MOP 100 per additional family member, plus a <b>certificate</b> <b>fee</b> of MOP 150.|$|E
40|$|Based on our {{discussion}} following my recent e-mail, I request that Registry of Radioactive Sealed Sources and Devices registration certificate NR- 0162 -D- 101 -S (fixed moisture density gauge/X-Z gamma positioner) remain active since {{ownership of the}} device remains with the U. S. EPA, although no longer with our facility or program. It is my understanding that the Robert S. Kerr Environmental Research Center {{is responsible for the}} payment of the <b>certificate</b> <b>fee</b> until ownership of the registration certificate is transferred to EPA Region 8, who now owns the device, or the device is sold to an outside entity, such as the Colorado School of Mines, that has an active radioactive materials license and can legally own and use the device. Please advise if this is not the present situation with this certificate. Thank you again for your help in determining the ownership, activity and responsibility of this registration certificate and for working with us to get it inactivated. Maybe we can make arrangements to have it transferred to its rightful owners...|$|E

40|$|In an experiment, we {{test the}} impact of quality {{certificates}} on donations to a charity. When presented with a quality certificate, participants chose higher donations by approximately 10 %. This effect is significant for donations out of prize money and actual own money donations, and not significant but positive for own money intended donations. Moreover, this effect persists over time. We also find a nega-tive but not significant effect of information about <b>certificate</b> <b>fees.</b> We find that the certificate increases trust in the nonprofit organization.

40|$|Equity {{policies}} enable {{individuals from}} low SES backgrounds to enter University, yet do not facilitate their engagement {{as members of}} groups. These selected individuals enter a broader cohort, where they are expected (with support) to meet the same graduate attributes as everyone else. Rather than the diverse experiences of such students being seen as strengths to be built on, the focus tends {{to be placed on}} remedying their learning disadvantage. Thus, university poses as a neutral pathway to jobs and status, and effectively, a pathway out of low SES communities, rather than a gateway into greater community involvement. This paper presents a case study of a graduate <b>certificate</b> which offered <b>fee</b> scholarships to a group of overseas skilled refugees and migrants. In contrast to usual equity experiences, these students progressed as a cohort, were often the majority group in class, bent the curriculum to their own needs and applied the learning to their community involvements. Such engagement constituted a rich adult learning experience, which challenged conventional teaching-learning processes and curriculum, and raised questions about academic standards. Examining learnings from this project, the paper asks how Schools of Social Work can draw on their professional values to enhance equity processes within the academy.
