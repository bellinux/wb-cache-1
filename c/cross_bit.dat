40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} determining the paths of multiple, unpredictable moving bodies in a cluttered environment using weak detection sensors that provide simple crossing information. Each sensor is a beam that, when broken, provides {{the direction of the}} <b>crossing</b> (one <b>bit)</b> and nothing else. Using a simple network of beams, the individual paths are separated and reconstructed as well as possible, up to combinatorial information about the route taken. In this setup, simple filtering algorithms are introduced, and a low-cost hardware implementation that demonstrates the practicality of the approach is shown. The results may apply in settings such as verification of multirobot system execution, surveillance and security, and unobtrusive behavioral monitoring for wildlife and the elderly. I...|$|R

Mud, also called drilling fluid, refers to fluids that contain a significant proportion of suspended solids in aqueous solution. When the drill <b>bit</b> <b>crosses</b> a permeable fracture zone, the well records a partial decrease in the outflow or even a total loss of mud circulation. Variations in the mud temperature, recorded in degrees Celsius, suggest mixing between hot geothermal fluid and cold drilling mud. As is the case for a natural outflow, the permeable fractures bearing hot fluid could induce drastic variations in the drilling mud temperature.|$|R

However, gametes are not commonly considered to have personhood, perhaps because most of them are never involved in fertilization.|$|R

The point that was made throughout my earlier paper is that economic theory sacrifices far too much relevance in its pursuit of ever-greater rigour. Given the challenges in agricultural sector in Africa, we need to see much stronger efforts to integrate the building of theory in economics with the study of reality.

30|$|The {{following}} paper evaluates a watermark algorithm {{designed for}} digital images {{by using a}} perceptive mask and a normalization process, thus preventing human eye detection, as well as ensuring its robustness against common processing and geometric attacks. The Hermite transform is employed because it allows a perfect reconstruction of the image, while incorporating human visual system properties; moreover, {{it is based on}} the Gaussian functions derivates. The applied watermark represents information of the digital image proprietor. The extraction process is blind, because it does not require the original image. The following techniques were utilized in the evaluation of the algorithm: peak signal-to-noise ratio, the structural similarity index average, the normalized <b>crossed</b> correlation, and <b>bit</b> error rate. Several watermark extraction tests were performed, with against geometric and common processing attacks. It allowed us to identify how many bits in the watermark can be modified for its adequate extraction.|$|R

The H 4 IRRAD experimental test area has been specifically designed to reproduce the radiation field that is present within the LHC tunnel and shielded areas. It has been used to test our custom SRAM based monitors. The monitors have been exposed to a maximum dose and high energy hadron fluence of about 76 Gy and 1. 3 × 10 ^ 11 cm^- 2 respectively.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} jitter on the GPS and Galileo navigation signals. Jitter effects have usually been modelled as additive noise, based on a sinusoidal input signal, and limits the achievable Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Analysis shows that psec-level jitter specifications are {{required in order to}} keep jitter noise well below the thermal noise for software radio satellite navigation receivers. However, analysis of a BPSK system shows that large errors occur if the jittered sample <b>crosses</b> a data <b>bit</b> boundary. Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation achieves greater bandwidth efficiency than BPSK. The new GPS L 5 signal is QPSK modulated. The Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) spreading modulation has recently been recommended by GPS-GalileoWorking group on Interoperability and Compatibility for adoption by Europe's Galileo program for its Open Service (OS) signal at the L 1 frequency and by the United Sates for its modernized GPS L 1 Civil (L 1 C) signal.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the sampling and jitter specifications and considerations for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) software receivers. Software Radio (SWR) technologies {{are being used}} in the implementation of communication receivers in general and GNSS receivers in particular. With the advent of new GPS signals, and a range of new Galileo and GLONASS signals soon becoming available, GNSS is an application where SWR and software-defined radio (SDR) are likely to have an impact. The sampling process is critical for SWR receivers where it occurs as close to the antenna as possible. One way to achieve this is by BandPass Sampling (BPS), which is an undersampling technique that exploits aliasing to perform downconversion. In this thesis, the allowable sampling frequencies are calculated and analyzed for the multiple frequency BPS software radio GNSS receivers. The SNR degradation due to jitter is calculated and the required jitter standard deviation allowable for wach GNSS band of interest is evaluated and a basic jitter budget is calculated that could assist in the design of multiple frequency SWR GNSS receivers. Analysis shows that psec-level jitter specifications are required in order to keep jitter noise well below the thermal noise for software radio satellite navigation receivers. However, analysis of a BPSK system shows that large errors occur if the jittered sample <b>crosses</b> a data <b>bit</b> boundary. However, the signal processing techniques required to process the BOC modulation are much more challenging than those for traditional BPSK. BOC and AltBOC have more transitions per chip of spreading code and hence jitter creates greater SNR degradation. This work derives expressions for noise due to jitter taking into account the transition probability in QPSK, BOC, AltBOC systems. Both simulations and analysis are used to give a better understanding of jitter effects on Software Radio GNSS receivers...|$|R
