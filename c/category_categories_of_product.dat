Diponegoro University. The first Advisor Drs. M. Hermintoyo, M. Pd. The Second Advisor Nur Hastuti, S. S., M. Hum. Keywords : metaphor, song lyric, popular song, semiotic, kode budaya. Metaphor {{is a word}} {{or phrase}} did not use in {{denotation}} meaning but as an image bassed on the feeling or a comparison. Hatsune Miku is one of Vocaloid’s virtual singer character. Vocaloid is a singer synthesizer program developed by Yamaha Corporation. Crypton Future Media developed Hatsune Miku using Yamaha’s voice synthesis technology. The purpose {{of this research is}} to analyze the metaphoric words related to cultural code of Hatsune Miku’s song lyrics. The methods used in this research are library research and semiotic method. The song lyrics used in this research in from one of Hatsune Miku’salbum titled HatsuneMiku 5 th Birthday Best impacts (初音ミク 5 thバースデーベスト impacts). 	The result of this research show that metaphor about ecosystem were divided in 9 <b>categories,</b> <b>category</b> <b>of</b> being, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> cosmos, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> energy, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> substance, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> terrestrial, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> object,category <b>of</b> living, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> animate, and <b>category</b> <b>of</b> human. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{notions of}} {{retraction}} and injectivity have been {{useful in the}} study <b>of</b> many <b>categories</b> (<b>category</b> <b>of</b> modules over a ring, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> posets, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> metric spaces over an Heyting albegra [...] .). In this article the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> Σ-transition algebras is considered, and in this frame, answers are given to the key questions related to these notions. For instance it is shown:—how to construct all the retraction types of a given Σ-transition algebra. —that the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> Σ-transition algebras has enough injective objects and an injective cogenerator. —that every Σ-transition algebras has an injective envelope. These allow to obtain results concerning the structure and the decomposition of a Σ-transition algebra...|$|R
