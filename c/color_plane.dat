5000|$|The zippering {{artifact}} {{is another}} {{side effect of}} CFA demosaicing, which also occurs primarily along edges, {{is known as the}} zipper effect. Simply put, zippering is another name for edge blurring that occurs in an on/off pattern along an edge. This effect occurs when the demosaicing algorithm averages pixel values over an edge, especially in the red and blue planes, resulting in its characteristic blur. As mentioned before, the best methods for preventing this effect are the various algorithms which interpolate along, rather than across image edges. Pattern recognition interpolation, adaptive <b>color</b> <b>plane</b> interpolation, and directionally weighted interpolation all attempt to prevent zippering by interpolating along edges detected in the image.|$|E

50|$|These {{algorithms}} {{are examples}} of multivariate interpolation on a uniform grid, using relatively straightforward mathematical operations on nearby instances of the same color component. The simplest method is nearest-neighbor interpolation which simply copies an adjacent pixel of the same color channel. It is unsuitable for any application where quality matters, but can be useful for generating previews given limited computational resources. Another simple method is bilinear interpolation, whereby the red value of a non-red pixel is computed as {{the average of the}} two or four adjacent red pixels, and similarly for blue and green. More complex methods that interpolate independently within each <b>color</b> <b>plane</b> include bicubic interpolation, spline interpolation, and Lanczos resampling.|$|E
40|$|Unique image {{processing}} challenges {{are produced by}} the Fluid Lens Camera System. Over traditional glass lens systems, better miniaturization potential and fixed length lens while zooming are unique abilities offered by the fluid lens. Non-uniform blurring for each <b>color</b> <b>plane</b> of the image is also caused by the fluid in the lens. A sharp green <b>color</b> <b>plane</b> and blurred blue and red color planes are also produced by this fluid. For natural and medical images, the edges in the green and blue color planes are similar. In this work, the sharpness of the blurred color planes is improved by sharing edge information between color planes. Avoiding shading artifacts while improving edge quality {{is the goal of}} this work. Several algorithms are discussed: a wavelet-based algorithm, a contourlet- based algorithm, a Support Vector Regression algorithm, and an Adaboost classification algorithm. In each algorithm, the strengths of the previous algorithm are built upon in order to improve results. A major advantage of these methods is that shading and edge information is combined without using a complicated point spread function.

40|$|Abstract—The novel {{field of}} fluid lens cameras {{introduces}} unique image processing challenges. Intended for surgical applica-tions, these fluid optics systems {{have a number}} of advantages over traditional glass lens systems. These advantages include improved miniaturization and no moving parts while zooming. However, the liquid medium creates two forms of image degradation: image distortion, which warps the image such that straight lines appear curved, and nonuniform color blur, which degrades the image such that certain color planes appear sharper than others. We propose the use of image processing techniques to reduce these degradations. To deal with image warping, we employ a conven-tional method that models the warping process as a degree-six polynomial in order to invert the effect. For image blur, we pro-pose an adapted perfect reconstruction filter bank that uses high frequency sub-bands of sharp color planes to improve blurred color planes. The algorithm adjusts the number of levels in the decomposition and alters a prefilter based on crude knowledge of the blurring channel characteristics.

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{features a}} new method for skin color segmentation using a 2 D {{plane in the}} RGB color space. The RGB color values of the input color image {{do not need to}} be converted into HSI or YIQ color coordinates that have popularly been used for color segmentation. We have observed an important fact that skin colors in the RGB color space are approximately distributed in a linear fashion. Based on this fact, we have applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) techniques to RGB values of skin colors from a set of training images. We detect skin regions by the lookup of skin color histogram computed based on a 2 D <b>color</b> <b>plane</b> of which two axes correspond to two directions with smallest spread of skin colors. The proposed 2 D <b>color</b> <b>plane</b> for color histogram lookup has an advantage over HS or IQ color planes. By using this plane, the problem of color constancy is much relieved. A learned color histogram contains most skin colors detected in the input images and at the same time, the distribution of skin colors in the plane is invariant compared to those in the HS or IQ planes. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed method by comparing with the performance of color histogram lookup methods based on HS or IQ <b>color</b> <b>plane.</b> The experimental results show that the performance of our method is robust to illumination changes. ...|$|E

Correlations between the different color planes can be exploited for the aim of data compression. For this purpose {{the similarities between the}} fractal transform parameters of one block location but different color planes are regarded in a blockwise manner. Starting-point is the fractal code for one block in the dominant <b>color</b> <b>plane</b> which serves as prediction for the code of the corresponding block in the other planes. Emerging from this prediction the depending codes can be derived by a successive refinement strategy.

40|$|Abstract—Due to {{the novel}} fluid optics, unique image {{processing}} challenges are presented by the fluidic lens camera system. De-veloped for surgical applications, unique properties, such as no moving parts while zooming and better miniaturization than tra-ditional glass optics, are advantages of the fluid lens. Despite these abilities, sharp color planes and blurred color planes are created by the nonuniform reaction of the liquid lens to different color wavelengths. Severe axial color aberrations are caused by this re-action. In order to deblur color images without estimating a point spread function, a contourlet filter bank system is proposed. Infor-mation from sharp color planes is used by this multiband deblur-ring method to improve blurred color planes. Compared to tra-ditional Lucy-Richardson and Wiener deconvolution algorithms, significantly improved sharpness and reduced ghosting artifacts are produced by a previous wavelet-based method. Directional fil-tering {{is used by the}} proposed contourlet-based system to adjust to the contours of the image. An image is produced by the pro-posed method which has a similar level of sharpness to the previous wavelet-based method and has fewer ghosting artifacts. Conditions for when this algorithm will reduce the mean squared error are an-alyzed. While improving the blue <b>color</b> <b>plane</b> by using information from the green <b>color</b> <b>plane</b> is the primary focus of this paper, these methods could be adjusted to improve the red <b>color</b> <b>plane.</b> Many multiband systems such as global mapping, infrared imaging, and computer assisted surgery are natural extensions of this work. This information sharing algorithm is beneficial to any image set with high edge correlation. Improved results in the areas of deblurring, noise reduction, and resolution enhancement can be produced by the proposed algorithm.
