40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the nature and}} consequences of China's rise {{to the center of}} world economic affairs through manufacturing-led development. Our historical analysis shows that China is still well short of the point in its developmental process where its growth might be reasonably expected to slow, or the energy, resource and carbon intensity of growth to recede. The study argues that the current trajectory of industrialization will have to be altered when China becomes more actively engaged in dealing with structural issues at home and abroad against the background of the unwinding of global imbalances. One profitable strategy that China might employ would be to approximate the incredibly fruitful mass-market integration efforts of the USA that eventually elevated it to its position of global primacy. The cyclical re-emergence of excess capacity in Chinese heavy industry, serious questions about the medium term ability of other major regions to accommodate further large gains in <b>Chinese</b> <b>market</b> <b>share,</b> and the stark conflict between the contemporary style of industrial development and the health of the biosphere indicate strongly that {{now is the time to}} catalyze the required adjustment and reform processes that will underpin sustainable long-run prosperity.

Moreover, the results of this study will help to launch an actual new brand in the business world. Design: A two (influence level: high versus low) by two (cost- efficiency level: high versus low) experimental design was used. A logistical method was implemented in the survey in order to divide participants into two different groups, based upon dress style. The {{purpose of this}} is to analyze their differences more closely. We set the Chinese market as the control group, allowing us to compare it to the U. S. market. Findings: The analysis confirmed that when the influence is high, cost-efficiency has a positive impact on purchase intention in the U. S. market. The Lolita consumers in both the U. S. market and the <b>Chinese</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> the same group characteristics and notions in some aspects. Research Limitation: Future research needs to create a data collecting survey with more questions and an experimental design with more variables. This would aid in obtaining a more accurate result. Further, the participants in future studies should all be Lolita consumers, as in this research, and the focus could extend to other geographically segmented markets. Practical Implication: The following study has several managerial implications for all new brand managers and startups. First, reducing the cost will enhance cost-efficiency for your brand. Second, reconsider your brand 2 ̆ 7 s positioning and segment the market your trying to enter into. It 2 ̆ 7 s important to know your consumers and then position your business accordingly. Finally, increase your brand 2 ̆ 7 s influence/gain awareness by advertising, having events, etc. Social Implication: This study is very original because it is the first ever recorded academic research on the Lolita market, and all participants are real Lolita consumers, making the research a genuine representation of the Lolita market...|$|E

IT is like a nerve system for supply chain management (SCM). SCM clearly depends upon integrated information systems (IS) for sharing data on the various activities along the supply chain. This thesis focuses on analyzing the application of information technology in the supply chain management in the apparel industry. In total, four cases are studied with an emphasis on their application of IT in SCM. The Gunasekaran model is used to evaluate each case regarding application of IT in SCM.

40|$|The {{world has}} changed since the (re) {{entering}} of China into global markets. In recent decades China became an important economic player thanks to a spectacular and steady export-led growth. As the so-called 'factory of the world' the Chinese economy plays in particular {{a major role in}} the world production of manufactured goods. Thanks to a successful combination of comparative advantages in labour-intensive goods, strategic access to raw materials and a supportive trade and industrial policy, China has been able to expand its market share in manufacturing exports in many countries in the world. The rise of China led to fears in advanced industrialized economies that their manufacturing sector might have no future anymore. The intention of this paper is twofold. First, it will study the impact of the rise of China, measured in terms of the growth of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> in the imports by individual OECD countries, on the export market share of other OECD countries within the OECD. Hence our first purpose is to proof that the Chinese export expansion reduces the relative performance of OECD countries in manufacturing. Although this may seem to be common sense, it has never been formally proved before, at least not in an appropriate empirical framework. Secondly, we look for alternative strategies in order to maintain a nation's export market share in foreign countries, even if it has to cope with increased Chinese competition. The alternatives we study in this paper are quality and variety of traded goods. Countries may keep their market share by exporting a larger variety of manufacturing goods, or alternatively they may export goods of higher quality, relative to the other OECD countries. As it will turn out that quality plays an important role, we will mainly focus on the relationship between export market share dynamics and the quality of traded goods. By studying variety and quality of international trade the second purpose of this paper fits into a recently increasing literature dealing with the characteristics of traded goods at very disaggregated levels. We will not only briefly summarize this literature, but also extend the existing methodology to measure the extent and impact of quality and variety of trade. In particular we will study the impact of variety and quality in bilateral exports within the OECD on the export market share of OECD countries. This paper is closely related to Schott (2008) who shows that although Chinese exports increase tremendously, the relative quality of Chinese goods is still low. By pursuing both purposes we try to answer the question raised in the title of this paper, i. e. whether quality (and variety) is compensating for the effects of increasing Chinese export competition. The main conclusions of this paper are clear. First, Chinese competition is indeed a threat to the export market share of OECD countries in other OECD markets. Secondly, producing goods of higher quality has an opposite effect, hence a positive effect, on the export market share. Consequently, quality improvement is an appropriate policy in order to cope with the challenges put forward by the Chinese dragon. status: publishe...|$|E

Second, price limits delay efficient price discovery for upward price movements, but not for downward price movements.

Our results indicate that, unlike the Shenzhen and Shanghai A-share markets, the B-share, H-share and red chip markets do not exhibit significant asymmetric volatility (leverage effect). Furthermore, return volatility in the A-share markets is relatively more volatile than the others before 1997 and becomes more stable afterward.
