40|$|Recent work {{by several}} groups has {{established}} {{the properties of}} the dwarf satellites to M 31. We reexamine the reported kinematics of this group employing a fresh technique we have developed previously. By calculating the distribution of a <b>chi</b> <b>statistic</b> (which we define in the paper) for the M 31 system, we conclude that the total mass (disk plus halo) of the primary is unlikely to be as great as that of our own Milky Way. In fact the chi distribution for M 31 indicates that, like NGC 3992, it does not have a massive halo. In contrast, the analysis of the satellites of NGC 1961 and NGC 5084 provides strong evidence for massive halos surrounding both spiral galaxies.

40|$|The {{filtering}} feature-selection {{algorithm is}} a kind of important approach to dimensionality reduction in the field of the text categorization. Most of filtering feature-selection algorithms evaluate the significance of a feature for category based on balanced dataset and do not consider the imbalance factor of dataset. In this paper, a new scheme was proposed, which can weaken the adverse effect caused by the imbalance factor in the corpus. We evaluated the improved versions of nine well-known feature-selection methods (Information Gain, <b>Chi</b> <b>statistic,</b> Document Frequency, Orthogonal Centroid Feature Selection, DIA association factor, Comprehensive Measurement Feature Selection, Deviation from Poisson Feature Selection, improved Gini index, and Mutual Information) using naïve Bayes and support vector machines on three benchmark document collections (20 -Newsgroups, Reuters- 21578, and WebKB).

40|$|Abstract—Audio content {{classification}} is {{an interesting}} and significant issue. Audio classification technique has two basic parts: audio feature extraction and classifier. In general the audio content classification method is firstly to identify the original audio into text, then use the identified text to classify. But the text recognition rate is not high, some words that good for classification are identified by mistake causing that the classification effect is not ideal. In order to solve these problems above, this paper proposes a new effective audio classification method based on two-step strategy. In the first step the features are extracted by using the improved mutual information and classified with Naïve Bayes classifier. After classification of the first step, an unreliable area is determined, and samples with features in this area go on to be classified with the second step. In the second step, textual features extracted with <b>CHI</b> <b>statistic</b> method are used to build a text feature space model. Then audio features containing MFCC and frame energy are combined together with the text features {{to build a new}} feature vector space model. Finally, the new feature vector space model is classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experiments show that the two-step strategy classification method for audio classification achieves great classification performance with the accuracy rate of 97. 2 %...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Tuberculosis (TB) has {{remained}} {{one of the}} major public health problems in Zimbabwe with an estimated incidence rate of 552 per 100, 000 persons in 2013. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the trends in acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum-smear positive (SSP) TB overall and within subpopulations for the period during 2008 – 2011 in Zimbabwe. Results of this study will contribute towards the evaluation and implementation of targeted TB control interventions. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used to analyze 40, 110 SSP TB patient records routinely collected during 2008 – 2011. Incidence trends of SSP TB were described by province, sex, and age group. A Mantel–Haenszel <b>Chi</b> <b>Statistic</b> was calculated to compare each provincial SSP TB notification rate to the national SSP TB notification rate. Results SSP TB notification rates were higher in the two main urban provinces, the western provinces and Manicaland. The 25 – 44  year age group accounted for the largest proportion of notified SSP TB. However, the 55 – 64  year and 65 + age groups had SSP TB notification rates in 2011 higher than the 2008 value. Finally, the average SSP TB notification rate in males was 23  % higher than in females. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that TB control has successfully decreased the notification rate of SSP TB in Zimbabwe during 2008 – 2011. However, the disproportionate distribution of SSP TB among different regions and subpopulations of the country highlights the need for more targeted interventions to accelerate the decline of TB in Zimbabwe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} whether medial tenderness is {{a predictor}} of deep deltoid ligament incompetence in supination-external rotation ankle fractures. DESIGN: All Weber B lateral malleolar fractures with normal medial clear space over a 9 month period were prospectively included in the study. Fracture patterns not consistent with a supination-external rotation mechanism were excluded. SETTING: High-volume tertiary care referral center and Level I trauma center. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five skeletally mature patients with a Weber B lateral malleolar fracture and normal medial clear space presenting to our institution were included. INTERVENTION: All study patients had ankle anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise radiographs. Each patient was seen and evaluated by an orthopedic specialist and the mechanism of injury was recorded. Each patient was assessed for tenderness to palpation {{in the region of}} the deltoid ligament and then had an external rotation stress mortise radiograph. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correlating medial tenderness with deep deltoid competence as measured by stress radiographs. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (23. 6 %) were tender medially and had a positive external rotation stress radiograph. Thirteen patients (23. 6 %) were tender medially and had a negative external rotation stress radiograph. Nineteen patients (34. 5 %) were nontender medially and had a negative external rotation stress radiograph. Ten patients (18. 2 %) were nontender medially and had a positive external rotation stress radiograph. We calculated a <b>chi</b> <b>statistic</b> of 2. 37 as well as the associated P value of 0. 12. Medial tenderness as a measure of deep deltoid ligament incompetence had a sensitivity of 57 %, a specificity of 59 %, a positive predictive value of 50 %, a negative predictive value of 66 %, and an accuracy of 42 %. CONCLUSION: There was no statistical significance between the presence of medial tenderness and deep deltoid ligament incompetence. There is a 25 % chance of the fracture in question with medial tenderness having a positive external rotation stress and a 25 % chance the fracture with no medial tenderness having a positive stress test. Medial tenderness in a Weber B lateral ankle fracture with a normal clear space on standard plain radiographs does not ensure the presence of a positive external rotation stress test...|$|E

In order to test whether the increase of the Chi square was significant, thus rejecting the hypothesis of factor loadings invariance, the baseline Chi square was subtracted from the factor loadings invariance model Chi square, and the same was done with their degrees of freedom. The distribution of the resulting value is a Chi square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference of the degrees of freedom of the two models. The results of this computation showed that the increase of the <b>Chi</b> square <b>statistic</b> was not significant (ΔChi square =  6.21; df =  7; p > . 05), meaning that the Chinese group and the Italian group shared the same factor structure measured on the same scale.|$|R

As for RMSEA, a model is deemed to be a ‘good fit’ if a value is less than 0.05; a reasonable range for RMSEA values is between 0.05 and 0.08; and RMSEA value larger than 0.1 indicates a poor fit. Table  4 shows the GOF for the SEM model, measured by χ 2, χ 2 /DF, GFI, CFI, and RMSEA. The number of parameters estimated in this model is 43, and the degrees of freedom is 93.
