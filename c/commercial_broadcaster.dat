50|$|Within public {{broadcasting}} {{there are two}} different views regarding commercial activity. One is that {{public broadcasting}} is incompatible with commercial objectives.

25|$|The {{idea for}} a national, {{indigenous}} television service was initially conceived by the National Indigenous Radio Service (the peak Indigenous radio group), which initially lobbied the government to start a new, nationwide indigenous television network. Although no major political party championed this cause, <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcaster</b> Imparja Television stated in 2004 that it would run such a network, at least within its own licence area. In 2005 the federal Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts considered funding such a station, and conducted a review process.|$|E
50|$|However, {{those who}} defend the BBC {{suggest that the}} BBC needs to provide new {{services}} and entertainment, to remain relevant in the digital age.Furthermore, there are also questions about the public service commitments of the <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters.</b> All <b>commercial</b> channels that broadcast solely on digital platforms do not have public service requirements imposed. After digital switchover many of these channels {{will have the same}} coverage as the analogue <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters.</b> This has raised the question of how the analogue <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters,</b> with their costly public service obligations, will compete on a level playing field with such digital channels.|$|R

500|$|Underbelly began airing in New Zealand on TV3 on Sunday at 9:30pm, but {{the network}} put the [...] series on hiatus after three episodes {{because it was}} [...] "not {{performing}} as expected in the time slot". Due to a public outcry, TV3 reversed their decision 48hours later, saying it was [...] "bowing to the pressure of angry fans". TV3 reinstated the series in its old timeslot, but rescheduled it to 11:15pm on Tuesday evenings just weeks later. TV3 senior publicist Nicole Wood said the show had failed to win new viewers in the Sunday slot, {{and even though they}} were [...] "inundated with fans" [...] when they took it off air, it [...] "still didn't rate" [...] on its second showing. The series was brought back to primetime in July 2009, after the sequel series performed well in New Zealand. Beginning with episode 1, the series is currently playing every Thursday at 9:30pm. In April 2008, the Nine Network signed an international distribution deal with Fox International Channels and Portman Film & Television. The series will be broadcast in Scandinavia, Canada, France, the UK, Italy (Rai 4), Balkans, Korea, Pan-Asia, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and Germany. Gyngell said, [...] "to say we are pleased is an understatement– we are delighted that the series will gain international audiences and global recognition". Scottish <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcaster</b> STV have signed up to broadcast the series. Series 3 is now broadcasting after the good reception of the first two series.|$|E
