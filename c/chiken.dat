Turmeric or Curcuma longa (CL) and curcuma xanthorrhiza (CX), {{are commonly used}} by human and known to have active ingredients as antimicrobial. Therefore a research was conducted to evaluate {{the possibility of using}} these plant bioactives to replace antibiotic in poultry feed. The bioactives concentration of the CL and CX powder were measured prior to the feeding trial and then supplemented into standard diets of broiler <b>chikens.</b> The levels tested in this trial were based on the active ingredients that could inhibit growth of bacteria and fungi, i. e., low, medium and high levels of the CL and CX, respectively. The combination of low level of CL + high level of CX and low level CL + medium level of CX were also tested. A diet without feed additives and with antibiotics were used as controls. Each diet was fed from day old to 35 days old, replicated 6 times and each replication consist of 15 birds. Results showed that neither the antibiotic tested nor the turmeric (CL), xanthorrhiza (CX) nor the mixture of CL and CX gave significant (P> 0. 05) improvement on performances (body weight, FCR and mortatlity), nutrient digestibility of feed and carcass yield of broilers. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of partially cooked sweet potato meal {{on the performance of}} broiler <b>chikens.</b> A total of two hundred 8 day-old Anak 2000 strain broiler chicks were used. Partially cooked sweet potato meal (PCSPM) was included at 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 % levels designated as diets; I, II, III, IV and V respectively. The broiler chicks after brooding were randomly allotted to the five dietary tratments, each replicated four times with ten chicks per replicate in a completely ramdomised design. The feeding trial lasted for a period of eight weeks. Feed and water were provided at ad libitum. The results showed that daily weight gain was highly significantly (P< 0. 01) affected by dietary treatments. Such that any increase in the proportion of PCSPM in the starter diet negatively influenced weight gain. Feed conversion ratio was also highly significantly (P< 0. 01) affected, however, FCR increases with increase in the proportion of PCSPM. In the finisher phase, there is significant (P< 0. 0) difference in daily weight gain and feed conversion ratio.

During 54 days, one experimental group A (1200 chicks) receiving water supplemented with an anticoccidial based plant extract (Orego-STEM, 150 ml to 1000 L) was compared with a control group C (1200 chicks) receiving in drinking water a chemical anticoccidial and a batch B (1200 chicks) receiving in drinking water both anticoccidials alternatives. The results for the animal performances have shown a weight difference in favor of Lot A (batch: 3182 g A, Lot B: 2610 g, lot C: 3050) at the end of the rearing period. Feed intake was similar at the 35 th day. Thereafter, lot A showed a significant difference when compared to batch B and C. The cumulative mortality rate recorded at the end of rearing period was similar (5 - 6 %) in three batches. The lesion scores in subjects of lot B at autopsy showed more important clues as those of Lot A and C indicative of clinical and subclinical forms of coccidiosis. Finally, under experimental conditions the addition of Origanum majorana extract in drinking water improved growth performance of broilers.

40|$|Colistin is a decapeptide {{antibiotic}} with {{a narrow}} spectrum of antibacterial activity mainly against Gram-negative microor-ganisms (Ziv, 1981). It is also able to inac-tivate bacterial toxins in vitro (Ziv et al., 1978). That {{is why it is}} commonly used for treatment of diseases caused by sensi-tive Gram-negative bacteria (Roy et al., 1997; van Hattum et al., 2000). Despite the fact that this antibiotic is used for many years, the investigations on its pharmacokinetics in poultry are limited. The data about its oral absorption are con-tradictory. The lack or the very low values of absorption are well known (Roudaut, 1989). However, there are also data show-ing significant blood levels after oral (p. o.) administration in broiler chickens (Lashev and Haritova, 2003), and its ab-sorption is probably influenced by the age. The data from the literature show that the age of chickens can influence the behaviour in the organism of several antibacterial drugs, although the reported results are contradictory (Pashov, 1983; Pashov and Kanelov, 1994; Santos et al., 1996; Lashev, 2000). The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the pharmacokinetics of colistin in chickens at different ages.

Several {{results of the}} experiments were obtained as follows: 1) Isolated virus multiplied, showing cytopathogenic effect in cultures of chikcken kidny and chick embryo cell, However, in puppy kidney and calf kidney cell culture neither multiplicyties and cytopathogenicity of the virus was observed. Inclusion bodies could be found by dyeing samples. 2) On primary isolation, cytopathogenic changes were observed from three days after inoculation. On the subsequent passges, cytopathogenic changes occurred usually within 48 hours, and the after several passages. [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{consuming}} {{large quantities of}} food containing cholesterol has been widely known by the community. However, information concerning cholesterol content {{in a variety of}} foods originating from animal tissue is not very well known. By knowing the cholesterol content of food products, people could restrict or prevent their consumption of high cholesterol food and select foods with a low cholesterol content. The cholesterol content of various foods originating from animal tissues, such as beef, mutton, broiler and domestic chicken meat, entrails (liver, heart, kidney and intestines), skin, tail part and eggs and fish (salt water and fresh water) had been investigated. Cholesterol content was analysed using David Sleighton 2 ̆ 7 s method, which was a modification from Abell et. al. The study revealed that the cholesterol content of every 100 g wet weight meat of domestic <b>chiken</b> was similar to that of broiler chicken, 116 mg and 110 mg respectively. Cholesterol content of broiler <b>chiken</b> entrails was higher than that of domestic chicken. The highest cholesterol content of broiler chicken entrails was liver (529 mg/ 100 g) and the lowest was heart (171 mg/ 100 g), while for domestic chicken, the highest was kidney (336 mg/ 100 g) and the lowest was heart (164 mg/ 100 g). Egg yolk cholesterol content of domestic chicken was 922 mg/ 100 g nearly two folds of broiler chicken 2 ̆ 7 s egg which was 485 mg/ 100 g. The highest content of cholesterol among salt water animals was shrimp (179 mg/ 100 g) and the lowest was pomfret (97 mg/ 100 g), while for fresh water fishes the highest was catfish (94 mg/ 100 g) and the lowest was mujair (52 mg/ 100 g) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of biodiesel from the waste cooking oil {{was carried out}} using the catalyst from egg shell of purebred <b>chiken</b> with ethanol as a solvent. Synthesis of biodiesel was prepared in two steps, esterification and transesterification. Esterification was conducted in mol ratio of ethanol and waste cooking oil of   9 : 1 with H 2 SO 4 as a catalyst. Mol ratio of ethanol and used cooking oil in the transesterification of   12 : 1 with the CaO catalyst of shell eggs. CaO catalyst was yielded by calcinations egg shell of purebred chicken on 1000 for two hours. Calcination product was characterized with XRD to determine of CaO. Result of biodiesel was characterized based on FTIR, H-NMR, dan ASTM (American Standard Testing of Materials). Theoretically,yielded of biodiesel was 58 % and experiment was 36. 779 %...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{waste from}} “agar-agar” (gelation made of seaweed) factory in huge amount and has potency to pollute the {{environment}} {{if it is}} not well managed, obviously has opportunity to be used as compost. The purpose of this research is to find out the characteristic of composting process of agar-agar factory 2 ̆ 7 s waste, and the quality of its compost product,based on 2 (two) treatments i. e. with and without the use chicken manure starter. In general, result of the research showing that there is no significant different between using chicken manure starter and not using <b>chiken</b> manure starter, with understanding that both composting process can be done in aerobic condition (normal) with compost quality according to mature compost criteria. However, specifically the rate of waste decomposition (composting process) of using chicken manure starter looks faster in initial period of decomposition...|$|E
