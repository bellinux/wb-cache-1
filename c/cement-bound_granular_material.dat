40|$|Among the {{techniques}} adopted to stabilise road foundations, {{the use of}} cement bound <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> is worth mentioning: although this technique isn’t properly innovative, it represents a satisfying solution in case a layer with rather contained deformations (produced by heavy vehicular traffic, to which pavement fatigue failure is often associated) is needed. Up to now, the research has been mainly carried on <b>cement-bound</b> <b>granular</b> mixtures containing natural aggregate. On the contrary, in Italy, researches evaluating the characteristics of <b>cement-bound</b> <b>granular</b> aggregate made by recycled material are still at an early stage. More precisely, it can be stated that, despite the common re-utilisation of recycled material in the building sector (this re-use, especially {{in the last few}} years, has aroused growing interest thanks to strong economic reasons and environmental awareness), it is not yet adequately supported by extended scientific knowledge. Furthermore, there is an ever growing need to identify techniques not only to reduce the quantity of milled road material to be conveyed to waste dumps, but also to seek alternative material to be used in road construction, in order {{to take into account the}} reduced availability of non-renewable natural resources. Under these circumstances, the performances of a <b>cement-bound</b> <b>granular</b> mixture containing milled aggregate (from road pavements) have been compared with those of a cement-bound mix containing natural aggregate; for both types of materials the grading curve, dosage of cement, water content and mechanical properties of the mixtures (compressive strength and indirect tensile strength) have been evaluated. The results have been compared with those required in the Specifications and Regulations in force in Italy. The experimental study has demonstrated that the performances of both mixtures are equivalent and the milled aggregate from road pavements can be used as material for road foundations...|$|R

Perceiving <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> {{as a collection}} of particles, the proposed stress-strain model takes into account the discrete nature of <b>granular</b> <b>material.</b> ^ Microstructure of <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> has significant effects on the macro-scale constitutive behavior. To study a heterogeneous <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> with randomly packed particles, a suitable model for characterizing microstructure is essential.

Therefore, the distribution of heterogeneous stress and strain fields in <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is important for predicting the constitutive relationship. In this study, the heterogeneous stress and strain fields of <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is investigated using a method of Distributive tensor, taking into account the interactions between the constituent elements. The method of Distributive tensor for heterogeneous stress and strain fields is evaluated in detail by finite element method for continuum material and by computer simulation for discrete <b>granular</b> <b>material.</b> ^ In this study, a static hypothesis that delineates the distribution of forces at inter-particle contacts in the system of discrete particles is proposed. Based on static hypothesis, the stress-strain relationship of <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> under elastic condition can be derived in closed-form solution for <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> with anisotropic packing structure.

40|$|The {{constitutive}} {{relation of}} granular aggregate is one important aspect in solid mechanics research, since many problems involved are {{nothing like the}} ordinary mechanical problems. Using the energy method, this paper sets up the constitutive model for the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> through the homogenization of <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> with structural characteristics. Several important factors that are influential to the characteristics of such material are fully considered by this model: performance of granular connector, its geometric position, directional distribution, morphology and size of statistical domain and {{the density of the}} connectors. The analysis of the model reveals that the mechanical properties of the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> are not only related to the properties of the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> but also to the arrangement of the granular aggregate, i. e. its fabric characteristics. In addition, the morphology of granules determines how the granules will be connected, which in turn modifies the mechanical performance of connection among granules and hence the performance of the granular aggregate. Besides, the couple stress is an important stress component, which makes classical theory no longer applicable to the <b>granular</b> <b>material.</b> Therefore, the constitutive model for the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is a generic model reflecting the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> performance. </p...|$|R

Properly predicting the behavior of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> remains an area of considerable uncertainty and difficulty. The complexity originates mainly from the particulate nature of the material: that is, a <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> can exist over a range of densities at constant stress and the spectrum of states corresponds {{to a variety of}} responses ranging from flow-type failure to strain hardening. From the microscopic perspective, the overall macroscopic response of a <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is highly dependent on the packing patterns and interactions of the constituent particles which are, further, closely related to particle characteristics such as shape and size. This paper presents several important finings on the relationship between critical states of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> and their grain shapes.

Within this approach, both compression shocks and decompression waves {{are treated as}} (stress, specific volume, particle velocity, mass-based internal energy density, temperature, and mass-based entropy density) propagating discontinuities. In addition, the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is considered as being a continuum (i. e., no mesoscale features like grains, voids, and their agglomerates are considered). However, while the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is treated as a (smeared-out) continuum, it is recognized that it contains a solid constituent (parent matter), and that the structurodynamic properties (i. e., Equations of State (EOS) and Hugoniot relations) of the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> are related to its parent matter. Three characteristic shock loading regimes of <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> are considered and, in each case, an analysis is carried out to elucidate shock attenuation and energy dissipation processes.

40|$|Finite element models, which {{employ the}} Drucker-Prager yield criterion, have been {{developed}} to simulate the static contact statuses between conical silos and <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> in 3 forms: the near contact, the sliding contact and the sticking contact. Contact conditions are established when 2 separated surfaces touch at normal direction while maintaining tangential relative movement. In general physical meaning, the surfaces in contact status have the following characteristics: 1) No penetration between each other; 2) The normal pressure and the tangent friction force may be transferred during contact; 3) Generally the normal pulling force cannot be transferred when surface separation occurs. Due to the symmetric property of conical structures, simplified two-dimensional contacting simulations are carried out in this paper, nonlinear finite element software ANSYS is used and the contacting surfaces between <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> and conical silos are defined with rigid-to-flexible surface-to-surface contact pair. The target surfaces of conical silos are modeled with TARGE 169 element and the contact surfaces of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> are modeled with CONTA 171 element. During finite element analysis, conical silos and <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> are meshed with two-dimensional solid element, PLANE 42. The static contact statuses are investigated with conical silos containing different <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> The silo geometries vary at a dip angle of 20 °, 33. 7 ° and 45 °. Sunflower seeds, corn, coal, rounded gravel and wheat are selected as the <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> Results show that the mechanical properties of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> (including bulk density, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, dilation angle, internal friction angle, cohesion) and silo designs (especially dip angle) have significant effects on the contact statuses at the interface between conical silos and granular materials: 1) For various <b>granular</b> <b>material,</b> 3 contact statuses, i. e. the form of near contact, sliding contact and sticking contact, can be found between <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> and conical silo walls; 2) The contact statuses between conical silos and <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> do not depend on (or not mainly depend on) any mechanical property of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> The contact statuses are a combined effect of all mechanical properties of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> Those <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> with very small dilation angle may have the near contact statuses. Those <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> with higher cohesive force usually present a smaller sticking contact area, and those <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> with higher elastic modulus and bulk density usually present a larger sticking contact area than those with opposite material properties; 3) With the decreasing of conical silo depth, the near contact area disappears, the sliding contact area decreases and the sticking contact area increases. 4) Under the sliding contact status, the friction energy dissipation is mainly due to the relative motion between contact surfaces. Under the sticking contact status, the friction energy dissipation is mainly due to the elastic deformation because of the contact. The greater the sticking contact area, the more difficultly the silo discharges. The greater the sliding contact area, the more seriously the silo internal surfaces could be damaged. Since larger sticking/sliding contact area inevitably causes unloading difficulties or friction damage, contact statuses between <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> and conical silos should be optimized in the silos design in order to boost storage efficiency...|$|R

A number of different methods for installing a Hydra Probe dielectric sensor in a gravelly <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> were assessed and their repeatability compared with sensor installation in a fine-grained material.

40|$|We study vibrated {{granular}} media, investigating each of {{the three}} components of the energy flow: particle-particle dissipation, energy input at the vibrating wall, and particle-wall dissipation. Energy dissipated by interparticle collisions is well estimated by existing theories when the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is dilute, and these theories are extended to include rotational kinetic energy. When the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is dense, the observed particle-particle dissipation rate decreases to as little as 2 / 5 of the theoretical prediction. We observe that the rate of energy input is the weight of the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> times an average vibration velocity times a function of the ratio of particle to vibration velocity. `Particle-wall' dissipation has been neglected in all theories up to now, but can play an important role when the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is dilute.

Properties of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> at this intermediate scale are crucial inputs for macro-scale continuum models. We derive friction laws for <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> at the mesoscale by applying averaging techniques to grain-scale quantities. These laws portray the nature of steady-state frictional strength as a competition between steady-state dilation and grain-scale dissipation rates. The laws also directly link the rate of dilation to the non-steady-state frictional strength. At the macro-scale, we investigate continuum modeling techniques capable of simulating the distinct solid-like, liquid-like, and gas-like behaviors exhibited by <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> in a single computational domain.
