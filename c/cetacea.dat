Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla).

It is the sole extant species of its genus, Physeter, in the family Physeteridae. Two species of the related extant genus Kogia, the pygmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps and the dwarf sperm whale K. simus, are placed either in this family or in the family Kogiidae. In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea (see the separate entry on the sperm whale family).|$|E

His principal researches there included investigations with electrophysiological correlates of hand-eye co-ordination behaviour in the posterior parietal cortex regions of the brain. Other research under Dickinson's supervision has involved the study {{of a wide variety of}} naturalistic behaviours of exotic animal species, both in captivity (largely involving the extensive collection of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland) and wild populations of various primate species in Kenya, Gabon, Bolivia and Costa Rica.

40|$|We {{present the}} first report of community-acquired human infections with marine mammal–associated Brucella spp. and {{describe}} the identification of these strains in two patients with neurobrucellosis and intracerebral granulomas. The identification of these isolates as marine mammal strains was based on omp 2 a sequence and amplification of the region flanking bp 26. Brucellosis, caused by intracellular gram-negative bacteria of the genus Brucella, is endemic {{in many areas of}} the world. Exposure occurs through contact with infected animals, meat, or unpasteurized milk products. Neurobrucellosis is a rare, severe form of systemic infection and has a broad range of clinical syndromes (1 – 3). Central nervous system Brucella granulomas have been infrequently reported in sellar and parasellar sites and in the spinal cord (4 – 6). Although a number of Brucella spp. cause systemic disease in humans, they have species-specific primary reservoirs. The six recognized species of Brucella are primarily associated with terrestrial mammals and rodents. Recently, Brucella has been found to cause infections in marine mammals (7, 8). An expansion of the six current nomen species of Brucella has been proposed to include one (B. maris) or two (B. pinnipediae and B. <b>cetaceae)</b> new nomen species to categorize these strains (7, 8). To date, only one human infection with a marine mammal strain has been reported; this infection occurred in a research laboratory worker after occupational exposure (9).

25|$|Cetacean {{surfacing}} behaviour is a {{group of}} behaviours demonstrated by the <b>Cetacea</b> infraorder when they come to the water's surface to breathe. Time intervals between surfacing can vary depending on the species, surfacing style or the purpose of the dive, and some species have been known to dive for up to 85 minutes at a time when hunting. In addition to respiration, cetaceans have developed and used surface behaviours for many other functions such as display, feeding and communication. All regularly observed members of the order <b>Cetacea,</b> including whales, dolphins and porpoises, show a range of surfacing behaviours. <b>Cetacea</b> is usually split into two suborders, Odontoceti and Mysticeti, based on the presence of teeth or baleen plates in adults respectively. However, when considering behaviour, <b>Cetacea</b> can be split into whales (cetaceans more than 10 m long such as sperm and most baleen whales) and dolphins and porpoises (all Odontocetes less than 10 m long including orca) as many behaviours are correlated with size. Although some behaviours such as spyhopping, logging and lobtailing occur in both groups, others such as bow riding or peduncle throws are exclusive to one or the other. It is these energetic behaviours that humans observe most frequently, which has resulted in a large amount of scientific literature on the subject and a popular tourism industry.|$|E
25|$|Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) {{are common}} around the shorelines. Several species of <b>cetacea</b> {{live in the}} waters around the Faroe Islands.

Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are regular visitors around the islands.|$|E
40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Brucella are {{categorized}} as biothreat agents and pose a hazard for both humans and animals. Current identification methods rely on biochemical tests that may require up to 7 days for results. We sequenced the 16 S rRNA genes of 65 Brucella strains along with 17 related strains likely to present a differential diagnostic challenge. All Brucella 16 S rRNA gene sequences were determined to be identical and were clearly different from the 17 related strains, suggesting that 16 S rRNA gene sequencing is a reliable tool for rapid genus-level identification of Brucella spp. and their differentiation from closely related organisms. Brucella spp., the causative agents of brucellosis, are patho-genic {{to a variety of}} domesticated and wild animals. The genus Brucella is comprised of gram-negative, facultative, intracellu-lar pathogens (1). Phenotypic characteristics, antigenic varia-tion, and prevalence of infection in different animal hosts have resulted in the initial recognition of six species: B. abortus (cattle), B. melitensis (goats/sheep), B. suis (swine), B. canis (dogs), B. ovis (rams), and B. neotomae (desert rats) (13, 27). Recently two Brucella strains from different marine mammals have been reported (7, 11, 22), and the names B. pinnipediae (seal/otter) and B. <b>cetaceae</b> (porpoise/whale) have been pro-posed (12). DNA hybridization analyses indicate a high level of homology among the brucellae, suggesting that the genus Bru-cella may comprise only one species with several biovars (40). Brucellosis impacts public health and agricultural economies worldwide because of its high infectivity rate (13).

40|$|International audienceBrucellosis {{is not a}} {{sustainable}} disease in humans. The source of human infection always resides in domestic or wild animal reservoirs. The routes of infection are multiple: food-borne, occupational or recreational, linked to travel and even to bioterrorism. New Brucella strains or species may emerge and existing Brucella species adapt to changing social, cultural, travel and agricultural environment. Brucella melitensis {{is the most important}} zoonotic agent, followed by Brucella abortus and Brucella suis. This correlates with the fact that worldwide, the control of bovine brucellosis (due to B. abortus) has been achieved {{to a greater extent than}} the control of sheep and goat brucellosis (due to B. melitensis), these latter species being the most important domestic animals in many developing countries. The long duration and high cost of treatment of human brucellosis reduces the efficacy of the therapy. There is no human vaccine for brucellosis and the occurrence of brucellosis is directly linked to the status of animal brucellosis in a region. In this context, the Word Health Organization has defined the development of a human vaccine, besides the implementation of control and eradication programs in animals, as a high priority. The pathogenicity for humans of B. suis biovars 1, 3 and 4 is well established, whereas B. suis biovar 2  seems to be less pathogenic. Indeed, although hunters and pig farmers have repeatably experienced infectious contact with B. suis biovar 2 (found in wild boar and outdoor-rearing pigs in Europe), isolation of B. suis biovar 2 from human samples have only been seldom reported. Marine mammal brucellosis, due to two new proposed Brucella species i. e. B. <b>cetaceae</b> and B. pinnipediae, represents a new zoonotic threat but the pathogenicity for humans of the different Brucella species found in cetaceans and pinnipeds still has to be clearly established...|$|R

25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{species are}} {{sometimes}} mistaken for dolphin relatives {{due to their}} similar overall morphology. However, the morphological traits are convergent. Temnodontosaurus were not mammals but were large marine reptiles and their ancestors were land dwelling reptiles. Temnodontosaurus do have morphological traits which differ from <b>Cetacea</b> also. Temnodontosaurus tail would beat laterally side to side, instead of up and down. Temnodontosaurus skull's also have nostrils that are {{placed in front of}} the eyes instead of on the dorsal side of the head like Cetaceans. Though reptiles, Temnodontosaurus can also be mistaken for fish due to their fins and elongate undifferentiated body, but unlike fish Temnodontosaurus are air breathers and must go to the water’s surface for air. Also Temnodontosaurus, like other Ichthyosaurs, are viviparous.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Judy Massare {{concluded}} that ichthyosaurs {{had been the}} fastest marine reptiles. Their length/depth ratio was between three and five, the optimal number to minimise water resistance or drag. Their smooth skin and streamlined bodies prevented excessive turbulence. Their hydrodynamic efficiency, {{the degree to which}} energy is converted into a forward movement, would approach that of dolphins and measure about 0.8. Ichthyosaurs would be a fifth faster than plesiosaurs, though half of the difference was explained by assuming a 30% higher metabolism for ichthyosaurs. Together, within Massare's model these effects resulted in a cruising speed of slightly less than five kilometres per hour. However, in 2002, Motani corrected certain mistakes in Massare's formulae and revised the estimated cruising speed to less than two kilometres per hour, somewhat below that of modern <b>Cetacea.</b> However, as the speeds estimated for plesiosaurs and mosasaurids were also revised downwards, ichthyosaurs maintained their relative position.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} living mammals, the more {{striking}} of Owen's contributions {{relate to the}} monotremes, marsupials and the anthropoid apes. He {{was also the first}} to recognize and name the two natural groups of typical Ungulate, the odd-toed (Perissodactyla) and the even-toed (Artiodactyla), while describing some fossil remains, in 1848. Most of his writings on mammals, however, deal with extinct forms, to which his attention seems to have been first directed by the remarkable fossils collected by Charles Darwin, in South America. Toxodon, from the pampas, was then described and gave the earliest clear evidence of an extinct generalized hoof animal, a pachyderm with affinities to the Rodentia, Edentata and herbivorous <b>Cetacea.</b> Owen's interest in South American extinct mammals then led to the recognition of the giant armadillo, which he named Glyptodon (1839) and to classic memoirs on the giant ground-sloths, Mylodon (1842) and Megatherium (1860), besides other important contributions. Owen also first described the false killer whale in 1863.|$|E
25|$|Sustained speed may be {{estimated}} by calculating the drag of a simplified {{model of the}} body, that can be approached by a prolate spheroid, and the sustainable level of energy output by the muscles. A first study of this problem was published by Judy Massare in 1988. Even when assuming a low hydrodynamic efficiency of 0.65, Massare's model seemed to indicate that plesiosaurs, if warm-blooded, would have cruised at a speed of four metres per second, or about fourteen kilometres per hour, considerably exceeding the known speeds of extant dolphins and whales. However, in 2002 Ryosuke Motani showed that the formulae that Massare had used, had been flawed. A recalculation, using corrected formulae, resulted in a speed of half a metre per second (1.8km/h) for a cold-blooded plesiosaur and {{one and a half}} metres per second (5.4km/h) for an endothermic plesiosaur. Even the highest estimate is about a third lower than the speed of extant <b>Cetacea.</b>|$|E
25|$|Forty-six {{marine mammals}} from the order <b>Cetacea</b> {{are found in}} Australian coastal waters. Since the {{majority}} of these species have global distribution, some authors do not consider them to be Australian species. There are nine species of baleen whale present, including the humpback whale. There are 37 species of toothed whale, which include all six genera of the family Ziphiidae, and 21 species of oceanic dolphin, including the Australian snubfin dolphin, a species first described in 2005. Some oceanic dolphins, such as the orca, can be found in all waters around the continent; others, such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, are confined to the warm northern waters. The dugong is an endangered marine species that inhabits the waters of north-eastern and north-western Australia, particularly the Torres Strait. It can grow up to 3m long and weigh as much as 400kg.

500|$|The {{cetaceans}} became aquatic around 50 {{million years}} ago (mya). Based on molecular and morphological research, the cetaceans genetically and morphologically fall firmly within the Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). The term [...] "Cetartiodactyla" [...] reflects the idea that whales evolved within the ungulates. The term was coined by merging the name for the two orders, <b>Cetacea</b> and Artiodactyla, into a single word.

500|$|The term [...] "whale" [...] is {{sometimes}} used interchangeably with dolphins and porpoises, {{acting as a}} synonym for <b>Cetacea.</b> Six species of dolphins have the word [...] "whale" [...] in their name, collectively known as blackfish: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, {{all of which are}} classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).

The cetaceans are included in the order Cetartiodactyla with the Artiodactyla (the even-toed ungulates). Previously, they were placed within their own order, <b>Cetacea,</b> now an infraorder. They are divided into two subgroups, the Odontoceti (the toothed whales, including dolphins and porpoises) and the Mysticeti (the baleen whales), formerly suborders but now considered parvorders or unranked taxa.

500|$|In Part II, Varner {{adopts a}} higher-order thought theory of {{consciousness}} and reviews evidence for animal consciousness. He argues that, according to contemporary science, vertebrates are conscious (i.e., sentient, {{able to feel}} pain), but few invertebrates are; cephalopods are an exception. He goes on to argue that most animals lack a biographical sense of self, something possessed by paradigmatic humans. A good life for human persons, consequently, [...] "consists in living a good story", meaning that persons can be harmed in ways that non-persons cannot. Varner denies that nonhuman animals lack the psychological sophistication necessary for personhood, but argues that some, nonetheless, may be [...] "near-persons"; this means that they lack a biographical sense of self, but possess autonoetic consciousness. Possible candidates include nonhuman primates, as well as Corvidae, <b>Cetacea</b> and Elephantidae, and rats and parrots. Varner frames the lives of near-persons as of less significance than the lives of persons, but of greater significance than the lives of other animals who are nonetheless sentient. The distinctions drawn in Part II are logically independent of any commitment to utilitarianism, Harean or otherwise.|$|E
