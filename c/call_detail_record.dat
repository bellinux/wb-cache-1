40|$|Abstract. In this paper, by {{exploiting}} the log of <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> <b>records,</b> {{we present a}} solution procedure of mining user moving patterns in a mobile computing system. Specifically, we propose algorithm LS to accurately determine similar moving sequences from the log of <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> <b>records</b> so as to obtain moving behaviors of users. By exploring the feature of spatial-temporal locality, we develop algorithm TC to group <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> <b>records</b> into clusters. In light {{of the concept of}} regression, we devise algorithm MF to derive moving functions of moving behaviors. Performance of the proposed solution procedure is analyzed and sensitivity analysis on several design parameters is conducted. It is shown by our simulation results that user moving patterns obtained by our solution procedure are of very high quality and in fact very close to real user moving behaviors. ...|$|R

Mobile operators deploy their own LIM system which allows the government to intercept calls, after taking “due authorisation” in compliance with Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act read with Rule 419(A) of the IT Rules. The LIM system to monitor Internet traffic is deployed by the government at the international gateways of some large ISPs (between the ISPs Internet Edge Router (PE) and the core network).
