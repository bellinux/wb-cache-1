40|$|Abstract Objective Impairments {{involving}} inhibitory control {{have been}} considered central deficits in drug users, {{but it appears that}} dysfunctions may be specific to users’ drug of choice. This article aims to review recent findings on inhibitory control impairment in samples of <b>crack</b> and/or <b>cocaine</b> users. Methods Searches were conducted on the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Knowledge databases in two stages according to eligibility criteria. Initially, databases were searched and the titles and abstracts of results were analyzed and then selected articles were read in full. Inclusion criteria were: empirical articles written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish, published {{in the last ten years}} and involving the assessment of inhibitory control in <b>crack</b> and/or <b>cocaine</b> users. Results The database searches returned a total of 3, 796 titles, 56 of them were selected initially and then a further 20 were excluded. Thirty-six articles were included in this review. In 90 % of the studies reviewed the presence of inhibitory control deficits was reported, verified by impaired cognitive processing and response monitoring, as well as high levels of impulsiveness, regardless of the pattern of <b>crack</b> and/or <b>cocaine</b> consumption (recreational or chronic). Former users showed high levels of impulsiveness even after long periods of abstinence. Conclusions <b>Crack</b> and/or <b>cocaine</b> users may have inhibitory control deficits, irrespective of different consumption patterns. High levels of impulsiveness can represent a factor of vulnerability to drug use and relapse...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the prevalence {{and patterns of}} use of <b>crack</b> and <b>cocaine</b> hydrochloride among heroin users in Spain. To explore if the expansion of heroin smoking {{is accompanied by a}} similar phenomenon for cocaine. DESIGN: Cross sectional study in 1995. Face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire. SETTING: Three cities with different prevalences of heroin use by smoking: high (Seville), intermediate (Madrid), and low (Barcelona). PARTICIPANTS: 909 heroin users, 452 in treatment and 457 out of treatment. MAIN RESULTS: Last month prevalence of crack use was 62. 3 % in Seville, 19. 4 % in Madrid, and 7. 7 % in Barcelona. Most users in Madrid (86. 5 %) and Barcelona (100 %) generally prepared their own crack, usually with ammonia as alkali; in Seville most users (69. 7 %) bought preprocessed crack. The proportion of users who began taking <b>cocaine</b> (<b>crack</b> or <b>cocaine</b> hydrochloride) by smoking has increased progressively since the seventies, rising to 74. 1 % in Seville, 61. 5 % in Madrid, and 28 % in Barcelona in 1992 - 1995, with the earliest increase in Seville. The factors associated with crack use were: residence in Seville (odds ratio (OR) = 16. 3), cocaine hydrochloride use mainly by smoking (OR = 5. 0), by sniffing (OR = 2. 7) or by injecting (OR = 2. 5), heroin use mainly by smoking (OR = 2. 8) and weekly use of cannabis (OR = 1. 9). CONCLUSIONS: In Spain smoking cocaine may be progressively diffusing from the south west to the north east, similar to what has happened with smoking heroin, but beginning later in time. The factors associated with smoking cocaine are basically ecological or cultural in nature (characteristics of the available drugs and the main route of heroin administration in each city) ...|$|R
