5|$|When Connor McDavid {{was named}} {{captain of the}} Edmonton Oilers, he became the {{youngest}} permanent <b>captain</b> <b>in</b> NHL history. Gabriel Landeskog of the Colorado Avalanche and Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins, are the second- and third-youngest players to be named <b>captain</b> <b>in</b> NHL history, respectively. In 1984, Brian Bellows was named interim captain of the Minnesota North Stars when Craig Hartsburg was injured, and is the youngest player to captain a team in NHL history. However, because Bellows served only as an interim captain, McDavid retains {{the distinction of being}} the youngest permanent <b>captain</b> <b>in</b> the League's history. Mark Messier is the only player to captain two separate teams to Stanley Cup championships, those being the 1990 Edmonton Oilers and the 1994 New York Rangers.

5|$|After {{attending}} public school, MacLaren played intermittently for Lancashire until 1899 as {{he tried}} to establish a career outside the sport. Even so, he was appointed county <b>captain</b> <b>in</b> 1894 and was chosen frequently to play for England. An appointment as Lancashire's assistant secretary allowed him to play more regularly from 1900. He first captained England in 1898 as a stand-in, but became <b>captain</b> <b>in</b> his own right in 1899. Under his leadership, England lost to Australia in three consecutive series—1899, 1901–02 and 1902. MacLaren was involved in controversies throughout all three defeats, and was replaced as <b>captain</b> <b>in</b> 1905, although he remained in the team. Business interests kept him out of the game for the following years, but he was invited to lead England once more in 1909. Defeat in that series ended his Test career, and the following year he ceased playing regular first-class cricket. He played occasionally until 1922–23, and had some late successes: in 1921, a team selected and captained by MacLaren defeated a previously unbeaten Australian team, and on his final first-class appearance during a 1922–23 Marylebone Cricket Club tour of New Zealand, he scored 200 runs.|$|E

5|$|For Somerset, Burns passed 1,000 {{first-class}} runs in {{a season}} twice, and {{was part of the}} team which won the 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. He provided Somerset with a batting all-rounder, particularly in one-day cricket in which he averaged 27 with the bat and 30 with the ball for the county. He took over as Somerset <b>captain</b> <b>in</b> 2003, primarily {{due to the lack of}} other suitable candidates. He continued in the role in the following year, though he was criticised throughout due to poor results, which at one stage resulted in a number of Somerset's players being threatened with being sacked. He was replaced as <b>captain</b> <b>in</b> 2005 by Graeme Smith, and retired from first-class cricket at the end of that year. He subsequently trained as an umpire, and was promoted to the England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) reserve list in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Gilligan played cricket for Dulwich College {{before the}} First World War, then for Cambridge, twice winning his blue. He briefly played county cricket for Surrey but moved to Sussex in 1920.

First playing for England in 1922, he was appointed Test <b>captain</b> <b>in</b> 1924. In the latter year, Gilligan was {{at the height of}} his form when he suffered a blow to his heart while batting. The strain affected his bowling, which was never again as effective, but he still captained England in Australia during the 1924–25 season. The series was lost, but both he and his team were popular and respected. In following years, he played less frequently; he resigned as Sussex <b>captain</b> <b>in</b> 1929 and retired three years later. He subsequently became a writer, journalist and cricket commentator while maintaining his connections with Sussex.|$|E
