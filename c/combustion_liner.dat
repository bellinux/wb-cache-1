40|$|In this fuel {{flexible}} turbine system (FFTS) program, the Parker gasification {{system was}} further optimized, fuel composition of biomass gasification process was characterized and {{the feasibility of}} running Capstone MicroTurbine(TM) systems with gasification syngas fuels was evaluated. With high hydrogen content, the gaseous fuel from a gasification process of various feed stocks such as switchgrass and corn stover has high reactivity and high flashback propensity when running in the current lean premixed injectors. The research concluded that the existing C 65 microturbine combustion system, which is designed for natural gas, {{is not able to}} burn the high hydrogen content syngas due to insufficient resistance to flashback (undesired flame propagation to upstream within the fuel injector). A comprehensive literature review was conducted on high-hydrogen fuel combustion and its main issues. For Capstone?s lean premixed injector, the main mechanisms of flashback were identified to be boundary layer flashback and bulk flow flashback. Since the existing microturbine combustion system is not able to operate on high-hydrogen syngas fuels, new hardware needed to be developed. The new hardware developed and tested included (1) a series of injectors with a reduced propensity for boundary layer flashback and (2) two new <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> designs (<b>Combustion</b> <b>Liner</b> Design A and B) that lead to desired primary zone air flow split to meet the overall bulk velocity requirement to mitigate the risk of core flashback inside the injectors. The new injector designs were evaluated in both test apparatus and C 65 /C 200 engines. While some of the new injector designs did not provide satisfactory performance in burning target syngas fuels, particularly in improving resistance to flashback. The combustion system configuration of FFTS- 4 injector and <b>Combustion</b> <b>Liner</b> Design A was found promising to enable the C 65 microturbine system to run on high hydrogen biomass syngas. The FFTS- 4 injector was tested in a C 65 engine operating on 100 % hydrogen and with the redesigned <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> - <b>Combustion</b> <b>Liner</b> Design A - installed. The results were promising for the FFTS program as the system was able to burn 100 % hydrogen fuel without flashback while maintaining good combustion performance.

40|$|NARloy-Z alloy (Cu- 3 percent, Ag- 0. 5 percent, Zr) is a {{state of}} the art alloy {{currently}} used for fabricating rocket engine <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liners.</b> Research conducted at NASA-MSFC and Penn State Applied Research Laboratory has shown that thermal conductivity of NARloy-Z can be increased significantly by adding diamonds to form a composite (NARloy-Z-D).

For instance, NARloy-Z containing 40 vol. percent diamond particles, sintered at 975 C to full density by using the Field assisted Sintering Technology (FAST) showed 69 percent higher thermal conductivity than baseline NARloy-Z. Furthermore, NARloy-Z- 40 vol. percent D is 30 percent lighter than NARloy-Z and hence the density normalized thermal conductivity is 140 percent better. These attributes will improve the performance and life of the advanced rocket engines significantly. By one estimate, increased thermal conductivity will directly translate into increased turbopump power up to 2 X and increased chamber pressure for improved thrust and ISP, resulting in an expected 20 percent improvement in engine performance. Follow on research is now being conducted to demonstrate the benefits of this high thermal conductivity NARloy-Z-D composite for <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liner</b> applications in advanced rocket engines. The work consists of a) Optimizing the chemistry and heat treatment for NARloy-Z-D composite, b) Developing design properties (thermal and mechanical) for the optimized NARloy-Z-D, c) Fabrication of net shape subscale <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liner,</b> and d) Hot fire testing of the liner for performance.

40|$|The copper- 8 {{atomic percent}} chromium- 4 atomic percent niobium (CuCrNb) alloy was {{developed}} by Glenn Research Center (formally Lewis Research Center) as an improved alloy for <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liners.</b> In comparison to NARloy-Z, the baseline (as in Space Shuttle Main Engine) alloy for such liners, CuCrNb demonstrates mechanical and thermophysical properties equivalent to NARloy-Z, but at temperatures 100 C to 150 C (180 F to 270 F) higher. Anticipated materials related benefits include decreasing the thrust cell liner weight 5 % to 20 %, increasing the service life at least two fold over current combustion chamber design, and increasing the safety margins available to designers. By adding an oxidation and thermal barrier coating to the <b>liner,</b> the <b>combustion</b> chamber can operate at even higher temperatures. For all these benefits, however, this alloy cannot be formed using conventional casting and forging methods because of the levels of chromium and niobium, which exceed their solubility limit in copper. Until recently, the only forming process that maintains the required microstructure of CrNb intermetallics is powder metallurgy formation of a billet from powder stock, followed by extrusion. This severely limits its usefulness in structural applications, particularly the complex shapes required for <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liners.</b> Vacuum plasma spray (VPS) has been demonstrated as a method to form structural articles including small combustion chambers from the CuCrNb alloy.

Technology developed in microgravity research to build cartridges for space furnaces was utilized to vacuum plasma spray (VPS) a functional gradient coating on the hot wall of the <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> as one continuous operation, eliminating any bondline between the coating and the liner. The coating was NiCrAlY, developed previously as durable protective coatings on space shuttle high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) turbine blades. A thermal model showed that 0. 03 in.

The liner hot wall {{is exposed to}} a 2760 C (5000 F) flame while the cold side is exposed to cryogenic hydrogen liquid. Materials {{for use in the}} <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liner</b> require a combination of high temperature strength, creep resistance, and low cycle fatigue resistance along with high thermal conductivity.

In-situ combustion monitoring {{is also expected to}} benefit advanced power plants of the future, fueled by coal-derived syngas, liquified natural gas (LNG), hydrogen, or hydrogen blend fuels. The in-situ monitoring that CCADS provides can enable the optimal operation of advanced, fuel-flexible turbines for minimal pollutant emissions and maximum efficiency over the full operating range of an advanced turbine. Previous work has demonstrated CCADS as a useful sensor for in-situ monitoring of natural gas combustion, including detection of important combustion events such as flashback and lean blowoff, in experimental combustors without thermal barrier coatings (TBC). Since typical TBC materials are electrical insulators at room temperature, and CCADS operation requires conduction of electrical current to the walls of the combustor, a TBC on the <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> was identified as a potential barrier to CCADS operation in commercial application.

The interaction between the interrelated combustion driven flame dynamics, acoustic pressure fluctuations and liner wall vibration has been investigated in the laboratory combustor test system. During the operation, the combustion, acoustics and wall vibrations have been coupled together. The dynamic combustion process generates high amplitude pressure oscillations resulting in vibration of the liner structure at about constant elevated temperature in base load operation. The thermo-acoustic instabilities have a significant destructive impact {{on the life of}} the liner material due to high cyclic vibration levels at high temperature. A structural health monitoring (SHM) method has been established to identify the damage, detect the flaw existence and determine the location, severity and progress of the damage for the combustion liners. Vibration-based and acoustic emission (AE) techniques have been applied in the test system to assess the structural behavior.

The method enables a reliable assessment on the liner specimen at elevated temperatures by means of non-destructive evaluation under continuous operation of the combustor. The <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> specimen material has been assessed by calculating the near-tip fields at the crack tip by finite element based stress and fracture mechanics analysis. An algorithm based on J-Integral has been utilized to analyze the crack growth behavior under various loading conditions considering both linear and non-linear elastic fracture mechanics concepts. The location and the direction of the cracking on the liner specimen have been predicted. The presented work interrelates the different mechanisms in gas turbine combustors and the applicability of the concepts has been verified and validated in the test systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{combustion}} rig tests were analyzed to determine liquid jet penetration heights of oil-in-water unsteady emulsions in a gaseous cross flow. Data was taken ranging {{the water to}} fuel ratio at several engine loads. The goal {{of this study is}} to develop a transfer function to model penetration heights over the engine load range and compare with emissions requirements to predict emission compliant water to fuel ratios without risk of <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> wetting and coating spallation. In this study correlations were developed at lower and upper range engine loads while the mid range shows an unclear transition pattern that needs to be addressed in further research. While operating on a liquid fueled diffusion flame NOx emissions are a major concern because of flame temperatures reaching high levels. An unsteady emulsion system is implemented mixing the fuel with water upstream from injection as a means to cool the flame and bring down firing temperature. Coating spallation is at risk and predictive methods are needed Analysis The geometry and method of injection is most similar to a Liquid Jet in Cross Flow. Numerical Analysis was done around this basic theory. For these experiments the thermocouple temperatures were used as a means of determining the jet penetration. In the low load ranges 10 - 30 % load a clear trend relating the penetration to water fuel ratio was observed. This relates closely to the principles of the liquid jet in cross flow. When analyzing the mid load range data there was large amounts of scatter and a valid correlation could not be formed. At base load conditions the data strays away from the principles of the liquid jet in cross flow, and is not dependant on the water fuel ratio but rather more dependant on pressure. A transition phase is apparent in this data, but more data is needed to characterize the transition...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the process development for fabricating a high thermal conductivity NARloy-Z-Diamond composite (NARloy-Z-D) <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liner</b> for application in advanced rocket engines. The fabrication process is challenging and {{this paper presents}} some details of these challenges and approaches used to address them. Prior research conducted at NASA-MSFC and Penn State had shown that NARloy-Z- 40 %D composite material has significantly higher thermal conductivity than {{the state of the}} art NARloy-Z alloy. Furthermore, NARloy-Z- 40 %D is much lighter than NARloy-Z. These attributes help to improve the performance of the advanced rocket engines. Increased thermal conductivity will directly translate into increased turbopump power, increased chamber pressure for improved thrust and specific impulse. Early work on NARloy-Z-D composites used the Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST, Ref. 1, 2) for fabricating discs. NARloy-Z-D composites containing 10, 20 and 40 vol% of high thermal conductivity diamond powder were investigated. Thermal conductivity (TC) data. TC increased with increasing diamond content and showed 50 % improvement over pure copper at 40 vol% diamond. This composition was selected for fabricating the <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liner</b> using the FAST technique...|$|R
