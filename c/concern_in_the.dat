5|$|Control {{of water}} {{was the primary}} <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds {{from the sale of}} power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget.

5|$|At {{the time}} of McCarthy's speech, {{communism}} was a significant <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. This concern was exacerbated {{by the actions of}} the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy's claim.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Russian Far East immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E

5|$|Exotic species (also {{known as}} {{invasive}} or non-native species) are often unintentionally introduced by people traveling {{from outside the}} forest by sticking to vehicle tires, shoes, or cattle and are usually found near roadways, campgrounds, and other areas used by people. The Forest Service has an invasive species control effort that identifies and attempts to contain the further spread of non-native plants. Invasive plants of particular <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest include spotted knapweed, yellow starthistle, rush skeletonweed, leafy spurge, and cheatgrass.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{research}} into the properties of neptunium since then {{has been focused on}} understanding how to confine it as a portion of nuclear waste. Because it has isotopes with very long half-lives, it is of particular <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of designing confinement facilities that can last for thousands of years. It has found some limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes. However, most of the neptunium that is produced as a reaction byproduct in nuclear power stations {{is considered to be a}} waste product.|$|E

Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, signs were installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the disability to the British ship, Troude pulled Formidable ahead in light winds, slowly rejoining the main squadron under Moreno, which was holding station off Cadiz harbour. As Formidable moved away, the remaining masts on Venerable collapsed and the ship grounded off Sancti Petri. There was <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British squadron that Moreno might counterattack the disabled ship, but the arrival on the horizon of Audacious and Superb persuaded the Spanish admiral to withdraw into Cadiz. Hood was able to refloat Venerable on 13 July and the ship was towed back to Gibraltar with the prize Saint Antoine. Saumarez left three ships to maintain the blockade at Cadiz, returning the situation off the port to that before the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Bassett {{years of}} the late-50s to early-70s were marked by mediocrity on the field but {{consistent}} success at the turnstiles. An issue {{that has become a}} perennial <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city also emerged at this time: the possibility of a National Football League team in Toronto. Various machinations were entertained by Bassett including moving the Argos to the NFL, bringing an American expansion team to the city (e.g. the Toronto Northmen of the WFL), or expanding the CFL itself in the opposite direction. Other team owners steadfastly opposed Bassett's moves and almost rescinded his franchise in 1974; angered, he sold the team for $3.3 million to hotel magnate William R. Hodgson in the same year.|$|E
5|$|The Holderness {{coastline}} suffers {{the highest}} rate of coastal erosion in Europe: 2 metres a year on average or 2million tonnes of material a year. Some of this is transported by longshore drift with about 3% of material being deposited at Spurn Head spit, to the south. The coastline has retreated noticeably in the last 2,000 years, with many former settlements now flooded, particularly Ravenser Odd and Ravenspurn, which was a major port until its destruction in the 14th century. Erosion is an ongoing <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council has been carrying out cliff erosion defences between Sewerby and Kilnsea since 1951. The Holderness area drains mostly into the Humber and the eponymous River Hull drains the area north of Hull.|$|E

5|$|The common {{blackbird}} has {{an extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million square miles), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 79 to 160 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least <b>Concern.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> western Palaearctic, populations are generally stable or increasing, {{but there have been}} local declines, especially on farmland, which may be due to agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows (which provide nesting places), and to drain damp grassland and increase the use of pesticides, both of which could have reduced the availability of invertebrate food.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} {{increased}} environmental <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. In the mid-1950s, Soviet scientists began taking regular radiation readings near Leningrad, Moscow, and Odessa and collected {{data on the}} prevalence of strontium-90, which indicated that strontium-90 levels in western Russia approximately matched those in the eastern US. Rising Soviet concern was punctuated in September 1957 by the Kyshtym disaster, which forced the evacuation of 10,000 people after an explosion at a nuclear plant. Around the same time, 219 Soviet scientists signed Pauling's antinuclear petition. Soviet political elites did not share the concerns of others in Soviet Union, however; Kurchatov unsuccessfully called on Khrushchev to halt testing in 1958.|$|E

5|$|Although Woodfull was {{a devout}} Methodist, {{he would show}} a deep <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{personal}} welfare of all players, which extended to finding {{the location of the}} nearest Catholic Church for those teammates who followed the religion. At the time, Australian society at large was divided along Catholic-Protestant lines, and while O'Reilly and McCabe were full of praise for Woodfull, they were later accused of leading a Catholic revolt against the leadership of the Protestant Bradman during a divisive period in the late-1930s. While Woodfull himself never touched alcohol due to his strict adherence to his religious principles, he did not impose his beliefs on his team. He would buy drinks for his players, and ask administrators to provide more alcohol for his teammates when they were exhausted. At the time, cricketers widely regarded beer as a highly effective means of rehydration, and on one occasion Woodfull threatened to halt play when administrators refused his players more ale {{on the grounds that they}} had already consumed their quota.|$|E
5|$|Clayman (IGN) {{reported}} that the game had no major technical issues, which was a major <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> protracted run-up to the game's release. He also found that most of its levels {{did not appear to}} leverage the Xbox 360's advances in areas apart from graphics. Bramwell (Eurogamer), on the other hand, fought the controls and camera throughout the game. He lamented a particular issue in which the camera would spin 180 degrees when Kameo was hit, which made the path of retreat harder to see. Theobald (GameSpy) also lamented the camera. Kasavin (GameSpot) found Kameo to be technically outstanding, and praised its automatic game save features, short loading times, steady frame rates, and detailed display on both standard- and high-definition televisions. Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that Kameo was technically impressive to the point of overwhelming the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s when inflation was stable, {{but by the}} mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E

5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized. Because of its size and strength, it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per person per day, and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn trawlers, this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This species has also been listed under Least <b>Concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{experiences}} noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it {{has high}} levels of sodium and alkalinity. Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge stormwater into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a concrete channel. In {{a study by the}} Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during base flow or storm flow conditions. However, a study from the previous year found concentrations of sodium and alkalinity exceeding the threshold for <b>concern.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by slush pumped into it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{provided}} an opportunity for improving the visuals and gameplay. The visuals were given more contrast, so objects stood out more. Improvements to the lighting was a major focus for the team. The game's engine was also improved, along with character animations and facial movement. Due to the relatively small size of the DLC environment, developers {{did not need to}} focus on a raised <b>concern</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main game about repeating character faces and voices. An element that had been generally criticized by both critics and players of the original game was the boss fights, which had been outsourced to Grip Entertainment and consequently did not follow the player-driven gameplay style {{of the rest of the}} game, instead focusing heavily on action. While a boss fight was included in The Missing Link, it was entirely developed in-house by Eidos Montréal staff and allowed for a variety of solution for defeating the boss, including non-lethal options.|$|E
