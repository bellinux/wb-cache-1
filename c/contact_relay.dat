A control panel controlled what function was to be performed by directing the impulse to a series of ‘wire contact relays’ with the impulses de-coded according to the Hollerith code. (Mark Sense could not provide the current needed to ‘pick’ a wire <b>contact</b> <b>relay</b> and so needed vacuum tubes to amplify the current). After the card was read, a ‘Card Gate’ moved into the card path to stop the card for printing on the correct horizontal line.|$|E

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{printers}} are thrown out annually, {{since it is}} usually more attractive {{to buy a new}} printer than to replace ink cartridges, especially if the apparent cost is very similar. Most of the discarded printers either end up in land fills, or are melted for recovery of the metal components. At the University of Évora, a new approach has been developed since 2007 : old printers are dismantled and the parts are used in electronics and automation classes, saving the environment and helping to reduce the annual cost of running the laboratory classes. One of the most widely available and useful printers is the HP 600 series that were manufactured between 1994 and 2000. These printers, once dismantled can provide various precious components for electronic classes. These components include: 2 step motors, one 12 V motor complete with gear-head and trolley, a LM 35 DZ precision thermometer, one <b>contact</b> <b>relay,</b> one infra-red switch, two LDRs and one high quality cable and a LPT connector {{that can be used in}} automation developments using the PC´s LPT port. The four years of experience have shown that the students are more than willing to take the time to dismantle the equipment and carefully extract the components. With the proper tools, two students can dismantle a printer and remove the parts in less than 15 minutes. This paper presents the individual components that can be removed and presents sample circuits and uses for the parts in electronic and automation laboratory classes...|$|E

50|$|The use of relays for {{the logical}} control of complex {{switching}} systems like telephone exchanges was studied by Claude Shannon, who formalized {{the application of}} Boolean algebra to relay circuit design in A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. Relays can perform the basic operations of Boolean combinatorial logic. For example, the boolean AND function is realised by connecting normally open <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> in series, the OR function by connecting normally open contacts in parallel.

50|$|A relay allows {{circuits}} to be switched by electrical equipment: for example, a timer circuit with a relay could switch {{power at}} a preset time. For many years relays were the standard method of controlling industrial electronic systems. A number of relays {{could be used}} together to carry out complex functions (relay logic). The principle of relay logic is based on relays which energize and de-energize associated <b>contacts.</b> <b>Relay</b> logic is the predecessor of ladder logic, which is commonly used in programmable logic controllers.|$|R

A common additional feature made available (at additional cost) was the leading zeros feature (termed [...] "Left-Zero"). This was delivered by an additional set of four SMS cards. The field was programmed for leading zeros using the program card. If it was (say) a six digit field, the operator only had to key in the actual value (for example 73). The feature would then fill the field by punching the leading four zeros, followed by the 73, in effect right justifying the field, thus: 000073.|$|R
50|$|For {{high-speed}} use, the mercury-wetted relay is used instead. This {{combines the}} speed of a low-mass relay, together with the fast wetting of mercury <b>contacts.</b> A <b>relay,</b> usually a reed <b>relay,</b> has its <b>contacts</b> coated with a small quantity of mercury. This gives the low bounce advantage of mercury, although the current capacity is still limited to broadly that of the original reed relay.|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of running}} mains voltage to the switches, a low voltage—typically 24 V AC—is {{connected}} to remote momentary toggle or rocker switches. The momentary switches usually have SPDT contacts in an (ON)-OFF-(ON) configuration.
