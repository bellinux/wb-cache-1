40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analytical}} procedures aimed at identifying different perturbation sources in the diagnostic of power equipment and structures that may be exposed {{to a variety of}} upsetting phenomena. Sources placed on individual parts of a jointed structure affected by both natural and designed stimuli generate signals that are transmitted to sensors through source-sensor transmission channels whose characteristics depend on the type of the structure and the assembly of its parts. The proposed method allows to discriminate different signals acquired by sensors and coming contemporarily from different sources. A subsequent recognition technique based on signal processing procedures is then applied to identify any anomalies in the different parts of the structure. The method can be applied to diagnose a number of different electromechanical structures such as <b>power</b> transformers, <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> <b>power</b> cables, electrical and mechanical railway structures.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The use of {{generator}} <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> in <b>power</b> stations {{was investigated}} and evaluated. A feasibility {{study to determine}} if the additional capital cost required, when using a generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> in a <b>power</b> station could be justified by the advantages it provides. The background to the study is provided through a technology and literature survey. Included in the technology review and the literature study is information on interruption mediums, the historic developments of <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> application theory. This data was used to determine the practicality of using a specific interruption medium within a generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> application. The requirements of generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> were determined and used to evaluate the interruption mediums in question. To ensure practical results, commonly used layouts were used to determine the effect of using a generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> on the reliability, availability and the mean time to repair of a power station electrical distribution layout. Furthermore, the effect of the protection on the generator and generator transformer was evaluated. It was found that increased selectivity of the protection system by using a generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> limits the extent of equipment damage in case of failure. Practical layouts were used to determine the effect on reliability. The analysis was conducted using assumed values of operational costs to determine the cost incurred through the change in reliability of the power station. By adding a generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker,</b> the station transformer and associated equipment is regarded as back-up or redundant equipment. This increases the reliability of the power station dramatically and limits the risk of income lost due to failures. The full evaluation included the estimation of the capital investment costs and the impact that the additional cost has on the operational requirements of a power station. The study determined that the capital cost required to use a generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> results in no additional income for a power station. Through the increased protection, higher availability and the possible omission of power station ancillary equipment, the use of generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> will result in more power being delivered and more income generated by a power station. The study proved that the generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is a critical part of a power station layout and is a necessary capital requirement to ensure the sustainability of the power station.

Because temperature is a basic physical attribute of nearly every industrial and commercial process, our system can eventually result in significant improvements in nearly every industrial and commercial process.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{about the}} implementation of Solid State <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breaker</b> in <b>power</b> system using MOSFET. The high power semiconductor switches {{can be used to}} separate the faulty portions {{from the rest of the}} power system in case of abnormal conditions. The Solid State <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breaker</b> is a topology made in the form of module, can protect power system and its components from faults. Existing mechanical <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are based on the principle of magnetically latching a pair of mechanical contacts shrouded by an arc chute for arc extinction. Very often unnecessary tripping results from a phenomenon known as, “rapid rise” which subsequently results in the demand for frequent maintenance. Due to the long turn-off delay of the present mechanical <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker,</b> significant voltage sag is experienced in the grid which affects the sensible loads. The distortions caused by the three phase short circuit can be reduced to 100 µs in the system with SSCB, in contrast to 100 ms achieved by the present technology and hence it improves the power quality. The SSCB uses high power anti parallel switches to carry bidirectional current. The load voltage is sensed and it is used to turn on and turn off the SSCB. The Eight bus system with SSCB is modeled and simulated using Matlab/Simulink. The hardware model is developed for implementation of SSCB using MOSFETand it is tested in the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increase}} of penetration of distribution in distribution systems, the problems of power loss increase and short-circuit capacity beyond the rated capacity of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> will become more serious. In this paper, a methodology (modified BPSO) is presented for network reconfiguration {{which is based on}} the hybrid approach of Tabu search and BPSO algorithms to prevent the local convergence and to decrease the calculation time using double fitness to consider the constraints. Moreover, an average load simulated method (ALS method) considering load variation is proposed such that the average load value is used instead of the actual load for calculation. Finally, from a case study, the results of simulation certify that the approaches will decrease drastically the losses and improve the voltage profiles obviously; at the same time, the short-circuit capacity is also decreased into smaller shut-off capacity of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> The <b>power</b> losses will not be increased too much even if the short-circuit capacity constraint is considered; voltage profiles are better with the constraint of short-circuit capacity considered.

50|$|In higher powered applications, the {{protective}} relays that detect a fault and initiate a trip are {{separate from the}} <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> Early relays worked based upon electromagnetic principles similar to those mentioned in the previous paragraph, modern relays are application-specific computers that determine whether to trip based upon readings from the power system. Different relays will initiate trips depending upon different protection schemes. For example, an overcurrent relay might initiate a trip if the current on any phase exceeds a certain threshold whereas a set of differential relays might initiate a trip if the sum of currents between them indicates there may be current leaking to earth. The <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> in higher <b>powered</b> applications are different too.
