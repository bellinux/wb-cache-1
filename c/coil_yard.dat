40|$|An {{automatic}} {{steel coil}} recognition system with {{two types of}} laser-assisted range sensor has been developed for full automated crane operation in the steel <b>coil</b> <b>yard.</b> Performance tests of recognizing full scale model coils were carried out by mounting the recognition system on a full size crane. As a result, recognition accuracy of coil center position, coil diameter and width were confirmed to be ± 20 mm, which is enough fur practical applications. This recognition system was delivered to commercial operations in the steel maker, and has been operated regularl...|$|E
40|$|Lots of {{researches}} {{and applications}} on the automated overhead cranes in shops {{have been done}} for some decades, but a few successful results are reported. A more reasonable control system fit to requirements of manufacturing industries is suggested in the study. The controller was designed in the continuous time domain by loop-shaping method. Sway of the rope is suppressed by anti-sway control method. The sway angle of the rope is measured by a sway angle sensor which is mechanically {{in contact with the}} rope. The real-time control law is comprised of the position and the anti-sway controller. Some algorithms required for <b>coil</b> <b>yard</b> operation as well as main control algorithms such as reference position generation, position control and anti-sway control have been designed and fully tested on a crane in the steel-making works. The designed crane control system showed satisfactory performance on position control accuracy and anti-sway of rope. The maximum positional error is 20 mm and the maximum sway error is 0. 07 degrees in the destination position...|$|E
60|$|From {{the limb}} {{of a tree}} above his head swayed a huge python, one of those {{reptiles}} {{that are able to}} crush a man's bones in their <b>coils.</b> A few <b>yards</b> away crouched a savage panther, its glaring red eyes fixed full on the helpless Claus. One of those monstrous spotted spiders whose sting is death crept stealthily toward him over the matted leaves, which shriveled and turned black at its very touch.|$|R
40|$|Steelmaking, {{continuous}} casting and hot rolling {{are not only}} the key processes of steel production, but also the processes costing lots of energy. Pig iron is made into slabs {{by the process of}} steel making and {{continuous casting}}. The hot rolling process makes slabs into hot <b>coil.</b> A slab <b>yard</b> is built between the two parts as a buffer area to coordinate the production rhythm. In this work flow, if the slab can&# 39;t be transferred to hot rolling process timely when it&# 39;s cast to a slab with high temperature, it will stay in the slab yard and auto-cool to room temperature. When it is called for hot rolling, the slab needs to be reheated from room temperature to about 1250 °C. It can be seen that lots of energy loss exists in the process of reheating slabs. This paper proposes a method based on heuristic and mathematical programming to solve this problem, as so-called, the integrated scheduling problem. Validation research is taken for the models and algorithm. The experiment result shows that this solution can solve the problem correctly and achieve a short solve time even for large scale problem...|$|R
