50|$|The kaval that is {{most common}} in Bulgaria is the one in middle (D) register. The kaval in lower (<b>C)</b> <b>register</b> is also not {{uncommon}} for this country. What is characteristic for the Bulgarian style of kaval performance is the incredible diversity of sound shades and techniques. According to the pitch there are four different registers {{that can be achieved}} with the Bulgarian kaval. What controls which register the performer works in is mostly the air flow and to some extent the position of the mouth and the lips {{on the end of the}} kaval. A very characteristic sound of kaval is achieved in the lowest register. It could sound very mild and gentle if blown lightly while by changing the air stream a deeper (flageolet like) sound is achieved. This sound is so outstanding that some consider it another register that they call - kaba. It is also very interesting to notice that the technique of circular breathing is successfully utilized while playing the kaval. This technique lets the performer play without interrupting the air flow, while taking a breath through the nose. In the past it has been considered an extraordinary skill while nowadays it is used by more and more young performers.|$|E

40|$|The HSE’s new Hepatitis C Strategy {{calls for}} more {{hepatitis}} care {{to be carried out}} in the community by GPs. The long-awaited national Strategy, published earlier this week, contains 36 practical recommendations aimed at improving the surveillance, testing, treatment and education of hepatitis C patients. One of the key recommendations is the creation of a specific hepatitis <b>C</b> <b>register</b> and a standardised unique identifier as there is currently a dearth of detailed information on the epidemiology of this cohort. The Strategy report said that delivery of hepatitis services within the primary care setting, particularly through GPs working in the addiction services, should be maximised to alleviate the burden on hospital services and to provide care to patients in a setting that is most convenient to them. “Weekly GP visits by stable patients for methadone substitution could be linked to hepatitis C treatment and monitoring. This work would be supported and facilitated by community Hepatitis C liaison nurse specialists and by increased access to community diagnostics,” it says. Other recommendations include providing patients, particularly those with chaotic lifestyles and other social problems, with practical supports to enable them to attend for and adhere to treatment, and addressing alcohol issues for affected hepatitis C patients. “Improving access to treatment and supporting patients through treatment will reduce the progression from viral infection to liver damage for many patients. It should also contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of hepatitis C infection, thus reducing the associated clinical and social burden of the disease,” notes the Strategy report. The head of the Strategy Working Group, Prof Joe Barry, Head of the Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Trinity College Dublin, welcomed its publication and told IMT he is confident that despite the HSE’s worsening financial situation it can be fully implemented as many of its recommendations are budget neutral...|$|E
