5|$|Although {{described}} as a satellite terminal, the terminal building is connected by an above-ground <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> Terminal 2. Departures {{take place on the}} lower deck (similar to the A380 boarding lounges currently in use at Gates 9 and 11), with arrivals streamed on to the first floor to connect with the current first floor arrivals deck.

5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 by the legislature, {{creating}} a new commerce <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> link Lewis County {{in the south to}} the Canada–US border in the north. However the study showed that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from using the new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E

This connection is used by several trains each rush hour, allowing trains from the Franklin Line to avoid congestion in the crowded Southwest Corridor.|$|E

5|$|Abd el-Hamid {{meanwhile}} {{reported the}} dire situation of his forces at 5:30 PM on October 17. The 16th Brigade {{had been in}} heavy combat for three consecutive days – ammunition was becoming scarce, and the brigade was heavily outnumbered and outgunned due to its losses, including the destruction of its artillery units. Abd el-Hamid received orders from 16th Division headquarters to retreat. His brigade abandoned its Chinese Farms positions and reinforced {{the lines of the}} 18th Mechanized Brigade to the north during the night of October 17/18. This finally opened the Tirtur and Akavish roads to Israeli forces, ensuring Operation Abiray-Lev would proceed. Missouri remained in Egyptian hands though, posing a threat to the Israeli <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> the canal.|$|E
5|$|After convalescing, Miles re-joined the 2nd New Zealand Division in North Africa, {{where it}} was {{reforming}} after the losses incurred in Greece and on Crete. He then participated in Operation Crusader. During this campaign, aimed at lifting the besieged port of Tobruk, the 2nd New Zealand Division was involved in heavy fighting around Sidi Rezegh, where Miles deployed artillery {{in support of the}} 6th Infantry Brigade. Having established a <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> Tobruk, the commander of the division, Major General Bernard Freyberg, was becoming concerned that they would be unable to hold it open. On 30 November, he entrusted Miles with getting permission from Lieutenant General Alfred Godwin-Austen, the corps commander, to withdraw into or alongside Tobruk. Tentative permission was granted but only if Sidi Rezegh could not be held. However, the same day the 6th Brigade was overrun by elements of the 15th Panzer Division.|$|E

Michigan Avenue was the <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> {{the side of}} A-Block, and Broadway was the central corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through Times Square (an area with a clock on the wall), before entering the dining hall for their meals. Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison. The corridor between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue. The corridor in D-Block was named Sunset Strip. Gun galleries lay {{at the end of}} each block, including the West and East Gun Galleries.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} passes from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, I-70 enters the Denver {{metropolitan}} area, {{part of a}} larger urban area called the Front Range Urban Corridor. The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the LoDo district, the common name of the lower downtown area of Denver. Through the downtown area, US40 is routed along Colfax Avenue, which served as the primary east–west artery through the Denver area before the construction of I-70. Through downtown, US6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I-70 <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> join Interstate76 on a northeast course toward Nebraska. The freeway meets Interstate25 in an interchange frequently called the Mousetrap. From I-25 on to I-225, I-70 serves—together with those two Interstates—as part of an inner beltway around Denver.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores, {{including}} wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela {{conservation area}} and migration <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> {{the south of}} the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.|$|E

5|$|In 121 BC, Han forces {{expelled}} the Xiongnu from a vast territory {{spanning the}} Hexi <b>Corridor</b> <b>to</b> Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei. The {{majority of people}} on the frontier were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the Ministry of Transport invited {{construction}} company Freeman Fox, Wilbur Smith Associates (FFWSA) {{to investigate and}} report {{on the impact of}} the New Town proposals on traffic demand between the proposed New Town site and Wolverhampton, and the best highway solution to meet this demand. The predicted demand was that of 75,000 vehicles per day by 1990 and a need for a dual 3-lane motorway. Two corridors were identified for a possible new motorway route, and a third option to possibly upgrade existing roads. The route could have followed the A5 <b>Corridor</b> <b>to</b> the M6 South of Gailey, at junction 12, or a new corridor could have been established to the M6, north-east of Featherstone, at junction 11. Additionally, it was proposed that the existing A5 could be upgraded to full dual carriageway grade separated standards together with improvements to the A41 and A464 trunk routes.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{man with}} a camera follows a woman from an {{elevator}} through a <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray. He gets off on a floor before the woman and runs down the stairs. Lights flicker and the elevator cable snaps. As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and its door spills open to reveal the woman's wrist, covered with blood. The man begins to snap photos. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an X-file—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.|$|E
