There are 64 cameras and 50 microphones in the house, and the HouseGuests will also be required to wear microphones at all times. The backyard this season, where competitions will be held, is not actually outside, due to potential bad weather conditions. There are lights in {{this section of the}} house, however, that will mimic the rising and setting of the sun as the day goes on. This area features a [...] "contemporary Canada" [...] theme along the walls, with images of popular Canadian culture items being painted on. There is a pool in this area of the house, along with various work out equipment. There is, however, a secret room in the backyard that will lead to a hidden room that is actually outdoors, and features a hot tub. On the house, executive producer of Insight Productions stated, [...] "It has to have working bathrooms, working showers, working kitchens, air <b>conditioning,</b> <b>temperature</b> control, swimming pools, hot tubs, you name it. And all of it has to be inside a studio." [...] The house only features one main bedroom, which features seven double beds. There is also a Head of Household bedroom in the house, which features double doors at its entrance. During her tour of the house, host Arisa Cox described the living room and dining room as having a [...] "mid-century modern" [...] look. There is a hallway with bright greens walls that leads to both the bathroom and bedroom. There is only one toilet and two showers in the house, excluding the one in the HoH bedroom. There is a moose named Marsha in the hallway to the Diary Room, which can give the HouseGuests tasks.|$|E

40|$|The {{first two}} {{experiments}} of this thesis investigated {{the effects of}} <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> in relation to grain type (maize, wheat and sorghum) on the performance, nutrient utilisation and digestive tract development of broiler starters. The third experiment examined the influence of feed form (mash vs. pellet) and <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> in broiler starters fed wheat-based diets. The effects of improved pellet quality from {{the addition of a}} pellet binder or/and moisture to a wheat-based diet, and the effects of pellet diameter and pellet length on the quality of pellets and, performance, nutrient utilisation and digestive tract development of broilers were studied in fourth and fifth experiments, respectively. 	In the first experiment discussed in Chapter 4, increasing conditioning temperatures decreased the weight gain and feed intake of broilers fed wheat-based diets, whereas birds fed maize-based diets conditioned at 60 and 90 ºC had higher weight gain and feed intake than those fed the diet conditioned at 75 ºC. Increasing conditioning temperatures increased the feed per gain in both grain-type diets. Pellet durability index (PDI) improved with increasing conditioning temperatures in wheat-based diets, but was unaffected in maize-based diets. In wheat-based diets, increasing conditioning temperatures decreased the ileal digestibility of nitrogen (N) and starch. Ileal N digestibility of maize-based diets conditioned at 60 and 90 ºC was higher than at 75 ºC. Starch digestibility was unaffected by <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> in maize-based diets. No effect of <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> was found for the apparent metabolisable energy (AME). 	Data reported in Chapter 5 showed that birds fed maize- and sorghum-based diets conditioned at 60 ºC had a similar weight gain to those fed diets conditioned at 90 ºC and higher than those fed diets conditioned at 75 ºC. In both grain-type diets, birds fed diets conditioned at 60 and 90 ºC tended to have higher feed intake than those fed diets conditioned at 75 ºC. <b>Conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> had no effect on the feed per gain. Increasing conditioning temperatures caused gradual improvements in the PDI of maize-based diets, while the improvement was marked in the sorghum-based diet conditioned at 90 ºC. In both grain-type diets, pellet hardness increased with increasing conditioning temperatures, particularly at 90 ºC. In maize-based diets, ileal N digestibility was poorer at 75 ºC compared with 60 and 90 ºC whereas ileal starch digestibility was unaffected by <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> and AME was higher at 75 ºC compared with 60 and 90 ºC. For sorghum-based diets, increasing conditioning temperatures resulted in linear reductions in the ileal N and starch digestibility and AME. Data reported in Chapter 6 showed that in mash diets, increasing conditioning temperatures above 60 ºC had negative effects on weight gain, feed per gain and nutrient utilisation of broiler starters. But the deterioration in performance parameters caused by conditioning at higher temperatures was restored when steam-conditioned mash diets were pelleted. Pellet durability and hardness increased with increasing conditioning temperatures. Data reported in Chapter 7 showed that the negative effect of higher <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> on weight gain, and to some extent feed intake, of broilers {{is not limited to the}} starter period (d 1 to 21), but can also be carried over the whole growth period (d 1 to 35). This study also illustrated possibilities for high quality pellets to be manufactured by the addition of pellet binder or/and moisture to a mash diet without the need for high conditioning temperatures. The final experiment (Chapter 8) demonstrated that increasing the pellet length from 3 - to 6 -mm during the grower period (d 10 to 21) positively influenced the weight gain and feed per gain of broilers. While the weight gain response disappeared as the birds grew older, improvements in feed per gain was maintained over the finisher (d 22 to 42) and whole grow-out (d 10 to 42) periods in 4. 76 -mm diameter pellets. This study also showed that using a small diameter die hole and longer pellet length may have an additive effect on pellet quality, and provide opportunities to produce high quality pellets under low conditioning temperatures. The major finding of this thesis research was that the balance between the negative effect of high conditioning temperatures on nutrient availability and the positive effect on pellet quality is relevant in determining the broiler performance. The probability and magnitude of these two counteracting effects determine the performance of broilers. Another important finding was that the pre-conditioning addition of moisture and the use of small diameter die hole and longer pellet length can effectively address pellet quality concerns at low conditioning temperatures...|$|E

Wheat contains xylanase inhibitors (XI) and grain-associated xylanases (GA-XYL), which could affect {{the action of the}} EX-XYL. In this study, both GA-XYL and XI activity in feeding-quality wheat were assessed. In addition, the effect of the conditions during digestion in monogastrics and the effects of pelleting at different <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperatures</b> on GA-XYL and XI were investigated. The GA-XYL activity varied between no activity and 0. 821 XU/g. In contrast, the XI activity was consistently high in all wheat samples and ranged between 259 and 331 IU/g. Simulating the digestive process did not affect the activities of GA-XYL or XI. Pelleting at 85 °C or higher reduced the XI activity up to 46 %. GA-XYL, however, were more heat-sensitive, and their activity was reduced to 67 % at 60 °C. The extract viscosity increased and the release of reducing sugars decreased at higher <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperatures.</b> In addition, the net effect of EX-XYL on extract viscosity increased at higher temperatures, whereas the release of reducing sugars was not affected.

The 4 commercial products used were: Quantum Blue 5 G (AB Vista, Marlborough, United Kingdom); Ronozyme Hi Phos GT (DSM Nutritional Products, Parsippany, NJ); Axtra Phy TPT (Dupont, Wilmington, DE), and Microtech 5000 Plus (Guangdong VTR Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China). The phytase products were mixed as part of a corn-soybean meal-based swine diet at a concentration recommended by the manufacturer to provide a 0. 12 % aP release. Diets were exposed to each of 4 thermal conditioning temperatures (65, 75, 85, and 95 °C) for approximately 40 s and the entire process was repeated on 4 consecutive days to create 4 replicates. Samples were taken while feed exited the conditioner and before entering the pellet die. Phytase activity was determined from complete feed samples before conditioning to establish a baseline diet phytase activity level for each product. Phytase stability was measured as the residual phytase activity (% of initial) at each <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature.</b> There were no product × temperature interactions for <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature,</b> throughput, or residual phytase activity. As expected, as the target temperature was increased, <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> increased (linear, P < 0. 001) and conditioner throughput decreased (linear, P < 0. 001). As target temperature increased, phytase activity decreased (linear, P < 0. 001) for each product. There was a significant phytase product main effect which was primarily caused by Microtech 5000 Plus having decreased (P < 0. 05) phytase activity when compared to all other products at all conditioning temperatures.

Seven different factors, including ground corn particle size, added fat level, inclusion of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), feed rate, steam <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature,</b> conditioner retention time, and pellet die thickness (L:D ratio) were examined. Each factor was evaluated at two levels, and treatments were developed in order that all factor to factor comparisons could be made. Pellet samples were analyzed according to the standard method as described in ASAE S 269. 4, a modification of this method, and by using the NHP 100 pellet tester set to each of its four testing intervals (30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds). The standard method was found to provide the most consistent and repeatable determinations of pellet durability, and was found to correlate well with the modified method, {{as well as with the}} NHP 100 results at 30 and 60 seconds. Physical attributes of feed pellets, such as pellet hardness, bulk density, and moisture content were found to have significant, but weak correlations with pellet quality.

A 2 × 3 factorial array of treatments comprised two sorghum varieties, with white (Liberty) and red (Venture) pericarps and three conditioning temperatures (70, 80, 90 °C). Both sorghums were finely-ground through a 2. 0 mm hammer-mill screen prior to {{incorporation into the}} diets. Each of the dietary treatments was offered to six replicate cages (6 birds per cage) from 7 to 28 days post-hatch. Digesta samples were collected at day 28 for determination of starch and nitrogen digestibilities and mean retention time in the proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, proximal ileum and distal ileum. The digestion dynamics of starch and nitrogen were determined using an exponential mathematical model to relate digestion coefficients with mean retention times in each small intestinal segment. Increasing conditioning temperatures generated a ‘concave response ’ in starch digestion rates in white sorghum diets; whereas, there was a ‘convex response ’ in red sorghum diets. Thus, at the intermediate 80 °C <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature,</b> starch digestion rates were at a minimum value for white, but at a maximum value for red sorghum-based diets, {{which is consistent with}} the significant sorghum type×temperature interaction (p< 0. 05).

Effect of {{pelleting}} on {{survival of}} porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-contaminated feed. Journal of Animal Science, 95 (3), 1170 - 1178. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2016. 0961 Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a heat-sensitive virus that has devastated the U. S. swine industry. Because of its heat sensitivity, {{we hypothesized that}} a steam conditioner and pellet mill mimicking traditional commercial thermal processing may mitigate PEDV infectivity. Pelleting, a common feed processing method, includes the use of steam and shear forces, resulting in increased temperature of the processed feed. Two thermal processing experiments were designed to determine if different pellet mill conditioner retention times and temperatures would impact PEDV quantity and infectivity by analysis of quantitative reverse transcription PCR and bioassay. In Exp. 1, a 3 x 3 x 2 factorial design was used with 3 pelleting temperatures (68. 3, 79. 4, and 90. 6 degrees C), 3 conditioning times (45, 90, or 180 s), and 2 doses of viral inoculation (low, 1 x 102 tissue culture infectious dose(50) (the concentration used to see cytopathic effect in 50 % of the cells) /g, or high, 1 x 10 (4) tissue culture infectious dose(50) /g). Noninoculated and PEDV-inoculated unprocessed mash were used as controls. The low-dose PEDV-infected mash had 6. 8 +/- 1. 8 cycle threshold (Ct) greater (P < 0. 05) PEDV than the high-dose mash. Regardless of time or temperature, pelleting reduced (P < 0. 05) the quantity of detectable viral PEDV RNA compared with the PEDV-inoculated unprocessed mash. Fecal swabs from pigs inoculated with the PEDV-positive unprocessed mash, regardless of dose, were clinically PEDV positive from 2 to 7 d (end of the trial) after inoculation. However, if either PEDV dose of inoculated feed was pelleted {{at any of the}} 9 tested <b>conditioning</b> time x <b>temperature</b> combinations, no PEDV RNA was detected in fecal swabs or cecum content. Based on Exp. 1 results, a second experiment was developed to determine the impact of lower processing temperatures on PEDV quantity and infectivity. In Exp. 2, PEDV-inoculated feed was pelleted at 1 of 5 <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperatures</b> (37. 8, 46. 1, 54. 4, 62. 8, and 71. 1 degrees C) for 30 s.

Steam pelleting variables did not cause a significant loss of lysine or change in color and absorbance values. Analyzing the unprocessed ingredient mix suggests that the choice of the ingredients used in the ingredient mix, rather than the pelleting process applied, is responsible for the RL/TL ratio observed in the dry standard dog food used in this study. MRP content increased during steam pelleting (fructoselysine: 366. 2 to 538. 8 mg/kg DM; ¿-N-carboxymethyllysine: 12. 6 to 14. 8 mg/kg DM; lysinoalanine: 5. 7 to 7. 7 mg/kg DM; P < 0. 05). Increasing <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> from 65 to 90 °C increased fructoselysine (475. 9 to 601. 6 mg/kg DM; P < 0. 01) and ¿-N-carboxymethyllysine (14. 3 to 15. 1 mg/kg DM; P = 0. 003). An increased die hole length of 80 mm decreased fructoselysine content compared to 45 and 65 mm (461. 3 vs. 573. 3 and 581. 6 mg/kg DM; P < 0. 01) but increased lysinoalanine content (8. 8 vs. 7. 4 and 6. 8 mg/kg DM; P = 0. 002). Analyzing total and reactive lysine and absorbance values are not accurate enough to predict the MR and formation of MRPs during processing...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{considerable}} in-terest in the use of microbial phytase to release phytate-bound P and to improve overall P avail-ability in poultry diets. The following results dem-onstrate that supplemental phytase is effective in improving the availability of phytate-bound P for growth, bone mineralization, metabolizable energy and nutrient digestibility and nutrient retention in broiler diets (Kornegay et al., 1996; Cabahug et al., 1999; Ravindran et al., 2000; Zyla et al., 2001). The structure of an enzyme is critical to its spe-cific activity. The primary and secondary structure of enzymes can be altered by exposure to heat, ex-tremes of pH or certain organic solvents so that the activity can be decreased or completely abolished (Spring et al., 1996). The same temperature rise supplied with steam heating results in rapid inacti-vation. At a pre-pelleting <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> of 65 °C, the commercial enzyme formulation under discussion is completely stable. However, as the <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperature</b> increases, the enzyme becomes gradually more inactivated until at 75 °C the residual activity is about 30 % of the starting level (Cowan, 1993 a). Feeds used for broiler production are often (steam and/or double) pelleted and the ability of enzymes to withstand this heat treatment is questioned (Al Bustany, 1996). Controversy exits on the extent of the loss in enzyme activity and on the feed prop-erties that can diminish these losses. The nature of phytase makes it very susceptible to tempera-ture increments. This in fact is a property which needs to receive the attention of the industry since feed manufacturing thermal processes usually take place (Eeckhout, 1999). The intrinsic phytase in small grains is inactivated by steam pelleting at temperatures above 80 °C. Hydrothermal processes, such as pelleting, extrusion and expansion, were Effects of pelleting temperature of phytase supplemented broiler feed on tibia mineralization, calcium and phosphorus content of serum and performanc...|$|E

40|$|The {{weight and}} {{dimensional}} changes of injection molded glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 66 composites {{based on two}} glass fiber products with different sizing formulations and unreinforced polymer samples have been characterized during conditioning in water, ethylene glycol, and a water-glycol mixture at 508 C and 708 C {{for a range of}} times up to 900 h. The results reveal that hydrothermal ageing in these fluids causes significant changes in the weight and dimensions of these materials. All conditioned materials showed a time dependent weight and dimension increase. The change observed in water could be well modeled by a simple Fickian diffusion process; however, the absorption process followed a more complex pattern in the other conditioning fluids. It was not apparent that changing the glass fiber sizing affected the dimensional stability of the composites under these relatively mild conditions. There was a strong correlation between the swelling of these samples and the level of fluid absorption. The composites exhibited highly aniosotropic levels of swelling. These effects were well in line with the influence of fibers on restriction of the matrix deformation in the fiber direction. The polymer and composite swelling coefficients correlated well with data previously obtained at higher <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Liverpool Plains is {{a fertile}} {{agricultural}} region in New South Wales, Australia. Two sorghums from the 2009 Liverpool Plains harvest, sorghums # 3 and # 5, were extensively characterised which included concentrations of kafirin and phenolic compounds plus rapid visco-analysis (RVA) starch pasting profiles. Diets {{based on these}} two sorghums were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic and were offered to male Ross 308 broiler chicks from 7 to 28 days post [...] hatch as either intact pellets or reground mash following steam-pelleting at <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperatures</b> of either 65 or 97 °C. Thus the feeding study consisted of a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial array of dietary treatments: two sorghum varieties, two feed forms and two <b>conditioning</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Each of the eight treatments was replicated six times with six birds per replicate cage. Assessed parameters included growth performance, nutrient utilisation, apparent starch and protein (N) digestibility coefficients and disappearance rates from the distal jejunum and distal ileum. Intact pellets supported higher (P < 0. 001) feed intakes and weight gains by 9. 83 and 9. 08 %, respectively, than reground mash diets. Feed conversion ratios of broilers offered diets steam-conditioned at 97 °C were 2. 46 % inferior (P < 0. 001) in comparison to 65 °C diets and both apparent metabolizable energy (AME) and N-corrected AME (AMEn) were compromised. Broilers offered sorghum # 3 -based diets significantly (P < 0. 001) outperformed their sorghum # 5 counterparts in terms of weight gain by 3. 75 % (1, 334 versus 1, 223 g/bird), FCR by 4. 81 % (1. 524 versus 1. 601), AME by 1. 06 MJ (13. 61 versus 12. 55 MJ/kg), ME:GE ratio (ME:GE) by 4. 81 % (0. 806 versus 0. 769) and AMEn by 1. 03 MJ (12. 38 versus 11. 35 MJ/kg). The inferiority of sorghum # 5 appeared {{to be associated with}} higher concentrations of kafirin (61. 5 versus 50. 7 g/kg) and conjugated phenolic acids, including ferulic acid (31. 1 versus 25. 6 µg/g). There {{were no significant differences in}} jejunal and ileal starch and protein (N) digestibility coefficients between the two sorghums. However, starch to protein (N) disappearance rate ratios from the distal jejunum were significantly (P < 0. 001) correlated with ME:GE and AME. The multiple linear regression equations indicated that energy utilisation was enhanced by coupling rapidly digestible protein with slowly digestible starch, which suggests that bilateral bioavailability of starch and protein is pivotal to efficient energy utilisation...|$|R
