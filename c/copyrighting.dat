It also provided authoritative records about who owned the <b>copyright,</b> in case of disputes.|$|R

Consumers can obtain music for {{a certain amount of time}} easily and the consumer decides which artists receive the $100. The money can either be given to one artist or to many, the distribution is up to the consumer.|$|E
25|$|When Von Teese was a teenager, {{her mother}} {{took her to}} buy her first bra, made from plain white cotton, {{and gave her a}} plastic egg {{containing}} a pair of wrinkly, flesh-colored pantyhose. Von Teese says she was disappointed, as she had been hoping to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father's Playboy magazines. This fueled her passion for lingerie. She worked in a lingerie store as a salesgirl when she was 15, eventually as a buyer. Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as corsets and basques with fully fashioned stockings ever since. In college, Von Teese studied historic costuming and aspired to work as a stylist for films. She is a trained costume designer, often designing (and <b>copyrighting)</b> her photo shoots herself.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, the SARB {{took the}} step of <b>copyrighting</b> the Springbok emblem and Springbok colours as a badge under the Heraldry Act to {{pre-empt}} any other sporting body <b>copyrighting</b> it. The board initially declared, it {{was happy to}} share the Springbok colours providing that they were only awarded to white amateur sportspeople representing South Africa internationally. It was also an attempt to try and stop the South Africa national rugby league team from using the colours, though Rugby League South Africa circumvented this by developing {{their own version of}} the Springbok colours. Later legislation in 1971 was passed in order to enforce apartheid so that only white South Africans could be awarded Springbok colours though this later extended to those deemed as [...] "honorary whites". This came after three black Africans were awarded Springbok colours for competing in the World Paraplegic Games. Later {{as a result of the}} legislation, Glen Popham was not awarded Springbok colours following winning a gold medal in Karate in the 1969 South African Games alongside his white team, as his race was officially classified as Coloured which the South African National Olympic Committee were not aware of prior. As non-whites were not eligible to be selected for South African national sports teams, the Springbok colours came to be viewed as a symbol of white supremacy in apartheid South Africa because they were only awarded to white sportspeople.|$|E

While O'Neil and Adams' work was critically acclaimed, writer Steve Englehart and penciller Marshall Rogers's eight-issue run in Detective Comics #471–476 (August 1977-April 1978) defined the Joker for decades to come with stories emphasizing the character's insanity. In [...] "The Laughing Fish", the Joker disfigures fish with a rictus grin resembling his own (expecting copyright protection), and is unable to understand that <b>copyrighting</b> a natural resource is legally impossible. Englehart and Rogers' work on the series influenced the 1989 film Batman, and was adapted for 1992's [...] Rogers expanded on Adams' character design, drawing the Joker with a fedora and trench coat.

500|$|While {{flying back}} from New York, A.B. Quintanilla—the brother-producer of Selena—heard the Pretenders' 1983 single [...] "Back on the Chain Gang" [...] on the radio. At the time, A.B. {{was having a}} nervous {{breakdown}} after realizing he {{was running out of}} materials to record for Selena's fourth studio album, Amor Prohibido (1994). He likened the idea of reworking [...] "Back on the Chain Gang" [...] into a Spanish-language cumbia song. Keyboardist of the group, Ricky Vela wrote the Spanish lyrics into a cumbia-style that A.B. envisioned for the recording. The Amor Prohibido album was pressed for a release date of March 13, 1994, and was halted for distribution due to the <b>copyrighting</b> issues with [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos". Vela retold in a 2002 interview how he was awaken by Selena and A.B. because they did not have the clearance for [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos". Singer-songwriter Chrissie Hynde's music producers reported the song to Hynde who did not allow Selena to continue with [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] until she received an English-language writing of the song. It was only after Vela re-wrote the song into English that Hynde gave Selena the clearance for the recording. Musicologist James Perone, noticed how the song was the shortest track off of Amor Prohibido.

The new Russian copyright terms from the 1993 law became applicable to all works of authors who had died 1943 or later, or to works published in 1943 or later. For authors who had lived and worked during the Great Patriotic War, the copyright term was extended by four years; the corresponding year for such authors and their works was thus 1939. For work first published {{after the death of}} the author, the term started at the posthumous publication of the work, and for posthumously rehabilitated authors, the copyright term of the 1993 law began to run with their rehabilitation, making it possible that even older works were placed under copyright again in these casesexamples include the works of Boris Pilniak (executed in 1938, rehabilitated in 1957), Isaac Babel (executed 1940, rehabilitated 1954), or also Osip Mandelstam (died 1938, rehabilitated 1956/1987). Other authors on whose works copyright was restored were Anna Akhmatova (died 1966), Vera Mukhina (died 1953, sculptor of the statue [...] "Worker and Kolkhoz Woman"), Aleksey Shchusev (died 1949, architect of the Lenin Mausoleum), Aleksey Tolstoy (died 1945), and many others. An extreme example is Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita: the work was first published posthumously in 1966. At that time, the Soviet copyright term of then 15 years p.m.a. had already expired as Bulgakov had died in 1940.

40|$|This Essay {{studies the}} effect of Eldred v. Ashcroft on the {{treatment}} of aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims. Aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims test the boundaries of <b>copyright</b> by urging courts to adopt unconventional or novel readings of doctrine that would extend <b>copyright</b> well beyond its core of preventing individuals from reproducing the <b>copyrighted</b> works of others. Accordingly, aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims are often made against defendants who have done more than simply "parrot" a <b>copyrighted</b> work. These defendants have generally added meaningful work of their own, whether {{in the form of}} comment and criticism, significant reworking of the plaintiff's material, or new material unrelated to the <b>copyrighted</b> work. At their most extreme, aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims assert that almost any borrowing from a <b>copyrighted</b> work constitutes actionable infringement. Aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims are interesting because they illustrate the tension between <b>copyright</b> and the First Amendment. A defendant who combines original speech with material borrowed from a <b>copyrighted</b> source may commit infringement, but {{this does not mean that}} no free speech problems exist. <b>Copyright</b> judgments generally include injunctions that effectively prevent the defendant from publishing or disseminating any original speech contained in the infringing work. Aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims often raise significant First Amendment problems because they tend to be brought against defendants whose alleged infringements contain a significant amount of new speech. Unfortunately, courts have been overly receptive to aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims, at least in part because conventional wisdom states that courts can safely ignore First Amendment concerns in <b>copyright</b> because <b>copyright</b> doctrine somehow "naturally" takes account of First Amendment values. The Essay criticizes this conventional wisdom because it supports the success of aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims that do little to advance <b>copyright's</b> fundamental purposes. It goes on to argue that conventional wisdom must be changed, and that the Supreme Court has begun this process by recognizing the First Amendment's importance to <b>copyright</b> in the Eldred opinion. The Essay concludes by showing how proper recognition of the First Amendment in <b>copyright</b> affects the treatment of aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims. intellectual property law, <b>copyright</b> claims, Eldred v.
