40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{illustrate}} an unexplored illegal exploitation of legal businesses, with the purpose of limiting this market and especially the related transactions. The issue of transactions regarding illegal material executed with credit cards was solved through involving the companies who issues the credit cards, making the market more transparent and thus preventing this kind of transactions. The thesis will illustrate how cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are being exploited regarding illegal transactions and more specifically, transactions regarding selling and purchasing Child Abusive Material within file hosting services (<b>cyberlockers).</b> The analyzed data was gathered using a webcrawler and different methods for analyzing correlation were implemented on the data to find relationships between different data points. The data points were then clustered, using an algorithm to create a relationship network. The developed model analyzed the data to identify trends and patterns regarding the illegal transactions and the results can be used to find the most prominent users who are potential perpetrators that actively distributes illegal material. A deeper analysis is then performed on the, according to the model, most interesting users in an attempt to identify their underlying identity. When cryptocurrencies are used by perpetrators to pay and get paid for illegal material, the transaction flows cannot immediately be connected to specific identities and therefore it is required to first identify potential perpetrators and track their transactions, to later compare them with the transactions that has already been identified as payments for illegal material. Apart from this model, a framework has been created to identify certain patterns and trends regarding the cyberlockers’ transaction flows. This was performed through analysis of the transaction flows connected to <b>cyberlockers</b> that were suspected to contain Child Abusive Material or other illegal material. With the results from the first and second model, the most interesting <b>cyberlockers</b> for future investigations were discovered, according to the trends and patterns in their surrounding transaction flows. When that analysis was performed and the first model was implemented, potential perpetrators was identified through collaborations between the investigating unit, the Police, the <b>cyberlockers</b> in question and the relevant exchange services. Through this collaboration the identities of the perpetrators are revealed and the transaction flows can then be analyzed to limit further distribution of Child Abusive Material within <b>cyberlockers</b> and consequently limit the illegal transactions with cryptocurrencies.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{examines the}} role of music fans as cultural intermediaries who are active in the curation, archiving and promotion of progressive rock music. Fans not only work with the official products of the music industries, but also create, organise, discuss and circulate their own materials/information. In each case, fans act as ‘expert filters’ (Baym & Burnett, 2009) to source, sort, and upload/distribute music which has either been ‘forgotten’ by the mainstream recorded music industries (i. e. unavailable to purchase or to stream legally), or which has never otherwise been made officially {{available to the public}} by the bands or their representatives. The latter relates to live concert recordings (also known as ROIO, or ‘records of illegitimate origin’) which are sourced, edited, remastered and packaged by fans as not-for-profit bootlegs (Anderton, 2006). The former includes a range of internet blogs that publish links to music downloads via <b>cyberlockers</b> or video streaming sites. The blogs to be discussed in this paper typically focus on rare, private press or OOP (out-of-print) recordings, and may be themed (though not exclusively) around specific musical sub-genres or eras, or on music produced within specific countries.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the fan practice of record collecting (Shuker, 2010) as it has translated into the digital environment of the Internet, and begins to address one of several questions posed by Mark Duffett in Understanding Fandom: ‘to what extent is collecting premised on the ownership of the collected items or their rarity value’ (2013 : 179). Drawing on research into a range of music blogs, message boards and fan groupings, the article suggests that we may identify a shift from ‘record collecting’ towards ‘music collecting’, and that this shift might be conceptualised as a move from ‘secondary involvement’ (Shuker, 2010 : 168) to ‘tertiary involvement’. Secondary involvement involves a typically systematic approach to acquiring and collecting material culture, such as out-of-print (OOP), rare or private press vinyl releases, whereas ‘tertiary involvement’ involves the collection and accumulation of the music encoded within that material culture, {{in the form of}} digital data file formats such as MP 3 and FLAC. The music investigated in this article is that encoded in what Will Straw (2000) has called ‘obsolete objects’ – artefacts that persist long after their commercial life cycle and economic value is over; and that encoded in unofficially released recordings of live performances, whether in the form of commercially produced bootlegs (Marshall, 2005) or as not-for-profit bootlegs which are sourced, edited, remastered and packaged by fans (Anderton, 2006). Those involved in creating, distributing (via <b>cyberlockers,</b> torrents, direct download links or YouTube uploads) and/or collecting these music files are characterised as active and informal cultural intermediaries who curate, organise, archive, discuss, circulate and promote recordings and information, hence act as ‘expert filters’ online (Baym & Burnett, 2009).

40|$|Recently, <b>Cyberlocker</b> {{services}} have gained great {{popularity in the}} file-sharing market. Driven by tremendous benefits {{a large number of}} files such as popular movies are uploaded to Cyberlockers. We explore the profit chain of filesharing networks based on Cyberlockers and find that an important issue is how to collect the download URLs of popular files stored at different Cyberlockers and share them with public users. In this paper, we focus on these sites collecting and sharing the <b>Cyberlocker</b> URLs of movies, called <b>Cyberlocker</b> URL-sharing sites. First, we extract 1, 587 URL-sharing sites based on 31, 525 valid pages returned by Google search and demonstrate that the quality distribution of these sites follows a power-law. Second, we analyze the link citations among URLsharing sites and build the directed link citation graph. By characterizing basic metrics of the graph, such as cited strength and in/out-degree, we understand the structure of URL-sharing sites in depth. Furthermore, we discover that <b>Cyberlocker</b> URLs can be disseminated dynamically through crawler mechanisms among different sites, and highlight the implications of such metrics in this context. Additionally, we study the security risks of 1, 587 URL-sharing sites. The results show that security risks do exist when surfing 155 suspicious URL-sharing sites such as myrls. me and rapid 4 me. com although the majority sites (90. 23 %) are safe.

40|$|In the 1990 s, the {{introduction}} of World Wide Web led a rapid {{growth in the number}} of web users, which resulted in new challenges. The Internet turned computer crimes into transnational crimes. In the 21 st century, new trends in computer crimes and cybercrimes were continuously discovered. The methods of committing crimes became sophisticated, such as Internet piracy in which the offender used anonymous <b>cyberlocker</b> services to distribute copyrighted resources. With these increasing challenges, countries have given response to cybercrimes with higher priority. A reliable framework which is able to profile and track the user identity is helpful for law enforcement agencies in investigating cybercrimes. In this dissertation, we studies two issues in relation to web user profiling and tracking. First, the data left on a computer is crucial to detect the user identity. Since user’s online behavior characteristics and interest patterns can be extracted from web browser history, we proposed a web user identification model that is based on profiling technique. The model constructed the user profile based on his/her web browsing activities. Two aspects of browsing behavior were examined to construct the profile, namely the user’s page view number (PVN) and page view time (PVT) for each browsed domain. Combined with Term Frequency (TF) and Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) weighing scheme, four weighing models were proposed and compared to find profiles which were similar to the target profile. There is a high probability that these resulting profiles belong to the same person as the target profile in real world. Experiments were conducted on 51 computers in real world, and our results revealed that the model can be used to uniquely identify web users effectively. The performance of TFIDF is generally better than TF, and TFIDF-PVN weighing model achieves the best result for recognizing accurate web users. Second, besides the data left on a computer, much digital evidence can be found on the Internet. In recent years, <b>cyberlocker</b> services become popular that facilitates people to distribute infringing copies of copyrighted media on the Internet. Therefore, we studied the issue of cyberlocker-based piracy. Due to the anonymity property of <b>cyberlocker,</b> we proposed a model to collect data related to <b>cyberlocker</b> from public forums, on which the sharing behavior of <b>cyberlocker</b> links can be connected to a specific user. Then we built the forum user profiles based on their sharing activities of <b>cyberlocker</b> links. The relationships between different profiles were analyzed by multidimensional scaling analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis. We are able to detect forum users with similar sharing behaviors. Furthermore, we introduced five categories of behavioral characteristics to construct more comprehensive profiles. Experiments were conducted on real data collected from popular forums in Hong Kong and the results indicated the model can effectively detect profiles with similar file sharing characteristics for identity tracking. The model also generated taxonomy of forum users containing several general profiles, which can help law enforcement agencies to determine the behaviorial patterns of <b>cyberlocker</b> link sharing for different types of users. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|File - hosting websites, often {{referred}} to as ‘cyberlockers’, {{play a central role in}} today’s digital media landscape. Rapidshare, YouSendIt, FileSonic, HotFile and other sites which allow easy downloading of digital files via a URL link constitute an informal mode of media distribution. They have profoundly changed how music, film, TV and books circulate, and are considered by entertainment industry groups to be among the most m enacing weapons in the arsenal of digital piracy. Yet the <b>cyberlocker</b> business model is changing rapidly as a result of changes in law and policy. In the wake of recent events – including the closure of Megaupload and the arrest of Kim Dotcom in January 20 12 – this distribution ecology is now profoundly unstable. The paper begins by outlining the history of the <b>cyberlocker</b> as a media distribution platform and discussing its peculiar status as a quasi - ‘social’ media technology. It then offers some examples of recent changes in <b>cyberlocker</b> services available in the Asia - Pacific region. The second half of the paper focuses on the transnational dimensions of cyberlockers and the media distribution they facilitate. Cyberlockers are a global phenomenon: local - lan guage services operate in most territories; the shadier operators organize their businesses in a way that leverages jurisdictional differences and enforcement weaknesses; and the cultural flows they facilitate are unimpeded by territorial copyright.

40|$|Kim Dotcom, {{founder of}} Megaupload Limited, {{has been in}} many news {{headlines}} over the past year. Megaupload—one of Dotcom’s many peer-to-peer sharing sites—was the center of controversy, as it allowed users to upload and share all sorts of files, including copyrighted material. After an organized effort by the Department of Justice and several foreign governments, Dotcom was arrested for (secondary) copyright infringement and his site was ultimately shut down. Dotcom has recently launched a new service, MEGA, which he claims will evade copyright laws entirely. Like other well-known cloud-sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Drive, MEGA allows users to upload files and to share them with select users. In an attempt to avoid liability, MEGA locally encrypts all files on the user’s computer before they are uploaded to the site. The private key and public key used to encrypt and decrypt the file are retained solely by the user; MEGA gets no part of that information.

40|$|In this presentation, {{music fans}} are characterised as {{cultural}} intermediaries who have important roles to play within popular music culture. They are active {{not only in}} curating, collecting and archiving the material culture produced and circulated by the music industries, but also in creating, organising, discussing and circulating their own materials/information. The development of online networks of communication, storage and distribution has allowed more fans to engage in these practices, but has also led to conflicts regarding copyright and ownership, and to the apparent co-opting of fan networks, products and free labour for the commercial gain of the music industries. This talk will discuss two forms of fan-led cultural production. Firstly, there is the not-for-profit trading of live concert recordings, including remaster projects and pseudo- record labels created by fans and fan networks. These curate, collect and distribute recordings of live performances that would not otherwise be available through ‘traditional’ commercial record company sources, and so build alternative canons and histories for artists. Secondly, there are blogging sites that curate rare, private press and OOP (out of print) recordings that are otherwise impossible to find from legitimate streaming and download sites, or from primary retail sources (though some may appear as ‘second-hand’ copies in online marketplaces such as Musicstack, Eil, eBay, Gemm and so on).

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} links between film {{cultures}} and film distribution. What happens to film culture when a film is passed between friends on a USB, or downloaded from a <b>cyberlocker,</b> or purchased on a copied DVD at a local grocery store? Beyond the cinema and the major commercial players of the formal sector, film now lives in a multiplex of different access points, from iTunes downloads, legal BitTorrent releases, host-your-own community screenings and free YouTube streams. New forms of distribution beyond the dominant commercial players are not just restructuring the film industry, they are presenting theoretical challenges to film scholars. As disruptions and innovations in the industry, these trends speak to the research questions: How to conceptualise new forms of distribution not previously subjected to scholarly analysis? How do audiences in Australia access film today? How does the distribution of a film influence the terms of its use and reception by audiences? This thesis takes a multi-method path to interrogate the cultural-economic exchanges within the distribution screenscape and a diversity of distribution circuits. Case studies include Australia’s formal distribution sector, Sydney Film Festival analysed as a distributor and new and disruptive digital circuits such as the BitTorrent Now e-store. Combining industrial analysis, interviews with distributors and ethnographic observation, this thesis contributes to new knowledge in three major ways. First, throughout film studies, distribution has been primarily analysed as an industrial phenomenon. I attune distribution research to the phenomenon of film culture, showing how distribution and exhibition play into the contingent life of film culture. Second, I expose emerging forms of distribution to scholarly examination, namely cinema-on-demand, crowdfunding and e-stores that legally use file-sharing technologies {{to the advantage of}} film producers. Third, the thesis develops a new conceptualisation of distribution, moving from the historically dominant commercial conceptualisation of distribution – the sale of films through various platforms, territories and ancillary markets – to a view of distribution as the means of a film’s arrival in a distribution screenscape dominated by informal and ancillary circuits...|$|E
40|$|Like {{money for}} jam, journalists {{have found their}} demon figure, their {{publicity}} machine, {{in the form of}} anti-copyright maestro Kim Dotcom. He is a figure of capacious girth with a string of white collar crimes that would make some blush and others envious. Most just know him as Kim Schmitz, who made copyright violations lucrative and established an online empire that has been the scourge of authorities the world over. (Read: the US copyright system, with its compliant backers.)   The label attached to the German cyber maverick has stuck, largely because of the man’s own self-publicizing exploits. Whether actual or alleged, they have been many. ‘Mega’ is the term that is thrown in with his various titles: MegaPorn, MegaVideo, MegaLive, MegaPix, Megaupload. Like the horsemen of the apocalypse, ‘Kim Dotcom’ and his profligate coevals rode in with effortless and merciless ease, strafing targets for value with unusually expansive bandwith while enabling millions to participate in the scheme. Again, the battle over the ‘freedoms’ of the internet come to the fore: laws established to supposedly protect the integrity of a product, and the insatiable appetite of the broader masses to acquire them. Last week, the US government, {{with the help of a}} string of assisting authorities (Netherlands, UK, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Philippines) seized the domain names of Megaupload, pressed the police in New Zealand to arrest several of the site’s operators, amongst them Kim Dotcom himself, and freeze some $ 50 million in assets. Prosecutors, in an indictment lodged in a Virginia federal court, charge that the site has earned more than $ 175 million since 2005, the majority of derived from the fruits of copyright violations. In addition to Kim Dotcom are five other figures who are apparently part of a ‘Mega Conspiracy’ and have a habit of using unimaginative license plates. The case is now being heard in New Zealand which will decide on whether Dotcom’s extradition to the US is warranted. The prosecution has opposed bail. The politicians are getting nervous – US copyright guardians are feared, even in these corners. Questions are being asked regarding Dotcom’s residency status. The jittery Winston Peters, leader of the nationalist New Zealand First Party, has already dubbed the affair around the German nation as ‘this immigration scandal’. The <b>cyberlocker</b> business Schmitz co-founded in 2005 has become so formidable a threat it is deemed greater than the service provided by The Pirate Bay. Megaupload, a Hong Kong based entity, enables millions to access unauthorized copies of TV software, TV shows, films, songs and, of course, good lashings of porn. Those in the television and film business have been steaming away in fury, looking at Megaupload fill its coffers from subscriptions to locker services provided by the company. <b>Cyberlocker</b> services are said to be less awkward than BitTorrent systems, which gives them broader reach and accessibility. Last year, the adult-entertainment company Perfect 10 mounted an action against Megaupload, beginning the corporate onslaught on the site. A US District Judge in LA rejected Megaupload’s motion to dismiss the suit by Perfect 10 against the company for uploading pirated content to the cyberlockers the company possesses (CNet, Aug 4, 2011). If the internet is a bastion of untrammeled freedoms, a medium of expression, one wonders how laws of private property could be relevant. But the Internet and history’s most effective scribe, Karl Marx are not necessarily good bedfellows here, at least when it comes to the copyright regulators who seek to encase the world in a cocoon of corporate ‘protections’. When the individuals concerned work for the vanguard of asinine products such as the Motion Picture Association of America, representing Hollywood’s six largest film companies, piracy does not merely become a privilege, it becomes a duty. Muck, after all, should be dispersed. For the US authorities keen to prosecute the matter, the pursuit of happiness is a circumscribed and carefully policed mission. Especially if that pursuit is taking place in distant New Zealand. The locals have certainly found Kim Dotcom a rich food to stomach, be it his $ 30 million residence, extensive car collection or his heavily conspicuous consumption. Much of the dislike shown against Kim Dotcom and his unappealing company is a matter of taste and realization. This is personal, and the US authorities have made no secret of that fact. Why not sue the company name instead? Dotcom comes across as the figure who needs to be dealt with by the forces of order, unsavory, insatiable, a cavorter. He is the fat man on the outside of every thin woman wanting and biding his time to get in. He is a past convict of insider trading. The Dotcom case is a battle in miniature about the cyber world and what users can or can’t do. Much of what he and his team have done is legitimate. As James Grimmelmann of New York Law School observes, ‘If proven at trial, there’s easily enough in the indictment to prove criminal copyright infringement many times over. But much of what the indictment details are legitimate business strategies many website use to increase their traffic and revenues: offering premium subscriptions, running ads, rewarding active users’ (Ars Technica, Jan 19). But more to the point, and much to the terror of the copyright gatekeepers, it is a battle over an attempt to fence in the world of providers and users and bring order to the refuse of the pleasure jungle.
