The mechanical behavior of FRP-confined <b>concrete</b> <b>filled</b> steel tube is mainly related to the equivalent confinement effect coefficient before the rupture of FRP.

A tunnel {{was required}} because the land above the tunnel {{was being used}} by the Army for a parade ground and golf course, so leaving an open cut for the highway was impossible.

Tunnel sections were built in 28 ft lengths, and work was started from each end of the tunnel, working towards the center, allowing two to three sections of tunnel to be completed per week. The open cut-and-cover method was deemed economical because of the relatively small amount of material that would need to be removed.|$|E

The Vermont & Canada and the Vermont Central (headquartered in Northfield, VT) merged sometime prior to 1853. The original alignment passed through what is now downtown Burlington, and the depot was located two blocks south of the current City Hall. [...] The 8-mile section, part of the original Vermont Central mainline between Windsor, VT and Burlington, VT was completed in 1848. It required three wooden bridges over the Winooski River. These were replaced with steel truss bridges at a later date. At the site of the tunnel, the unusual formation of the ridge—accreted sand rather than underlying ledge—posed an enormous challenge to Daniel Chipman Linsley, engineer (1827-1889), and D.J. Morrison, construction chief, who both worked for the railroad. Reportedly Daniel Chipman Linsley's hair turned white prematurely, possibly resulting from the stress of the project. Linsley and Morrison had a wooden arch built that matched the intended shape of the tunnel, then advanced the wooden arch close behind the digging to support the ceiling of the newly bored hole. The <b>concrete</b> <b>fill</b> was laid in above the wooden arch, and the bricklaying crews finished the lining once the wooden arch rate of some 3 feet per day. The crew of 85 workers, split into 12-hour shifts so that work could progress 24 hours a day, labored through the winter of 1860-1861 to complete the tunnel by May 1861.|$|E

Concrete {{is one of}} the main materials used to construct the columns and this technology has seen substantial improvements and various innovations over the last two hundred years. The uses of concrete-filled tube (CFT) as column member become more popular in recent years due to various advantages such as increased capacity and stiffness as well as significant reduction in maintenance cost over reinforced concrete columns. Basically CFT referred to a tube filled with <b>concrete</b> <b>fill.</b> The tube acts as both longitudinal and transverse reinforcement to the concrete while providing confining pressure. Until recent years steel was used to construct the tube (‘can’) due to its favorable properties and availability. In recent years, increasing studies on the applications of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) in structures have been reported. In line with this trend, a number of studies were reported on the use of FRP ‘can’ in such CFT members, particularly in mining applications. Such FRP ‘cans’ are preferred in mining application because of the portability due to its light weight compared to steel. This paper presents a brief review of the application of FRP ‘can’ in structural engineering and a preliminary experimental investigation in the behavior of a concrete filled FRP ‘can’ under axial loading. The compressive strength and failure modes of the FRP CFTs were obtained by varying the slenderness ratios of CFTs. The results are analyzed and discussed in terms of the effects of both slenderness ratio and lateral confinement due to the FRP ‘can’ on the stress state and therefore, on failure mode and strength behaviour...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Townsville’s former General Hospital site is {{undergoing}} a major redevelopment that includes the construction of twelve elevated, level residential allotments with commanding views across Cleveland Bay towards Magnetic Island. To achieve the above development objectives, a large quantity of fill is required and most importantly {{will need to be}} retained to construct the allotments. Numerous methods of retainment were investigated and the reinforced earth option was discovered to be the most feasible. A recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>fill</b> material, crushed to 100 mm minus, was proposed {{to be used in the}} reinforced earth structure. This material was a result of the demolition of numerous buildings from within the site. External advice suggested that the 100 mm minus material would not integrate sufficiently with the reinforcement (Tensar Geogrid) and would need to be crushed further to a 75 mm minus material. This would help to provide enough resistance to achieve the correct pullout characteristics of the reinforcement. The objective is to create a testing apparatus that makes it possible to test the interaction of the Tensar Geogrid reinforcement with the various gradings of crushed recycled concrete material. These tests can then be analysed to confirm interaction calculations and the design of the reinforced earth structure. A plywood box is constructed to allow the compaction of various grades of crushed concrete within. A similar grade of Tensar grid is used for each test and located centrally within the material. The reinforcement material extrudes from the box allowing a force to be applied. A load gauge records the pullout force applied to pull the Tensar grid from the apparatus. The results from the individual tests undertaken are analysed against calculations made for the various types of material. The results are then compared against each other to indicate the ability of interaction and performance under load. Preliminary analysis indicates that failure strength is similar for all tests undertaken, however the rate of failure gives a good indication of the interaction characteristics of the materials...|$|E

40|$|Lightweight Foamed <b>Concrete</b> <b>Fill</b> (LFCF), {{also known}} as {{cellular}} concrete, has been growing in use in transportation infrastructure projects over recent years. LFCF is a versatile construction material that has now been in use for over 30 years. A number of recent road rehabilitation projects have demonstrated some {{of the benefits of}} use. With a greater emphasis on sustainability on all provincial and municipal road projects, new solutions are being sought to minimize the generation of waste and deliver better performing pavements that require less maintenance interventions. Roads over peat and organic deposits pose challenges for road agencies. They are subject to continual and long term settlements that necessitate frequent patch repairs. The downside of such repairs is that the additional weight of the new asphalt, triggers further settlement. Traditionally, permanent solutions have necessitated the total reconstruction of the road section and removal of the underlying organic layers. This is expensive, creates huge traffic disruptions, generates waste and consumes large volumes of aggregate for the reinstatement. The use of lightweight fill offers an alternative as it allows the pavement to be ‘floated’ above the organic layer. However, the traditional lightweight materials, such as polystyrene, have been prohibitively expensive for such applications. In recent years, LFCF has been successfully used as a cost effective solution in road works. LFCF is a foamed, pumpable, cementitious fill with a density of only 475 kg/m 3, about a quarter of that of conventional granular fill. With a compressive strength of at least 0. 5 MPa, it has sufficient strength to support pavement loads. However, the real advantages relate to constructability, since the material can be installed very quickly, minimizes excavation time, can be placed in winter and does not require conventional compaction or associated testing. This paper will provide an overview of the use of LFCF for road works, including typical specifications, quality control/assurance requirements, and performance based on a number of case study applications...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of a decade of research at the University of Wollongong, University of Western Sydney and University of New South Wales into the behaviour and design of the impact and blast loading of steel and <b>concrete</b> <b>filled</b> steel members. The paper will review research carried out to ascertain the material properties of steel and concrete at high strain rates. Furthermore, the flexural impact behaviour of hollow and <b>concrete</b> <b>filled</b> steel columns will be reviewed. More recent research also summarises live field blast tests on hollow and <b>concrete</b> <b>filled</b> steel columns subjected to transverse blast loading. This paper will also outline the development of a National Facility for Physical Blast Simulation (NFPBS) in Australia which was awarded funding by the Australian Research Council Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities Scheme in 2013 and which is being prepared for installation and commissioning in 2014 at University of New South Wales...|$|R
