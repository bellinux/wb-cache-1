The 4th Canadian Division {{was responsible for the}} northern portion of the advance that included the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> the highest point of the ridge followed by the heavily defended Pimple just west of the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle. The 3rd Canadian Division was responsible for the narrow central section of the ridge, including the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> La Folie Farm. The 2nd Canadian Division, which later included an additional brigade from the 5th British Division, was directly south of 3rd Canadian Division and entrusted with the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> the village of Thélus.

The objective {{this study was to}} analyze reproductive data of Sturnira lilium from long-term sampling carried out in several sites in Rio de Janeiro states, southeastern Brazil. We carried out sampling in 42 sites (with altitudes ranging from sea level to 1300 m a. s. l.) from May 1989 to December 2011. In total, we obtained 2602 <b>captures</b> <b>of</b> S. lilium: 1242 <b>captures</b> <b>of</b> adult females, 1225 <b>captures</b> <b>of</b> adult males, and 136 <b>captures</b> <b>of</b> subadults. The sex ratio was 0. 99 males: 1 female. The reproductive season varied from eight to twelve months a year, and it was not related to the total accumulated rainfall. Sturnira lilium have continuously polyestrous reproduction with postpartum estrus and pregnant females can be observed in all months except July. In the present study, the highest proportions of pregnant females were observed in the months with the highest rainfall...|$|R
