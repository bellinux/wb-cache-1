40|$|The {{influence}} of the reproductive status was tested in the blood serum of 30 sheep (10 pregnant sheep on the 15 th day prior to lambing, 10 lactating sheep on the 20 th day of the lactation and 10 non-pregnant sheep). The {{influence of}} age was determined in the blood serum of 20 sheep and 20 lambs. Analysis {{of the impact of}} age in sheep and lamb on the concentration of thyroid hormones showed that 30 -day old lambs had significantly higher (P< 0. 01) concentration of T 3 and T 4 compared to the other age <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep.</b> At the same time, 100 -day old lambs had significantly higher concentration of T 4 if compared to the 1 and 3 -year old sheep. Referring to the reproductive status, there was significantly lower (P< 0. 01) concentration of T 3 determined in the blood of lactating sheep than of nonpregnant and pregnant sheep. These findings point out unsatisfactory energy supply in the older sheep, sheep during late pregnancy and sheep at the beginning of lactation...|$|E
40|$|Serological assay (virus {{neutralization}} test - VNT) {{was employed to}} examine blood sera collected from sheep of different age categories reared under different housing systems for the presence of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and Border disease virus (BDV) infections in sheep. The objective of the investigation in sheep as reservoir hosts of the viruses was to clarify the potential for their transmission to cattle herds and vice versa. Experimental Group A included 5 mini farms composed entirely of sheep that were not in cohabitation with cattle in the same buildings or on the same pasture. Experimental Group B was made up of five mini sheep farms, whose owners raised cattle as well. A total of 10 blood samples (5 from junior <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> aged up to 12 months and 5 from the older sheep) were secured from each of the 10 mini farms selected for the study. The VNT method did not detect the presence of specific anti-BVDV antibodies to both BVDV genotypes (BVDV- 1 and BVDV- 2) in any of the 100 test blood serum samples of sheep. Specific anti-BDV antibodies to the BDV Moredun strain were not found in any of the test serum samples of 100 sheep...|$|E
40|$|Selenium {{deficiency}} occurs {{mainly in}} young cat-egories of farm animals and in high-performing animals (Kursa, 1969; Pavlata et al., 2001 a). In {{the majority of}} the production herds of farm animals general Se supplementation is a condition for main-taining their health (Pavlata et al., 2004) and a suf-ficient amount of Se in animal products (Travnicek et al., 2006). A low selenium content in soils (Pavlata et al., 2002) causes selenium deficiency in the Czech Republic. The blood serum of the CR population contains only 42 – 63 µg Se/l (Kvicala et al., 2003). In some areas of Southern Bohemia Kvicala and Kroupova (1999) reported only 2 – 5 µg Se/l in the blood plasma of cattle. The required daily selenium intake in ruminants varies from 100 to 300 µg/kg DM according to feed digestibility, age and perfor-mance (Schenkel and Flachowsky, 2000) while in the Czech Republic an amount of 200 µg Se/kg DM is recommended for all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep.</b> The supply of Se to animals is evaluated according to its content in blood, urine and/or excrements and tis-sues, indirectly according to the activity of the en-zyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). According to Stowe and Herdt (1992) an optimum selenium level in the blood serum of sheep is 120 – 150 µg/...|$|E

40|$|Kari sheep is an {{important}} genetic resource of Pakistan endemic to Chitral in North Western Frontier Province of Pakistan. The objective {{of the present study}} was to establish karyotype of this breed. Blood samples from five representative specimens <b>of</b> Kari <b>sheep,</b> including one ram and four ewes, were examined for chromosomal spread from metaphase of the lymphocyte culture. Animals for this purpose were brought to Peshawar, as traveling to nearest laboratory with 12 hours was difficult. The homologous chromosomes were arranged in pairs in their descending order and size. Diploid number of chromosomes in Kari sheep were 54 (27 pairs), including 26 autosome pairs and one sex-chromosome pair. The chromosome array in ewes was similar to ram, except for the sex chromosome. Both the homologous sex chromosomes (XX) in ewes were large but similar.

40|$|Paratuberculosis is {{an incurable}} chronic disease of ruminants, which is {{manifested}} with clinical signs of diarrhea and progressive weight loss. Causative agent is Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, and the disiase occurs in cattle, sheep and goats. The outspread of paratuberculosis is huge {{in the whole}} world, especially in the countries where animal breeding is a developed branch of economy. Animals get infected with food and water contaminated with feces of infected animals. The infection spreads within infected pastures and also when trading animals with latent infection. Clinical manifestation of the disease can firstly be noticed in young <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep,</b> which is different than in cattle. Primary clinical symptom is chronic weight loss. It is rather hard to determine the level of prevalence of the disease, in a certain region, because the diagnostic procedure is complex and not always reliable enough. Detection of antibodies with ELISA test is considered a method of choice for diagnostic of paratuberculosis, because of fast gaining of the results and relatively low price of the test. By applying the ELISA test, we have analysed 2000 sheep blood samples. Positive results for paratuberculosis were found in 66 (3, 30 %) animals in total. In sheep samples from southern Backa region, positive findings were gained from 42 (3, 89 %) samples, and in Srem region, positive finding were found in samples from 24 sheep (2, 60 %). Control programs {{are based on the}} removal of all infected animals, application of general preventive measures and vaccination. Application of vaccination aims for elimination of clinical form of the disease. An effective treatment has not been determined so far...|$|E
40|$|The method {{described}} in the previous paper was used to induce secondary responses in spleen cells from CBA/H mice, pre-primed with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus by culturing them with LCM-infected peritoneal cells. The cytolytic effector cells thus generated have been characterized. Effector cells were sensitive to treatment with anti-theta ascitic fluid and complement. Separation procedures based on rosetting <b>of</b> certain <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> lymphocytes with <b>sheep</b> red cells through an Isopaque-Ficoll gradient indicated that effector cells lacked surface immunoglobulin and generally did not bear Fc receptors. Cytolytic activity was restricted by the H- 2 gene complex. Killing had single-hit characteristics. All these results suggested that the cells from memory cultures mediating cytolysis were T cells. There was evidence for two T cell subsets, a major subpopulation directed against antigens on infected targets and a minor one directed against antigens on uninfected, H- 2 -compatible targets. Specificity {{was present at the}} infected cell:memory responder and killer:target levels between LCM virus (an arenavirus) and ectromelia virus (a poxvirus) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} {{the influence of}} the dingo (Canis lupus dingo) on the past, present and future distributions <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> in Australia. Design The role of the dingo in the rise and fall <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> numbers is reviewed, revised data are provided on the present distribution and density <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> and dingoes, and historical patterns <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> distribution are used to explore the future <b>of</b> rangeland <b>sheep</b> grazing. Results Dingoes are a critical causal factor in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> at the national, regional and local levels. Dingo predation contributed substantially to the historical contraction <b>of</b> the <b>sheep</b> industry to its present-day distribution, which is almost exclusively confined to areas within fenced dingo exclusion zones. Dingo populations and/or their influence are now present and increasing in all <b>sheep</b> production zones <b>of</b> Australia, inclusive of areas that were once dingo free'. Conclusions Rangeland production <b>of</b> wool and <b>sheep</b> meat is predicted to disappear within 30 - 40 years if the present rate of contraction of the industry continues unabated. Understanding the influence <b>of</b> dingoes on <b>sheep</b> production may help refine disease response strategies and help predict the future distribution <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> and their diseases...|$|R
