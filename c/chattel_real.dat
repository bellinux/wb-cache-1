5000|$|The motion made in {{the circuit}} court to modify the decree {{was based on the}} idea, that while the term for years might be a <b>chattel</b> <b>real,</b> the machinery, buildings, fixtures, and {{improvements}} placed on the land should have been sold as personal property. As the statute requires that real estate [...] "shall" [...] be sold {{at the door of the}} courthouse, the visible property could not be sold there in view of the persons attending the sale of the real estate, unless it was first severed from the land, and to have so treated it would, doubtless, have rendered not only it but the term for years worthless, as vendible articles. No such result could have been contemplated by the lawmakers, and none such can be allowed, if another reasonable and consistent construction is to be found.|$|E

This study is a normative legal research with the research question as follow, “Can the elements of torts be implemented to the creditor or fiduciary assignee so that the creditoris considered doing the unlawful act?” The primary data are used in the study.

40|$|John Carter 2 ̆ 7 s paper {{provides}} a good discussion of many fundamental {{problems associated with the}} satisfactory enforcement of contractual obligations. In reviewing the various subtopics of the conference, he posits a scale of 2 ̆ 7 security 2 ̆ 7 for performance that runs from simple reliance on the promisor 2 ̆ 7 s word to that of the <b>chattel</b> or <b>real</b> property mortgage with maximum rights of self-help in the promisee. In this commentary on his paper, I will argue that the greatest security for any promisee remains the word of the promisor and that this is so for reasons beyond those of honour. First, the duty of good faith imposes on contracting parties an obligation, independent of their mutual covenants, to perform their undertakings. Second, this same duty of good faith often imposes limitations on the self-help remedies of a secured party, especially when it is coupled with the general dislike of forfeiture. Third, the duty of good faith is consistent with the usual expectations of contracting parties in a commercial setting who rely more often on the development of long term relationships of trust and predictable performance than on the security of proprietary interests...|$|R
40|$|The author {{publishes a}} new and {{improved}} reading of the {{last will and testament}} of Marko Marulić written on June 14 1521 {{on the basis of the}} two extant MSS, the Zagreb and the Zadar. The will is extremely important for the study of the personality of Marulić. The important elements of law history are also investigated. Marulić’s testament is a good example of a will drawn up according to the principles of what was called universal law. It does, it is true, reflect the distant ideas of Roman Law, which via post-classical (4 th to 6 th century), Justinian’s (mid-th century) and the Langobard-Frankish law were subject to tumultuous development and amalgamated with the system that was in force in western Europe, including in this the law of the Dalmatian towns. An essential feature of this type of testament was the division of assets into conditional (bona conditionata) and free (bona libera) assets. This differentiation derived from Croatian-Hungarian law, which underwent many modifications in Split. The will to a great extent relates to the rights of Jelena, the widow of Marulić’s brother Valerius, and to a list of Jelena’s <b>chattels</b> and <b>real</b> property. In an appendix to the introductory study is a critical edition of the wording of the will, and the first translation of it into Croatian. It was edited and translated by Lujo Margetić. The will contains an extensive list of Marulić’s books, which gives a useful insight into how well-read Marulić was. The edition and Croatian translation of the list are by Bratislav Lučin...|$|R

50|$|In the Remigiusland, Konken {{was subject}} to the lordship of either the Bishopric of Reims or the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims, {{but in terms of}} ecclesiastical organization, it belonged to the Archbishopric of Mainz. Either way, the village was the hub of a parish. It is unknown when a church was ﬁrst built in Konken, but it was likely in the Early Middle Ages. If the church that still stands now goes back to 1124, then there must once have been an older one. The church’s patron saint before the Reformation was Vitus (or locally, Veith). The mediaeval nave was {{replaced}} in 1771 with a spacious aisleless church. The old tower was kept, but later also underwent considerable alterations. Also belonging to the parish, besides Konken, were the villages of Albessen, Herchweiler, Herschweiler, Krottelbach (the part {{to the left of the}} brook), Langenbach, Unter-Selchenbach and Pettersheim. There were changes now and then, but in general, this arrangement is the one that held true. After the Reformation was introduced, which was binding on everyone, the hitherto autonomous parish of Quirnbach also long belonged to Konken, bringing along with it not only Quirnbach, but also Frutzweiler, Liebsthal, Rehweiler, Sangerhof and Trahweiler. As well as the 1556 Weistum mentioned above, an ecclesiastical one (a Kirchenweistum) has also survived from the Church of Konken. By the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, all the villagers had to convert in 1523 to Lutheranism, and in 1588, at Count Palatine Johannes I’s behest, everyone had to convert again, this time to Calvinism. In the times of the Thirty Years' War and French King Louis XIV’s wars of conquest, the parish of Niederkirchen in the Oster valley was likewise attached to the Church of Konken, although it was split away again as a parish in its own right in 1710. The parish of Quirnbach, too, along with all the villages associated with it, was eventually split off to become autonomous again once the population had grown so quickly in the 18th and 19th centuries. Even though other denominations were once again allowed after the Thirty Years' War, the villagers all remained Reformed (Calvinist) up to the merger of the Calvinist and Lutheran Churches in the 1818 Palatine Union. Roman Catholic Christians settled sporadically only in the course of the 19th century. Even today, Konken is the hub of a major Evangelical church community within the deaconry of Kusel, while Catholics belong to the Catholic church community and the Catholic deaconry of Kusel. Since there were formerly many Jews living in the village, Judaism earned itself some importance. In the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken before the Thirty Years' War, Jews stood under strict surveillance. They were allowed to “…lend usuriously neither a townsman nor a subject something, whether by pledge, or on the strength of jewels or clothes, or <b>chattels</b> or <b>real</b> property, without the authorities’ foreknowledge and approval.” They were once even forbidden the right to represent themselves in court. Under these circumstances, only a few Jews settled in the principality at ﬁrst, which is not to say that they did not come in greater numbers later, towards the end of the 17th century, despite lingering reprisals, settling mostly in bigger villages and smaller towns as tradesmen. Many of them lived with a minimal livelihood. A few of them amassed great fortunes through trade, but very few of them ever made careers of being ofﬁcials. With a population that was just short of 10% Jewish in 1825, Konken, at the time in the Oberamt of Lichtenberg, was said to be a village with a particularly high Jewish population (Odenbach was 8% Jewish and Steinbach, then Leyen domain, though, was 29% Jewish). It is to be noted that there was strong Jewish migration in the early 19th century. In 1835, there were 85 Jews in Konken, almost 15% of the inhabitants at that time. To this great Jewish community, which also comprised some Jews outside the village, belonged a Judenschultheiß. There was a synagogue in Konken, which was most likely built in the earlier half of the 19th century. By the latter half of the 19th century, though, the Jewish population was already beginning to shrink. There were still 24 Jews living in Konken in 1919, but by 1933, the same year that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power, only 14 were still living in the village. After 1933, most of those remaining left the village. The last Jewish inhabitant was taken away by the Nazis in 1940 and deported to the Gurs internment camp in the South of France.|$|R
