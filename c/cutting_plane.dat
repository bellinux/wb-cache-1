25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{the problem}} became {{increasingly}} popular in scientific circles in Europe and the USA after the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica offered prizes for steps {{in solving the}} problem. Notable contributions were made by George Dantzig, Delbert Ray Fulkerson and Selmer M. Johnson from the RAND Corporation, who expressed the problem as an integer linear program and developed the <b>cutting</b> <b>plane</b> method for its solution. They wrote what is considered the seminal paper on the subject in which with these new methods they solved an instance with 49 cities to optimality by constructing a tour and proving that no other tour could be shorter. Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson, however, speculated that given a near optimal solution {{we may be able}} to find optimality or prove optimality by adding a small amount of extra inequalities (cuts). They used this idea to solve their initial 49 city problem using a string model. They found they only needed 26 cuts to come to a solution for their 49 city problem. While this paper did not give an algorithmic approach to TSP problems, the ideas that lay within it were indispensable to later creating exact solution methods for the TSP, though it would take 15 years to find an algorithmic approach in creating these cuts. As well as <b>cutting</b> <b>plane</b> methods, Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson used branch and bound algorithms perhaps for the first time.|$|E

These miter slots (or miter grooves) are used to position and guide either a miter gauge (also known as a crosscut fence) or crosscut sled. The miter gauge is usually set to be at 90 degrees to {{the plane of the}} blade's cut, to cause the cut made in the workpiece to be made at a right angle. The miter gauge can also be adjusted to cause the cut to be made at a precisely controlled angle (a so-called miter cut).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} the {{strength}} of the semantic and syntactic version of the <b>cutting</b> <b>planes</b> proof system. First, we show that the lower bound technique of [22] applies also to semantic cutting planes: the proof system has feasible interpolation via monotone real circuits, which gives an exponential lower bound on lengths of semantic <b>cutting</b> <b>planes</b> refutations. Second, we show that semantic refutations are stronger than syntactic ones. In particular, we give a formula for which any refutation in syntactic <b>cutting</b> <b>planes</b> requires exponential length, while there is a polynomial length refutation in semantic <b>cutting</b> <b>planes.</b> In other words, syntactic <b>cutting</b> <b>planes</b> does not p-simulate semantic <b>cutting</b> <b>planes.</b> We also give two incompatible integer inequalities which require exponential length refutation in syntactic <b>cutting</b> <b>planes.</b> Finally, we pose the following problem, which arises in connection with semantic inference of arity larger than two: can every multivariate non-decreasing real function be expressed as a composition of non-decreasing real functions in two variables...|$|R

The fence is commonly called a [...] "rip fence" [...] referring to its use in guiding the workpiece during the process of making a rip cut. Most table saws come standard with a rip fence, but some high end saws are available without a fence so a fence of the user's choice can be purchased separately.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} the {{cross-section}} of a solid may depend upon {{the orientation of the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>plane</b> to the solid. For instance, while all the cross-sections of a ball are disks, the cross-sections of a cube depend on how the <b>cutting</b> <b>plane</b> is related to the cube. If the <b>cutting</b> <b>plane</b> is perpendicular to a line joining the centers of two opposite faces of the cube, the cross-section will be a square, however, if the <b>cutting</b> <b>plane</b> is perpendicular to a diagonal of the cube joining opposite vertices, the cross-section can be either a point, a triangle or a hexagon.|$|E

An {{exponential}} {{lower bound}} for the size of tree-like <b>cutting</b> <b>planes</b> refutations of a certain family of conjunctive normal form (CNF) formulas with polynomial size resolution refutations is proved.

When people apply this method to find a <b>cutting</b> <b>plane,</b> they often depend on experience. So this method is seldom deemed as a general method.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} space {{complexity}} of the <b>cutting</b> <b>planes</b> proof system, in which the lines in a proof are integral linear inequalities. We measure the space used by a refutation {{as the number of}} linear inequalities that need to be kept on a blackboard while verifying it. We show that any unsatisfiable set of linear inequalities has a <b>cutting</b> <b>planes</b> refutation in space five. This is in contrast to the weaker resolution proof system, for which the analogous space measure has been well-studied and many optimal linear lower bounds are known. Motivated by this result we consider a natural restriction of <b>cutting</b> <b>planes,</b> in which all coefficients have size bounded by a constant. We show that there is a CNF which requires super-constant space to refute in this system. The system nevertheless already has an exponential speed-up over resolution with respect to size, and we additionally show that it is stronger than resolution with respect to space, by constructing constant-space <b>cutting</b> <b>planes</b> proofs, with coefficients bounded by two, of the pigeonhole principle. We also consider variable instance space for <b>cutting</b> <b>planes,</b> where we count the number of instances of variables on the blackboard, and total space, where we count the total number of symbols...|$|R

Similar proofs can be developed for the VRP-PC. As ATSP-TW and PC-ATSP can be formulated as directed identical-vehicle VRP-TW and PC-VRP, respectively, this provides a link to study the polyhedral combinatorics for the ATSP-TW and PC-ATSP.
