5|$|As the New Kingdom crumbled, the {{building}} of mortuary temples ceased and was never revived. Some rulers of the Third Intermediate Period, such as those at Tanis, were buried within the enclosures of divine temples, thus continuing the <b>close</b> <b>link</b> between temple and tomb.|$|E
5|$|A <b>close</b> <b>link</b> {{existed between}} the ruler and the Sangha (Buddhist priesthood) since the {{introduction}} of Buddhism to the country. This relationship was further strengthened during Dutthagamani's reign. The monks often advised and even guided the king on decisions. This association was initially with the Mahavihara sect, but {{by the middle of}} the 1st century BC, the Abhayagiri sect had also begun to have a <b>close</b> <b>link</b> to the ruling of the country. By the end of the 3rd century AD, the Jetavana sect had also become close to the ruler. Estrangements between the ruler and the priesthood often weakened the government, as happened during the reign of Lanjatissa. Even Valagamba's resistance movement was initially hampered because of a rift with the Mahavihara, and he succeeded only after a reconciliation was affected. Some rulers patronized only one sect, but this often led to unrest in the country and most rulers equally supported all sects. Despite this, religious establishments were often plundered during times of internal strife by the rulers themselves, such as during the reigns of Dathopatissa I (639–650) and Kashyapa II (650–659).|$|E
25|$|Derry {{is close}} to the border with County Donegal, with which it has had a <b>close</b> <b>link</b> for many centuries.

25|$|A {{number of}} the club's {{followers}} acknowledge a very <b>close</b> <b>link</b> with English side Sunderland, although it is an association that is often unwelcome and denied by the authorities. Over 100 Feyenoord supporters attended a function in Sunderland on the evening before their fixture with Newcastle in April 2015 and a similar number of Sunderland fans made the journey to watch the Dutch side in their ultimately delayed fixture against Vitesse.|$|E
25|$|The event {{coincided with}} the {{appointment}} of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister two days earlier, but Downing Street dismissed suggestions of a connection. A <b>close</b> <b>link</b> was quickly established to the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack the following day. Bilal Abdullah, arrested following the Glasgow attack, was later found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder in relation to both incidents and sentenced to life imprisonment, {{with a minimum of}} 32 years in prison.|$|E
25|$|The islands prospered under Roman rule, {{and were}} {{eventually}} distinguished as a Municipium and a Foederata Civitas. Many Roman antiquities still exist, testifying to the <b>close</b> <b>link</b> between the Maltese inhabitants and Sicily.

Despite this, the local Punic-Hellenistic culture and language is thought to have survived until at least the 1st century AD.|$|E

Tentative studies appear to suggest that the fish possessed a more developed braincase than the lampreys, with an almost shark-like outline. Internal scales have also been recovered, some fused into plates resembling gnathostome tooth-whorls to such a degree that some researchers favour a <b>close</b> <b>link</b> between the families.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco use has {{predominantly}} {{negative effects}} on human health and concern about health effects of tobacco has a long history. Research has focused primarily on cigarette tobacco smoking. In 1950, Richard Doll published research in the British Medical Journal showing a <b>close</b> <b>link</b> between smoking and lung cancer. Four years later, in 1954, the British Doctors Study, a study of some 40,000 doctors over 20 years, confirmed the suggestion, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, 22% of American {{households}} had two income earners. The {{vast majority}} (97%) of {{households in the}} top quintile had two or more income earners.

This {{raises the question of whether}} or not the combination of incomes results in higher social status. Of course, there is no definite answer as class is a vague sociological concept.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the limited}} source materials, {{during this time}} there were efforts to {{decipher}} the newly discovered Cretan script. Australian classicist Florence Stawell published {{an interpretation of the}} Phaistos Disc in the April 1911 issue of The Burlington Magazine. She followed this with the book A Clue to the Cretan Scripts, published in 1931. Stawell declared all three Cretan script forms to represent early Homeric Greek, and offered her attempts at translations. Also in 1931, F. G. Gordon's Through Basque to Minoan was published by the Oxford University Press. Gordon attempted to prove a <b>close</b> <b>link</b> between the Basque language and Linear B, without lasting success.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Glasgow Airport {{attack was}} a {{terrorist}} ramming attack which occurred on 30 June 2007, at 15:11 BST, when a dark green Jeep Cherokee loaded with propane canisters was driven at the glass doors of the Glasgow Airport terminal and set ablaze. It was the first terrorist attack {{to take place in}} Scotland since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988. The attack took place three days after the appointment of Scottish MP Gordon Brown as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but Downing Street dismissed suggestions of a connection. A <b>close</b> <b>link</b> was quickly established to the 2007 London car bombs the previous day. Although the doors were damaged, security bollards outside the entrance stopped the car from entering the terminal, where there were 4,000 people, with the potential for many fatalities.|$|E
25|$|In the Great Plains, {{the prairie}} dog is a {{keystone}} species. Studies comparing species abundances {{in areas of}} colonization against areas with no prairie dog colonization show clear evidence that the prairie dog does {{have a significant impact}} on its surroundings by altering vegetation and therefore affecting habitat and food availability for other species. There is a great mosaic of vegetative diversity within the Great Plains due to the prairie dog’s extensive grazing on long grasses. This mosaic supports a variety of small mammals. In addition to altering vegetation, the prairie dog also creates habitat for many other organisms by creating extensive tunnel systems that other small mammals such as the desert cottontail, striped skunk and deer mouse use for shelter. A strong characteristic of keystone species is their ability to create and modify other organism’s habitats and it is evident that the prairie dog does this. In conclusion, the prairie dog is an iconic animal species North America. Its <b>close</b> <b>link</b> to the ecology and structure of the Great Plains make it the defining keystone species of the ecoregion.|$|E

25|$|After {{speculation}} {{that he would}} take up the vacant managerial role at Peterborough United, Keith Alexander left his position as manager of Lincoln City by mutual consent on 24 May 2006 stating that he could take the club no further, and shortly after on 15 June John Schofield was appointed his successor, with John Deehan as Director of Football. When John Deehan was the Director of Football, the club enjoyed a <b>close</b> <b>link</b> with Premier League outfit Aston Villa. As well as Villa hosting a behind closed-doors friendly with City earlier in the 2006–07 season, Paul Green, a promising youngster, made a permanent move to the club, whilst goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik featured several times on the substitute bench during his loan spell at City. Deehan also brought in Ryan Amoo, a youth player who he worked with at Villa, who has since left the club since his contract expired. For the fifth year in a row, under a different manager, however, Lincoln City reached the League Two play-offs after finishing 5th in the league (the highest position that they have qualified for the play-offs in). Once again, however, they lost, this time to Bristol Rovers in the semi-finals courtesy of a 2–1 defeat away and a 3–5 defeat at home. The failure to succeed in five successive Play-off competitions is a record for any club.|$|E
25|$|The second-oldest {{published}} {{account is}} {{known by the}} opening words of its long title: Huei tlamahuiçoltica ("The great event"). It was published in Nahuatl by the then vicar of the hermitage at Guadalupe, Luis Lasso de la Vega, in 1649. In four places in the introduction, he announced his authorship of {{all or part of}} the text, a claim long received with varying degrees of incredulity because of the text's consummate grasp of a form of classical Nahuatl dating from the mid-16th century, the command of which Lasso de la Vega neither before nor after left any sign. The complete work comprises several elements including a brief biography of Juan Diego and, most famously, a highly wrought and ceremonious account of the apparitions known from its opening words as the Nican Mopohua ("Here it is told"). Despite the variations in style and content which mark the various elements, an exclusively textual analysis by three American investigators published in 1998 provisionally (a) assigned the entire work to the same author or authors, (b) saw no good reason to strip de la Vega of the authorship role he had claimed, and (c) of the three possible explanations for the <b>close</b> <b>link</b> between Sánchez's work and the Huei tlamahuiçoltica, opted for a dependence of the latter upon the former which, however, was said to be indicated rather than proved. Whether the role to be attributed to Lasso de la Vega was creative, editorial or redactional remains an open question. Nevertheless, the broad consensus among Mexican historians (both ecclesiastical and secular) has long been, and remains, that the Nican Mopohua dates from as early as the mid-16th century and (so far as it is attributed to any author) that the likeliest hypothesis as to authorship is that Antonio Valeriano wrote it, or at least had a hand in it.The Nican Mopohua was not reprinted or translated in full into Spanish until 1929, although an incomplete translation had been published in 1895 and Becerra Tanco's 1675 account (see next entry) has close affinities with it.|$|E

500|$|The three {{leaders of}} the {{movement}} were all aristocrats, {{and they were able}} to get the support of their family and friends as well as the King. In Pope's view [...] "this <b>close</b> <b>link</b> between the monks and the nobles is ultimately the most important factor in the success of the reform". Wormald agrees, stating that aristocratic support for monastic reform was more important for its success than royal or papal sponsorship. The aristocracy did not confine their support to reformed foundations, but continued to donate to unreformed ones.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} Postclassic Period (c. 900 [...] c. 1200), Quiriguá was {{occupied}} by peoples {{closely linked to the}} Caribbean coastal areas of the Yucatán Peninsula and Belize, perhaps due to Chontal Maya control of a trade network that included the Yucatán coast and the Motagua Valley. During their brief reoccupation of the site they made substantial additions to the acropolis complex. Finds associated with their occupation include a reclining chacmool sculpture and ceramics from the east coast of Yucatán, artifacts that demonstrate a <b>close</b> <b>link</b> with the distant city of Chichen Itza. Some copper bells and ornaments were recovered from Quiriguá, they are among the earliest finds of metal artifacts in the Maya area. They have been dated to either the Terminal Classic (c.800 c.950) or the Early Postclassic.|$|E
500|$|Language and {{linguistic}} barriers {{are a major}} theme in The Word for World Is Forest, something exemplified by the title. In contrast to other Hainish universe novels such as The Left Hand of Darkness, The Word for World Is Forest portrays a communication gap that the protagonists are never able to bridge. Both the native Athsheans and the loggers have languages that reflect their perceptions of reality, but {{they are unable to}} find a common language. In the native Athshean language, the word [...] "Athshe" [...] means both [...] "forest" [...] and [...] "world", demonstrating the <b>close</b> <b>link</b> that the Athsheans have to the forest and their planet. It is noted by Lyubov that the Athsheans believe [...] "the substance of their world was not earth, but forest". The language used by the Athsheans during conversations similarly show their interconnectedness and dependence on their ecosystem through the use of forest related metaphors.|$|E
