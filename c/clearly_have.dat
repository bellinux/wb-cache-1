25|$|In 1831, with George IV {{dead and}} the new king, William IV, over 60 and still without {{legitimate}} issue, the young princess's status as heir presumptive and the Duchess's prospective place as regent led to major increases in British state income for the Kents.

25|$|The {{architecture}} {{in the city}} {{is a mixture of}} local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet Stalinist architectural styles. The oldest parts of town, including the Abanot-Ubani, Avlabari, and to a certain extent the Sololaki districts <b>clearly</b> <b>have</b> a traditional Georgian architectural look with Near Eastern influences. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were built or expanded mainly in the 19th century (Rustaveli Avenue, Vera district, etc.) have a chiefly Western European look, but they nevertheless contain individual examples of European pseudo-Moorish architecture, such as the Tbilisi Opera.|$|E

25|$|At art {{exhibitions}} {{the visitor}} usually {{is not allowed}} to touch the displayed objects, not even when they <b>clearly</b> <b>have</b> a functional background like an artistic chair or jewellery. Therefore, Noten used a funfair machine he called Mr Claw to offer visitors the opportunity to actually touch works of art. Mr Claw contains plastic bubbles with small pieces of jewellery inside the visitor can attempt to grab by using the machine's remote-controlled grabber. As a special attraction Noten put a 1kg silver bar inside as well (unfortunately this item is too heavy to be lifted by the grabber). Mr Claw was used at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam Geel metalliek: Goud voor Robert Smit exhibition on contemporary jewellery in 2004, and at the Icon Experiment 2008 exhibition in London, UK.|$|E
25|$|Michaelson et al. cited {{studies by}} A. P. Elkin {{in which he}} argued that Aboriginal and Tibetan shamanism have {{markedly}} close similarities. He {{also noted that the}} worldwide pattern of shamanism suggests a common heritage that radiated outward from North Africa about 50,000 years ago; it may have originated as a woman's role which over time has been taken over by men. Aboriginal females in Australia have explicitly been recorded as saying that men had taken over roles they once performed in ceremonies. This is supported by many completely different languages having a similar word for female shamans (e.g., udaghan, udagan, utygan), while the term for male shamans is distinct in each language. Michaelson considered it significant that while few females are depicted in Bradshaw art, Tassel figures which appear to be leading ceremonies (the oldest art) <b>clearly</b> <b>have</b> breasts, in contrast to later art which depicts males in the leading roles. Pettigrew identifies elements of Bradshaw art with symbols used by Sandawe artists to convey their experience with hallucinogens, and others that seem to show hallucinatory elements. From this he infers that psilocybin-induced trances were a feature of both cultures.|$|E
25|$|Although queen {{selection}} {{is not fully}} understood, workers <b>clearly</b> <b>have</b> {{an important role in}} the queen elimination process. Workers often test queens, and depending on the queens’ response, the workers may remove them from the colony. It has been suggested that workers discriminate between queens based on their relative fertility. Workers seem to identify the more fecund queens through various behavioral tests and dismiss any queens with inhibited ovaries. Queen size could be an additional determinant in queen selection. Since size differences between queens and workers increase as the colony ages, smaller queens could be eliminated to create this morphological gap. This selection process also correlates with the fact that a colony’s queen population decreases as the colony ages. Colonies begin to gain more queens once they have reached a minimum queen population. The new queens usually reproduce in the old colony, which lowers relatedness. Swarming occurs afterwards, frequently during the queen-reduction cycle. The dissociation between queen cycle and the colony cycle allows worker interests to be satisfied with respect to the timing of queen and male production, without sacrificing the ability to initiate new colonies at appropriate times. Workers prefer this selective pattern of queen emergence because they are three times more closely related to their sisters than to other brothers on single-queen colonies. Workers are equally related to the nieces and nephews that make up most of the brood on multiple-queen colonies.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{economic}} times, the railroad's management remained confident. On May 10, 1894, the directors approved {{the extension of}} the main line from Struble to Pine Grove Mills. Such an extension had been contemplated as long ago as 1884, during the BRB era. While Pine Grove Mills would originate some traffic through farming and logging, the extension was primarily contemplated {{as part of a larger}} route. By extending south from Pine Grove Mills to Huntingdon, the line could connect with the Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad, an independent railroad serving the Broad Top coal region. By linking to the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania at Bellefonte (built in 1893 over the contemplated Nittany Valley & Southern route), the Bellefonte Central could form part of a coal route tapping the Broad Top field on behalf of the New York Central. However, the route faced a formidable obstacle in the crossing of Tussey Mountain. Such a line would require switchbacks or a long summit tunnel. The Pennsylvania Railroad already occupied the only usable gap at Spruce Creek and would not look favorably on its new competitor for the Broad Top traffic. However, the economy remained slow, and the railroad found it difficult to obtain land at favorable prices. After a little grading, the project stalled until 1896, when the railroad lifted the rail from the derelict Red Bank Branch west of Graysdale and used it to lay track on the extension. Service on the extension opened to Bloomsdorf in September 1896 and to Pine Grove Mills in December. Despite a $75,000 subscription offered by the town of Stone Valley (now submerged under Lake Perez) to complete the extension to Huntingdon, the expense of further extension would <b>clearly</b> <b>have</b> outstripped the railroad's finances. The Bellefonte Central undertook no further construction towards Huntingdon.|$|E

500|$|The {{investigation}} {{opened in}} London on 14 July 1307. The first {{three of the}} nine witnesses to Cragh's hanging to be heard were Lady Mary de Briouze, William Codineston, and the younger William de Briouze; his father had died in 1291. The commissioners were naturally curious {{about the details of}} the execution, because if Cragh had not actually been killed then there could <b>clearly</b> <b>have</b> been no miracle. William de Briouze was in no doubt that the hanging had been properly conducted, and pointed out it was customary that [...] "if any subterfuge or trickery were discovered... then the executioner himself would be hanged in turn". He added that any deception could be ruled out because of the hatred that he and his father had for Cragh, whom he described as [...] "the worst of malefactors". The same point was made by William of Codineston: [...] "the lord de Briouze and his justices, officials, and servants hated William Cragh very much and rejoiced greatly at his hanging and death".|$|E
500|$|Tolkien {{almost never}} {{borrowed}} words directly from real languages into Quenya. The major {{exception is the}} name Earendel/Eärendil, which he found in an Old English poem by Cynewulf. Yet the Finnish influence extended sometimes also to the vocabulary. A few Quenya words, such as tul- [...] "come" [...] and anta- [...] "give", <b>clearly</b> <b>have</b> a Finnish origin. Other forms that {{appear to have been}} borrowed are actually coincidental, such as Finnish kirja [...] "book", and Quenya cirya [...] "ship". Tolkien invented the Valarin/Quenderin root kir- from which sprang his Quenya word cirya. The Latin aure [...] "dawn", and Quenya aure [...] "moment of special meaning, special day, festival day" [...] are unrelated. Instead, Quenya aurë comes from the Valarin/Quenderin root ur-. Germanic influence can more be seen in grammar (the -r nominative plural ending is reminiscent of the Scandinavian languages) or phonology, than in words: Arda, the Quenya name for [...] "region", just happened to resemble Germanic Erde [...] "earth", while it actually comes from the Valarin/Quenderin root gar-. According to Tom DuBois and Scott Mellor, the name of Quenya itself may have been influenced by the name Kven, a language closely related to Finnish, but Tolkien never mentioned this.|$|E
500|$|John Harold Wilson {{argues that}} the famously virile stage {{presence}} of Hart as Horner {{must be taken into}} account when interpreting the play. As personified by Hart, Horner will have won women not so much through clever trickery as [...] "the old-fashioned way", by being [...] "dangerously attractive", and it is only fools like Sir Jaspar Fidget who really believe him harmless. Harcourt/Kynaston, although by 1675 a well-regarded and skilful actor of male roles, would <b>clearly</b> <b>have</b> been overshadowed by Horner/Hart. The actresses associated with each hero must also have tended to make the Horner plot more striking on the stage than the true-love plot. Horner's primary mistress Lady Fidget, spokeswoman for [...] "the virtuous gang" [...] of secretly sex-hungry town wives, was played by the dynamic Elizabeth Knepp, who Samuel Pepys declared [...] "the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest I've ever heard", talents that the famous drinking scene in Horner's lodging seems designed to do justice to. By contrast, the choice of the bit-part actress Elizabeth James as Alithea would have de-emphasised the Harcourt-Alithea plot. Such historical considerations have made modern critics sceptical of Norman Holland's classic 1959 [...] "right way/wrong way" [...] interpretation of the play, which positions the true-love plot as the most important one.|$|E
