25|$|Newfoundland and Labrador and the Gulf of St. Lawrence {{were the}} first regions to {{experience}} large scale sealing. Migratory fishermen began the hunting from {{as early as the}} 1500s. Large-scale <b>commercial</b> <b>seal</b> hunting became an annual event starting in 1723 and expanded rapidly near the turn of the 18th century. Initially, the method used was to ensnare the migrating seals in nets anchored to shore installations, known as the 'landsman seal fishery'. The hunt was mainly for the procurement of seal meat as a form of sustenance for the settlements in the area, rather than for commercial gain.|$|E
25|$|The seal hunt {{provided}} critical winter {{wages for}} fishermen, but was dangerous work marked by sealing disasters that claimed hundreds of lives, {{such as the}} 1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster involving the SS Southern Cross, the SS Newfoundland, and SS Stephano. The rugged hulls and experienced crews of Newfoundland sealing vessels often led sealers such as Bear and Terra Nova to be hired for arctic exploration and one sealer Algerine was hired to recover Titanic bodies in 1912. After World War II, the Newfoundland hunt was dominated by large Norwegian sealing vessels until the late 20th century, when the much diminished hunt shifted to smaller motor fishing vessels, based from outports around Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2007, the <b>commercial</b> <b>seal</b> hunt dividend contributed about $6 million to the Newfoundland GDP, {{a fraction of the}} industry's former importance.|$|E

The Aleut men were brought back to the islands temporarily in the summer of 1943 to conduct the fur seal harvest for the federal government, seal oil being used in the war effort. Most Aleuts from the Pribilofs were imprisoned at Funter Bay on Admiralty Island in Southeast Alaska. In 1979, the Aleut people from the Pribilof islands received $8.5 million in partial compensation for the unfair and unjust treatment they were subject to under federal administration between 1870 and 1946. In 1983, Congress passed the Fur Seal Act Amendments, which ended government control of the <b>commercial</b> <b>seal</b> harvest and most of the federal presence on the island. Responsibility for providing community services and management of the fur seals was left to local entities. USD$20 million was provided to help develop and diversify the Island economyUSD$12 million to St. Paul and USD$8 million to St. George. Commercial harvesting on St. Paul ceased in 1985. Ownership of fur seal pelts is now prohibited except for subsistence purposes.|$|E

25|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>sealing</b> in Australasia {{appears to}} have started with the London-based Massachusetts-born Eber Bunker, master of the William and Ann, who {{announced}} his intention in November 1791 to visit and hunt in New Zealand's Dusky Sound. Captain William Raven of the Britannia stationed a party at Dusky from 1792 to 1793, but the discovery in 1798-1799 of Bass Strait, between mainland Australia and Van Diemen's Land (later known as Tasmania) saw the sealers' focus shift there in 1798, when a gang including Daniel Cooper landed from the Nautilus on Cape Barren Island.|$|R
40|$|When {{preparing}} quench calibration curves, <b>commercial</b> <b>sealed</b> {{standards are}} often used, {{although it is}} advisable {{to use the same}} composition, scintillation liquid, and sample as the unknowns. <b>Commercial</b> <b>sealed</b> standards usually contain a toluene or xylene based cocktail and carbon tetrachloride or nitromethane as quencher. However, the unknown samples may contain another solvent and other chemical quenchers. The solvent has become more signifi-cant with the introduction of new "safe " solvents that behave differently from the traditional toluene solvent. As reported in earlier literature, different solvents and chemical quenchers lead to different quench curves, but no physical explanation has been given. In this work, quench curves for several commercial cocktails with chemical quenchers and one color quencher have been measured. The counting efficiency and the mean pulse height of the isotope (3 H) were recorded for different amounts of quencher and with varying coincidence resolving time of the counter. The differences in quenching characteristics can be explained as differences in the scintillation pulse shapes. The shape of the scintillation pulse is primarily dependent on the way the excitation energy is deposited in the solvent and on how the chemical quenchers act on the excited solvent molecules. The data indicate that there are mainly two different chemical quenching mechanisms: quenching of the higher excited states, which are precursors of the triplet states, and quenching of the lower singlet states...|$|R

40|$|Considerable {{uncertainties}} often {{surround the}} causes of long-term changes in population abundance. One striking example is the precipitous decline of southern sea lions (SSL; Otaria flavescens) at the Falkland Islands, from 80   555 pups in the mid 1930 s to just 5506 pups in 1965. Despite an increase in SSL abundance {{over the past two}} decades, the population has not recovered, with the number of pups born in 2014 (minimum 4443 pups) less than 6 % of the 1930 s estimate. The order-of-magnitude decline is primarily attributed to <b>commercial</b> <b>sealing</b> in Argentina. Here, we test this established paradigm and alternative hypotheses by assessing (1) <b>commercial</b> <b>sealing</b> at the Falkland Islands, (2) winter migration of SSL from the Falkland Islands to Argentina, (3) whether the number of SSL in Argentina could have sustained the reported level of exploitation, and (4) environmental change. The most parsimonious hypothesis explaining the SSL population decline was environmental change. Specifically, analysis of 160 years of winter sea surface temperatures revealed marked changes, including a period of warming between 1930 and 1950 that was consistent with the period of SSL decline. Sea surface temperature changes likely influenced the distribution or availability of SSL prey and impacted its population dynamics. We suggest that historical harvesting may not always be the “smoking gun” as is often purported. Rather, our conclusions support the growing evidence for bottom-up forcing on the abundance of species at lower trophic levels (e. g., plankton and fish) and resulting impacts on higher trophic levels across a broad range of ecosystems...|$|R

5|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>sealing</b> was {{historically}} just {{as important}} an industry as whaling. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of the}} hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|R
