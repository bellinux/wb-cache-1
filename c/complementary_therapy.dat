5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a <b>complementary</b> <b>therapy</b> to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E

The complex, thePoint4, was originally named The Point after a nearby block of flats. It includes a bistro and conference facilities, and commenced operation in April 2009, and was officially opened on 24 June by BBC sports presenter and Daily Mail columnist Des Kelly. In 2008 the college was nominated as one of the sites for the 2012 Paralympic Games and acted as a pre-Games training camp for Paralympic athletes.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} what proportion of oncology patients receiving conventional medical treatment also use complementary treatments; to assess which complementary treatments {{are the most}} popular and to assess patients' motivation for using them; to evaluate associated advantages and risks. DESIGN [...] Postal screening questionnaire followed by semistructured interview. SETTING [...] Two hospitals in inner London. SUBJECTS [...] 600 unselected oncology patients aged 18 or over who had known their diagnosis of cancer for at least three months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prevalence and demography of use of complementary therapies; patients' motivation and expectations of complementary therapies; areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction associated with conventional and <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies.</b> RESULTS [...] 415 (69 %) patients returned the questionnaire. 16 % had used <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies.</b> The most popular were healing, relaxation, visualisation, diets, homoeopathy, vitamins, herbalism, and the Bristol approach. Patients using <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies</b> tended to be younger, of higher social class, and female. Three quarters used two or more therapies. Therapies were mostly used for anticipated antitumour effect. Ill effects of diets and herb treatments were described. Satisfaction with both conventional and <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies</b> was high, although diets often caused difficulties. Patients using <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies</b> were less satisfied with conventional treatments, largely because of side effects and lack of hope of cure. Benefits of <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies</b> were mainly psychological. CONCLUSIONS [...] A sizeable percentage of patients receiving conventional treatments for cancer also use <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies.</b> Patient satisfaction with <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies,</b> other than dietary therapies, was high even without the hoped for anticancer effect. Patients reported psychological benefits such as hope and optimism...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of nurses advocate integration of <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies</b> and conventional medicine, {{and some of}} them implement these methods in their clinical practice. There various reasons for application of <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies</b> by nurses, identification of which is of paramount importance. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the perceptions of nurses toward the reasons for using <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies</b> in clinical nursing practice. Methods: This study was a qualitative content analysis, conducted in Isfahan and Kashan, Iran, during June 2014 -July 2015. Purposive sampling was performed and was continued until data saturation. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with fifteen experienced nurses. Data were collected and analyzed using content analysis method. Data analysis was carried out using MaxQDA software. Results: Four major categories including “ethical perceptions and attitudes”, “obligating beliefs”, “attention to information from unofficial sources”, and “attention to information from official sources” were extracted with two main themes of “moral obligation of nurses” and “application of information sources by nurses”. Conclusion: With regard to the reasons for application of <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies</b> in practice, performance of nurses could be demonstrated through assessing their moral obligation and application of obtained information from various sources, especially unofficial ones. Therefore, acknowledging these findings could help healthcare planners design guidelines and functional models to integrate <b>complementary</b> <b>therapies</b> and nursing practice. ...|$|R
