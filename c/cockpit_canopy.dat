50|$|To {{partially}} compensate, the IJAAF {{introduced the}} Ki-21-IIb, with a pedal-operated upper turret with one 12.7 mm (0.50 in) Type 1 machine gun, redesigned <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopies</b> and increased fuel capacity. Although used in all fronts in the Pacific theater, {{it became clear}} by 1942 that the design was rapidly becoming obsolete, and was increasingly shifted away from front-line service.|$|R
25|$|Built {{primarily}} of wood, the SZD-22 had airbrakes in the wings, a streamline <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy,</b> short nose and tail skids {{with a single}} mainwheel. The SZD-22C model replaced the plywood covering of the wings with fabric and some models had provision for water ballast in rubber bags fitted to the wing roots. Most of SZD-22s - 271, were built in ZSLS in Krosno.|$|E
25|$|Last Neptune variant {{produced}} by Lockheed, powered by R-3350-32W and J-34 engines. Fitted with lower drag wingtip tanks, AN/APS-20 search radar in a revised radome and a bulged <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy.</b> Early aircraft were fitted with defensive gun turrets {{but these were}} removed as for the P2V-5. 287 were built, including 48 assembled by Kawasaki in Japan. Redesignated P-2H in 1962.|$|E
25|$|It was {{proposed}} that a He 111 bomber would carry either {{one or two}} Reichenbergs beneath its wings, releasing them close to the target. The pilots would then steer their aircraft towards the target, jettisoning the <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy</b> shortly before impact and bailing out. It was estimated that {{the chances of a}} pilot surviving such a bailout were less than 1% due to the proximity of the pulsejet's intake to the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, as a {{contractor}} within the Civilian Repair Organisation, Heston Aircraft Company was heavily engaged in repair and other support work on military aircraft. From late 1940, Heston Aircraft {{played a major}} role in modifying Supermarine Spitfires for the photographic reconnaissance task. The company equipped the Spitfires with vertical and oblique cameras, additional fuel tanks, and modified <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopies.</b> Many marks of Spitfire were repaired at Heston throughout the war. Other types to be repaired and modified included the Fairchild Argus, Fairey Battle and the naval Vought SB2U Vindicator.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{the site}} BatmobileHistory.com, the Batmobile created for the 1968-1969 Filmation Associates TV series was not {{strongly}} based on its immediate predecessor (except for sharing dual rear <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopies</b> with the Barris/Futura Batmobile) or any version in DC Comics publications of the time. Furthermore, Filmation's Batmobile featured a long, black body with what {{is described as a}} [...] "Coke bottle" [...] profile, with a large, light blue bat emblem set across the hood, which, when a dashboard control was activated, the metal bat symbol folded its [...] "wings" [...] up at its center, forming a barricade/chain cutter.

50|$|As an {{aircraft}} approaches {{the speed of}} sound, shock waves form on areas of greater curvature. These shock waves radiate away energy that the engines must supply, energy that does not go into making the aircraft go faster. This {{appears to be a}} new form of drag—referred to as wave drag—which peaks at about three times the drag at speeds even slightly below the critical mach. In order to minimize the wave drag, the curvature of the aircraft should be kept to a minimum, which implies much higher fineness ratios. This is why high-speed aircraft have long pointed noses and tails, and <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopies</b> that are flush to the fuselage line.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable actions of the Bf 110 {{occurred}} {{on the night of}} the 17/18 August 1943. Bf 110 units had been mass equipped with the Schräge Musik system, an emplacement of two upward-firing cannon, which for its initial installations placed the twin-cannon fitment almost midway down the <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy</b> behind the pilot, which could attack the blind spot of RAF Bomber Command's Lancaster and Halifax bombers, which lacked a ventral turret. Using this, NJG 5's Leutnant Peter Erhardt destroyed four bombers in 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The test bed, {{known as}} the Bi-mono, was a small tractor {{monoplane}} with a fabric-covered steel-tube construction fuselage and a wooden wing. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage while an enclosed cockpit was provided for the pilot. The auxiliary wing {{was attached to the}} top of the <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy</b> and to the lower wing by interplane struts. Two different upper wings were designed with different wingspans, the shorter wing having the same span as the lower wing. The aircraft was powered by a single de Havilland Gipsy Six engine.|$|E
25|$|The Little Toot is {{a single}} seat, open cockpit, biplane with {{conventional}} landing gear. Its design accommodates an optional <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy.</b> The fuselage is welded steel tubing aluminum covering. The original tail section is a metal monocoque truss section from a Luscome 8A. The wings use spruce spars with wooden ribs and are fabric covered. The upper wing is swept back eight degrees. The lower wing has 2.5 degrees of dihedral with nearly full-length ailerons. The landing gear and wheel pants were sourced from a Cessna 140 tail-dragger. The production cost of the original Little Toot aircraft was 2000 in 1958.|$|E

40|$|Results of drag cleanup tests {{conducted}} in the Langley full-scale tunnel {{during the period from}} 1935 to 1945 are summarized for potential application to current propeller-driven general aviation airplanes. Data from tests on 23 airplanes indicate that the drag increments produced by many individual configuration features - such as, power plant installation, air leakage, <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopies,</b> control surface gaps, and antenna installations - are not large; however, when the increments are summed, the resulting total drag increase is significant. On the basis of results of the investigation, it appears that considerable reduction in drag can be obtained by proper attention to details in aerodynamic design and by adherence to the guidelines discussed...|$|R
25|$|The Northrop Gamma 2F was {{an attack}} bomber {{derivative}} of the Northrop Gamma transport aircraft, developed in parallel with the Northrop Gamma 2C, (of which one was built), designated the YA-13 and XA-16. The Gamma 2F had a revised tail, <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy</b> and wing flaps compared with the Gamma 2C, and was fitted with new semi-retractable landing gear. It was delivered to the United States Army Air Corps for tests on 6 October 1934, and after modifications which included fitting with a conventional fixed landing gear, was accepted by the Air Corps. A total of 110 aircraft were ordered as the A-17 in 1935.|$|E
25|$|Bader's fuselage, {{tail and}} fin were gone from behind him, {{and he lost}} height rapidly at what he {{estimated}} to be 400mph (640km/hr) in a slow spin. He jettisoned the <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy,</b> released his harness pin, and the air rushing past the open cockpit started to suck him out, but his prosthetic leg was trapped. Part {{way out of the}} cockpit and still attached to his aircraft, Bader fell for some time before he released his parachute, at which point the leg's retaining strap snapped under the strain and he was pulled free. A Bf 109 flew by some 50 yards away as he neared the ground at around 4,000feet (1,200metres).|$|E
25|$|It had a circular-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage with a nose air intake. A range-only radar {{was fitted}} in the conical inlet cone {{of the air}} intake. The wings had a sweep angle of 55° at quarterchord. Two wing fences were fitted on the upper surface of each wing. The horizontal stabilizer was midway down the rear fuselage and two air brakes were fitted on its underside. The <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy</b> was faired into the spine that {{ran the length of}} the top of the fuselage. The tandem undercarriage had a single wheel on the forward unit and twin wheels on the main unit with outrigger struts that retracted aft into wingtip fairings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} has a glass <b>cockpit,</b> motorized <b>canopy,</b> autopilot, retractable {{landing gear}} and a ballistic parachute. The main structure is made from carbon fibre.

50|$|Emeraudes {{were also}} {{produced}} in the United Kingdom (by Fairtravel as the Linnet) and in South Africa by General Aircraft ("Genair") of Virginia Airport as the Aeriel 2 with imported engines, the first aircraft to be manufactured entirely in that country. The Linnet was modified by the Garland Aircraft Company, formed by P.A.T Garland and D.E. Bianchi, to meet British airworthiness requirements. The first aircraft (G-APNS) was built at White Waltham and first flown on 1 September 1958 by Squadron Leader Neville Duke. Two more aircraft were planned but only one more was built by Garland-Bianchi in 1962. Between 1963 and 1965 three more aircraft were built with 100-hp Rolls Royce Continental O-200-A engines. The last two aircraft had one-piece sliding <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopies.</b>|$|R

25|$|While {{her sister}} joined the BBC, in April 1942 Maureen joined the ATA, one of 164 female pilots {{eventually}} {{to do so}} in three years. Trained to fly 38 types of aircraft, her 800 hours subsequently logged included time in Spitfires, Mustangs, Typhoons, and bomber types including the Wellington. She later stated that her favourite type to fly was the de Havilland Mosquito. Initially attached to No.6 Ferry Pool at RAF Ratcliffe near Leicester, she then moved to the all-female Ferry Pool at Hamble, Southampton, which exclusively delivered Spitfires from Supermarine's new factory at RAF Southampton. She was forced into occasional emergency landings, once after the <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy</b> of her Spitfire blew off after take off and another occasion put down in a field after the engine of her Fairchild Argus failed in the air.|$|E
25|$|After his {{hospitalization}} Barkhorn {{was invited}} by Adolf Galland {{to join the}} elite Jagdverband 44 (JV44—44th Fighter Detachment) flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet-fighter. He found flying the Me 262 over the western front difficult {{and he did not}} score any victories in it. On 21 April 1945, he flew his 1,104th and last mission. One of the engines of his aircraft flamed out as he was approaching an enemy bomber formation and he was forced to make an emergency landing. As he approached the airfield, his jet was attacked by several prowling North American P-51 Mustang fighters. Barkhorn managed to land his burning plane though he received a slight wound {{as a result of this}} action when the <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy</b> — which on the Me 262A, flipped open to starboard, like a Bf 109's did — prior to crash landing, slammed shut on his neck. Taken prisoner by the Western Allies while still in hospital, he was released from Allied captivity in September 1945.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Britain {{brought the}} village of Shoreham {{directly}} into the war when on 15 September 1940, a Dornier Do 17Z, part of a force of about 100 German bombers approaching London, was shot down shortly before noon. The invading formation had been challenged by nine RAF squadrons and the battle developed {{into a series of}} individual 'dogfights'. The unfortunate pilot of the Dornier was forced to land in a field at Castle Farm, with a Spitfire circling overhead, its <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy</b> open, and its pilot waving a handkerchief, to signal a warning to the growing crowd of hop-pickers nearby to stay away until the Shoreham Home Guard arrived to recover the German crew. Feldwebel Heitsch, the pilot, and Feldwebel Pfeiffer, the observer, were driven to The Fox & Hounds pub in Knatts Valley, where they were bought a brandy before being driven to Sevenoaks Police Station. The museum holds a collection of photographs of the Dornier, along with items taken from the wreckage at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Streamlining on the FDB-1 was accentuated. The {{engine was}} snugly faired into a NACA cowling {{reminiscent}} of earlier Seversky fighter designs, also {{heavily influenced by}} Gregor, who left that company early in 1937. The rearward sliding center section of <b>cockpit's</b> <b>canopy,</b> spacious for such a small airframe, was a unique Gregor innovation. The FDB-1 clean lines partly were accomplished by the attachment and support of wings via substantial faired [...] "V" [...] interlane struts. Flying and landing wires and cables were replaced by a single faired strut running between {{the root of the}} top wing rear spar and the foot of the [...] "V" [...] strut where it joins the lower wing at its front spar. A system of tubes moved the control surfaces, except for the rudder, which was partially operated by cables.|$|R
5000|$|For defence, the Me 210's rear gunner {{was armed}} with two 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns. Each {{of these was}} fitted into half-teardrop-shaped Ferngerichtete Drehringseitenlafette FDSL 131/1B turrets mounted {{on each side of}} the aircraft, and was {{remote-controlled}} from the gunner's position in the rear of the glazed cockpit area with a unique gun-aiming setup. This unit had a pivoting handgun-style grip, trigger and gunsight at its center, to aim the guns vertically and horizontally. The rear of the <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy's</b> lower side glazing panels were bulged out to allow the gunner to see in almost any rearward-facing direction. The guns were electrically fired, and an electrical contact breaker acted as a form of [...] "interrupter" [...] as used on many forms of multi-engined, turret-armed WW II aircraft, preventing the gunner from shooting off the Me 210's tailplane.|$|R
500|$|Smith joined No. 237 Squadron in Corsica on 10 May 1944, {{and resumed}} {{operational}} flying two days later. He was promoted {{in the field}} to flight lieutenant. [...] The unit was attached to an American bomber group, and assigned to cover it during attacks on northern Italian cities. The fighters also embarked on strafing raids in the Po Valley against railway traffic and heavy vehicles. Smith flew 10 sorties and on the last of these, on 22 June, led a strafing raid against a large railway yard when his aircraft was hit by flak on a second pass. He warned other pilots not to attempt a second pass on the railway yard, and turned towards the coast, hoping to ditch in the sea. Smith's wingman, Alan Douglas, told him by radio that black smoke was coming from the aircraft, then that the engine was ablaze. Smith bailed out. He had never parachuted before. He turned his Spitfire upside down, thrust the stick forward, released the <b>cockpit's</b> <b>canopy,</b> fell out of the plane and landed without serious injuries {{on the side of a}} mountain.|$|R
25|$|The G-1, {{produced}} from February 1942, {{was the first}} production version of the G-series and the first production Bf 109 with a pressurized cockpit. It could be identified by the small, horn-shaped air intake for the cockpit compressor just above the supercharger intake, on the left upper cowling. In addition, the angled armour plate for the pilot's head {{was replaced by a}} vertical piece which sealed-off the rear of the side-hinged <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy.</b> Small, triangular armour-glass panels were fitted into the upper corners of this armour, although there were aircraft in which the plate was solid steel. Silica gel capsules were placed in each pane of the windscreen and opening canopy to absorb any moisture which may have been trapped in the double glazing. The last 80 G-1s built were lightweight G-1/R2. In these GM-1 nitrous oxide 'boost' was used, and the pilot's back armour was removed, as were all fittings for the long-range drop tank. A few G-1 flown by I./JG 1 are known to have carried the underwing 20mm MG 151/20 cannon gondolas.|$|E
25|$|The Heinkel He 112, {{based on}} a {{scaled-down}} Blitz, was the favourite of the Luftwaffe leaders. Compared with the Bf 109, it was also cheaper. Positive aspects of the He 112 included the wide track and robustness of the undercarriage (this opened outwards from mid wing, {{as opposed to the}} 109s which opened from the wing root), considerably better visibility from the cockpit, and a lower wing loading that made for easier landings. In addition, the V4 had a single-piece, clear-view, sliding <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopy</b> and a more powerful Jumo 210Da engine with a modified exhaust system. However, the He 112 was also structurally complicated, being 18% heavier than the Bf 109, and {{it soon became clear that}} the thick wing, which spanned 12.6m (41ft 4in) with an area of 23.2m2 (249.7ft2) on the first prototype (V1), was a disadvantage for a light fighter, decreasing the aircraft's rate of roll and manoeuvrability. As a result, the He 112 V4 which was used for the trials had new wings, spanning 11.5m (37ft 8.75in) with an area of 21.6m2 (232.5ft2). However, the improvements had not been fully tested and the He 112 V4 could not be demonstrated in accordance with the rules laid down by the Acceptance Commission, placing it at a distinct disadvantage.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} years of operation, the analog {{computers}} would not always keep up with rapidly changing flight environmental inputs. If internal pressures became too great and the spike was incorrectly positioned, the shock wave would suddenly blow out the front of the inlet, called an [...] "Inlet Unstart". During unstarts afterburner extinctions were common. The remaining engine's asymmetrical thrust would cause the aircraft to yaw violently to one side. SAS, autopilot, and manual control inputs would fight the yawing, but often the extreme off-angle would reduce airflow in the opposite engine and stimulate [...] "sympathetic stalls". This generated a rapid counter-yawing, often coupled with loud [...] "banging" [...] noises, and a rough ride during which crews' helmets would sometimes strike their <b>cockpit</b> <b>canopies.</b> One response to a single unstart was unstarting both inlets to prevent yawing, then restarting them both. Lockheed later installed an electronic control to detect unstart conditions and perform this reset action without pilot intervention. Beginning in 1980, the analog inlet control system was replaced by a digital system, which reduced unstart instances.|$|R
