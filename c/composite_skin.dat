[...] The vehicle design is for a hydrogen-fuelled aircraft that would take off from a purpose-built runway, and accelerate to Mach5.4 at [...] altitude (compared to typical airliners' [...] ) using the atmosphere's oxygen before switching the engines to use the internal liquid oxygen (LOX) supply to take it into orbit. It could carry [...] of cargo to an equatorial low Earth orbit (LEO); up to [...] to the International Space Station, almost 45% more than the capacity of the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle; or [...] to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), over 30% more than SpaceX F9 RTLS (.) The relatively light vehicle would then re-enter the atmosphere and land on a runway, being protected from the conditions of re-entry by a ceramic <b>composite</b> <b>skin.</b> [...] When on the ground, it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance. If the design goal is achieved, it should be ready to fly again within two days and be able to complete 200 orbital flights.|$|E

This {{paper is}} focused on the {{development}} of a finite element model describing the behaviour of sandwich structure with <b>composite</b> <b>skins</b> and low density foam core in case of low-velocity transverse impact load.

Being able {{to judge the}} damages and the residual strengths to these impacts are desirable. To reach this goal, {{the first step is}} to focus on the basics of how flat panels of glass reinforced polymer composites will behave. The composite hulls on the Norsafe MILPRO boats are made out of a sandwich structure which consists of two glass reinforced polymer <b>composite</b> <b>skins</b> separated by a lightweight core. Post-impact analysis of the <b>composite</b> <b>skins</b> will be studied with fo- cus on the residual strength properties. Low-velocity impact events by an impactor of a hemispherical tip on composite specimen supported by a rigid substrate will be performed. The damage tolerance of the impact event has been investigated through tensile-, compression- and flexural tests. Two laminates have been studied. A cross-ply laminate with layup [0 / 90] 5 and a quasi-isotropic laminate with layup [(0 / 90 / ± 45) 2 0 / 90].

40|$|Composite {{sandwich}} structures {{are widely used}} in the high-performance applications where weight reduction {{is one of the}} most attractive design parameters. However, structural sandwich components have low resistance to out-of-plane impact due to the thin outer <b>composite</b> <b>skins</b> and the highly deformable cores. The present paper deals with a finite element study on the impact response of sandwich panels, obtained combining phenolic resin-based glass fiber reinforced plastics as skins and phenolic resin-impregnated aramid paper honeycomb structure (Nomex) as core. The numerical analysis has been performed using the LSDYNA software enabling to account for the main sandwich failure modes occurring during impact. The honeycomb core structure and <b>composite</b> <b>skins</b> have been modeled by means of solid and shell elements respectively. The properties of the finite element model have been calibrated on a series of experimental outcomes in order to achieve numerical parameters for both composite facesheet and orthotropic honeycomb material models. The major concerns are related to damage mechanisms, influence of strain-rate effects and energy absorbing capability. The model is validated using the results from experimental impact tests performed on different initial impact conditions. Good agreement was obtained between numerical and experimental results in terms of impact damage and force-displacement trend...|$|R
