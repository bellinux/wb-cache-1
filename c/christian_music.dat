5|$|In contrast, however, many Christian evangelists {{and church}} {{organizations}} {{took a more}} supportive role. For example, televangelist Jim Bakker expressed {{public support for the}} group Stryper, watching them perform and becoming personal friends with the band's members.

5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} with contemporary <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> (CCM) often assume that Loder sings hymn-style music. Her career {{is unusual in}} that it began in CCM; most young musicians choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but {{they may also be}} interpreted as being about other subjects.|$|E

5|$|Ramírez is {{friends with}} José Mesa. Mesa helped teach Ramírez English, helped teach {{him how to}} pitch, and {{translated}} for him in 2006 while both were with the Rockies.

He often donates baseball equipment to children who need it, and in 2006 the Rockies recognized him for this by making him their Roberto Clemente Award nominee.|$|E
5|$|The first Christian {{hard rock}} group was {{possibly}} the California-based band Agape, {{formed in the}} late 1960s. Known for their psychedelic rock and blues influences, the band released an album titled Gospel Hard Rock in 1971, followed by Victims of Tradition in 1972. After Agape, the Resurrection Band was formed in 1972 in Milwaukee's Jesus People community and released the hard rock album Music to Raise the Dead in 1974. The Swedish group Jerusalem was formed in 1975 and is cited as another early Christian hard rock group. In 1978, Resurrection Band released its album Awaiting Your Reply and Jerusalem released Jerusalem (Volume 1). Both albums had a notable impact on <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> culture. During that time, heavy metal was a new style of music for the <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> industry, and many Christian labels did not expect it to sell well. However, Awaiting Your Reply hit big in the Christian market, and reached No. 6 on the Gospel album sales charts. Jerusalem also became an instant hit among listeners, and within {{the first six months}} the record sold 20,000 copies, unheard of within the genre of Christian rock in Europe. The Canadian Daniel Band is cited among the first bands, as is Barnabas.|$|E
5|$|Thrive (stylized as THRIVE) is {{the sixth}} studio album by American {{contemporary}} <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> band Casting Crowns. Released on January 28, 2014 through Beach Street and Reunion Records, {{the album was}} produced by Mark A. Miller. Musically, the album, whose concept was inspired by Psalms 1 from the Bible, has a rock and contemporary Christian sound with influences from folk and bluegrass. The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics for its lyrics and musical diversity, but some critics felt that some songs were too similar {{to the work of}} other artists or to their own previous work.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1980, bassist Dan Birney and guitarist Mike Somerville {{left the}} band, while singer John Schlitt was fired over a drug dependency.

5|$|Two of her {{siblings}} {{have also had}} careers in the music industry. Her brother Pake dabbled in the country music industry in the late 80s but returned to Oklahoma after a brief stint. He owns and operates a 1,000 acre ranch near Coalgate, Oklahoma, and continues to rodeo. Her sister Susie is a successful <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> singer who travels the country with her husband, speaking and performing. She also has an older sister, Alice Foran, a retired social worker who resides in Lane, Oklahoma. Her niece, Calamity McEntire, is an assistant basketball coach at the University of Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Casting Crowns {{was formed}} in 1999 by Mark Hall (lead vocals), Hector Cervantes (guitar, vocals), Juan DeVevo (guitar, vocals), and Melodee DeVevo (violin, vocals) as a student worship band. The band is {{originally}} from Daytona Beach, Florida but relocated to Eagle's Landing First Baptist Church in McDonough, Georgia in 2001, where they recruited Megan Garrett (piano/vocals), Andy Williams (drums), and Chris Huffman (bass guitar) as members. One of their independent records was discovered by Mark A. Miller, the lead vocalist for country band Sawyer Brown. Although Casting Crowns had not released their independent records with intentions of receiving a record deal, Miller offered the band {{the opportunity to become}} the first artists signed to his record label. The band agreed to join and signed with the as-yet-unnamed record label, an imprint of Provident Label Group, and began work on their debut album. As a group, Casting Crowns was unusual in several ways, such as having seven members, never having toured before, and their producer (Miller) having no history in the <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> industry. However, Christian singer and songwriter Steven Curtis Chapman was brought in to co-produce the album with Miller, giving the project a greater amount of support in the <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> industry. Terry Hemmings, Provident Label Group CEO/President and a personal friend of Miller, openly predicted success for Casting Crowns and made them one of his top priorities at the label. While most artists in a similar situation would have received nine months for artist development, Hemmings gave the band four months and sped up the album's release. Casting Crowns was recorded at Glow in the Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee. The album was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1980s {{also saw}} Gospel music see its {{popularity}} peak. A {{new form of}} gospel had evolved, called Contemporary <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> (CCM). CCM had {{been around since the}} late 1960s, and consisted of a pop/rock sound with slight religious lyrics. CCM had become the most popular form of gospel by the mid-1980s, especially with artists like Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, and Kathy Troccoli. Amy Grant was the most popular CCM, and gospel, singer of the 1980s, and after experiencing unprecedented success in CCM, crossed over into mainstream pop in the 1980s and 1990s. Michael W. Smith also had considerable success in CCM before crossing over to a successful career in pop music as well. Grant would later produce CCM's first #1 pop hit ("Baby Baby"), and CCM's best-selling album (Heart In Motion).|$|E

5|$|Many {{rock and}} metal fans that became Christians through the {{ministry}} of Christian metal bands were rejected from churches in the 1980s. In 1984, California pastor Bob Beeman saw this problem and soon started the ministry called Sanctuary - The Rock and Roll Refuge. This fellowship brought many musicians together and formed groups such as Tourniquet, Deliverance, Vengeance and Mortal that would soon become ground breaking acts in <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> culture. Sanctuary's first worship leader was Stryper's vocalist Michael Sweet and later Barren Cross' bass player Jim LaVerde. Sanctuary sponsored the first Christian metal festival, The Metal Mardi Gras, held in 1987 in Los Angeles. This proved influential and soon Christian metal festivals were organized elsewhere as well. Sanctuary's activities began spreading, and it had 36 parishes all over the United States at its peak by the 1990s. The Sanctuary parishes {{had a significant impact}} on the Christian metal movement: groups that would later become notable such as P.O.D. performed their first concerts in Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|MercyMe {{was formed}} in 1994 by vocalist Bart Millard, guitarist Mike Scheuchzer, and keyboardist Jim Bryson. The band later brought on drummer Robby Shaffer and bassist Nathan Cochran. In October 1999, the band {{released}} their fifth independent album, The Worship Project. The album proved successful, selling over 60,000 copies within a year, but the difficulty of selling albums directly, {{in addition to having}} to book and manage for themselves, led the band to pursue a contract with a record label. Millard was directed by a friend to contact Jeff Moseley, who had connections in the <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> industry, for advice. After being contacted by Millard, Moseley expressed interest in the band, and within a week MercyMe was officially signed to INO Records, a new record label Moseley was helming. Moseley introduced the band to Pete Kipley, who would produce the album. Although Kipley had been involved on some minor projects, Almost There was his first major project.|$|E

Even so, the <b>Christian</b> <b>music</b> industry has experienced the same issues as the general market in recent years.|$|E
