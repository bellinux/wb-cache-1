40|$|The {{topic of}} this diploma thesis is {{copyright}} protection of databases. The {{aim of the}} thesis is to describe and introduce databases and their legal protection due to their role as essential tools for the location of required information. The thesis contains analysis of legislation in European Union and the Czech Republic and includes brief analysis of legislation in Finland. The thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter deals with the term database, classification of databases and illustrates basic foundations for database protection. The second chapter {{is divided into two}} subchapters and characterises the legal protection of databases in European Union. The first subchapter is concerned with the legislation process and adoption of the directive on the legal protection of databases starting with the Green Paper in 1988 and ending with adoption of the directive in 1996. The second subchapter analyses this directive in more detail, describes the main terms and institutes and explores the two-tier system of legal protection of databases introduced by this directive.

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1927, the Vatican Library, on order of Pope Pius XI, himself the former {{librarian}} for the Vatican, and by suggestion of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, sent two cataloguers to the Library of Congress {{as a means of}} sharing cataloguing information as well as be taught how to create a catalogue for a large collection. Working together with Martel, the two gained enormous insights into the world of cataloguing. When they returned to Rome, the whole adventure was such a resounding success that a mission of cataloguers to Rome to help them in classifying the archives. The Carnegie Endowment turned to Dr. William Warner Bishop to select and head the team. Turning first to Martel, who quickly rebuffed him, Dr. Bishop was able to persuade James C.M. Hanson to go on the condition that Martel would also be persuaded to attend. Working through Dr. Putnam, Dr. Bishop was able to get Martel’s agreement and together with three others, the work began on adapting the LC and the Anglo-American Code of <b>Catalogue</b> <b>Rules</b> to the Vatican’s immense collection and archives. Martel was the natural choice to be the head classifier as he had such vast experience dating back nearly 30 years. As they had done with the Library of Congress, Martel and his old friend Hanson worked together to build an enduring system. As one contemporary stated, the two were “greatly influential in drawing up the Vatican Norme, perhaps the best of modern cataloging codes, and one which goes far to reconcile European and American practice." ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the diffuse emission at 5 [*]GHz in the first quadrant of the Galactic plane using two months of preliminary intensity data taken with the C-Band All-Sky Survey (C-BASS) northern instrument at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, California. Combining C-BASS maps with ancillary data to make temperature–temperature plots, we find synchrotron spectral indices of β = − 2. 65 ± 0. 05 between 0. 408 and 5 [*]GHz and β = − 2. 72 ± 0. 09 between 1. 420 and 5 [*]GHz for − 10 ° < |b| < − 4 °, 20 ° < l < 40 °. Through the subtraction of a radio recombination line free–free template, we determine the synchrotron spectral index in the Galactic plane (|b| < 4 °) to be β = − 2. 56 ± 0. 07 between 0. 408 and 5 [*]GHz, with a contribution of 53 ± 8 per cent from free–free emission at 5 [*]GHz. These results are consistent with previous low-frequency measurements in the Galactic plane. By including C-BASS data in spectral fits, we demonstrate the presence of anomalous microwave emission (AME) associated with the H[*]ii complexes W 43, W 44 and W 47 near 30 [*]GHz, at 4. 4 σ, 3. 1 σ and 2. 5 σ, respectively. The CORNISH (Co-Ordinated Radio ‘N’ Infrared Survey for High mass star formation) VLA 5 -GHz source <b>catalogue</b> <b>rules</b> out the possibility that the excess emission detected around 30 [*]GHz may be due to ultracompact H[*]ii regions. Diffuse AME was also identified at a 4 σ level within 30 ° < l < 40 °, − 2 ° < b < 2 ° between 5 and 22. 8 [*]GHz...|$|R

40|$|The disordered transcriptomes {{of cancer}} {{encompass}} direct effects of somatic mutation on transcription; co-ordinated secondary alterations in transcriptional pathways; and increased transcriptional noise. To <b>catalogue</b> the <b>rules</b> governing how somatic mutation exerts direct transcriptional effects, we developed an exhaustive bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing RNA-sequencing data, which we integrated with whole genome sequencing from 23 breast cancers. Using X-inactivation analyses, we find cancer cells are more transcriptionally active than intermixed stromal cells. This {{is especially true}} in ER-negative tumours. Overall, 59 % of 6980 exonic substitutions were expressed. Compared to other classes, nonsense mutations showed lower expression levels than expected with patterns characteristic of nonsense-mediated decay. 14 % of 4234 genomic rearrangements caused transcriptional abnormalities, including exon skips, exon reusage, fusion transcripts and premature poly-adenylation. We found productive, stable transcription from sense-to-antisense gene fusions and gene-to-intergenic rearrangements, suggesting that these mutation classes may drive more transcriptional disruption than previously suspected. Systematic integration of transcriptome with genome data therefore reveals the rules by which transcriptional machinery interprets somatic mutation...|$|R
