5000|$|The {{development}} {{of industry and}} material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were {{the source of a}} massive stock of distinctive new words, phrases and idioms. Typical examples are the vocabulary of railroading (see further at rail terminology) and transportation terminology, ranging from names of roads (from dirt roads and back roads to freeways and parkways) to road infrastructure (parking lot, overpass, rest area), and from automotive terminology to public transit (for example, in the sentence [...] "riding the subway downtown"); such American introductions as commuter (from <b>commutation</b> <b>ticket),</b> concourse, to board (a vehicle), to park, double-park and parallel park (a car), [...] or the noun terminal have long been used in all dialects of English.|$|E

50|$|Most TRA {{stations}} feature staffed ticket offices, {{supplemented by}} ticket vending machines (TVMs) at busy locations. Unreserved single or day-return tickets must be purchased {{on the day}} of travel (to prevent ticket reuse), leading to ticket queues at peak commuter periods. Passengers purchasing advance tickets can delay entire queues, causing imminent train departures to be missed. To maximize passenger throughput, separate ticket windows provide train information, today's tickets, and advance or <b>commutation</b> <b>tickets.</b> Some daily ticket windows only accept cash, further decreasing transaction times. Ticket windows at busy stations can be dynamically switched between different functions, minimizing daily ticket queues.|$|R

2500|$|On February 1, 1972, {{the fare}} on the SIRT was {{increase}}d, {{for the first}} time since 1958, to thirty-five cents. The increase was from an average fare of twenty-two cents: the system used to have zoned fares.

5000|$|For {{the first}} time since 1958, the fare on the SIRT was {{increased}} on September 1, 1972 to 35 cents. The increase was from an average fare of 22 cents. The fare increase applied to the whole system, and was accompanied by the elimination of <b>commutation</b> <b>tickets</b> and student tickets. Previously, fares ranged from 20 to 35 cents. 16 per cent of riders of the 17,000 daily riders had no change in fare. There was a 10 per cent increase for 51 per cent of passengers and a 15 per cent increase for the remaining 33 per cent. The fare increase was expected to bring in an extra $400,000 a year. At the time, the line was operating at a deficit of $2.9 Million a year, with $2.5 Million of it offset by a subsidy from the city. The MTA, at the time, had plans for a $25 Million improvement program for the line, including 52 new cars, the R44s. The R44s were planned to go into service by the end of 1973. Improvements were also planned for the tower and signal systems, for the roadbed and for the stations. Increased power, 8,000 feet of new rails, and mercury-vapor lighting at 14 of the 22 stations were also part of the plan. Three quarters of the $25 Million were to be provided by 1967 state transportation bond issue. The remaining $6.25 Million was to be paid by the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very happy}} indeed, Mr. Vanderley," [...] she said, with the pretty dimpled smile which had so {{frequently}} shown {{itself in the}} course of our conversation, [...] "that you have given me this position. I am sure that I shall like it, and I shall try very hard to make my work satisfactory. I shall come up every morning in the nine o'clock train, as you desire; and I shall be obliged to bring my husband with me, but this will not in any way interfere with my work. He is suffering from a malarial disease, and is subject to periods of faintness, so that it would be impossible for me to leave him for the whole morning; but he can sit outside anywhere, under a tree, or perhaps somewhere in the house if it happens to rain. He is perfectly contented if he has a comfortable place to sit in. He is not able to attend to any business, and as I now have to be the bread-winner I am most deeply grateful for this work which you have given me. I am sure that the little trip in and out of town will do him good, and as I shall buy <b>commutation</b> <b>tickets</b> it will not be expensive. He came with me this morning, and if you will excuse me I will bring him in and introduce him." [...] And without waiting for any remark from me she left the room, and shortly returned with the malarial subject. He was an extremely mild-mannered man, of light weight and sedate aspect. The few words in which he indicated his gratification with his wife's engagement suggested to me the need of sulphate of quinia.|$|R
