5|$|The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's {{governing}} body, {{refused a}} <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal</b> from Michelin {{to allow a}} chicane to be installed, maintaining that such rule changes would be grossly unfair to the Bridgestone-shod teams, who had come prepared with properly working tyres, and that a last-minute change to the track layout would be dangerous in case of crashes. The Michelin teams, unable {{to come to a}} compromise with the FIA, decided not to participate. It was later stated that the Michelin-shod teams could have potentially exposed themselves to criminal liability under Indiana state law had they competed.|$|E
5|$|When the {{legislative}} session ended on March 28, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky and addressed {{the state legislature}} on April 2, 1861. He urged the General Assembly to push for federal adoption of the Crittenden Compromise and advocated calling a border states convention, which would draft a <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal</b> and submit it to the Northern and Southern states for adoption. Asserting that the states were coequal and free {{to choose their own}} course, he maintained that, if the border states convention failed, Kentucky should call a sovereignty convention and join the Confederacy as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|The <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal</b> was {{referred}} to a special committee proposed by Crittenden's fellow Kentucky senator, Lazarus Powell. Though {{it was believed that}} Republicans in general, including their representatives on the committee, were disposed to accept Crittenden's compromise or one substantially similar to it, President-elect Lincoln had already instructed his trusted allies in the legislature to resist any plan to extend slavery into the territories. Consequently, when the committee held its first meeting, the Republican members blocked Crittenden's plan and six others from coming to the floor for a vote. Despite their opposition, however, the Republicans presented no alternative plan. After the rejection of Crittenden's plan in committee, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia followed South Carolina's lead and passed ordinances of secession.|$|E
40|$|A {{member state}} of the European Union can use its term as the Council {{president}} to make progress on pending but stalled proposals which it {{would like to see}} adopted. This case study of the directive on the risk arising from physical agents shows how a Council presidency can use issue subtraction, additional meetings and <b>compromise</b> <b>proposals</b> to overcome gridlock in the Council. There is a notable difference in terms of legislative activity between the presidencies of high regulation and low regulation countries. High regulation countries put forward <b>compromise</b> <b>proposals</b> and scheduled additional meetings to resolve outstanding issues. The case study also demonstrates the importance of issue subtraction. The original proposal was gridlocked in the Council for five years. Only after the original proposal was split up into several dossiers (issue de-coupling) was it possible to reach agreement...|$|R

However, Leopold II, King of the Belgians refused to part with any of his lands, putting paid to Beust's proposal.|$|R
50|$|As an MK, Prof. Lubotzky {{was mainly}} {{known for his}} <b>compromise</b> <b>proposals</b> on {{religious}} issues and pluralism. He was actively involved in setting up {{a solution to the}} conversion bill crisis via the Ne'eman Commission, working to avoid a conflict between Israel and the Jewish Diaspora. Prof. Lubotzky also co-drafted a comprehensive proposal for a new covenant for religion-state affairs in Israel with MK Yossi Beilin.|$|R
25|$|The <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal</b> pleased {{neither the}} Hydro-Electric Commission nor the Tasmanian Wilderness Society which was campaigning against the dam. It also caused a {{deadlock}} in the Tasmanian Parliament: the House of Assembly rejected the HEC's Lower Gordon (Gordon-below-Franklin) dam, and the Legislative Council rejected the lower house's legislation, and {{voted against the}} Upper Gordon (Gordon-above-Olga) dam, insisting they proceed with the original proposal. Lowe, now personally opposed to damming in the region, was successful in {{the expansion of the}} existing Frenchmans Cap National Park to include the Franklin, Gordon and Olga Rivers in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park.|$|E
25|$|On April 28, President Harry Truman {{announced}} that Ridgway was being replaced {{as commander in}} Korea by General Mark Clark, and UN negotiators at Panmunjom made a <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal</b> on the stalemated issues. The next day the JCS asked Weyland to provide target information and recommendations {{in the event of}} complete stalemate, and he repeated his recommendation to bomb the hydroelectric plants. Ridgway objected to the JCS on May 1, stating that no attack should be made except on his recommendation, to which the JCS agreed. The next day the communists totally rejected the UN proposal, and while the talks continued, the UN took the stance that their position was irrevocable.|$|E
25|$|At the 2010 {{meeting of}} the International Whaling Commission in Morocco, representatives of the 88 member nations {{discussed}} {{whether or not to}} lift the 24-year ban on commercial whaling. Japan, Norway and Iceland have urged the organization to lift the ban. A coalition of anti-whaling nations has offered a compromise plan that would allow these countries to continue whaling, but with smaller catches and under close supervision. Their plan would also completely ban whaling in the Southern Ocean. More than 200 scientists and experts have opposed the <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal</b> for lifting the ban, and have also opposed allowing whaling in the Southern Ocean, which was declared a whale sanctuary in 1994 (Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary).|$|E
50|$|The Crittenden {{proposals}} were also {{discussed at the}} Peace Conference of 1861, a meeting of more than 100 of the nation's leading politicians, held February 8-27, 1861, in Washington, D.C.. The conference, lead by former President John Tyler, was the final formal effort of the states to avert the start of war. There too, the <b>Compromise</b> <b>proposals</b> failed, as the provision guaranteeing slave-ownership throughout all Western territories and future acquisitions again proved unpalatable.|$|R

25|$|Before the referendum, Alingué {{had played}} a {{significant}} role during the convening of the National Sovereign Conference (CNS) in 1993. He acted there as a spokesman for the members representing the political parties, presiding over the conclusive rounds of talks that beginning on March 7 were to define the last issues on the tables. In particular, he {{played an important role in}} putting an end to the serious deadlock that emerged regarding the composition and the size of the transitional legislature that was to remain in office until elections were held. After many fruitless votations, Alingué, speaking for the political parties, imposed a <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal,</b> on which no negotiation or debate was accepted.|$|E
25|$|Britain, France, Italy and America imposed severe {{economic}} penalties on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles, {{and both the}} British and French empires annexed former German and Ottoman Empire colonies in Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific. Russia {{was not involved in}} this because of their withdrawal from the war soon after the Russian revolution in 1917. The United States swiftly pulled its troops out of Europe after Germany had surrendered. Two thirds of the American soldiers participating in the war had returned home already when the Treaty of Versailles was signed. Only a lone U.S. Army unit was left in the European soil at end of the decade. The United States Senate did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles; instead, the United States signed separate peace treaties with Germany, Austria and Hungary in August 1921. The Senate also refused to enter the newly created League of Nations on Wilson's terms, and Wilson rejected the Senate's <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Late in 1976, Ian Smith {{accepted}} {{the basic elements}} of the <b>compromise</b> <b>proposals</b> made by US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to introduce majority rule within two years. The Smith Government then sought to negotiate an acceptable settlement with moderate black leaders, while retaining strong white influence in key areas. The Rhodesian military, in turn, had the job of eroding the rising military strength of the ZANLA and ZIPRA to the greatest extent possible in order [...] "buy time" [...] for an acceptable political settlement to be reached.|$|R
50|$|The {{international}} community, led by Nigeria, {{tried to}} bring order to the expanding chaos in Chad {{through a series of}} international peace conferences. But the first peace conference held in March excluded minor factions, like the Volcan Army; as a reaction they created the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), a counter-government supported by Libya and opposed to the new Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT). As the first <b>compromise</b> <b>proposals</b> failed, the FACP swiftly renamed itself Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR), and assumed as its leader Ahmat Acyl.

500|$|A Democrat {{active in}} many {{progressive}} causes, including efforts to strengthen public control of government, {{and the fight}} against child labor, Owen is especially remembered as the Senate sponsor of the Glass-Owen Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which created the Federal Reserve System. [...] In discussions at the time, he resisted a campaign to put the Federal Reserve formally {{under the control of}} the banking industry, and the 1913 Act emerged broadly in line with Owen's <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal,</b> creating a central Federal Reserve Board nominated by the Government alongside twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks dominated by the larger banks. [...] Owen subsequently became highly critical of what he saw as the Federal Reserve's bias towards deflationary policies during the early 1920s and again in the early 1930s, which he attributed to excessive influence by the largest banks upon the Fed, and which he identified as largely responsible for causing the Great Depression: a minority view at the time, but one that has, in recent decades, gained wide acceptance among Conservative economists (having been popularized by Milton Friedman in the 1960s). In 1920 Owen unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency.|$|E
500|$|On March 12, 2014, the FCC Media Bureau {{released}} a notice {{that it would}} further analyze television station transactions that include sharing agreements, particularly those that include a purchase option that [...] "may counter any incentive the licensee has to increase {{the value of the}} station, since the licensee may be unlikely to realize that increased value." [...] Under the new provisions, broadcasters must demonstrate in their transaction applications as to how such deals would serve the public interest. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) – which, along with station groups such as Sinclair Broadcast Group, have disapproved of the proposal to ban JSAs – presented a <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal,</b> in which the brokered licensee in a sharing agreement would retain control over at least 85 percent of the station's programming, maintain at least 70 percent of ad sales revenue and [...] "maintain at least 20 percent of station value in the license itself". FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, and Gordon Smith, president of the NAB, were also opposed to the new rules on joint sales agreements, believing that they would discourage the ownership of television stations by minority-owned companies. Tom Wheeler, however, proposed the restrictions in the hopes of encouraging more women and minorities to own stations, due to the ongoing consolidation in the television industry through company mergers and sharing agreements.|$|E
500|$|At {{the conference}} in Vienna later in the year, Metternich found himself {{constrained}} by the Kings of Württemberg and Bavaria to abandon his plans to reform the German federation. He now regretted having so quickly forced through its original constitution five years before. Nevertheless, he held ground on other issues and the Conference's Final Act was highly reactionary, much as Metternich had envisaged it. He remained in Vienna until the close in May 1820, finding the whole affair a bore. On 6 May he heard {{of the death of}} his daughter Klementine from tuberculosis. Journeying on to Prague, he heard that his eldest daughter Maria had also contracted the disease. He was at her bedside in Baden bei Wien when she died on 20 July. This prompted Eleonore and the remaining children to leave for the cleaner air of France. The rest of 1820 was filled with liberal revolts to which Metternich was expected to respond. Ultimately, the Austrian Foreign Minister was torn between following through on his conservative pledge (a policy favoured by the Russians) and keeping out of a country in which Austria had no interest (favoured by the British). He chose [...] "sympathetic inactivity" [...] on Spain but, much to his dismay and surprise, Guglielmo Pepe led a revolt in Naples in early July and forced King Ferdinand I to accept a new constitution. Metternich reluctantly agreed to attend the Russian-initiated Congress of Troppau in October to discuss these events. He need not have worried: the Tsar gave way and accepted a <b>compromise</b> <b>proposal</b> of moderate interventionism. Still worried by Kapodistrias' influence over the Tsar, he laid down his conservative principles in a long memorandum, including an attack on the free press and the initiative of the middle classes.|$|E

30|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in the applications of WSANs in the recent years. Due to the harsh employed environment and limited energy supply, WSAN is prone {{to be out of}} work, which may break network connectivity. In this paper, we investigate the problem of restoring network connectivity when a single node fails. A hybrid distributed, localized, and efficient connectivity restoration algorithm HCR is proposed to solve this problem through moving the backup node to BestPosition. Compared with the previous schemes, HCR performs a localized network analysis to identify critical nodes, and only a critical node’s failure triggers the restoration process. It is a <b>compromised</b> <b>proposal</b> between the cut vertex identification and non-identification. It is effective and has low complexity.|$|R
