50|$|A {{concealed}} fan <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> will typically {{be installed}} within an accessible ceiling void or services zone. The {{return air grille}} and supply air diffuser, typically set flush into the ceiling, will be ducted {{to and from the}} fan <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> and thus allows a great degree of flexibility for locating the grilles to suit the ceiling layout and/or the partition layout within a space.

5000|$|The {{reason that}} these DC Fan <b>Coil</b> <b>Units</b> are, despite their {{apparent}} relative complexity, becoming more popular is their improved energy efficiency levels {{compared to their}} AC motor driven counterparts {{of only a few}} years ago.

A fan <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> is a diverse device sometimes using ductwork, and is used to control the temperature in the space where it is installed, or serve multiple spaces.

40|$|Abstract Background Air {{conditioning}} systems represent {{one important}} source of microbial pollutants for indoor air. In the past few years, numerous strategies have been conceived to reduce the contamination of air conditioners, mainly in hospital settings. The biocidal detergent BATT 2 represents a natural product obtained through extraction from brown seaweeds, that has been tested previously on multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Methods BATT 2 has been utilized for the disinfection of fan <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> from four air conditioning systems located in hospital environments with a mean degree of risk. Samples were collected from the air supplied by the conditioning systems and from the surfaces of fan <b>coil</b> <b>units,</b> before and after sanitization procedures. Total microbial counts at 37 °C and 22 °C and mycotic count at 32 °C were evaluated. Staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also detected on surfaces samples. Results The biodetergent was able to reduce up 50 % of the microbial pollution of fan <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> surfaces and air supplied by the air conditioners.

In this paper, a literature review of life cycle assessment and embodied carbon studies clearly signposts {{the need for more}} research on the embodied impacts of building services. Theoretical and practical challenges are identified in the use of LCA methods in construction along with possible solutions compatible with BIM-led design. A case study of horizontal, ducted fan <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> demonstrates that variations in embodied carbon of similar units could be associated with variations in total cooling capacity. This raises the possibility that metrics could subsequently be devised to predict embodied carbon for a generic class of fan <b>coil</b> <b>units.</b> Implications of these results are explored and recommendations made for future studies...|$|R

40|$|A quasi-steady state {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} {{ground source heat pump}} has been developed. Heating and cooling is delivered to the building using fan <b>coil</b> <b>units,</b> which are either in constant operation (Strategy 1) or switched on/off as water flow to the coil is diverted (Strategy 2). The performance of the system is evaluated using a system performance factor (SPF). It was observed that values for SPF 4 (which includes all components) decreases for decreasing building load. For strategy 2, the energy saving associated with SPF 4 are greater than Strategy 1, but savings are diminished at higher loads. Improved system performance was observed at lower return water temperatures in heating and higher return temperatures in cooling. However, in both cases the capacity of the fan <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> is reduced. The temperature compensation strategy developed resulted in an improved SPF 4 for Strategy 1 and a less significant improvement for Strategy 2...|$|R
50|$|In {{high-rise}} residential construction, typically each fan <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> {{requires a}} rectangular through-penetration {{in the concrete}} slab on top of which it sits. Usually, there are either 2 or 4 pipes made of ABS, steel or copper that go through the floor. The pipes are usually insulated with refrigeration insulation, such as acrylonitrile butadiene/polyvinyl chloride (AB/PVC) flexible foam (Rubatex or Armaflex brands) on all pipes, or {{at least on the}} chilled water lines to prevent condensate from forming.|$|E
5000|$|Speed {{control of}} the fan motors within a fan <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some {{manufacturers}} accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat. Building Energy Management Systems {{can be used for}} automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor. More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation. Compared to units with asynchronous 3-speed motors, the fan coil units with brushless motors will reduce the power consumption up to 70%.http://heinenhopman.com/en/merchant/fan-coil-unit/ ...|$|E
50|$|Fan <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit</b> design falls principally {{into two}} main types: blow through and draw through. As the names suggest, {{in the first}} type the fans are fitted such that they blow through the heat exchanger, {{and in the other}} type the fans are fitted after the coil such that they draw air through it. Draw through units are {{considered}} thermally superior, as ordinarily they make better use of the heat exchanger. However they are more expensive, as they require a chassis to hold the fans whereas a blow-through unit typically consists of a set of fans bolted straight to a coil.|$|E

50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{selected}} chilled water temperatures {{and the relative}} humidity of the space, {{it is likely that}} the cooling coil will dehumidify the entering air stream, and as a by product of this process, it will at times produce a condensate which will need to be carried to drain. The fan <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> will contain a purpose designed drip tray with drain connection for this purpose. The simplest means to drain the condensate from multiple fan coil units will be by a network of pipework laid to falls to a suitable point. Alternatively a condensate pump may be employed where space for such gravity pipework is limited.|$|E
50|$|The coil {{receives}} hot or {{cold water}} from a central plant, and removes heat from or adds heat to the air through heat transfer. Traditionally fan coil units can contain their own internal thermostat, or can be wired to operate with a remote thermostat. However, and as is common in most modern buildings with a Building Energy Management System (BEMS), {{the control of the}} fan <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> will be by a local digital controller or outstation (along with associated room temperature sensor and control valve actuators) linked to the BEMS via a communication network, and therefore adjustable and controllable from a central point, such as a supervisors head end computer.|$|E
