Re-elected in 2008 with Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, Vietti received the role of deputy chairman of his parliamentary group.|$|E
5000|$|The Weimar Coalition (Weimarer Koalition) is {{the name}} given to the centre-left to center-right {{coalition}} of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the social liberal German Democratic Party (DDP) and the <b>Christian</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>Party,</b> who together had {{a large majority of}} the delegates to the Constituent Assembly that met at Weimar in 1919, and were the principal groups that designed the constitution of Germany's Weimar Republic. These three parties were seen as the most committed to Germany's new democratic system, and together governed Germany until the elections of 1920, when the first elections under the new constitution were held, and both the SPD and especially the DDP lost a considerable share of their votes. Although the Coalition was revived in the ministry of Joseph Wirth from 1921 to 1922, the pro-democratic elements never truly had a majority in the Reichstag from this point on, and the situation gradually grew worse for them with the continued weakening of the DDP. This meant that any pro-republican group that hoped to attain a majority would need to form a [...] "Grand Coalition" [...] with the conservative liberal German People's Party (DVP).|$|E

5000|$|Barnett {{also claims}} that, in {{strategic}} terms, Germany {{was in fact}} in a superior position following the Treaty than {{she had been in}} 1914. Germany′s eastern frontiers faced Russia and Austria, who had both in the past balanced German power. Barnett asserts that its post-war eastern borders were safer, because the former Austrian Empire fractured after the war into smaller, weaker states, Russia was wracked by revolution and civil war, and the newly restored Poland was no match for even a defeated Germany. In the West, Germany was balanced only by France and Belgium, both of which were smaller in population and less economically vibrant than Germany. Barnett concludes by saying that instead of weakening Germany, the treaty [...] "much enhanced" [...] German power. Britain and France should have (according to Barnett) [...] "divided and permanently weakened" [...] Germany by undoing Bismarck's work and partitioning Germany into smaller, weaker states so it could never have disrupted the peace of Europe again. By failing to do this and therefore not solving the problem of German power and restoring the equilibrium of Europe, Britain [...] "had failed in her main purpose in taking part in the Great War".The British historian of modern Germany, Richard J. Evans, wrote that during the war the German right was committed to an annexationist program which aimed at Germany annexing most of Europe and Africa. Consequently, any peace treaty that did not leave Germany as the conqueror would be unacceptable to them. Short of allowing Germany to keep all the conquests of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Evans argued that there was nothing that could have been done to persuade the German right to accept Versailles. Evans further noted that the parties of the Weimar Coalition, namely the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the social liberal German Democratic Party (DDP) and the <b>Christian</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>Party,</b> were all equally opposed to Versailles, and it is false to claim as some historians have that opposition to Versailles also equalled opposition to the Weimar Republic. Finally, Evans argued that it is untrue that Versailles caused the premature end of the Republic, instead contending that it was the Great Depression of the early 1930s that put an end to German democracy. He also argued that Versailles was not the [...] "main cause" [...] of National Socialism and the German economy was [...] "only marginally influenced by the impact of reparations".|$|E

5000|$|Bondevik's first cabinet governed Norway between 17 October 1997 to 3 March 2000.

5000|$|Labour held office {{until after}} the 1997 general election. Kjell Magne Bondevik's First Cabinet, a {{coalition}} of the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic,</b> <b>Centre</b> and Liberal <b>parties,</b> assumed office then, but {{did not have a}} suicide paragraph. However, when Kjell Magne Bondevik's Second Cabinet (<b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic,</b> Conservative, Liberal) assumed office in 2001, a suicide paragraph {{was a part of the}} post-election Declaration of Sem. Unlike in 1989, it was not clear that the EU was an actual forthcoming issue. However, the parties decided to keep it as a safeguard, and the paragraph now meant that the coalition would disband if the European question reached the broader political [...] "agenda". Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik represented an EU-sceptical party, and was personally prepared to resign, an action which would dissolve the cabinet. Dagbladets commentator noted that the will to remain in coalition was strong, so the suicide paragraph actually vitalized Bondevik's Second Cabinet, securing a state of non-debate and thus a prolonged life of the coalition. The cabinet remained intact throughout the term.|$|R
40|$|Title: Similarities or {{differences}} within the centre-right? A {{study of the}} potential for party fusions within in the Swedish centre-right Author: Charlie Weimers Aim: The thesis seeks to find the potential for party fusions within the Swedish centre-right by analyzing the ideological similarities and differences between the parties. Method/Material: In the thesis, four dimensions of the parties’ ideologies are analyzed: view of man, theory for societal structures, fiscal theory and moral values. The results of the study of the ideologies are then compared. The investigation is done with the party manifestos as starting point and with the analysis of ideas as theoretical tool. Main Results: The comparative analysis, based on the parties’ ideological views, shows specific party constellations are more probable than others. The biggest ideological similarities are to be found between the Liberal People’s <b>Party</b> and the <b>Centre</b> <b>Party,</b> out of which I conclude that these two parties have the best potential for a fusion. The Moderate Party and the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party also have clear similarities, thus there is a potential for fusion to a certain degree. The Moderate Party also shows some similarities with the Liberal People’s <b>Party</b> and the <b>Centre</b> <b>Party,</b> hence the possibility for a merger can not be excluded. My conclusion is based upon social liberalism and neo-conservatism as ideal types, which gives the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party a position to the right. Thus, it would possible to claim that this party has the least options regarding fusion partners. The Moderate Party has the most alternatives, since the party is in a kind of “middle ground” between social liberalism and neo-conservatism.

50|$|The modern State Secretary {{institution}} {{was established}} in 1947, following a 78-41 vote in the Norwegian Parliament. The Labour and Communist parties voted for, whereas the Agrarian (<b>Centre),</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic,</b> Liberal, and Conservative parties voted against. The cabinet {{at that time was}} a single-party Labour cabinet led by Einar Gerhardsen, and one State Secretary was appointed seven of the ministries. State Secretaries in the Office of the Prime Minister followed in 1956, having originally been known as Secretaries to the Prime Minister. When the cabinet Lyng (Conservative, <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic,</b> <b>Centre,</b> Liberal) assumed office in August 1963, they appointed State Secretaries in nearly all ministries, and when the cabinet Korvald (<b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic,</b> <b>Centre,</b> Liberal) assumed office, it became the first cabinet to employ two State Secretaries in one ministry.|$|R
