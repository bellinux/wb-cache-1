5|$|Hemming's <b>Cartulary</b> is a {{manuscript}} <b>cartulary,</b> or collection of charters and other land records, collected by a monk named Hemming {{around the time}} of the Norman Conquest of England. The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; it is in the British Library as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the Liber Wigorniensis, is a collection of Anglo-Saxon charters and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, Hemming's <b>Cartulary</b> proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources for}} Urse's life are English {{documents}} such as charters and writs which mention his activities. Often these {{are contained in}} collections of such documents, known as cartularies, which were assembled by monasteries and cathedral chapters to document their landholdings. Cartularies frequently contain documents from landholders surrounding a monastery, which {{is the case with}} many of the documents mentioning Urse. Other sources of information on Urse are Domesday Book, which mentions his landholdings in 1086, and a number of chronicles, including William of Malmesbury's Gesta pontificum Anglorum, Florence of Worcester's Chronicon ex chronicis, and Hemming's <b>Cartulary,</b> a mixed chronicle and <b>cartulary</b> from Worcester Cathedral. There are also mentions of Urse in Norman sources, such as charters for Saint-Georges de Boscherville Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} 11th-century <b>cartulary</b> {{surviving}} from England is the Oswald <b>cartulary,</b> also compiled at Worcester. Historian M. T. Clanchy {{has suggested that}} the form English cartularies took may have originated at Worcester, although fellow historian Robin Fleming has argued that Christ Church Canterbury's surviving <b>cartulary</b> is also an 11th-century compilation. Who owned the manuscript after it left Worcester Cathedral Priory, presumably with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1540s, is unknown, but the manuscript was in the possession of Robert Cotton by 1612, when it is recorded as being loaned by Cotton to Arthur Agarde. There are annotations in the manuscript by John Joscelyn, who was secretary to Matthew Parker (d. 1575), the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, but whether Parker owned the manuscript is uncertain. The manuscript thus became part of the Cotton library, which passed into public ownership in 1702 on the death of Cotton's grandson on the basis of an act of Parliament of 1701. The manuscript itself is now part of the British Library's holdings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cartularies</b> of Valpuesta are two medieval Spanish <b>cartularies</b> which {{belonged to}} a monastery in the {{locality}} of Valpuesta {{in what is now}} the province of Burgos, Castile and León, Spain. The <b>cartularies</b> are called the Gótico and the Galicano from the type of script used in each. They are housed in the National Archives of Spain.|$|R

50|$|The allusion of Gregory of Tours to chartarum tomi in the 6th {{century is}} {{commonly}} taken {{to refer to}} <b>cartularies.</b> The oldest surviving <b>cartularies,</b> however, originated in the 10th century. Those from the 10th to the 13th centuries are very numerous.|$|R
5|$|The {{two works}} are bound {{together}} in one surviving manuscript, the earliest surviving <b>cartulary</b> from medieval England. A major theme is the losses suffered by Worcester {{at the hands of}} royal officials and local landowners. Included amongst the despoilers are kings such as Cnut and William the Conqueror, and nobles such as Eadric Streona and Urse d'Abetot. Also included are accounts of lawsuits waged by the Worcester monks in an effort to regain their lost lands. The two sections of the <b>cartulary</b> were first printed in 1723. The original manuscript was slightly damaged by fire in 1733, and required rebinding. A new printed edition is in production as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Urse {{was also}} {{involved}} in a dispute between Wulfstan and Evesham Abbey over lands in Worcestershire as, after the Conquest, Urse acquired the lands of Azur, a kinsman of an earlier Bishop of Worcester, Beorhtheah. Azur had originally leased the lands from the diocese, but after Urse confiscated the lands, the sheriff did not return the lands to the bishop, and instead kept them for himself. The Worcester monk Hemming recorded {{the loss of the}} lands to Urse in Hemming's <b>Cartulary,</b> a <b>cartulary</b> written about 1095 recording lands and charters belonging to the diocese of Worcester. Hemmings' <b>Cartulary</b> mentions not just Azur's lands, but others at Acton Beauchamp, Clopton, and Redmarley as taken from the diocese of Worcester by Urse. After Abbot Æthelwig's death, Urse also acquired lands that Æthelwig had seized through less than legal means, when William I's half-brother Odo of Bayeux, the Bishop of Bayeux, presided at the lawsuit brought to determine the ownership of the lands. Odo gave a number of the disputed estates to Urse {{during the course of the}} lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|In 1191, {{the king}} {{confirmed}} the monastery {{and its surrounding}} fields as belonging to the Cistercian Order. The aged abbot of Santa María de Huerta, bishop Martín de Finojosa (later canonized), consecrated the church in September 1213 and died days later. The surrounding area of Murel and Trillo along the Tagus prospered, giving tithes and gifts of land to the monastery. The <b>cartulary,</b> Cartulario de Óvila, is preserved at the University of Madrid.|$|E

5|$|The Kačić's {{family can}} be traced to the Pacta conventa, an {{agreement}} dating from 1102 (or later), according to which the Kačićs were one of the twelve Croatian noble tribes (genus) who accepted the Hungarian king Coloman as the new king of Croatia. They were represented by comes Juraj Kačić (Comittem Gurram de genere Chaçittorum). According to the Supetar <b>Cartulary,</b> they were one of six tribes which selected bans who, in turn, elected a new king in a case where the prior king died without leaving heirs.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{documentary}} evidence {{is available from}} Ealdred's time as Bishop of Worcester. Only five leases that he signed survive, and all date from 1051 to 1053. Two further leases exist in Hemming's <b>Cartulary</b> as copies only. How the diocese of Worcester was administered when Ealdred was abroad is unclear, although it appears that Wulfstan, the prior of the cathedral chapter, performed the religious duties in the diocese. On the financial side, the Evesham Chronicle states that Æthelwig, who became abbot of Evesham Abbey in 1058, administered Worcester before he became abbot.|$|E

The books comprise, with some repetition, a <b>cartulary</b> of possessions of the cathedral, with grants of land dating back {{as early as the}} 8th century, well before the development of hereditary surnames in England; they also comprise acts of the Dean and Chapter, and surveys of their estates, mostly in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|When Donnchadh adopted or {{was given}} the title of earl (Latin: comes), or in his own {{language}} mormaer, is a debated question. Historian Alan Orr Anderson argued that he began using the title of comes between 1214 and 1216, based on Donnchadh's appearance as a witness to two charters issued by Thomas de Colville; the first, known as Melrose 193 (this being its number in Cosmo Innes's printed version of the <b>cartulary),</b> was dated by Anderson to 1214. In this charter, Donnchadh has no title. By contrast Donnchadh was styled comes in a charter dated by Anderson to 1216, Melrose 192.|$|E
5|$|Basset {{probably}} died in 1127, and {{was certainly}} dead in 1130. He {{is said to}} have taken ill at Northampton, and to have been clothed in a monk's habit while on his deathbed. He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a <b>cartulary,</b> records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem to have been held by Basset as a sub-tenant, four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not very valuable, and Basset can not be considered a baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage to {{become a member of the}} barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E
5000|$|Two smaller {{books of}} fiefs {{related to the}} LFM project are also preserved.

5|$|Doctor Francisco Layna Serrano {{of nearby}} Ruguilla {{had for years}} tried to save the monastery but had failed to {{interest}} {{the government in the}} expensive preservation proposal. Realizing that this was his last chance to document the place as its stones were being removed, he wrote a monograph of its history and included a site plan of the layout of buildings, written from memory. As a result of his efforts, on June 3, 1931, Santa María de Óvila was listed as a National Monument of Spain, or Bien de Interés Cultural (Cultural Property). Layna Serrano published his monograph in 1932. In 1933, the monastery's historic <b>cartulary</b> was brought to the University of Madrid and published; the original was archived at the University of Oviedo.|$|E
5|$|If {{the latter}} {{suggestion}} is correct, then Thored's {{first appearance in}} history is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recension D (EF)'s entry for 966, which recorded the accession of Oslac to the ealdormanry of southern Northumbria: In this year, Thored, Gunnar's son, harried Westmoringa land, and, in this same year, Oslac succeeded {{to the office of}} ealdorman. The Anglo-Saxon scholar Frank Stenton believed that this was an act of regional faction-fighting, rather than, as had been suggested by others, Thored carrying out the orders of King Edgar the Peaceable. This entry is, incidentally, the first mention of Westmoringa land, that is, Westmorland. Gunnar seems to have been ealdorman earlier in the decade, for in one charter (surviving only in a later <b>cartulary)</b> dated to 963 and three Abingdon charters dated to 965, an ealdorman (dux) called Gunnar is mentioned.|$|E
5|$|The burial {{practices}} of the archbishops did change after Cuthbert, {{but it is not}} clear whether this was intended by Cuthbert, as a Post-Conquest Canterbury <b>cartulary</b> has it, or due to other reasons, unconnected with Cuthbert. Although Sonia Hawkes argues that the change in burial customs, which extended over most of Britain, resulted from Cuthbert's mandating burial in church yards, instead of outside the city limits as had been the custom previously. However, the main evidence for this theory is a 16th-century tradition at Canterbury and the archaeological evidence of a change in burial patterns. Although a change did occur, the archaeological evidence does not give a reason why this change happened, and given the late date of the Canterbury tradition, the theory cannot be considered proven.|$|E
40|$|Despite the feeble {{interest}} of the Italian historians for the deeds produced by non-urban political subject, just a simple bibliographical and archival recognition has allowed to show the large diffusion of the <b>cartularies</b> {{at the end of}} the Middle Ages. This essay investigates the vicissitude of the <b>cartularies,</b> non only regarding their function within the kinship (time by time labeled as pragmatic, juridical, symbolic, performative), but also regarding to the narrative structure often taken by the <b>cartularies,</b> which provides them as a cultural product. They really were a sort of memory books, of political recollections – even though per fragmenta, produced through an accurate selection of documents – of the “gentiluomini di Lombardia” (as Machiavelli called the rural nobility) whom were alien different ways of codification of the story of the family (such as the more famous “libri di famiglia”, so widespread in Tuscany) ...|$|R

5|$|Urse {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for extortion and financial exactions. During the reign of William II, he was considered {{second only to the}} king's minister Ranulf Flambard in his rapacity. The first mention of his exactions is in Hemming's <b>Cartulary.</b> Further details were given by the medieval chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Gerald of Wales, both of whom relate Ealdred's curse. His exactions were also mentioned in Domesday Book, where an entry in the survey for Gloucestershire noted that his oppression prevented the inhabitants of Sodbury so much that they were unable to pay their customary rents. He intimidated the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter into granting him a lease of two of their estates, Greenhill and Eastbury. Urse was one of a new breed of royal official, one who was not opposed to royal power but rather welcomed it, as it helped his own position.|$|E
5|$|Hemming was {{the author}} of the second and later part, a {{collection}} of lands and rights belonging to the cathedral chapter of Worcester, as well as a narrative of the deeds of Wulfstan, the Bishop of Worcester who died in 1095, and Archbishop Ealdred of York. In this part of the work is a preface known as the Enucleatio libelli, where Hemming names himself as the person responsible for compiling the work, and names Wulfstan as the inspiration for his work. Another section, known as the Prefatio istius libelli, now much later in the manuscript but possibly meant as an introduction to the Codicellus, is a shorter introduction that gives the purpose of the collection. Historians usually take the two prefaces to mean that Wulfstan commissioned the work, but it is unclear whether it was created before or after Wulfstan's death. It may have been produced during the vacancy after Wulfstan's death, and before the appointment of the next bishop, Samson. Historian Nicholas Brooks, along with Vivian Galbraith, argues that Hemming's work was a response to the problems encountered by the diocese during the vacancy, when royal officials administered the lands of the bishopric. According to Brooks, the claim that Wulfstan ordered the composition of the <b>cartulary</b> was inaccurate, and was made to appeal to the authority of the bishop. The historian Julia Barrow believes that the inspiration for the work was the creation of the Domesday Book in 1086, although she agrees that the work was completed after Wulfstan's death. Hemming's work contains over 50charters, some of which are duplicates of ones in the Liber.|$|E
