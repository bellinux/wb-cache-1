50|$|The top command deploys {{teams of}} trained, armed men to rural areas vital for drug-trafficking operations. These include zones with natural sea ports along the Caribbean coast, or areas where <b>coca</b> <b>base</b> must be bought, like Caucasia or Tarazá in Antioquia (InSight has also heard reports of an Urabeño cell in Medellin). These cells then attempt to recruit local informants, {{especially}} collaborators who can inform {{them of the}} actions of the security forces.|$|E
5000|$|As {{an example}} of the above, it is claimed by critics that Peru and Bolivia, as {{countries}} which had earlier monopolized coca cultivations until local eradication efforts later led to the eventual transfer of that part of the illegal business to Colombia, have recently had small increases in coca production despite record eradication in Colombia, which some years ago accounted for about 80% of the <b>coca</b> <b>base</b> produced in South America. Supporters of the Plan and of drug prohibition in general consider that the increase has, so far, been significant to be a sign of the above [...] "balloon effect".|$|E
5000|$|Currently, the Rastrojos have an {{agreement}} with the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional - ELN) for several years in the departments of Cauca and Nariño. More recently they obtained a similar agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) {{in other parts of the}} country. In both cases, these alliances give the Rastrojos direct access to <b>coca</b> <b>base,</b> which provides them the raw material to convert into cocaine at very cheap prices. The Rastrojos' other ally, Daniel Barrera Barrera, alias [...] "El Loco," [...] struck similar agreements with the FARC in other areas until his arrest in September 2012. Together the Rastrojos and Barrera have obtained a huge competitive advantage, one that has also led to strong partnerships with Mexican cartels.|$|E
50|$|The International Narcotics Control Board of the United Nations {{has had the}} {{coca leaf}} {{on the list of}} {{dangerous}} drugs since 1961. Exporting the drink worldwide will not be possible unless drug laws are changed, including local Bolivian law which prevents exporting any <b>coca</b> <b>based</b> product from the country. However, importers from Iran, Bolivia's economic and political ally, have already expressed an interest in over 2 million units of the drink when large scale production starts.|$|R

Based on the mobile policy of Sink nodes by the voronoi division, the essay proposes a coverage optimization control algorithm (<b>COCA)</b> <b>based</b> on coverage hole calculating {{to optimize the}} initial random deployment of sensor nodes, and then to eliminate coverage holes and improve the coverage performance of network. Simulation results show that, compared with the random deployed network, the COCA algorithm only requires fewer nodes to achieve a higher coverage ratio and to maintain in low energy consumption, which embodies optimum performance of the network deployment...|$|R
40|$|A {{programming}} {{model for}} software parallelization, called CoCa, is introduced that copes with {{problems caused by}} typical features of high-energy physics software. By <b>basing</b> <b>CoCa</b> on the database transaction paradimg, the complexity induced by the parallelization is for a large part transparent to the programmer, resulting in {{a higher level of}} abstraction than the native message passing software. CoCa is implemented on a Meiko CS- 2 and on a SUN SPARCcenter 2000 parallel computer. On the CS- 2, the performance is comparable with the performance of native PVM and MPI...|$|R
50|$|When {{it comes}} to drug trafficking, the Gulf's Clan are similar to rival DTOS like the Rastrojos or the Paisas {{in that they are}} uninterested in {{controlling}} the entire chain of drug production. But they have not proved as adept as the Rastrojos when {{it comes to}} brokering key alliances with other major players in the drug trade. The Gulf's Clan will buy <b>coca</b> <b>base</b> from the FARC, but the two groups will not collaborate much further than that. What is helping the Clan compete so far is their military discipline: so far they have proved immune to the kind of infighting tearing apart the Paisas or the Oficina. The Gulf's Clan may yet prove themselves capable of expanding their operations beyond the Caribbean coast and northern Colombia, if they are not derailed by their war with the Rastrojos.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{generalized}} structure of cellular automata (CA) – the configurable cellular automata (CoCA). With selected properties from programmable CA (PCA) and controllable CA (CCA), {{a new approach}} to cellular automata is developed. In CoCA, the cells are dynamically reconfigured at run-time via a control CA. Reconfiguration of a cell simply means varying the properties of that cell with time. Some examples of properties to be reconfigured are rule selection, boundary condition, and radius. While the objective {{of this paper is to}} propose CoCA as a new CA method, the main focus is to design a CoCA that can function as a good pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). As a PRNG, CoCA can be a suitable candidate as it can pass 17 out of 18 Diehard tests with 31 cells. <b>CoCA</b> PRNG’s performance <b>based</b> on Diehard test is considered superior over other CA PRNG works. Moreover, CoCA opens new rooms for research not only in the field of random number generation, but in modeling complex systems as well. Key words: random number generation, cellular automata, configurable cellular automata 1...|$|R
40|$|Cocaine {{trafficking}} is {{a significant}} problem that affects countries {{all over the world}} and this needs to be researched in order to understand the huge impact that it has. The cocaine trade is a multi-billion pound industry that is governed by gangs organising the crime on an international scale and all efforts to eliminate the business have been unsuccessful up to the present time. The production of <b>coca</b> is <b>based</b> in South America; the majority coming from Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. These countries are the main cocaine producers where it is manufactured on a large scale and then distributed across the borders to the Caribbean, Australia and Europe. The methods of trafficking are varied and the cocaine is shipped, transferred by aircraft, transported by land routes and smuggled by drug mules. The controls in place are discussed and it becomes clear that they are often corrupt and the laws and efforts of prevention have not decreased the power of the cocaine trade. This sparked the question of whether it was worth spending millions of pounds to eliminate coca production and reduce trafficking and the explanations in this research conclude that there still has to be efforts in order to control the trade otherwise it would be even worse without the risk of any punishments and consequences. This study uses limited qualitative interviews with three drug users who described their experiences of using cocaine. This research was to help understand the social impact of cocaine on UK society. For all three interviewees, their lives have been changed by the drug abuse and they had taken both powder cocaine and crack cocaine. They described how they had committed crimes in order to fund their drug habit and showed emotion when talking about how their family relationships had been affected. It is concluded that the cocaine trade is proving extremely difficult to eradicate because the supply and demand are so great, the network of the business is strong and it is on such a large scale where people are risking their lives because the income is worth it to them. It is also concluded that there is not enough research to draw conclusions about the effect of cocaine trafficking on the United Kingdom and therefore a UK wide study would be exceptionally valuable...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the field}} of studies on drugs and security, the present {{dissertation}} is aimed at making, at least, three original contributions. First, from the traditional classification of illegal drugs –those derived from the coca leaf, those derived from the poppies, those derived from cannabis and the synthetic drugs– this study focuses on the coca-cocaine complex (CCC), i. e., the actors involved {{as well as the}} dimensions of production, manufacture, traffic and consumption of <b>coca</b> paste, cocaine <b>base</b> paste, cocaine hydrochloride, and its raw material, the coca leaf. The analysis was aimed at elucidating the way in which this complex has affected South America since the 1980 s, and Argentina in the post- 2001 crisis. Secondly, from a theoretical framework that combines an objectivist perspective of security with the constructivist Theory of Securitization, this dissertation not only deals with the material threats posed by the CCC, but also analyses the perceptions that South American and Argentinian political elites have developed and turned into security priority issues regarding the CCC. Finally, this thesis seeks to overcome the prevalent and traditional formulations on drugs and security studies, which have focused their analysis on the effects of drug trafficking on national security –the state-centered approach–. Instead, this dissertation widens the scope in order to integrate Argentina into South America as a Regional Security Complex (RSC) and as the geopolitical basis of the CCC. This, I consider, is the strongest contribution of this research work to the field, given the fact that, while there is an extensive bibliography on the CCC in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, there has been little research yielding information about the CCC in Argentina –arguably for its recent change of profile in the universe of drug trafficking...|$|R
