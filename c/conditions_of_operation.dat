50|$|Fares are {{identical}} to those {{on the rest of}} the metropolitan network, and the line is accessible by the same transit subscriptions. A ticket t+ allows for a one-way trip on the line, regardless of the number of connections made with other mÃ©tro lines or the RER (so long as the RER is taken only within the city of Paris, i.e. Paris intra-muros).The financing of the operation of the line is guaranteed by the RATP. Fares and subscription prices are regulated by the government and in fact their revenues do not cover the entire operating costs of the network. The difference is made up with funding provided by the Syndicat des transports d'ÃŽle-de-France (STIF), presided over since 2005 by the president of the Conseil rÃ©gional d'ÃŽle-de-France and governed by locally elected officials.
