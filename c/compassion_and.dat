40|$|Background: Studies have {{investigated}} burnout <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> fatigue among nurses and {{effects in the}} nursing profession. However, there are limited investigations of burnout <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> fatigue among undergraduate nursing students in South Africa, as nursing students may experience distressful situations during their nursing education course, which may have an impact during their training and in their profession as they graduate. Purpose: The purpose of this descriptive study was to describe compassion satisfaction, <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>and</b> burnout among undergraduate nursing students at a tertiary nursing institution. Methods: A quantitative descriptive {{study was conducted to}} describe compassion satisfaction, <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>and</b> burnout among undergraduate nursing students at a tertiary nursing institution in KwaZulu-Natal. Convenience sampling was used. Results: Sixty-seven undergraduate students (26 third-year and 41 fourth-year nursing students) took the self-test Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL). The study results indicate that undergraduate students experienced average levels of <b>compassion</b> fatigue, burnout <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> satisfaction. Conclusion: As shown in the study, some of the undergraduate students are experiencing <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>and</b> burnout, associated with relieving suffering of others. Therefore, knowledge of <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>and</b> burnout and the coping strategies should be part of nursing training...|$|R

5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E

Additionally, this study looked at the years of experience, job responsibilities, on-call responsibilities and direct student contact hours which may impact an individual’s overall professional quality of life. To accomplish the objectives outlined in the purpose statement, the following research questions were explored: 1. What is the relationship between student conduct professionals’ <b>compassion</b> satisfaction, burnout, <b>and</b> secondary traumatic stress? 2. What is the relationship between student conduct professionals’ years of experience <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> satisfaction, burnout, <b>and</b> secondary traumatic stress? 3.

In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of women's suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, <b>compassion,</b> <b>and</b> civic spirit.

5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of <b>compassion</b> <b>and</b> sympathy to emerge.|$|E

40|$|Family {{caregivers}} significantly {{contribute to}} the provision of health care for their family members. This complex care can result in stress {{that may lead to}} both positive and negative consequences for the caregiver. Current literature tends to focus on negative consequences such as caregiver burden. Therefore, <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> satisfaction are proposed as concepts that may better reflect the family caregiving experience. Compassion fatigue is comprised of two components; burnout and secondary traumatic stress. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the concept of <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> satisfaction among family caregivers and to explore the relationship between caregiver burden <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> fatigue to determine which characteristics were predictive for the level of compassion fatigue. Using a cross sectional descriptive survey design with a convenience sample, 168 family caregivers providing care for family members with chronic illness completed a web based survey. The survey included a demographic questionnaire, the Caregiver Burden Interview, the Professional Quality of Life measure and the Brief COPE inventory. Results from this study revealed that the majority of participants reported a high level of caregiver burden, a moderate level of burnout, equal division of low and moderate levels of secondary traumatic stress, and a moderate level of compassion satisfaction. Analysis suggested that caregiver burden <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> fatigue are similar, but distinct concepts and supported the use of <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> satisfaction as caregiving outcomes for family caregivers. Characteristics related to gender, caregiving demands, and caregiver resources resulted in differences found in <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>and</b> <b>compassion</b> satisfaction scores with caregiver burden as the primary predictor that explained a substantial amount of variance in compassion fatigue scores.

The overarching {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if and how quality of working life affects <b>Compassion</b> Fatigue, Burnout, <b>and</b> <b>Compassion</b> Satisfaction among mental health practitioners. Methods Staff working in three Italian Mental Health Departments completed the Professional Quality of Life Scale, measuring <b>Compassion</b> Fatigue, Burnout, <b>and</b> <b>Compassion</b> Satisfaction, <b>and</b> the Quality of Working Life Questionnaire. The latter was used to collect socio-demographics, occupational characteristics and 13 indicators of quality of working life. Multiple regressions controlling for other variables were undertaken to predict <b>Compassion</b> Fatigue, Burnout, <b>and</b> <b>Compassion</b> Satisfaction. Results Four hundred questionnaires were completed. In bivariate analyses, experiencing more ergonomic problems, perceiving risks for the future, a higher impact of work on life, and lower levels of trust and of perceived quality of meetings were associated with poorer outcomes. Multivariate analysis showed that (a) ergonomic problems and impact of work on life predicted higher levels of both <b>Compassion</b> Fatigue <b>and</b> Burnout; (b) impact of life on work was associated with <b>Compassion</b> Fatigue <b>and</b> lower levels of trust and perceiving more risks for the future with Burnout only; (c) perceived quality of meetings, need of training, and perceiving no risks for the future predicted higher levels of Compassion Satisfaction. Conclusions In order to provide adequate mental health services, service providers need to give their employees adequate ergonomic conditions, giving special attention to time pressures. Building trustful relationships with management and within the teams is also crucial. Training and meetings are other important targets for potential improvement. Additionally, insecurity about the future should be addressed as it can affect both Burnout <b>and</b> <b>Compassion</b> Satisfaction.
