40|$|Inorganic arsenic is a known {{environmental}} toxicant and carcinogen {{of global}} public health concern. Arsenic is genotoxic and cytotoxic to human keratinocytes. However, the biological pathways perturbed in keratinocytes by low chronic dose inorganic arsenic {{are not completely}} understood. The objective of the investigation was to discover the mechanism of arsenic <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> epidermal keratinocytes. We hypothesize that a combined strategy of DNA microarray, qRT-PCR and gene function annotation will identify aberrantly expressed genes in HaCaT keratinocyte cell line after chronic treatment with arsenic trioxide. Microarray data analysis identified 14 up-regulated genes and 21 down-regulated genes in response to arsenic trioxide. The expression of 4 up-regulated genes and 1 down-regulated gene were confirmed by qRT-PCR. The up-regulated genes were AKR 1 C 3 (Aldo-Keto Reductase family 1, member C 3), IGFL 1 (Insulin Growth Factor-Like family member 1), IL 1 R 2 (Interleukin 1 Receptor, type 2), and TNFSF 18 (Tumor Necrosis Factor [ligand] SuperFamily, member 18) and down-regulated gene was RGS 2 (Regulator of G-protein Signaling 2). The observed over expression of TNFSF 18 (167 fold) coupled with moderate expression of IGFL 1 (3. 1 fold), IL 1 R 2 (5. 9 fold) and AKR 1 C 3 (9. 2 fold) with a decreased RGS 2 (2. 0 fold) suggests that chronic arsenic exposure could produce sustained levels of TNF with modulation by an IL- 1 analogue resulting in chronic immunologic insult. A concomitant decrease in growth inhibiting gene (RGS 2) and increase in AKR 1 C 3 may contribute to chronic inflammation leading to metaplasia, which may eventually lead to <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>in</b> the skin keratinocytes.

A meta-analysis of these cohort studies found that occupational exposure to TCE was associated with excess incidences of liver cancer, kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma, with the strongest evidence for the first three cancers (Wartenberg et al. 2000). Elevated risks of death from Hodgkin’s disease, multiple myeloma, cervical cancer, and liver cancer also were observed (Wartenberg et al. 2000). Nevertheless, these studies are based on {{a relatively small number of}} exposed workers and were confounded by exposure to other solvents and other risk factors. Findings from other cohort studies, with less accurate assessment of TCE exposures, have more variable results. Exposure to TCE was assessed less accurately in case-control studies; in many studies, TCE exposure was estimated from exposures to solvents in general. These studies typically reported higher cancer rates for tumor sites similar to those observed in the cohort studies. Elevated risks were most consistently observed for kidney cancer, liver cancer, Hodgkin’s disease, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and cervical cancer (Wartenberg et al. 2000).

40|$|Exposure to {{extremely}} low-frequency {{magnetic fields}} (ELF-MF) was evaluated in an International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs as possibly carcinogenic to humans in 2001, based on increased childhood leukemia risk observed in epidemiological studies. We conducted a hazard assessment using available scientific evidence published before March 2015, {{with inclusion of}} new research findings from the Advanced Research on Interaction Mechanisms of electroMagnetic exposures with Organisms for Risk Assessment (ARIMMORA) project. The IARC Monograph evaluation scheme was applied to hazard identification. In ARIMMORA for the first time, a transgenic mouse model was used to mimic the most common childhood leukemia: new pathogenic mechanisms were indicated, but more data are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Although experiments in different animal strains showed exposure-related decreases of CD 8 + T-cells, a role in carcinogenesis must be further established. No direct damage of DNA by exposure was observed. Overall in the literature, there is limited evidence of <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans</b> and inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals, with only weak supporting evidence from mechanistic studies. New exposure data from ARIMMORA confirmed that if the association is nevertheless causal, up to 2 % of childhood leukemias in Europe, as previously estimated, may be attributable to ELF-MF. In summary, ARIMMORA concludes {{that the relationship between}} ELF-MF and childhood leukemia remains consistent with possible <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans.</b> While this scientific uncertainty is dissatisfactory for science and public health, new mechanistic insight from ARIMMORA experiments points to future research that could provide a step-change in future assessments.
