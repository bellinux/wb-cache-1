40|$|<b>Clay</b> <b>coated</b> quartz grains can {{influence}} reservoir quality evolution during sandstone diagenesis. Porosity {{can be reduced}} and fluid flow restricted where grain coats encroach into pore space. Conversely pore-lining grain coats can restrict the growth of pore-filling quartz cement in deeply buried sandstones, and thus can result in unusually high porosity in deeply buried sandstones. Being able to predict the distribution of <b>clay</b> <b>coated</b> sand grains within petroleum reservoirs is thus important to help find good reservoir quality. Here we report a modern analogue study of 12 sediment cores from the Anllóns Estuary, Galicia, NW Spain, collected {{from a range of}} sub-environments, to help develop an understanding of the occurrence and distribution of <b>clay</b> <b>coated</b> grains. The cores were described for grain size, bioturbation and sedimentary structures, and then sub-sampled for electron and light microscopy, laser granulometry, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The Anllóns Estuary is sand-dominated with intertidal sand flats and saltmarsh environments at the margins; there is a shallowing/fining-upwards trend in the estuary-fill succession. Grain coats are present in nearly every sample analysed; they are between 1 μm and 100 μm thick and typically lack internal organisation. The extent of grain coat coverage can exceed 25 % in some samples with coverage highest in the top 20 cm of cores. Samples from muddy intertidal flat and the muddy saltmarsh environments, close to the margins of the estuary, have the highest coat coverage (mean coat coverage of 20. 2 % and 21. 3 %, respectively). The lowest mean coat coverage occurs in the sandy saltmarsh (10. 4 %), beyond the upper tidal limit and sandy intertidal flat environments (8. 4 %), close to the main estuary channel. Mean coat coverage correlates with the concentration of clay fraction. The primary controls on the distribution of fine-grained sediment, and therefore grain coat distribution, are primary sediment transport and deposition processes that concentrate the clay fraction in the sediment towards the margins of the estuary. Bioturbation and clay illuviation/mechanical infiltration are secondary processes that may redistribute fine-grained sediment and produce grain coats. Here we have shown that detrital grain coats are more likely in marginal environments of ancient estuary-fills, which are typically found in the fining-upward part of progradational successions...|$|E

40|$|Adhesive nanocomposites of {{organically}} modified montmorillonite (OM) and polyurethane {{have been}} synthesized and their permeability to oxygen and water vapor has been measured. The gas permeation through the composites was correlated to the volume {{fraction of the}} impermeable inorganic part of the OM. The incorporation of small volume fractions of the platelike nanoparticles in the polymer matrix decreased the gas transmission rate, when the interface between the two heterogeneous phases was properly designed. The oxygen transmission rate decayed asymptotically with increasing aluminosilicate volume fraction and a 30 % reduction was achieved at 3 vol %, when the <b>clay</b> was <b>coated</b> with bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) hydrogenated tallow ammonium or alkylbenzyldimethylammonium ions. In contrast, <b>coating</b> the <b>clay</b> surface with dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium ions leads {{to an increase in}} the gas transmission rate with augmenting inorganic fraction. This was attributed to a probable change in morphology resulting from phase separation at the interface between the apolar pure hydrocarbon <b>clay</b> <b>coating</b> and the relatively polar PU. The water vapor permeation through the PU nanocomposites was more strongly reduced than oxygen and a 50 % reduction was observed at 3 vol % silicate fraction. This was attributed to stronger interactions and hydrogen bonding of the water molecules with the PU matrix as well as to their clustering. Differences in the hydrophobicity of the <b>clay</b> <b>coating</b> influenced the water transmission rate.

40|$|The geomechanical {{behaviour}} of {{a variety}} of soft rocks from the Waitemata Group, Auckland, is characterised, and the influence of microstructure in determining the geomechanics examined. Field geotechnical measurements of joint spacing and Schmidt Hammer rebound are related to geomechanical properties to determine controls on joint development and applicability of field index tests for soft materials. Samples studied are dominantly sandstones, with one conglomerate; all of which have a significant component of swelling clay minerals. Low bulk densities, high porosities and large void ratios are characteristic of the samples. They vary from extremely weak, very low durability rocks to moderately: strong and durable materials. Extremely weak sandstones are highly deformable and undergo plastic deformation when loaded in compression. The stronger samples undergo strain softening and respond elastically to applied stresses prior to brittle failure. High softening factors indicate that compressive and tensile strengths are greatly reduced upon saturation. All the study rocks have high proportions of sand and silt size material (≤ 95 %), and up to 10 % of < 2 μ m proportions; significant gravel size material only occurs in the conglomerate. Volcanic and detrital rock fragments are the dominant constituents in all samples, with abundant quartz, minor calcic plagioclase, and a variety of accessory minerals. The dominant clay is smectite with lesser amounts of illite, kaolinite, and mixed-layer clays. Individual sand and silt grains are dominantly subrounded to subangular quartz, regular bricks of feldspar, and rods of rutile, and are often <b>clay</b> <b>coated.</b> Microaggregates and grains are combined into aggregates and assemblages, and in some cases macroassemblages, to form granular arrangements, which produce a network of interconnecting pores. The fabric of the rocks is characterised by discontinuous matrices. Fabric types range from skeletal to turbostratic, and arrangements range from tightly interlocking grains to loose granular structures. Clay micro aggregates are either flocculated or form welded FF honeycomb arrangements. Strength and durability are not influenced by quantity, size, or type of clasts or minerals present; rather, it is the arrangement of individual components (and associated pore spaces) in the rock fabric which directly determines the geomechanical behaviour. Strong, durable samples have an abundance of clean grain to grain contacts, and few large clay aggregates. Clay microaggregates are arranged in welded FF arrangements, and pore space is restricted to micropores which resist water infiltration. Progressively weaker rocks are characterised by an increase in <b>clay</b> <b>coated</b> grains, clay aggregates, and clay connectors (which form weak links for stress transmission), and interconnecting pores at all levels in the fabric. In the weakest rock macroassemblages of <b>clay</b> <b>coated</b> grains, and open flocculated smectitic aggregates connected by point contacts, produce a network of macropores, allowing easy access of water which flocculates clays into weaker states by reducing bonding and cohesion. Schmidt rebound values in the field do not provide a useful indication of either compressive or tensile strength of these rocks. The rebound values do, however, correlate well with laboratory determined dynamic elasticity values, suggesting that the instrument should be used in the field to predict rock elasticity and not strength. Joint spacing within the rock units is related to elasticity with units capable of storing stress through plastic deformation having reasonably wide, uniformly spaced joints. Units which release stress through brittle fracture have closely spaced, and more complex joint systems...|$|E

The erosion could be initiated by loosening and resuspension of surface sediments resulting from seismic activity generated by strong earthquakes in the Central America subduction zone. The same vibration maintained residual nodules at the seafloor surface.

40|$|The {{presence}} of clay-sized particles and clay minerals in modern sands and ancient sandstones has long presented an interesting problem, because primary depositional processes tend {{to lead to}} physical separation of fine- and coarse-grained materials.

40|$|A {{study of}} clay {{chemistry}} has been approached with three aims: - {{to modify the}} conducting properties by intercalation of tetrathiafulvalene, - to study the electrochemistry of redox-active coordination compounds immobilised on <b>clay</b> <b>coated</b> electrodes, and - to study the role of clays as reagents in inorganic glass forming reactions using mainly solid-state magic-angle-spinning NMR. TTF was intercalated by smectites containing different interlayer and lattice cations. Evidence from ESR and 57 Fe Mossbauer indicated charge-transfer from TTF to structural iron in natural montmorillonite, and to interlayer Cu 2 + in Cu 2 + exchanged laponite. No charge transfer was observed for laponite (Na+ form) itself. Ion exchange of TTF 3 (BF 4) 2 with laponite was found to proceed quantitatively. The intercalated species {{were believed to be}} (TTF) 2 + dimers. Conductivity data showed an order of magnitude increase for the intercalated clays. The mechanism is thought to be ionic rather than CT as Na+ laponite showed a similar enhancement in conductivity. Mechanically robust colloidal clay films were prepared on platinum electrodes. After immersion in solutions containing redox active complexes [Co(bpy) 3] 3 + and [Cr(bpy) 3] 3 +, the films became electroactive when a potential was applied. Cyclic voltammograms obtained for both complexes were found to be of the diffusion controlled type. For [Co(bpy) 3] 3 + immobilised on <b>clay</b> <b>coated</b> electrodes, a one-step oxidation and four-step reduction wave was observed corresponding to a one electron stepwise reversible reduction of Co(III), through Co(II), Co(I), Co(O) to Co(I) oxidation state. For [Cr(bpy) 3] 3 + the electrochemistry was complicated by the presence of additional waves corresponding to the dissociation of [Cr(bpy) 3] 3 + into the diaquo complex. ESR and diffuse reflectance data supported such a mechanism. 29 Si, 27 Al and 23 Na MAS NMR spectroscopy, supported by powder XRD and FTIR, was used to probe the role of clays as reagents in glass forming reactions. 29 Si MAS NMR was found to be a very sensitive technique for identifying the presence and relative abundance of crystalline and non-crystalline phases. In thermal reactions of laponite formation of new mineral phases such as forsterite, akermanite, sillimanite and diopside were detected. The relative abundance of each phase was dependent on thermal history, chemical nature and concentration of the modifier oxide present. In continuing work, the effect of selected oxides on the glass forming reactions of a model feldspar composition was investigated using solid state NMR alone. Addition of network modifying oxides generally produced less negative 29 Si chemical shifts and larger linewidths corresponding to a wider distribution of Si-O-Si bond angles and lengths, and a dominant aluminosilicate phase with a less polymerised structure than the starting material. 29 Si linewidths and 27 Al chemical shifts were respectively correlated with cationic potential and Lewis acidity of the oxide cations. Anomalous Al(4) chemical shifts were thought to be due to precipitation of aluminate phases rather than a breakdown in Lowenstein's aluminium avoidance principle...|$|E
40|$|Phyllosilicate clays and hydrous oxides are {{recognised}} {{as important}} minerals in soils for organic carbon (OC) stabilisation. Most {{studies on the}} influence that hydrous oxides have on OC stabilisation {{have been carried out}} using different soils that contain different amounts of Fe or Al oxides or in experiments where OC stabilisation was measured separately on phyllosilicate clays and oxides. Consequently, the interactive effect of different types of phyllosilicate clays and hydrous oxides on OC stabilisation remains poorly understood. In this work, a series of experiments was carried out to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} effect of different phyllosilicate clays on OC stabilisation in the presence and absence of different hydrous oxides. In the first set of experiments, stabilisation of plant-derived OC by three different phyllosilicate clays (kaolinite, illite, smectite) with and without goethite coating and illitic <b>clay</b> <b>coated</b> with different oxides (goethite, haematite, ferrihydrite, imogolite) was quantified by measuring mineralisation of added OC to these clays or clay-oxide associations in a model system consisting of sand mixed with clay. The amount of OC added to mineral was the same for all treatments (5 mg C g⁻¹ sand-clay mixture). These conditions correspond to a relatively high OC loading, such as may be experienced in top soils in highly productive systems (i. e. lots of vegetation). Experiments were carried out under moist soil conditions of ∼ 70 % water-filled pore space; under these conditions OC mineralisation should not be limited by availability of water or oxygen. For uncoated clays, OC stabilisation increased in order kaolinite < illite < smectite. It was found that the stabilisation of OC for kaolinite increased with goethite coating; this effect was not observed for illite- and smectite-oxide associations. For illite coated with different oxides, only ferrihydrite increased OC stabilisation over the illitic clay alone. Increasing OC stabilisation for these oxide-coated clays was related closely with increasing specific surface area (SSA). These results demonstrate that there is a clear effect of oxide coating on OC stabilisation that varies with the mineralogy of phyllosilicate clays and type of hydrous oxides and that under the conditions of this set of experiments, mineral surface area is the dominant factor. In these experiments the progress of mineralisation over time was closely monitored. Fitting cumulative C mineralisation data to a two-pool C mineralisation model revealed that where the OC stabilisation increased in the presence of oxide-hydroxides, there were reductions in the size of both slowly and rapidly mineralisable C pools. This demonstrates that OC stabilisation was brought about by an increase in the size of undecomposable pool rather than changes in the rates of decomposition of either pool. It has been suggested that the interactive effect of phyllosilicate clays and oxides on OC stabilisation is controlled by the capacity of clay-oxide associations to sorb dissolved OC. Therefore, a second set of experiments was carried out to assess the effect clay-oxide associations on the sorption of plant derived-OC. The sorption capacity of clays increased in the order kaolinite < illite < smectite on a mass basis or illite < smectite < kaolinite on a surface area basis. Goethite coating on kaolinite increased the sorption of dissolved OC while the sorption capacity of illitic and smectitic clays was not influenced by goethite coating. For illitic <b>clay</b> <b>coated</b> with three different hydrous iron oxides (goethite, haematite, ferrihydrite), an increase in the sorption capacity of dissolved OC was observed only for illite-ferrihydrite associations. Increases in the sorption capacity of dissolved OC were most evident for clay-oxide associations involving either a low-charge clay or high surface area oxide. Desorption experiments showed that only 6 - 14 % of the initially sorbed OC by mineral associations was released by a single extraction step. Coating phyllosilicate clays with hydrous iron oxides reduced desorption of clays, but the effect was most evident for the kaolinitegoethite and illite-ferrihydrite associations. It is likely that the net charge of oxidecoated clays, which is influenced by the balance between the negative charge of phyllosilicate clays and the positive charge of hydrous iron oxides, was crucial for performance of clay-oxide associations in the sorption and desorption of dissolved OC. These experiments showed that differences in OC stabilisation observed in the first set of experiments were closely related to the sorption capacity of the clays and oxidecoated clays. However, these experiments also showed that the strength of sorption of OC to the minerals, as reflected in the amount of DOC that could be desorbed in a single extraction, varied in a different order among the mineral assemblages and appeared to be related to surface charge rather than specific surface area. This suggests that the degree of OC stabilisation afforded by the assemblages may be quite different at low OC loadings than at high OC loadings. A third set of experiments was conducted to investigate OC stabilisation at low OC loadings, such as may be experienced in many sub-soils. In these experiments, OC was pre-sorbed onto clays and oxide-coated clays under batch sorption conditions of equal initial solution OC concentration. This resulted in systems with different OC loading on a mass basis, but loadings that were approximately proportional to the sorption capacity of mineral assemblages. In these experiments, incubations were performed “wet”, with 0. 5 – 1. g solid in 20 mL nutrient solution; treatments were kept oxic though intermittent shaking. Goethite coating increased the stability of OC sorbed to kaolinite and smectite against microbial decomposition, while the stability of OC sorbed to illite did not change with goethite coating. Among the three hydrous iron oxides tested, only ferrihydrite coating increased the stability of illite-associated OC against microbial degradation. These result showed that under these conditions of low OC loading, the biological stability of OC sorbed to clay-oxide associations again varied with the mineralogy of phyllosilicate clays and the different hydrous iron oxides. In this case, however, the bioavailability of mineral-associated OC was significantly correlated with the reversibility of OC sorption and with the affinity of dissolved OC for clay-oxide associations, as measured in the batch sorption experiments of the second set of experiments on these systems. This suggests the degree of OC stabilisation at low OC loading is controlled by the strength of mineral-organo associations rather the surface area of the minerals. Under conditions of low OC availability, microbial activity can be limited by energy availability to microorganisms. Under such conditions, the addition of a small amount of readily available organic matter can increase the decomposition of the pre-existing but less available OC. This is known as a priming effect. In a fourth set of experiments, the stability of OC sorbed onto minerals against microbial degradation was determined in the presence of glucose at C levels equivalent to 1 % and 10 % of sorbed OC over a 120 -day incubation. It was found that the total amount of C mineralised from clay−OC associations for all phyllosilicate clays increased with glucose addition. However, the net amount of C mineralised from clay−associated OC with glucose, which was determined by subtracting the amount of CO₂ produced in the corresponding glucoseonly treatment, was not significantly different from that mineralised from clay−associated OC without glucose addition. This result suggests the absence of a priming effect of easily decomposable C source on the mineralisation of OC sorbed to phyllosilicate clays. Therefore, it can be concluded that mechanisms other than energy availability control the stability of OC sorbed to phyllosilicate clays against microbial decomposition. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The paper {{recycling}} process generates {{a source of}} waste as the paper collected is refined to a quality required for recycled paper manufacturing. These waste materials contain a high paper fibre content with various types and proportions of contaminants, and as such have limited other economic uses. The basis of this project is to investigate a method to re-use this waste, through {{the addition of a}} polymer, to produce a filled polymer composite. To satisfy this goal this project has focused on the study of the material properties of a discrete range of highly-filled polymer composites from two different waste-paper filler types, Recycled Paper Waste (RPW) and Liquid Paperboard (LPB). The sources were primarily identified for the study based on their abundance, availability and low-cost as a waste product. Stretch-Wrap (SR) as a post-consumer product was chosen as the polymer matrix. The composites were studied under the condition of maximised fractional utilisation of the waste paper filler, balanced against the deleterious affects on some of the composite material properties, and allowing for the potential future large scale production. Investigation of the base raw materials identified particular aspects which drew attention to the composites materials in the study as being novel. The RPW is a diverse range of pre-treated wood fibres {{with a high level of}} non-paper contaminants and the LPB is a composite of high-grade <b>clay</b> <b>coated</b> paper, polymer and Aluminium layers. The SR matrix presents as a unique source as is a mixture of varied blends of barrier coating plastics and non-polymer inclusions, as well as adhesion promoting agents. The composites were produced utilising a pre-processing stage, compounded by twin-screw extrusion then moulded to the required form. The raw RPW and LPB fillers were both observed to take the form of short non-aligned fibres, evenly dispersed fibres in the matrix. Across the project a comprehensive range of material properties were studied to characterise the material behaviour, grouped to mechanical (short-term), thermal and melt rheological, optimisation of injection moulding processing and performance (long-term) properties, including creep and water absorption. The fillers were shown to provide reinforcement to the compliant matrix, resulting in the composites exhibiting significant increases in modulus values over the unfilled matrix as a function of the filler volume fraction. A constitutive model was developed to model the cantilever modulus as a function of the frequency of excitation and temperature. Reinforcement from the filler was noted to be more efficient in loading in flexure and cantilever. Young's modulus was shown to be well modelled by the modified Einstein model, with the flexural and cantilever modulus shown to be modelled using a Nielson-Tsai-Halpin model, which exhibited more efficient reinforcement from the filler. Modulus properties were shown to fit to mid-range Hashin-Shtrikman boundary model, using the modulus value for the filler as a typical value for paper sheets. Material maximum stress in tension, elongation at maximum stress and impact properties were observed to be limited to the strength and ductility of the unfilled matrix, and were observed to be subject to the degrading effect of the filler as a source of stress concentrations in the material. Yield stress and strength in flexure were both observed to increase with filler volume fraction, commented to be the result of being a function of both the positive effect of reinforcement in stiffness and degrading effect of the filler as a source of stress concentrations, able to be well modelled by the Piggott and Liedner model. Using thermo-gravimetric analysis the thermal limits of the filler under different heating rates was defined, with upper limits identified to be in the order of 240 0;C for both fillers, higher for the matrix. A particular noted behaviour, which would impact significantly on the processing of the composite, was identification of the water holding characteristics of the filler phase, which was observed to hold absorbed moisture up to 100 0;C, indicating the ability of the wood fibre to bind to water within the chemical structure. The melt rheological properties of the composite materials were measured and modelled as a function of filler volume fraction, temperature and frequency of excitation, with a constitutive model presented that is able to be applied to model the composite properties as a function of each of the respective variables. The composites were shown to exhibit the melt rheological behaviour of the unfilled polymer matrix, altered by the flow retardation effects of the filler. As a function of frequency of excitation, the composites were observed to display a power-law relation, with a decreasing power-law exponent and increasing consistency index with filler content, which was able to be adequately modelled using an Ostwald-De Waele power-law model. The viscosity of the composites was observed to be less thermally sensitive than the unfilled matrix. As a function of filler volume fraction, the viscosity of the composites was shown to increase significantly, at orders of magnitudes greater than the unfilled matrix, representing a major finding of the study. The effect of the filler content on composite viscosity was shown to fit to an exponential model. Optimisation of the injection moulding processing conditions was achieved using a second-order rotatable full central composite design method with the operating parameters the barrel temperature, injection pressure and dwell time. Factors noted to be a function of the processing parameters were the composite polymer-rich skin thickness, and to a lesser extent the packing density, viscosity of the melt and volatile emissions. The filler was observed to improve the creep resistance of the unfilled matrix, however providing reinforcement to a different characteristic behaviour to the modulus results, showing far less sensitivity to the filler volume fraction. The different behaviour in creep in comparison to the short-term modulus was believed to be due to the long loading time in creep allowing significantly more re-arrangement of the polymer chains, affecting the flow retardation effect of the fillers. The creep properties of the composites were successfully modelled using a two-element discrete relaxation spectrum model, with two-distinctive relaxation times, common to the unfilled polymer and the composites, and partial relaxation modulus values showing similar linear relation to the filler volume fraction observed in the short-term mechanical modulus results. A useful predictive model observed to fit to the experimental data was the elastic filler creep model. The water absorptive properties of the composites were experimentally measured and modelled as a function of temperature and surface preparation. The water absorbed as a function of the filler volume fraction at saturation was observed to be linearly dependent with an offset value above the water resistant matrix, noted to be different between the filler types. The differences between the fillers was believed to be due to differences in the compounded structure as the characteristic filler absorptive properties were measured to be equivalent. Saturation water absorption was shown to be independent of temperature. The rate of water absorption was modelled using a single diffusion rate Shen-Springer model, which showed good fit to the experimental results beyond the initial absorption. The effect on the mechanical properties of water absorption at saturation was shown to be a proportional reduction in both stiffness and strength, noted to have a proportionately greater effect on the stiffness properties, commented to be a function of the effect of the softening of the filler phase...|$|E

40|$|Results are {{reported}} for an acidic water flow-through experiment {{conducted in a}} fractured argillaceous limestone sample (73 % carbonates). The change in fracture geometry and related parameters is reported for six data sets obtained from synchrotron X-ray microtomography experiments. High-resolution three-dimensional images of the sample allowed quantification {{of the changes in}} fracture morphology at a spatial resolution of 6;μm. Mineral mass loss and permeability changes in the sample were also determined. Several physico-chemical phenomena were identified during the experiment. Initial smooth fracture surfaces evolved rapidly toward rough surfaces with uneven clay coverage due to the preferential dissolution of carbonate minerals compared to clay minerals whose dissolution rate is about 106 slower. A microporous <b>clay</b> <b>coating</b> progressively developed at the fluid-rock interface during heterogeneous dissolution of the fracture, while the global dissolution rate of the fracture walls exponentially decreased. The increase in surface roughness and the presumed reorganization of clays caused a progressive reduction in permeability. During the last flow-through stage, a large decrease in sample permeability was attributed to the large removal of clay particles; this process was responsible for a dramatic collapse of the fracture walls near the sample inlet and {{led to the development of}} preferential flow pathways. The development of the <b>clay</b> <b>coating</b> also acted as a barrier to flow and mass transfer between calcite grains and bulk solution and affected transport processes within the fractur...|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{inserting}} a special sheet {{in between the}} original and the intended copy, carbonless copy paper has micro-encapsulated dye or ink {{on the back side}} of the top sheet, and a <b>clay</b> <b>coating</b> on the front side of the bottom sheet. When pressure is applied (from writing or impact printing), the dye capsules rupture and react with the clay to form a permanent mark duplicating the markings made to the top sheet. Intermediary sheets, with clay on the front and dye capsules on the back, can be used to create multiple copies; this may be referred to as multipart stationery.|$|R
40|$|Investigation of paleosols plays a great role in paleoecological and paleoclimatological studies. They {{are also}} {{important}} in soil survey and planning, as they exhibit characteristics different from younger soils. Paleosols are those soils which formed under conditions different from present ones, and are either buried within sedimentary sequences or those which lie on persisting surfaces. Although such soils are widespread in central Iran and Zagros Zone, {{they have not been}} studied adequately. Paleosols are identified by different parameters such as morphological, physical, chemical, mineralogical, and micromorphological characteristics. In this study, morphological, physical, and chemical properties of three paleosols from Isfahan and Chaharmahal & Bakhtiary provinces were investigated. The profiles were on different landforms including alluvial fan, dissected old plain, and old lagoonal deposits. Soil profile in Segzi site, on old lagoonal deposits, had a very dark and thick layer at a depth of 45 - 60 cm containing some macrofossil shells. This shows that this area was covered by brackish water during the early Holocene. In Sepahanshahr profile, presence of strong <b>clay</b> <b>coating</b> and high concentrations of CaCO 3 indicates a wetter environment in the past than the present conditions with a precipitation of only 100 mm. In Emam-Gheis profile, a buried paleosol was identified with strong <b>clay</b> <b>coating</b> and free CaCO 3 horizons that shows more humid conditions. Evidences obtained from the three paleosols studied indicate that effective moisture in central Iran and Zagros regions during Late Pleistocene had been higher than its present levels...|$|R

40|$|Modified fillers {{consisting}} of kaolin particles encapsulated by starch {{have recently been}} demonstrated in mill trials to achieve significant filler loading levels without accompanying strength losses. In this work, laboratory experiments were conducted to explore the potential advantages of using starch-treated pigment for strength increases by application of surface coating. It is found that a platy <b>clay</b> <b>coating</b> will produce a higher increase in strength per unit weight of application compared to a fine clay, and more-so if the clay is encapsulated in starch. Starch encapsulation of clay produces a greater increase in strength than an equivalent weight proportion addition of starch to a kaolin formulation blend. The observations and measurements of changes in various physical properties of the coated samples are explained by a proportionate loss of void volume in the coating from the encapsulation process and the increase of stress transfer through introduction of higher platelet aspect ratio...|$|R
50|$|The 2 great {{groups of}} Luvisolic soils are {{distinguished}} {{mainly on the}} basis of soil temperature. Gray Brown Luvisols have a dark Ah horizon in which organic matter has been mixed with the mineral material (commonly by earthworm activity), a brown, often platy eluvial horizon (Ae) and an illuvial horizon (Bt) in which blocky structure is common. Their mean annual soil temperature is 8 °C or higher. The major area of Gray Brown Luvisols is found {{in the southern part of}} the Great Lakes-St Lawrence Lowlands. Gray Luvisols have eluvial and illuvial horizons and may have an Ah horizon if the mean annual soil temperature is below 8 °C.
