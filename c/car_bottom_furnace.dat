40|$|The first {{commercial}} bottom blown oxygen copper smelting furnace has been installed and operated at Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals (China) for 4 years. This new copper smelting technology shows {{a number of}} advantages including high productivity, low slag rate, high copper recovery and energy sufficiency. These advantages are with the flow dynamics of the <b>bottom</b> blown <b>furnace.</b> This paper reports an investigation into a 1 : 12 <b>bottom</b> blown <b>furnace</b> model set up at the University of Queensland to examine the novel features of the original furnace. In this paper, the mixing time in the <b>bottom</b> blown <b>furnace</b> model was investigated.

The preliminary correlations among mixing time, stirring energy, gas flow rate, and bath depth have been obtained for the <b>bottom</b> blown <b>furnace.</b> It was found that mixing time decreases with increasing gas flow rate and bath depth.

5000|$|The {{process begins}} with a {{downdraft}} sintering operation. The sinter, which {{is a mixture of}} roaster calcine and EAF calcine, is loaded onto a gate type conveyor and then combustions gases are pumped through the sinter. The carbon in the combustion gases react with some the impurities, such as lead, cadmium, and halides. These impurities are driven off into filtration bags. The sinter after this process, called product sinter, usually has a composition of 48% zinc, 8% iron, 5% aluminium, 4% silicon, 2.5% calcium, and smaller quantities of magnesium, lead, and other metals. The sinter product is then charged with coke into an electric retort furnace. A pair of graphite electrodes from the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>furnace</b> produce current flow through the mixture.

50|$|The process starts by {{charging}} solid sinter and heated coke {{into the top}} of the blast furnace.

Slag and lead collect at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>furnace</b> and are tapped off regularly. The zinc is scrubbed from the vapour in the condenser via liquid lead.
