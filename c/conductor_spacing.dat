40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the factors that enhance conductive anodic filament (CAF) formation in printed wiring boards. The variables studied were (1) flux formulation, (2) <b>conductor</b> <b>spacing,</b> (3) operating voltage, and (4) temperature. A Weibull distribution of failure times due to CAF was observed. A novel test circuit was designed and implemented that allowed the mean time to failure to be determined for boards processed with three different fluxes, at 0. 5 mm and 0. 75 mm conductor spacings and at 150 V and 200 V. The boards were aged at 85 %RH and a temperature of 75 °C, 85 °C or 95 °C. It was found that the flux formulation affected the rate of CAF formation. A modified linear aliphatic polyether flux with a chloride activator had a significantly different activation energy than control printed wiring boards or those boards processed with a poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol flux or a poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol flux with a bromide activator. The addition of bromine to a poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol flux decreased the rate of CAF formation as compared to poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol without a halide activator. The inter-relation between voltage and <b>conductor</b> <b>spacing</b> was quantified as a L 4 /V 2 relationship for the plated through hole test pattern used in this study. 325 V/mm was found to be a critical voltage gradient for the formation of CAF. The maximum temperature of the reflow profile also greatly enhances CAF formation and decreases the mean time to failure. Microscopic analysis showed distinct differences in CAF morphology between the various processed boards. Control boards had small halo-like CAF formations around a separated fiber / epoxy interface. CAF that formed on boards processed with poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol or poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol with a bromine activator had a stratified appearance that penetrated well into the epoxy. Boards that were processed with the modified linear aliphatic polyether with chlorine activator had a striated morphology that also penetrated into the epoxy. All CAFs were consistently copper and chlorine containing despite the use of a bromine containing flux. Electron diffraction revealed that a CAF observed in this study was synthetic atacamite.

40|$|Tin {{whiskers}} are conductive crystal growths {{that form}} unpredictively from tin and tin alloy surfaces. The growth of tin whiskers presents a reliability concern in electronic equipment {{due to their}} potential to create electrical shorts and metal vapor arcs. Concern with tin whiskers is increasing due to the ever tightening <b>conductor</b> <b>spacing</b> in smaller electronic products and {{the increased use of}} pure tin and lead-free tin alloys. While tin whiskers present a failure risk for electronics, a tin whisker mechanical bridging between two differently electrically biased conductors doesn't guaranteed electrical shorts due to surface films on tin whisker and conductors. The voltage must exceed a threshold level in order to produce the current flow through the tin whisker. However, the influence of contact force and presence of surface contaminations on breakdown voltage of tin whiskers has not been adequately investigated. Furthermore, whisker-induced electrical shorts can initiate destructive metal vapor arcs. The potential for metal vapor arc formation is affected by several factors, including whisker geometry, bias voltage and pressure. Previous studies demonstrated metal vapor arc formation using gold- and tin-wires; however, material and geometry differences between these test articles and actual tin whiskers have not been examined. Further, a practical guide for assessing the potential for tin whisker-induced metal vapor arc formation has not been provided. This dissertation provides characteristics and assessment of tin whisker-induced electrical shorts and metal vapor arcs. The breakdown voltage of tin whisker was measured using gold- and tin-coated probes to characterize the influence of two different contact materials on breakdown voltage. As a part of this effort, the effect of contact force on breakdown voltage and its current-voltage characteristics related with the failure mode and the possibility of electrical shorting by tin whiskers were also investigated. With regards to tin whisker-induced metal vapor arc formation, the effect of whisker geometry, bias voltage and pressure was investigated. Based on the experimental evidence, a metric defined as a function of bias voltage and resistance was proposed and the logistic regression model that can assess the likelihood of tin whisker-induced metal vapor arc formation was developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} system {{plays a key}} role in power system as it provides energy to the consumers safely, reliably, and economically. However, due to high R/X ratio, and low operating voltages, most of the losses occur in the {{distribution system}}. Moreover, distribution systems are generally unbalanced due to unequal single phase loads at the three phases of the system, and also additional unbalancing is introduced due to non-equilateral <b>conductor</b> <b>spacing.</b> This, causes the voltage, the current, and the power unbalance in the system. Further, the total neutral current of the system increases causing unwanted tripping of the relay. Hence, the service quality and the reliability of the distribution system reduces. Therefore, a suitable phase balancing strategy is required to mitigate the phase unbalancing in the unbalanced distribution systems. Also, apart from reducing the phase unbalancing in the unbalanced distribution systems, a suitable strategy is required to minimize the system power loss. In this regard, it is necessary for the distribution engineers to plan the unbalanced distribution systems in order to reduce the losses, voltage unbalances, and neutral current of the system for safe and reliable operation. Most of the approaches for the planning of the unbalanced distribution systems are based upon metaheuristic algorithms. Moreover, the recent research has focused only on either phase balancing or simultaneous phase balancing and conductor sizing optimization in unbalanced distribution systems using metaheuristic algorithms. However no work has been carried out to study the impact of the simultaneous optimization of the phase balancing, the conductor sizing, the capacitor location and sizing, the DG location and sizing, DSTATCOM location, and rating on system power loss, voltage unbalance, etc. utilizing these algorithms. As the metaheuristic algorithms are random in nature, the convergence is not guaranteed in a single simulation run. Hence, it is necessary to perform a statistical comparison among them in order to understand their relative merits and demerits for multiple simulation runs. In this thesis, the impact of the simultaneous optimization of the phase balancing and the conductor sizing on the planning problems/objective functions of the unbalanced distribution system such as; the power loss, the voltage unbalance, the total neutral current, and the complex power unbalance studied using various metaheuristic algorithms such as the DE, the CSA, the PSO, and the GA. In the first step, these objective functions are optimized separately; then they are aggregated with weights into a multi-objective optimization problem. Further, a performance comparison in terms of the mean value of the objective functions and standard deviation (SD) carried out. The reactive power compensating devices, such as the Capacitor, and the DSTATCOM has been integrated into the planning problem for the power loss minimization, the voltage profile improvement, and the voltage unbalance mitigation of the unbalanced distribution systems. Moreover, a three phase unbalanced modelling of the DSTATCOM has been developed. In this thesis, the effect of the simultaneous optimization of the phase balancing, the conductor sizing, the capacitor sizing, and the simultaneous optimization of the phase balancing, the conductor sizing, and the DSTATCOM sizing on the planning problem investigated. Both, single and multi-objective optimization approach are used in order to solve this problem. Also, statistical performance among the metaheuristic algorithms such as; the DE, the CSA, the PSO, and the GA in terms of the mean value of the objective function and SD carried out. Further, the renewable sources such as the DG and a combined DG and DSTATCOM has been incorporated into the unbalanced system in order to study their impact on various planning problems...|$|E
