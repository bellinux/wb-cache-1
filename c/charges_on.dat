Following this action by the attorney general, both Croitoru and Andre Gravelle announced plans to file lawsuits against people involved with the prosecution. Gravelle is suing for $25 million, and Croitoru is seeking $15 million for wrongful imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Hamilton Police Services was ordered to pay Gravelle $10,000 for court costs. In June 2006, Croitoru also pleaded guilty to the charges of extortion and violating the terms of his bail. As a result, he was forced to forfeit $10,000 of the bail money.|$|E
50|$|The charged object C is touched to {{the inside}} of the container. The charge {{detector}} reading does not change. However, if the object is now withdrawn from the container, the reading stays the same, indicating that the container now has a net charge. If the object is then tested with the charge detector, it is found to be completely uncharged, and the inside of the container is also found to be uncharged. This indicates that all the <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> C has been transferred to the container, and has exactly neutralized the opposite <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the inside surface of the container, leaving only the <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the outside. So the <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the inside of the container was exactly equal to the <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> C.|$|R

5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive <b>charges</b> <b>on</b> the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres.

In 1990, Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of conspiracy, lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and altering and destroying documents pertinent to the investigation. His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds. Arthur L. Liman served as chief counsel for the Senate during the Iran–Contra Scandal.|$|E

50|$|Any small <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> {{either of}} the two discs suffices to begin the {{charging}} process. Suppose, therefore, that the back disc has a small, net electrostatic charge. For concreteness, assume this charge is positive (red) and that the back disc (A lower chain) rotates counter-clockwise (right to left). As the charged sector (moving red square) rotates to the position of the brush (Y down arrow tip) next to front disc (B upper chain near center), it induces a polarization of <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the conducting shaft (Y-Y1 upper horizontal black line) holding the brush, attracting negative (green) charge to the near side (Y upper square becoming green), so that positive (red) <b>charge</b> accumulates <b>on</b> the far side (across the disc, 180 degrees away) (Y1 upper square becoming red). The shaft's polarized charges attach to the nearest sectors on disc B, resulting in negative <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> B Y closer to the original positive <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> A, and positive <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the opposite side of B Y1. After an additional 45° rotation, the positive (red) <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> A (lower chain) is repelled by a positive (red) charge approaching (Z near lower chain middle) a positive (red) <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> B (Z upper chain). The first collection comb (Z arrow-tipped lines to triangles) encountered allows both positive (red) charges to leave the sectors neutral (squares becoming black), and accumulate in the Leyden jar anode (red triangle) attracted to the Leyden jar cathode (green triangle). The charge completes the cycle across the discs when a spark (yellow zigzag) discharges the Leyden jar (red and green triangles).|$|R
