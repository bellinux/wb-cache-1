40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} a concepts, guidelines, a toolset {{and experiences}} with defining and implementing on-line visual displays of software development progress, <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> <b>Control</b> <b>panels</b> group sets of measurement visualizations providing a multi-dimensional, integrated view of development status. <b>Control</b> <b>panels</b> are developed at various organizational levels, serving the information needs of different stakeholders. Navigation between different <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> enables users to drill down to view more detailed information on, e. g., a particular project {{or on the}} progress of a particular development activity. In the constructive part of the work, I describe concepts, and a toolset {{that can be used for}} defining and implementing <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> In addition, I provide guidelines for grouping measures into <b>control</b> <b>panels,</b> and discuss how measurement programs can be partitioned into <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> The toolset, built as a "proof-of-concept" consists of a central measurement database, a visualization client, and a set of data importers that transfer data from external corporate repositories into the measurement database. The empirical part discusses our efforts to define and implement <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> in four high-technology companies in Finland. Framed in the context of "constructive action research", the cases are first described individually, according to the main steps of the action research cycle, then compared in a cross-case analysis. Our results—we succeeded in implementing <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> in only one of four organizations—indicate that the development of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> requires a substantial investment and commitment by the organization, but that it can be feasible even in small organizations. The main obstacles hindering the implementation were organizational and human in nature, and more related to measurement program implementation in general than to tool support per se. Interestingly, the organizations did not consider measurement definition, i. e., the selection of "metrics" to be problematic. Success factors identified included management commitment, dedicated measurement personnel, and organizational change management. While limited, our experiences with the use of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> show that they were felt to be more valuable by management than by the collocated project personnel. We thus hypothesise that the usefulness of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> increases with project size and geographical distance. In the future it would be interesting to develop <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> for distributed software development projects, in which informal status communication is more difficult. reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Brian and Stewie {{manage to}} sneak in {{backstage}} at the concert, where Miley asks why they're here. Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E
5|$|Each of Hollywood Dream's 5 trains carry 36 {{riders in}} nine coaches, each having {{a row of}} four seats.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the earthquake, {{multiple}} phone lines were down, and scattered power outages affected about 54,000 households. Moreover, at least 70 underground 11,000 volt cables sustained some degree of damage, contributing to the outages. The shaking ruptured local water mains, resulting in widespread flooding that affected several streets. Furthermore, officials ordered the closure of bridges in the area as a precautionary measure; one bridge was reported to have succumbed to the strong ground motions. Days after its occurrence, a small electrical fire ignited in a <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> at Christchurch Hospital due to dislodged wiring as a result of ongoing aftershocks.|$|E

The <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> shows planes crucial data, {{including}} speed, altitude, thrust, fuel, roll/pitch indicators and a compass. The panel {{also features a}} radar that provided an overview of important nearby objects. An onboard screen displays various flight information and warning messages, and features a speech synthesizer that occasionally announces dangers, such as approaching enemies or missile attacks. Finally, a small rear-view camera allows the player to observe enemies and missiles on their tail. The game also features a two player mode, where one player flies the plane and the other aims and fires the guns.|$|E
5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E

5|$|Bohra {{visits the}} site to {{retrieve}} Chitti, which has now reassembled itself, albeit in a damaged state. Bohra embeds a red chip inside Chitti while reconstructing it, converting it into a ruthless killer. It then gatecrashes Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding, kidnaps Sana, creates replicas of itself and kills Bohra. Using its robot army, Chitti occupies AIRD and causes mayhem in the city. After informing Sana that it has acquired the human ability to reproduce, Chitti wishes to marry her so that a machine and a human being can {{give birth to a}} preprogrammed child, but Sana refuses. It eventually finds Vaseegaran, who entered AIRD to stop it, and nearly kills him before the police appear. The ensuing battle between Chitti's robot army and the police personnel leads to many casualties and much property destruction. Vaseegaran eventually captures Chitti using a magnetic wall and accesses its internal <b>control</b> <b>panel,</b> whereby he instructs all the other robots to self-destruct. He removes Chitti's red chip, calming it.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the <b>control</b> <b>panel,</b> and commented that it was a reminder that the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E

5|$|Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine {{successfully}} {{installed the}} beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, {{depending on the}} operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows <b>Control</b> <b>Panel.</b> Some full scans took {{more than an hour}} on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.|$|E
5|$|Pei {{finally saw}} his {{architecture}} {{come to life}} in 1949, when he designed a two-story corporate building for Gulf Oil in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained {{as part of an}} apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior curtain wall brought praise from the journal Architectural Forum. Pei's designs echoed the work of Mies van der Rohe in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah in 1952. Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including Henry N. Cobb and Ulrich Franzen. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with teak walls and a glass clerestory. They also installed a <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{runs into}} {{the wreck of the}} Oberon and Leo runs after him, {{followed}} by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at {{what appears to be the}} Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.|$|E
