My results indicate that after controlling for audit committee <b>composition,</b> board <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> CEO duality are related to various measures of corporate reporting transparency. I find that greater insider participation on the board (regardless of level of financial expertise) is related to less transparent disclosures, especially those related to board and management structure and processes.

Finally, having different people serve as CEO <b>and</b> <b>chairman</b> of the board is not related to greater corporate reporting transparency.
