40|$|The Offset <b>Compound</b> <b>Gear</b> Drive is an in-line, discrete, {{two-speed}} device {{utilizing a}} special offset <b>compound</b> <b>gear</b> that has both an internal tooth configuration on the input end and external tooth configuration on the output end, thus {{allowing it to}} mesh in series, simultaneously, with both a smaller external tooth input gear and a larger internal tooth output gear. This unique geometry and offset axis permits the <b>compound</b> <b>gear</b> to mesh with the smaller diameter input gear and the larger diameter output gear, {{both of which are}} on the same central, or primary, centerline. This configuration results in a compact in-line reduction gear set consisting of fewer gears and bearings than a conventional planetary gear train. Switching between the two output ratios is accomplished through a main control clutch and sprag. Power flow to the above is transmitted through concentric power paths. Low-speed operation is accomplished in two meshes. For the purpose of illustrating the low-speed output operation, the following example pitch diameters are given. A 5. 0 pitch diameter (PD) input gear to 7. 50 PD (internal tooth) intermediate gear (0. 667 reduction mesh), and a 7. 50 PD (external tooth) intermediate gear to a 10. 00 PD output gear (0. 750 reduction mesh). Note that it is not required that the intermediate gears on the offset axis be of the same diameter. For this example, the resultant low-speed ratio is 2 : 1 (output speed = 0. 500; product of stage one 0. 667 reduction and stage two 0. 750 stage reduction). The design is not restricted to the example pitch diameters, or output ratio. From the output gear, power is transmitted through a hollow drive shaft, which, in turn, drives a sprag during which time the main clutch is disengaged...|$|E

Due to the reason of power circulation, these two kinds of planetary gear trains with high reduction ratios have low meshing efficiencies. The 2 K type planetary gear reducer only contain two ring gears and one carrier, hence it {{will not have the}} problem of power circulation and will have better meshing efficiency than 3 K type and 2 K- 2 H type planetary gear reducers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to estimate the contact pattern for gear drives. The proposed method {{is based on the}} geometric properties of the generated surfaces of the pinion and the gear and it neglects the mechanical characteristics of the mating members. The key feature of the method is the superimposition of a virtual marking compound over the gear surface that mimics the industrial practice of contact pattern inspection. For each meshing condition the instantaneous contact area is estimated as the intersection of the pinion surface with the marking <b>compound</b> <b>gear</b> surface. Finally, the contact pattern is estimated by the convex envelope of all the instantaneous contact areas in the zr-plane. The marking compound shape is identified through an optimization process to match a target contact pattern obtained, e. g. with an accurate loaded tooth contact analysis tool. The proposed method has been tested with a dedicated FEM software package capable of producing a very accurate contact pattern estimation of the contact pattern under load. Extensive simulations have shown that, once the optimal marking compound shape has been identified, the proposed method computes a reliable contact pattern even for very different surface geometries (e. g. an ease-off on the pinion surface) and assembly errors. The computational cost of the entire procedure is about two orders of magnitude lower than that required to run the full FEM analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{from a new}} algorithm developed for separating the vibration signals from a planetary gear system into separate signals attributable to each planet gear. From the separate signals, time synchronous average signals are produced for each planet gear and for the sun gear meshing with each planet gear. Assessments of the individual planet and sun gears {{can be made from}} these new vibration signals. These new separated signals match very well with noise-free synthetic data with and without characteristics indicative of faults. In a 3 -planet system, distortions planted in synthetic signals are easily distinguished over a wide range of signal-to-noise (S/N) values. In an 8 -planet system, distortions are easily detected for high S/N with degradation at low S/N. Spectra from separated signals from vibration measurements made in flight on the transmissions of OH- 58 C and AH 1 S helicopters are consistent with what would be expected based upon the transmission geometries. In this paper, the term planetary gear system refers to the <b>compound</b> <b>gear</b> systems with planet gears between a center sun gear and an outer ring gear, with the ring gear fixed and not rotating. The individual planet gears are connected through a carrier to the output of the gear system. Both planet/sun and planet/ring meshing produce vibrations.

Variable rotor speed for these vehicles is required for efficient high-speed operation. Two-speed drive system research has been performed to support these advanced rotorcraft applications. Experimental tests were performed on two promising two-speed transmission configurations. The offset <b>compound</b> <b>gear</b> (OCG) transmission and the dual star/idler (DSI) planetary transmission were tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center variable-speed transmission test facility. Both configurations were inline devices with concentric {{input and output shafts}} and designed to provide 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 output speed reduction ratios. Both were designed for 200 hp and 15, 000 rpm input speed and had a dry shift clutch configuration. Shift tests were performed on the transmissions at input speeds of 5, 000, 8, 000, 10, 000, 12, 500, and 15, 000 rpm. Both the OCG and DSI configurations successfully perform speed shifts at full rated 15, 000 rpm input speed. The transient shifting behavior of the OCG and DSI configurations were very similar. The shift clutch had more of an effect on shifting dynamics than the reduction gearing configuration itself since the same shift clutch was used in both configurations. For both OCG and DSI configurations, low-to-high speed shifts were limited in applied torque levels in order to prevent overloads on the transmission due to transient torque spikes. It is believed that the relative lack of appreciable slippage of the dry shifting clutch at operating conditions and pressure profiles tested was a major cause of the transient torque spikes. For the low-to-high speed shifts, the output speed ramp-up time slightly decreased and the peak out torque slightly increased as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased. This was caused by slightly less clutch slippage as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased...|$|E
