If, with proper clarity, the wine does not shed light and does not radiate reflection, we will give only the term yellow". On a <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> white wine can be almost colourless white. When young it usually takes on a pale greenish or pale yellow tint. Its yellow colour darkens with age and maturing becoming gold, then copper, and finally amber. One of the darkest wines in the world is achieved with a white grape: the Pedro Ximenez. The ratio of sugar also affects the colour of the wine making the colour more sustained, depending {{of the nature of the}} grape varietal: a Bordeaux Sauvignon blanc or a Muscadet Melon have a greenish tint while Chardonnay or Traminer grown and vinified under comparable conditions will be yellow.|$|E

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Screening dot is {{the basic}} printing element to reproduce continuous image and to form the printing image. Printing quality depends on the transfer quality of the screening dot. It is important to control the dot gain, sharpening, deformation, doubling and slur. In practice, some specific quality control techniques are used to monitor the screening dot variation. For dot gain control technique, multi-colour scales are often used to investigate dot gain or tone change. This article aims to investigate the secondary colour dot gain in electrostatic digital printing, by considering dot gain of the <b>colour</b> <b>scales,</b> Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Blue, Red and Green. The relations between secondary colour dot gain and primary colour dot gain are studied. Three primary <b>colour</b> <b>scales,</b> Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and three secondary <b>colour</b> <b>scales,</b> Blue, Red and Green, are designed from 2 % to 90 %. The <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> are output by electrostatic colour press and measured by spectrophotometer. The dot gain of the secondary <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> is modelled according to the dot gain rules of the primary <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> using multiple linear regression method. The results illustrate that the dot gain of secondary colour changes with the dot gain o...|$|R

This article is focused on the perception of <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> in relation to character of data. For experiment, a new questionnaire was created on the basis of <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> classification. This questionnaire was posed to the students of years 1 and 2 of high school in order to find out how they perceive the <b>colour</b> <b>scales.</b> The study analyzes three main questions; whether students differentiate qualitative and quantitative datasets and corresponding <b>colour</b> <b>scales,</b> whether they prefer representing of features by context colours or by the colour they like more and whether they are familiar with principles of diverging <b>colour</b> <b>scales.</b> When processing it, the correlation between certain agents and the answers was established...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} scalar and vector data are visualised by suited <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> based on {{perceptive}} and uniform colour models. Using opportune <b>colour</b> <b>scales,</b> <b>colour</b> information is created from the two-dimensional scalar data computed at different time steps. Direction {{and magnitude of}} computed vector data are represented employing circular colour look-up tables (LKT). In a scientific computing environment focused on analysis and interpretation of physical phenomena, the coloured visualisation of data generated by numerical simulations represents a fundamental fashion of knowledge. The colour, in fact, can help the researcher to analyse and interpret information present in computed data in a fast and immediate way. The colour human perception is a complex process, which includes physiological, psychophysical, psychological and physical aspects. A colour model (colour space) is a way adopted to represent and describe a colour using three co-ordinates. We visualise the results obtained by a finite difference method applied to the solution of 2 D shallow water equations for the simulation of water circulation in natural basin: the San Pablo Bay. We show solutions of the two-dimensional shallow water equations (SWEs), that is, solutions of quasi linear hyperbolic partial differential equations, governing the water circulation in a basin with spatial dimensions significantly greater than the water dept...|$|R

50|$|Scales play an {{important}} part in the natural history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable development of vivid or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by concealment and camouflage, mimicry and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings provided by dark <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> would allow sunlight to be absorbed and thus probably {{have a role to play}} in thermoregulation.Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their aposematism (toxicity or inedibility) thus preventing a predator from preying on it. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour patterns help edible Lepidopterans mimic inedible models while in Müllerian mimicry inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by predators.|$|R

A bivariate choropleth map uses color {{to solve a}} problem of representation in four dimensions; two spatial dimensions — longitude and latitude — and two statistical variables. Take the example of mapping population density and average daily maximum temperature simultaneously. Population could be given a <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> of black to green, and temperature from blue to red. Then an area with low population and low temperature would be dark blue, high population and low temperature would be cyan, high population and high temperature would be yellow, while low population and high temperature would be dark red. The eye can quickly see potential relationships between these variables.|$|E
