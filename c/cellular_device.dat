50|$|Base station {{survey data}} {{can be used to}} further narrow the past {{locations}} of a <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> if used in conjunction with historical cell site location information ("HCSLI") obtained from a wireless carrier. HCSLI includes a list of all cell sites and sectors accessed by a <b>cellular</b> <b>device,</b> and the date and time each access was made. Law enforcement will often obtain HCSLI from wireless carriers in order to determine where a particular cell phone was located in the past. Once this information is obtained, law enforcement will use a map of cell site locations to determine the past geographical locations of the <b>cellular</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The FBI {{has claimed}} that when used to identify, locate, or track a <b>cellular</b> <b>device,</b> the StingRay does not collect {{communications}} content or forward {{it to the}} service provider. [...] Instead, the device causes a disruption in service. Under this scenario, any attempt by the <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> user to place a call or access data services will fail while the StingRay is conducting its surveillance.|$|E
5000|$|In passive mode, the StingRay {{operates}} {{either as}} a digital analyzer, which receives and analyzes signals being transmitted by <b>cellular</b> <b>devices</b> and/or wireless carrier cell sites or as a radio jamming device, which transmits signals that block communications between <b>cellular</b> <b>devices</b> and wireless carrier cell sites. By [...] "passive mode," [...] it is meant that the StingRay does not mimic a wireless carrier cell site or communicate directly with <b>cellular</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In active mode, the StingRay {{will force}} each {{compatible}} <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> {{in a given}} area to disconnect from its service provider cell site (e.g., operated by Verizon, AT&T, etc.) and establish a new connection with the StingRay. [...] In most cases, this is accomplished by having the StingRay broadcast a pilot signal that is either stronger than, or made to appear stronger than, the pilot signals being broadcast by legitimate cell sites operating in the area. [...] A common function of all cellular communications protocols {{is to have the}} <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> connect to the cell site offering the strongest signal. StingRays exploit this function as a means to force temporary connections with cellular devices within a limited area.|$|E
50|$|In her {{concurrence}} in U.S. v Jones, Justice Sonia Sotomayor {{warned that}} the administration's defense of warrantless GPS tracking, if upheld, would allow federal agencies to track individuals through any <b>cellular</b> <b>device,</b> as law enforcement groups can also intercept signals the phones emit.|$|E
5000|$|Enhanced Network Selection (sometimes {{referred}} to as Enhanced Network Service, or simply ENS) extends GSM by {{making it possible for}} a GSM <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> (e.g., handset) to be [...] "homed" [...] OTA (over the air) to different networks.

50|$|However, {{the signal}} {{coverage}} {{area of a}} given cell site may change according {{to the time of}} day, weather, and physical obstructions in relation to where a <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> attempts to access service. The maps of cell site coverage areas used by law enforcement may also lack precision as a general matter. For these reasons, it is beneficial to use a StingRay and a test phone to map out the precise coverage areas of all cell sites appearing in the HCSLI records. This is typically done at the same time of day and under the same weather conditions that were in effect when the HCSLI was logged. Using a StingRay to conduct base station surveys in this manner allows for mapping out cell site coverage areas that more accurately match the coverage areas that were in effect when the <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> was used.|$|E

5000|$|Driving {{while using}} a {{handsfree}} <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> is not safer than using a hand held cell phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies, epidemiological, simulation, and meta-analysis. The increased cognitive workload involved in holding a conversation, not {{the use of}} hands, causes the increased risk. [...] For example, a Carnegie Mellon University study found that merely listening to somebody speak on a phone caused a 37% drop in activity in the parietal lobe, where spatial tasks are managed. The consistency of increased crash risk between hands-free and hand held cell phone use {{is at odds with}} legislation in many locations that prohibits hand held cell phone use but allows hands-free.|$|E
50|$|Location-based {{services}} or LBS {{is a term}} that {{is derived from the}} telematics and telecom world. The combination of A-GPS, newer GPS and cellular locating technology is what has enabled the latest “LBS” for handsets and PDAs. Line of sight is not necessarily required for a location fix. This is a significant advantage in certain applications since a GPS signal can still be lost indoors. As such, A-GPS enabled cell phones and PDAs can be located indoors and the handset may be tracked more precisely. This enables non-vehicle centric applications and can bridge the indoor location gap, typically the domain of RFID and RTLS systems, with an off the shelf <b>cellular</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
50|$|In September 1983, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{approved}} the DynaTAC 8000X telephone, the world's first commercial <b>cellular</b> <b>device.</b> By 1998, cellphones accounted for {{two thirds of}} Motorola's gross revenue. The company was also strong in semiconductor technology, including integrated circuits used in computers. In particular, it is known for the 6800 family and 68000 family of microprocessors and related peripheral ICs; the processors were used in Atari ST, Commodore Amiga, Color Computer, and Apple Macintosh personal computers {{and in the early}} HP laser printers, and some 6800-family peripheral devices were used in the IBM PC series of personal computers.

50|$|The Nokia C6-00 is a {{smartphone}} {{and portable}} entertainment handheld <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> by Finnish communications company Nokia, running the Symbian S60v5 operating system. It was announced on April 13, 2010. It {{is the third}} Nokia Symbian^1 smartphone featuring a full slide-out QWERTY keyboard. Its software and hardware specifications resemble the N97 mini in most ways. One of the differences is that the sliding in this phone is flat, unlike the upward angled in the N97 mini, hence allowing a four row QWERTY keypad, bringing a slightly enhanced typing experience to the table. The phone has a 5-megapixel camera, though unlike the N97 mini, {{it does not have}} Carl Zeiss optics. It also has a secondary camera in front for video calls. The Nokia C6-01 is the successor to the C6-00 featuring a major step-up with the new Symbian^3 operating system, Ovi Maps 3.0 and such but losing the QWERTY keyboard.|$|E
5000|$|By way of {{software}} upgrades, the StingRay and similar Harris products {{can be used}} to intercept GSM communications content transmitted over-the-air between a target <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> and a legitimate service provider cell site. The StingRay does this by way of the following man-in-the-middle attack: (1) simulate a cell site and force a connection from the target device, (2) download the target device's IMSI and other identifying information, (3) conduct [...] "GSM Active Key Extraction" [...] to obtain the target device's stored encryption key, (4) use the downloaded identifying information to simulate the target device over-the-air, (5) while simulating the target device, establish a connection with a legitimate cell site authorized to provide service to the target device, (6) use the encryption key to authenticate the StingRay to the service provider as being the target device, and (7) forward signals between the target device and the legitimate cell site while decrypting and recording communications content.|$|E
50|$|Mobile phone use {{while driving}} is common, {{but it is}} widely {{considered}} dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and accidents. Due {{to the number of}} accidents that are related to cell phone use while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of a cell phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. Nevertheless, many jurisdictions allow use of a hands-free device, in which the driver talks using a microphone and a speakerphone. Driving while using a hands-free <b>cellular</b> <b>device</b> is not safer than using a hand held cell phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies, epidemiological, simulation, and meta-analysis. In some cases restrictions are directed only at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones. When mobile phones were first introduced, they were typically only able to make voice calls. In the 2000s, as cell phone technology developed, and smartphone usage increased, cell phones {{can also be used to}} read or type text messages, surf the Internet and view videos.

5000|$|Matters {{turns to}} worst as {{in a weak}} moment after a school binging party, Tim {{intoxicated}} with alcohol engages in a casual gay sex encounter with Jeff filming the whole incident on his <b>cellular</b> <b>device.</b> As Tim catches up with Jeff's coveted time of 1:54 in running, Jeff first blackmails Tim with publishing the footage on social media in case Tim goes on with his scheme of stealing Jeff's position in qualifying. During the final run, a desperate and vindictive Jeff first intimidates Tim {{and then in a}} desperate move seeing Tim's insistence in winning the race, instructs his friend to publish the footage online. Tim confronted with his painful outing and public shaming, finds support from his father towards his son's sexuality and outing. The father also who pleads with the school board to stop Jeff and arranges for his son finishing his school year through home schooling with help from his school and teachers. But it is too late, as Tim has already prepared a make shift bomb to blast Jeff's celebration party after the latter's victory and qualification to the Nationals. He has also released a video footage on his own online page explaining why he is engaging in this final act. Tim had developed his skill of bomb-making through chemical experiments he had conducted in preparation with a joint lab project earlier with his now-deceased friend Francis. In his last moment of remorse of possibly causing great havoc and mayhem, he tries to remove the bomb he has placed, but dies himself as the bomb explodes in his hands. The last scene shows the reactions of many who knew Tim and could do nothing, with the friend of Jeff - and not Jeff himself - in a remorseful mood trying to justifying or self-excuse himself by saying that his actions were meant as [...] "just a joke".|$|E

40|$|Comparisons of {{different}} <b>cellular</b> <b>devices</b> {{and the investigation}} of their computing power {{can be made in}} terms of their capabilities to time-construct and time-compute functions. Time-construction means that a distinguished cell has to enter distinguished states exactly at the time steps f(1), f(2), [...] ., whereas time-computation requires the distinguished cell to enter a distinguished state firstly at time step f(n), where n is the length of the input. Here the family of functions which are time-constructible by a two-way unbounded cellular space (F(CS)) is characterized in terms of functions which are time-computable by one of the simplest <b>cellular</b> <b>devices,</b> a one-way bounded cellular automaton (C(OCA)). Conceptually, time-constructible functions have to be strictly increasing. Regarding that restriction the reverse characterization is shown, too. Some results concerning the structure of F(CS) and C(OCA) and their relation to formal language recognition are established. (orig.)
