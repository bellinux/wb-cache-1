40|$|One {{noticeable}} {{feature of}} theses completed in New Zealand {{in recent years}} has been the absence of studies dealing explicitly with aspects of the Great War. Some thesis writers have used the War years as convenient departura and initiation points for their particular topics of study. Others have spanned the war years using a wider chrohological context with the result that a limited number of studies have been presented on the watershed years 1914 to 1918. Upon researching this topic, maps were constructed to plot the location of patriotic organisations and kindred bodies active during the War in an attempt to achieve some sort of illustrative perspective. The ensuing result virtually left no corner of New Zealand untouched. The situation is quite different today however. At present there exist fourteen provincial <b>patriotic</b> <b>councils</b> which focus primarily on the Second world War. The only exception being the Otago Provincial <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Council</b> which has retained files covering the Great War. These files have recently passed into the possession of the Hocken Librar...|$|R

Popular standards such as [...] "Winter Wonderland", the <b>Cuban</b> <b>patriotic</b> song [...] "Guantanamera" [...] and the 1958 Eurovision entry [...] "Volare" [...] are also widely adapted to suit players and managers. The tune [...] "Tom Hark" [...] is often played at many stadiums following a goal by the home team and for chants such as [...] "Thursday Nights, Channel 5", whilst [...] "Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)" [...] by Doris Day is generally reserved for matches where the venue of the final is Wembley Stadium.|$|R
50|$|In June 2013, Blanco, National Youth Coordinator for the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Union (UNPACU), {{met with}} former Polish President Lech Walesa in Warsaw and in October {{of that year}} was invited by the Vaclav Havel Institute to speak about democracy-building in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In October 2014, Blanco participated in the Rising Star Program {{sponsored}} by International Republican Institute held in Prague, Czech Republic. He also represented UNPACU at the World Movement for Democracy 8th Assembly held in Seoul, Korea in 2015, and represented UNPACU at the Organization of American States (OAS) meeting held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic in June, 2016.

2500|$|In 1961, the nº8 of the Military Tribune had as {{its title}} [...] "Let's {{end the war}} of Angola". The authors were linked to the <b>Patriotic</b> Action <b>Councils</b> (Juntas de Acção Patriótica - JAP), {{supporters}} of Humberto Delgado, and responsible for {{the attack on the}} barracks of Beja. The Portuguese Front of National Liberation (Frente Portuguesa de Libertação Nacional - FPLN), founded in December 1962, attacked the conciliatory positions. The official feeling of the Portuguese state, despite all this, was the same: Portugal had inalienable and legitimate rights over the colonies and this was what was transmitted through the media and through the state propaganda.|$|R
5000|$|In 1916, Tucker {{organized}} {{a branch of}} the Loyal Legion of Dames in Washington, D. C. That same year, she was serving as {{a vice president of the}} Women’s National Republican Club, which was not in support of women’s suffrage. Instead, their aim was to mobilize women to support the candidacy of Charles Evans Hughes. Opposed to the pacifist stance of the group of feminists who would form the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, Tucker urged the army to train women to participate in the conflict, teaching them small arms use, telegraphy and signalling. By the early 1920s, Tucker and Cornelia Ross Potts were so opposed to the WILPF message that they convened a meeting to protest the annual WILPF convention in 1924 and attended the convention heckling the speakers. In response, they formed a group known as the National <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Council,</b> bringing together women from the American Legion Auxiliary, Daughters of 1812, Daughters of the American Revolution, and other organizations with the purpose of eliminating communism and pacifist movements, which were radical or unpatriotic. Tucker and Potts, who shared the leadership of the Daughters of 1812, created a propaganda investigation committee and by 1927 created a loyalty committee. In 1928, Tucker {{organized a}} national convention of patriotic societies to combat the pacifist movement. That same year, she took her message to the radio, broadcasting a Dames of the Loyal Legion program aimed to generate respect for heroes. She called for all teachers in either public or private schools to take an oath of allegiance to the United States and pledge to give honor to all historic soldiers and sailors of the nation.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2015, {{a secret}} audio tape {{capturing}} {{a male voice}} resembling that of Osafo-Maafo expressing ethnocentric comments in the Asante dialect went viral {{in the media and}} on the internet. The recording was done during a meeting between the former Finance Minister and the New <b>Patriotic</b> Party's <b>Council</b> of Elders in the Eastern region of Ghana. The voice bemoaned why Ghana's' resources are benefited also by regions that have little or no resources. [...] "You have all the resources, but you have no say in the management of your resources, and that is what is happening. Your development depends on the one who has no resources" [...] the voice said. The comments are thought to have been directed toward Northerners and President John Dramani Mahama in particular who is a Gonja by tribe. He cautioned that such sentiments should not be said in public [...] "You can’t say this openly, We should not", but added that [...] "Council members are at liberty to talk about it only among Asantes".|$|R
50|$|Born in Klukowo near Złotów, Aleksiewicz {{graduated}} from the Agricultural Academy in Szczecin in 1973 and became a farmer in 1974, owning a 35-hectare farm near the Złotów. He {{was active in the}} agricultural cooperative, and for many years was chairman of Farmers' Cooperatives in Złotów, then Chairman of the Board cooperative bank in Złotów. From 1979 to 1989, he was President of the General Council of the National Union of Farmers, Circles and Agricultural Organizations. He was also active in youth organizations (Rural Youth Association, Polish Students' Association, Socialist Union of Rural Youth, Polish Socialist Youth Union etc.). He was {{also a member of the}} National <b>Council</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Movement for National Rebirth. He was elected to the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party in Piła.|$|R
50|$|Middleton's {{official}} duties did not interrupt his dramatic writing; the 1620s saw {{the production of}} his and Rowley's tragedy The Changeling, and of several tragicomedies. In 1624, he reached a peak of notoriety when his dramatic allegory A Game at Chess was staged by the King's Men. The play used the conceit of a chess game to present and satirise the recent intrigues surrounding the Spanish Match. Though Middleton's approach was strongly <b>patriotic,</b> the Privy <b>Council</b> silenced the play after nine performances, having received a complaint from the Spanish ambassador. Middleton faced an unknown, probably frightening degree of punishment. Since no play later than A Game at Chess is recorded, {{it has been suggested}} that this included a ban on writing for the stage.|$|R
50|$|Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council {{called on}} all states, {{particularly}} Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro and the Republic Srpska within Bosnia and Herzegovina to co-operate with the ICTY {{with regard to}} Radovan Karadžić, Ratko Mladić and Ante Gotovina. Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and the Republic of the Congo, among other states, were requested to co-operate with the ICTR with regard to Félicien Kabuga and the Rwandan <b>Patriotic</b> Army. The <b>Council,</b> emphasising the importance of implementing the completion strategies, asked the prosecutors to review their caseloads and determine which cases to proceed with and those to defer to national jurisdictions, while prioritising the trials of senior leaders. Both tribunals were asked to report every six months on progress towards implementing the completion strategies.|$|R
50|$|Among the prerogatives of the Council {{was heading}} the state administration, {{preparation}} of projects {{of laws and}} Sejm acts, which were to be later accepted by the parliament, control over law enforcement and interpretation of the law. Although heavily criticized, most notably by the Familia and the so-called <b>Patriotic</b> Party, the <b>Council</b> managed to {{give rise to a}} period of economic prosperity in Poland. Its functioning strengthened (despite the intentions of some of its creators) the power of the monarch and reduced the power of the already existing and highly influential magnate-ministers, who were placed under the Council's supervision. The Permanent Council was eliminated in 1789 by the Four-Year Sejm and briefly reinstated in 1793 by the Sejm of Grodno. However, this time it was directly headed by the Russian ambassador. Majority of the Council's members were then bribed by the Russian embassy in Warsaw.|$|R
40|$|On August 16, 1961, C. Douglas Dillon, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, {{was at the}} Inter-American Economic and Social Conference in Punta del Este, Uruguay. The conference had progressed without {{interruption}} until Ernesto “Che” Guevara—the revolutionary and Cuban Minister of Industry—gave a speech rebuking the United States, calling its policies imperialistic and its hemispheric objectives insidious. Dillon had a hardline message in response: to acknowledge Guevara’s speech would “betray the thousands of <b>patriotic</b> <b>Cubans</b> who are still awaiting and struggling for the freedom of their country. ” Dillon reiterated that the United States would not recognize Castro’s permanency. Hours later, Guevara had a message for Richard Goodwin, {{a member of the}} U. S. delegation: the revolution could not be defeated, but for economic reasons, Cuba sought a modus vivendi with the United States. As evidence of his sincerity, Guevara said Cuba would consider restitutions for expropriated property and reconsider its relationship with the Soviet Union. Guevara’s encounter with Goodwin began a series of informal negotiations between Castro and the Kennedy administration. This schizophrenic diplomatic moment illustrates that even as public U. S. -Cuban relations epitomized Cold War hostility, several unofﬁcial discussions about normalization call into doubt this interpretive paradigm. This essay examines such contradictory political moments. Despite the enmity and ideological gap between the two states, a series of informal exchanges shows that normalization was a distinct policy possibility in the early 1960 s.
