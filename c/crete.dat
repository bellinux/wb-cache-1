5|$|The {{first such}} campaign, an {{attempted}} reconquest of the Emirate of <b>Crete</b> led by Theoktistos in person, made initial gains, but ultimately ended in disaster. After scoring {{a victory over}} the Arabs in <b>Crete,</b> Theoktistos learned of a rumour that Theodora intended to name a new emperor, possibly her brother Bardas. Theoktistos hurried back to Constantinople, where he discovered that the rumour was false, but in his absence, the Byzantine army in <b>Crete</b> was routed by the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|After Philip's {{withdrawal}} from his campaign against Rhodes, the Rhodians {{were free to}} attack Olous and Hierapytna and their other Cretan allies.

Many other cities in central <b>Crete</b> subsequently joined Rhodes and Knossos against Hierapytna and Olous. Now under attack on two fronts, Hierapytna surrendered.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his actions in Greece and <b>Crete,</b> Kippenberger had forged a {{reputation}} for himself as one of the leading officers of the 2nd Division.

5|$|Crocus cartwrightianus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Iridaceae, native to Greece and <b>Crete.</b> C.cartwrightianus is the presumed wild progenitor of the domesticated triploid Crocus sativus – the saffron crocus. Saffron is the triploid form of a species found in Eastern Greece, Crocus cartwrightianus; it probably appeared first in <b>Crete.</b> An origin in Western or Central Asia, although often suspected, has been disproved by botanical research.|$|E
5|$|During his pontificate Clement strove diplomatically {{to bring}} Western European nations to defense of <b>Crete.</b> The Ottomans were {{planning}} to advance on the Venetian owned capital of the Island at Candia. He intervened in the War of Devolution and helped negotiate a peace, which increased the likelihood that Spain and France would both aid <b>Crete.</b> The French initially sent a small force to aid <b>Crete</b> in 1668, before increasing their troop commitment in 1669. This did affect {{the outcome of the}} Ottoman advance, and they captured Candia in September 1669.|$|E

5|$|During the 820s, the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire had {{suffered}} two great losses that destroyed their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean: {{the beginning of}} the Muslim conquest of Sicily and the fall of <b>Crete</b> to Andalusian exiles. These losses ushered in an era where Saracen pirates raided the Christian northern shores of the Mediterranean almost at will. The establishment of the Emirate of <b>Crete,</b> which became a haven for Muslim ships, opened the Aegean Sea up for raids, while their—albeit partial—control of Sicily allowed the Arabs to raid and even settle in Italy and the Adriatic shores. Several Byzantine attempts to retake <b>Crete</b> {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Andalusian conquest, as well as a large-scale invasion in 842/43, failed with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|For most of 1650, a Venetian {{fleet of}} 41 vessels {{maintained}} the blockade of the Dardanelles, prohibiting Haideragazade Mehmed Pasha from sailing for <b>Crete.</b> He was replaced {{late in the}} year by Hozamzade Ali Pasha, governor of Rhodes, who used a clever ploy to get through the blockade: waiting until winter, when the Venetians withdrew their forces, he assembled a small number of ships and embarked several thousand troops with many provisions on them, and sailed unmolested to <b>Crete.</b>|$|E
5|$|From about 218 BC onwards, the archers of the Roman {{army of the}} mid-Republic were {{virtually}} all mercenaries from the island of <b>Crete,</b> which boasted a long specialist tradition. During the late Republic (88-30 BC) and the Augustan period, <b>Crete</b> was gradually eclipsed by men from other, much more populous, regions subjugated by the Romans with strong archery traditions. These included Thrace, Anatolia and above all, Syria. Of the 32 sagittarii units attested in the mid-2nd century, 13 have Syrian names, 7 Thracian, 5 from Anatolia, 1 from <b>Crete</b> and the remaining 6 of other or uncertain origin.|$|E

5|$|If the Venetians were idle, the Ottomans were not: {{with the}} signing of the Peace of Vasvár in 1664, they were able to focus their {{strength}} against <b>Crete.</b> Grand Vizier Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed initiated large preparations in the winter of 1665/66, and dispatched 9,000 men to bolster the Ottoman forces in <b>Crete.</b> An Ottoman peace proposal, which would have allowed Venice to keep Candia against an annual payment of tribute was rejected, and in May 1666, the Ottoman army, under the personal leadership of the Grand Vizier, departed from Thrace for southern Greece, whence it would embark for <b>Crete</b> during the winter. In February 1667, the Venetians received significant reinforcements from France and Savoy, totaling 21 warships and some 6,000 men, but, as in past years, disagreements among the leaders of the various contingents over precedence (France, the Papal States, Malta, Naples, Sicily contributed ships and men) hampered operations. Francesco Morosini, now again Captain General, sought to engage the Ottomans, but they avoided battle, and using their superior resources and bases, they steadily kept their forces on <b>Crete</b> supplied. The only allied success in 1667 was the repulsion of an Ottoman raid on Cerigo (Kythera).|$|E

5|$|The battalion's {{casualties}} in Greece and <b>Crete</b> were heavy {{and by the}} end of the campaign it had essentially been destroyed. The fighting in Greece resulted in eight dead and seven wounded, as well as 65 captured, while a further 27 were killed in action on <b>Crete,</b> and one was killed in an accident. A further 70 were wounded and 433 were taken prisoner. Instead of being disbanded, the unit was rebuilt from a small cadre of personnel who had not been sent to <b>Crete</b> (about 50 men) along with a large number of reinforcements, and the 16 personnel who had escaped <b>Crete.</b> This was undertaken in Palestine under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn, before the 2/7th was sent to Syria to perform occupation duties as part of the garrison that had been established there following the conclusion of the Syria–Lebanon campaign.|$|E
5|$|The last notable {{members of}} the family are {{mentioned}} in Constantinople during the early centuries of the Ottoman Empire, as with Michael or Mozalos Gabras, active ca. 1555–65, or Cyril Gabras, megas skeuophylax of the Patriarchate in 1604. Other family members are attested in <b>Crete</b> and the Aegean islands. Thus an unnamed Gabras held lands in Santorini in the early 17th century; and numerous Gabrades are to be found at Chios and in <b>Crete,</b> especially around Siteia, until the early 19th century. For <b>Crete</b> in particular, it has been often supposed, although with no definitive evidence, that the local Gabrades came directly from the Pontus.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Theophilos in 842, new {{measures}} to confront the Cretan threat were undertaken by the new Byzantine regime: in 843 a new maritime theme, that of the Aegean Sea, was established to better deal with the Arabs raids, and another expedition to recover <b>Crete</b> was launched under the personal leadership of the powerful logothetes and regent Theoktistos. Although it succeeded in occupying much of the island, Theoktistos had to abandon the army due to political intrigues in Constantinople, and the troops left behind were slaughtered by the Arabs. In an effort to weaken the Arabs in 853, several Byzantine fleets engaged in coordinated operations in the Eastern Mediterranean, attacking the Egyptian naval base of Damietta and capturing weapons intended for <b>Crete.</b> Despite some Byzantine successes against the Arabs in the following years, the Cretans resumed their raids in the early 860s, attacking the Peloponnese, the Cyclades, and Athos. In 866, the Byzantine Caesar Bardas assembled another large-scale expeditionary force to subdue <b>Crete,</b> but his murder by Basil the Macedonian only {{two weeks after the}} fleet set sail from the capital spelled the end of the undertaking.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Greece itself, {{medicinal}} plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions {{is the source}} of the drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from <b>Crete.</b> Wolfsbane comes from <b>Crete</b> and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E
