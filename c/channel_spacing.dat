5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} the 802.11 channels that overlap into an amateur radio band under the FCC in the United States. Note that the 5 cm amateur band extends from 5650 to 5925MHz, so that there are many frequencies outside the Part 15 ISM/UNII block used for 802.11a. Many commercial grade 802.11a access points can also operate in between the normal channels by using 5MHz <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> instead of the standard 20MHz <b>channel</b> <b>spacing.</b> 802.11a channels 132, 136 and 140 are only available for unlicensed use in ETSI regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{audio quality}} in the airband {{is limited by the}} RF {{bandwidth}} used. In the newer <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> scheme, the largest bandwidth of an airband channel might be limited to 8.33kHz, so the highest possible audio frequency is 4.165kHz. In the 25kHz <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> scheme, an upper audio frequency of 12.5kHz would be theoretically possible. However, most airband voice transmissions never actually reach these limits. Usually, the whole transmission is contained within a 6kHz to 8kHz bandwidth, corresponding to an upper audio frequency of 3kHz to 4kHz. This frequency, while low compared {{to the top of the}} human hearing range, is sufficient to convey speech. Different aircraft, control towers and other users transmit with different bandwidths and audio characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{air traffic}} {{congestion}} has led to further subdivision into narrow-band 8.33kHz channels in the ICAO European region; all aircraft flying are required to have communication equipment for this <b>channel</b> <b>spacing.</b> Outside of Europe, 8.33kHz channels are permitted in many countries but not widely used as of 2012.|$|E

25|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>spacing</b> for voice {{communication}} on the airband was originally 200kHz until 1947, providing 70 channels from 118 to 132MHz. Some radios {{of that time}} provided receive-only coverage below 118MHz {{for a total of}} 90 channels. From 1947–1958 the spacing became 100kHz; from 1954 split once again to 50kHz and the upper limit extended to 135.95MHz (360 channels), and then to 25kHz in 1972 to provide 720 usable channels. On 1 January 1990 the frequencies between 136.000 and 136.975MHz were added, resulting in 760 channels.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002 the ITU {{standardized}} a <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> grid for {{use with}} CWDM (ITU-T G.694.2), using the wavelengths from 1270nm through 1610nm with a <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> of 20nm. [...] (G.694.2 was revised in 2003 to shift the actual channel centers by 1nm, so that strictly speaking the center wavelengths are 1271 to 1611nm). [...] Many CWDM wavelengths below 1470nm are considered [...] "unusable" [...] on older G.652 specification fibers, due to the increased attenuation in the 1270–1470nm bands. Newer fibers which conform to the G.652.C and G.652.D standards, such as Corning SMF-28e and Samsung Widepass nearly eliminate the [...] "water peak" [...] attenuation peak and allow for full operation of all 18 ITU CWDM channels in metropolitan networks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept was}} first {{published}} in 1978, and by 1980 WDM systems were being realized in the laboratory. The first WDM systems combined only two signals.

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of the ITU-T G.694.1 frequency grid in 2002 has {{made it easier to}} integrate WDM with older but more standard SONET/SDH systems. WDM wavelengths are positioned in a grid having exactly 100GHz (about 0.8nm) spacing in optical frequency, with a reference frequency fixed at 193.10THz (1,552.52nm). The main grid is placed inside the optical fiber amplifier bandwidth, but can be extended to wider bandwidths. The first commercial deployment of DWDM was made by Ciena Corporation on the Sprint network in June 1996. [...] Today's DWDM systems use 50GHz or even 25GHz <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> for up to 160 channel operation.|$|E
2500|$|WDM {{systems are}} divided into three {{different}} wavelength patterns, normal (WDM), coarse (CWDM) [...] and dense (DWDM). [...] Normal WDM (sometimes called BWDM) uses the two normal wavelengths 1310 and 1550 on one fiber. Coarse WDM provides up to 16 channels across multiple transmission windows of silica fibers. Dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) uses the C-Band (1530nm-1565nm) transmission window but with denser <b>channel</b> <b>spacing.</b> Channel plans vary, but a typical DWDM system would use 40 channels at 100GHz spacing or 80 channels with 50GHz spacing. Some technologies are capable of 12.5GHz spacing (sometimes called ultra dense WDM). New amplification options (Raman amplification) enable {{the extension of the}} usable wavelengths to the L-band (1565nm-1625nm), more or less doubling these numbers.|$|E
2500|$|Coarse {{wavelength}} division multiplexing (CWDM) {{in contrast}} to DWDM uses increased <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> to allow less sophisticated and thus cheaper transceiver designs. To provide 16 channels on a single fiber CWDM uses the entire frequency band spanning {{the second and third}} transmission window (1310/1550nm respectively) including both windows (minimum dispersion window and minimum attenuation window) but also the critical area where OH scattering may occur, recommending the use of OH-free silica fibers in case the wavelengths between second and third transmission windows are to be used. Avoiding this region, the channels 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61 remain and these are the most commonly used. [...] With OS2 fibers the water peak problem is overcome, and all possible 18 channels can be used.|$|E

2500|$|The RF {{bandwidth}} of an AM transmission (refer to Figure 2, {{but only}} considering positive frequencies) is twice the bandwidth of the modulating (or [...] "baseband") signal, since {{the upper and}} lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth as wide as the highest modulating frequency. Although the bandwidth of an AM signal is narrower than one using frequency modulation (FM), it is twice as wide as single-sideband techniques; it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient. Within a frequency band, only half as many transmissions (or [...] "channels") can thus be accommodated. For this reason analog television employs a variant of single-sideband (known as vestigial sideband, somewhat of a compromise in terms of bandwidth) {{in order to reduce the}} required <b>channel</b> <b>spacing.</b>|$|E

50|$|FWM is a fiber-optic {{characteristic}} that affects wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems, where multiple optical wavelengths are spaced at equal intervals or <b>channel</b> <b>spacing.</b> The effects of FWM are pronounced with decreased <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> of wavelengths (such as in dense WDM systems) and at high signal power levels. High chromatic dispersion decreases FWM effects, as the signals lose coherence, {{or in other}} words, increases the phase mismatch. The interference FWM caused in WDM systems is known as interchannel crosstalk. FWM can be mitigated by using uneven <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> or fiber that increases dispersion.|$|E
