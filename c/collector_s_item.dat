40|$|Association rule mining is a {{powerful}} model of data mining used for finding hidden patterns in large databases. One of the great challenges of data mining {{is to protect the}} confidentiality of sensitive patterns when releasing database to third parties. Association rule hiding algorithms sanitize database such that certain sensitive association rules cannot be discovered through association rule mining techniques. In this study, we propose two algorithms, ADSRRC (Advanced Decrease Support of R. H. <b>S.</b> <b>items</b> of Rule Cluster) and RRLR (Remove and Reinsert L. H. S. of Rule), for hiding sensitive association rules. Both algorithms are developed to overcome limitations of existing rule hiding algorithm DSRRC (Decrease Support of R. H. <b>S.</b> <b>items</b> of Rule Cluster). Algorithm ADSRRC overcomes limitation of multiple sorting in database as well as it selects transaction to be modified based on different criteria than DSRRC algorithm. Algorithm RRLR overcomes limitation of hiding rules having multiple R. H. <b>S.</b> <b>items.</b> Experimental results show that both proposed algorithms outperform DSRRC in terms of side effects generated and data quality in most cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of garbage collectors and leak detectors in identifying dead objects {{depends on the}} accuracy of their reachability traversal. Accuracy has two orthogonal dimensions: (i) whether the reachability traversal can distinguish between pointers and nonpointers (type accuracy), and (ii) whether the reachability traversal can identify memory locations that will be dereferenced in the future (liveness accuracy). This article presents an experimental study {{of the importance of}} type and liveness accuracy for reachability traversals. We show that liveness accuracy reduces the reachable heap size by up to 62 % for our benchmark programs. However, the simpler liveness schemes (e. g., intraprocedural analysis of local variables) are largely ineffective for our benchmark runs: one must analyze global variables using interprocedural analysis to obtain significant benefits. Type accuracy has an insignificant impact on a garbage <b>collector</b> <b>s</b> ability to find unreachable objects in our benchmark runs.
