50|$|Grenier and Conway, however, {{continued}} to team together as La Résistance on Raw. With American-Franco hostility subsiding, the WWE <b>ceased</b> <b>billing</b> {{the team as}} being from France and instead promoted them as being haughty French Canadians who carried the flag of Quebec to the ring, with Grenier often singing the Canadian national anthem and Conway becoming known as Robért Conway, the French version of his name. The team held the World Tag Team Championship three times. Their first title reign came when they defeated Chris Benoit and Edge on the May 31, 2004 edition of Raw in Grenier's home town of Montreal, Quebec. The team dropped the belts to the same team of Benoit and Edge at Taboo Tuesday on October 19 when, even though Edge walked out on Benoit, Benoit was able to defeat La Résistance by himself. It {{was not long before}} La Résistance reclaimed the tag team gold for the second time on the November 1 edition of Raw, defeating Chris Benoit after Edge walked out on Benoit again. This time La Résistance did not hold the title as long as their last reign; they lost the belts two weeks later on Raw when they faced the team of William Regal and Eugene as well as Tajiri and Rhyno. In a 3-Way Elimination match, they dropped the title to Regal and Eugene. Their third, and final, Tag Team Title reign began at a Raw brand house show on January 16, 2005 in Winnipeg, Manitoba when they defeated Regal and Jonathan Coachman—Regal's actual partner, Eugene, had been injured and Coachman was selected to be his fill in partner, though Regal never tagged him in—to win the belts. La Résistance dropped the belts again a few weeks later on the February 7, edition of Raw, from Tokyo, Japan, to William Regal and his new tag team partner Tajiri.|$|R
50|$|In 1819 the <b>bills</b> <b>ceased</b> to be {{published}} {{under the authority of}} the Corporation of London, coming directly from the Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks. The clerk of St George Hanover Square ceased to provide returns from 1823. From then until 1858 the practice of producing bills of mortality was in decline, as parishes ceased to provide returns to the Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks. The last surviving bill of mortality is believed to be from 28 September 1858.|$|R
5000|$|On August 31, 2012, Paragon Studios {{announced}} that it was being closed, and City of Heroes would <b>cease</b> all <b>billing</b> immediately and begin the process of shutting down the service. The stated explanation for this move was a [...] "realignment of company focus and publishing support". November 30, 2012, was listed as the official shutdown date of the game and the servers were turned off at midnight PST. Many players arrived en masse to express their continued protest, support, and fond farewells, including messages of gratitude from the developers and moderators thanking their fans for their support and passion for the game. A variety of efforts got underway, led by players of the game, to keep the game operating past the announced date of closure. Ultimately, their efforts were unsuccessful, and the game shut down as scheduled.|$|R

25|$|The Buffalo Bills Radio Network is flagshipped at WGR, AM 550 in Buffalo. John Murphy is the team's current play-by-play announcer; {{he was a}} color {{commentator}} alongside, {{and eventually}} succeeded, longtime voice Van Miller after Miller's retirement {{at the end of}} the 2003 NFL season. Mark Kelso serves as the color analyst. The Bills radio network has approximately seventeen affiliates in upstate New York and one affiliate, CJCL 590AM (The Fan) in Toronto. As of early 2012, it is composed mostly of WGR, Entercom's sister stations WCMF (96.5 FM) and WROC-AM 950 in Rochester, and a fleet of independent AM and FM stations across upstate New York from Jamestown east to Albany. Previous flagship Citadel Broadcasting was purchased by Cumulus Media, who in turn <b>ceased</b> carrying <b>Bills</b> games {{at the end of the}} 2011 season, leaving the network without affiliates in Syracuse, Binghamton, and Erie. (The Syracuse affiliations were later picked up by Galaxy Communications.) Buffalo is one of ten teams contracted with Compass Media Networks to syndicate selected games nationwide.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Dollar has {{numerous}} discontinued denominations, {{particularly high}} denomination bills, issued before and in 1934 in six denominations ranging from $500 to $100,000. Although still legal tender, most {{are in the}} hands of collectors and museums. The reverse designs featured abstract scroll-work with ornate denomination identifiers. With the exception of the $100,000 <b>bill,</b> these <b>bills</b> <b>ceased</b> production in the 1940s, and were recalled in 1969. Of these, the $100,000 was printed only as a Series 1934 gold certificate and was only used for internal government transactions. The United States also issued fractional currency for a brief time in the 1860s and 1870s, in several denominations each less than a dollar.|$|R
50|$|The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2016 is a {{controversial}} act {{drafted by the}} United States Congress by both Democrats and Republicans during a lame duck session sanctioning Syrian government. On November 15, 2016 it passed the house unanimously as The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act (HR 5732). This is a new bipartisan legislation that would impose new sanctions upon the Damascus regime. If passed by the Senate and {{signed into law by}} the President, the legislation would impose fresh sanctions on entities conducting business with the Assad regime and its military and intelligence agencies. A number of regime-controlled industries, including in the airline, telecommunications and energy sectors, would also be targeted. The legislation would also require the U.S president to report to Congress on the prospects for a no-fly zone in Syria. It also aims to encourage negotiations by allowing the President to waive sanctions if the parties are engaged in meaningful negotiations and the violence against civilians has <b>ceased.</b> The <b>bill</b> would authorize the Secretary of State to support entities that are collecting and preserving evidence for the eventual prosecution of those who committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria from March 2011 to the present, require the President to report to Congress on the names of those who are responsible for or complicit in gross violations of human rights of the Syrian people.|$|R
5000|$|Vermeule is a {{judicial}} review skeptic. One legal scholar {{has written that}} Vermeule's approach to the interpretation of law [...] "eschews, and attempts to transcend, the main elements of the long-standing debates over methods that courts should use to interpret statutes and the Constitution[...] [...] [...] he sees no need to resolve apparently burning questions such as whether courts are bound by what legislatures write, or by what legislatures intend [...] [...] [...] For Vermeule, everything {{comes down to a}} simple but withering cost-benefit analysis." [...] Vermeule argues for a form of popular constitutionalism, in which the courts [...] "should enforce clear and specific constitutional texts, but should disclaim any role beyond that. Where constitutional texts are ambiguous or open ended, courts should let legislatures interpret them. Under this rule, courts would <b>cease</b> enforcing the <b>Bill</b> of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment. In particular, freedom of speech, due process, and equal protection of the laws would all be remitted to legislative enforcement.".|$|R
