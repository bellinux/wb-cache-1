5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area,</b> above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E

After construction, the grafts and adjoining arteries were excised, mounted in vitro at in situ length, filled with a dilute barium sulfate suspension, and pressurized in 25 mm Hg steps up to 200 mm Hg. Radiographs were obtained at each pressure. The computed <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the anastomoses were {{compared with those of}} the native arteries at corresponding pressures. Results showed that for the end-to-end anastomoses at 100 mm Hg the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the continuous Surgilene anastomoses were 70 % of the native artery <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas,</b> the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the continuous Novafil anastomoses were 90 % of the native artery <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas,</b> and the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the interrupted anastomoses were 107 % of the native artery <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> (p < 0. 05). At physiologic pressures, there were no differences in compliance among the three types of anastomosis. These data suggest that when constructing an end-to-end anastomosis in a small vessel, one should use an interrupted suture line or possibly continuous polybutester suture. Forty-two end-to-side anastomoses demonstrated no differences in <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> or compliance for the three suture techniques. This suggests that, unlike with end-to-end anastomoses, when constructing an end-to-side anastomosis in patients any of the three suture techniques may be acceptable.

[Purpose] The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} chronic low back pain by determining the ratio of the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the lumbar multifidus of the unaffected and affected sides at the L 5 level using the ultrasound imaging. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 24 young people (10 males, 14 females) with chronic low back pain lasting for more than 6 months on one side. The visual analog scale (VAS) value of pain was assessed and the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the bilateral multifidus muscle were measured with the subjects in a supine position in a resting state using ultrasound imaging. Correlation and linear regression analysis were performed on the VAS and the ratio of the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the lumbar multifidus of the unaffected and affected sides. [Results] The VAS and the ratio of the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the lumbar multifidus were linearly correlated.

5|$|The large groove {{that runs}} {{the length of the}} spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine's <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area,</b> and contains lines of arrested growth {{that can be used to}} determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} an ultrasonography-guided technique for cubital tunnel injection. Method The ulnar nerves from 12 elbows of 6 adult cadavers were scanned, and the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the ulnar nerves, cubital tunnel inlets and outlets were measured by using ultrasonography. All elbows were dissected after an ultrasonography-guided dye injection at the inlet of the cubital tunnel. The dissectors evaluated {{the spread of}} dye and the coloration of the nerve and remeasured the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the cubital tunnel inlets and outlets. Results After a real-time visualization of an ultrasonography-guided injection, the ulnar nerves were seperated from the medial groove for the ulnar nerve. All the ulnar nerves of the cadavers were successfully colored with the dye, from the inlet to oulet of the cubital tunnel. The post-injection <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> were significantly larger than the pre-injection <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas.</b> No significant differences were detected in the post-injection <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the cubital tunnel outlet and the ulnar nerve {{as compared with the}} pre-injection areas.

40|$|Bite {{force is}} a measure of whole-organism {{performance}} that is often used to investigate the relationships between performance, morphology and fitness. When in vivo measurements of bite force are unavailable, researchers often turn to lever models to predict bite forces. This study demonstrates that bite force predictions based on two-dimensional (2 -D) lever models can be improved by including three-dimensional (3 -D) geometry and realistic physiological <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> derived from dissections. Widely used, the 2 -D method does a reasonable job of predicting bite force. However, it does so by over predicting physiological <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> for the masseter and pterygoid muscles and under predicting physiological <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> for the temporalis muscle. We found that lever models that include the three dimensional structure of the skull and mandible and physiological <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> calculated from dissected muscles provide the best predictions of bite force. Models that accurately represent the biting mechanics strengthen our understanding of which variables are functionally relevant and how they are relevant to feeding performance...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons {{have been}} made of the shock {{phenomena}} and drag-rise increments for representative wing and central-body combinations with those for bodies of revolution having the same axial developments of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> normal to the airstream. On the basis of these comparisons, it is concluded that near the speed of sound the zero-lift drag rise of a low-aspect-ratio thin-wing and body combination is primarily dependent on the axial development of the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> normal to the airstream. It follows that the drag rise for any such configuration is approximately the same as that for any other with the same development of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas.</b> Investigations have also been made of representative wing-body combinations with the body so indented that the axial developments of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> for the combinations were the same as that for the original body alone.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} buckling modes and {{stresses of}} elastic Kelvin open-cell foams subjected to [001], [011] and [111] uniaxial compressions. Cubic unit cells and cell aggregates in model foams are analyzed using a homogenization {{theory of the}} updated Lagrangian type. The analysis is performed {{on the assumption that}} the struts in foams have a non-uniform distribution of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> as observed experimentally. The relative density is changed to range from 0. 005 to 0. 05. It is thus found that long wavelength buckling and macroscopic instability primarily occur under [001] and [011] compressions, with only short wavelength buckling under [111] compression. The primary buckling stresses under the three compressions are fairly close to one another and almost satisfy the Gibson–Ashby relation established to fit experiments. By also performing the analysis based on the uniformity of strut <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas,</b> it is shown that the non-uniformity of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> is an important factor for the buckling behavior of open-cell foams...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This study aims {{to develop}} a method to assess the changes in palatal and lingual <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> in {{patients}} submitted to rapid maxillary expansion (RME). METHODS: The sample comprised 31 Class I malocclusion individuals submitted to RME and {{divided into two groups}} treated with Haas (17 patients) and Hyrax (14 patients) expanders. Cone-beam computed tomography scans were acquired at T 0 (before expansion) and T 1 (six months after screw stabilization). Maxillary and mandibular <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> were assessed at first permanent molars and first premolars regions and compared at T 0 and T 1. Mandibular occlusal area was also analyzed. RESULTS: Maxillary <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> increased in 56. 18 mm 2 and 44. 32 mm 2 for the posterior and anterior regions. These values were smaller for the mandible, representing augmentation of 40. 32 mm 2 and 39. 91 mm 2 for posterior and anterior sections. No differences were found when comparing both expanders. Mandibular occlusal area increased 43. 99 mm 2 and mandibular incisors proclined. Increments of 1. 74 mm and 1. 7 mm occurred in mandibular intermolar and interpremolar distances. These same distances presented increments of 5. 5 mm and 5. 57 mm for the maxillary arch. CONCLUSION: Occlusal and <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> increased significantly after RME.

The <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the median nerve at the tunnel inlet and outlet can show swelling and compression of the nerve at the carpal. We hypothesized that the ratio of the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel inlet to outlet accurately reflects the severity of carpal tunnel syndrome. To test this, high-resolution ultrasound with a linear array transducer at 5 - 17 MHz was used to assess 77 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.
