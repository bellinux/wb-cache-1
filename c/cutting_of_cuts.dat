40|$|This report {{describes}} the <b>cutting</b> performance <b>of</b> different coated carbide cutting tools on surface roughness during machining of aluminum alloys AA 6061 -T 6 using dry machining and minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) technique. The <b>cutting</b> speed, depth <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> and feed rate were the selected input parameters in this study. This experiment was conducted based on central composite design (CCD) method. To develop {{a model of}} process optimization based on the response surface method. The investigation results showed that MQL technique lowers the surface roughness values compared with that <b>of</b> conventional dry <b>cutting</b> conditions. Based on the investigations of the surface roughness conditions and material removal rate, MQL technique reduces the cutting temperature to some extent. This caused the surface roughness value to lower while dry machining {{is dependent on the}} heat to get better surface roughness result. In summary, the improvement in surface finish is achieved utilizing higher feed rate, medium depth <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> lower speed and lower MQL flow rat...|$|R
