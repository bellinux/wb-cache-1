A first way to increase energy efficiency is to substitute mains frequency (50  Hz) furnaces with medium frequency (up to 250  Hz) ones. The latters have a higher power density (up to 1, 000  kW t− 1) than the formers (300  kW t− 1). This allows {{the use of a}} smaller crucible (up to a factor of three smaller) which results in a smaller total heat loss.

When the initial construction phase is completed in the Fall 1983, the complex will be capable of producing 400 million pounds per year of aluminum, sheet and foil using highly automated, computer controlled equipment that will maximize end product quality and minimize the consumption of energy. This paper will describe the basic processes used in the Logan complex and several design features that are being incorporated to reduce energy consumption. Large reverberatroy melting furnaces will remelt scrap aluminum and ingots will be cast on site to supplement those delivered to the site from ARCO Metal's reduction plants.

40|$|The paper reviews {{original}} {{data obtained by}} the present authors, revealed in recent separate publications, describing specific procedures for high quality grey irons, and reflecting the forecast needs of the worldwide iron foundry industry. High power, medium frequency <b>coreless</b> <b>induction</b> <b>furnaces</b> are commonly used in electric melting grey iron foundries. This has resulted in low sulphur (1, 500 °C), contributing to unfavourable conditions for graphite nucleation. Thin wall castings are increasingly produced by these electric melt shops with a risk of greater eutectic undercooling during solidification. The paper focused on two groups of grey cast irons and their specific problems: carbides and graphite morphology control in lower carbon equivalent high strength irons (CE= 3. 4 %- 3. 8 %), and austenite dendrite promotion in eutectic and slightly hypereutectic irons (CE= 4. 1 %- 4. 5 %), {{in order to increase}} their strength characteristics. There are 3 stages and 3 steps involving graphite formation, iron chemistry and iron processing that appear to be important. The concept in the present paper sustains a threestage model for nucleating flake graphite [(Mn,X) S type nuclei]. There are three important groups of elements (deoxidizer, Mn/S, and inoculant) and three technological stages in electric melting of iron (superheat, pre-conditioning of base iron, final inoculation). Attention is drawn to a control factor (%Mn) x (%S) ensuring it equals to 0. 03 – 0. 06, accompanied by 0. 005 wt. %– 0. 010 wt. % Al and/or Zr content in inoculated irons. It was found that iron powder addition promotes austenite dendrite formation in eutectic and slightly eutectic, acting as reinforcement for the eutectic cells. But, there is an accompanying possible negative influence on the characteristics of the (Mn,X) S type graphite nuclei (change the morphology of nuclei from polygonal compact to irregular polygonal, and therefore promote chill tendency in treated irons). A double addition (iron powder + inoculant) appears to be an effective treatment to benefit both austenite and graphite nucleation, with positive effects on the final structure and chill tendency...|$|R

The controlled values of different casting parameters such as pouring temperature, inoculation, carbon equivalent, moisture content, green compression strength, permeability and mould hardness were selected. Three different melts of metal with 0. 4 wt. %, 0. 6 wt. %, and 0. 8 wt. % inoculation (Fe-Si-Mg alloy and post inoculant) were produced using a 1 -ton capacity <b>coreless</b> medium frequency <b>induction</b> <b>furnace.</b> L- 27 orthogonal array with 3 -level settings {{were chosen for}} the analysis.
