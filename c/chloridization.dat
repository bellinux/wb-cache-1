40|$|Potentiometric {{chloride}} sensors were fabricated by electrochemically chloridizing {{the surface}} of screen printed silver electrodes using amperostatic coulometry or asymmetric square wave voltammetry. In the case of coulometric <b>chloridization,</b> the effect of different chloride ion sources was also investigated. The response to chloride ions by each type of sensor was determined by measuring their potentials {{with respect to a}} commercial Ag/AgCl reference electrode over the chloride concentration range 1. 8 to 3, 545 mg/L (approximately 50 ?M to 100 mM). Results reveal that irrespective of fabrication method, all sensors exhibit near Nernstian responses with no significant relationships between fabrication and response parameters...|$|E
40|$|This study {{details the}} use of {{printing}} and other additive processes to fabricate a novel amperometric glucose sensor. The sensor was fabricated using a Au coated 12. 7 micron polyimide film as a starting material, where micro-contact printing, electrochemical plating and <b>chloridization,</b> electrohydrodynamic jet (e-jet) printing, and spin coating were used to pattern, deposit, print, and coat functional materials, respectively. We have found that e-jet printing was effective for the deposition and patterning of glucose oxidase inks between ~ 5 to 1000 micron in width, and we have demonstrated that the enzyme was still active after printing. The thickness of the permselective layer was optimized to obtain a linear response to glucose concentration up to 32 mM. For these sensors no response to acetaminophen, a common interfering compound, was observed. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in Figure 4 and...|$|E

The thickness of the permselective layer was optimized to obtain a linear response for glucose concentrations up to 32 mM and no response to acetaminophen, a common interfering compound, was observed. The use of such thin polyimide substrates allow wrapping of the sensors around catheters with high radius of curvature ∼ 250 μm, where additive and microfabrication methods may allow significant cost reductions...|$|E

The combined fluidized bed consists of at least a riser tube and a semi-circulating fluidized bed.

40|$|Potentiometric {{cells from}} which the pH values of {{standard}} buffer solutions are computed rely on the silver-silver chloride reference electrode which {{has proved to be}} convenient, reproducible and reliable. Of the various methods of preparation of silver-silver chloride electrodes only one concerns us here: the thermal-electrolytic type that has been used more extensively than any other form. Once prepared, the electrodes need to be equilibrated before use and between experiments. The equilibration technique must ensure voltage stability and inter-electrode, or bias, potential below 0. 1 mV. In potentiometry the stability of a reference electrode is of utmost importance since an offset of 1 mV is equivalent to a deviation of about 0. 02 in the pH value. A thorough study has been conducted, involving a critical assessment of the various protocols which have been developed and adopted by different research schools and have been used in the course of inter-laboratory exercises. Factors that affect the electrode performance, such as size, mass, <b>chloridization,</b> storage and conditioning were systematically investigated, through measurements of bias potential, leading to a set of recommended procedures that meet the requirements for high quality results. In this work, the adequacy of the optimized methodology is confirmed by means of primary pH measurements...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{groundwater}} {{quality of the}} Paravanar river basin, groundwater data were collected by conventional methods. Hydrogeochemical facies of groundwater of study area reveals fresh to brackish and alkaline in nature. Piper plot shows {{that most of the}} groundwater samples fall in the mixed field of Ca-Mg-Cl type. Using GIS mapping technique, major element concentration of groundwater has been interpolated and studied. Groundwater thematic maps on electrical conductivity (EC), hydrogen ion concentration, bicarbonates, chlorides and nitrates were prepared from the groundwater quality data. Different classes in thematic maps were categorized as i) good, ii) moderate and iii) poor with respect to groundwater quality. Northeast and southeast parts of the study area represent the doubtful water class regarding the concentration of EC to represent connate nature of water adjacent to the coast. NNE (North-North-East) and southern parts of the study area have pH ranging from 7 to 8 indicating acidic nature as they were from the weathered Cuddalore sandstone. As northern part of the study area is irrigated, fertilizer used for agriculture may be the source for increase in concentration of nitrates. Chloride clusters in the south central part of the study area from coast up to NLC mines and reveals the <b>chloridization</b> of aquifer in 48 years either due to upwelling of connate water from the deeper aquifer as a result of depressurization of Neyveli aquifer for the safe mining of lignite...|$|E
