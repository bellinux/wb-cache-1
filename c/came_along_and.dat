He was eventually tricked by Cao Cao into leaving Liu Bei and joining Cao, but he recommended Zhuge Liang to Liu before leaving and swore never to give advice to Cao.|$|E

25|$|From the {{evidence}} that could be gathered, it appeared Waterhouse and Connolly became lost in a rainstorm and hugged the coast of Baja California southward, thinking they were headed north along the Pacific Coast. They landed safely on the beach about twenty miles north of Bahia de Los Angeles. Their sole chance for survival seemed to be staying with the plane until found. Tortured by heat, thirst, and hunger, they waited seventeen days, but the search never reached that far south. Finally two fishermen <b>came</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> took them in a canoe to Bahia de Los Angeles. There the Americans were murdered, apparently for the little money they had. Their bodies, buried in the sand, were discovered {{within a day or}} two by an American geological survey party and rediscovered a week later by an American mining engineer. The news, however, did not reach Rockwell Field until 13 October. Three days later, a Navy ship, USS Aaron Ward, sailed from San Diego with a group of Army officers to recover the bodies.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} engineer for the album, Brooks Arthur, [...] remembered the sessions in 2009: [...] "A cloud <b>came</b> <b>along,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was called}} the Van Morrison sessions. We all hopped upon that cloud, and the cloud took us away , and we made this album, and we landed when it was done." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1972, Morrison told John Grissim, Jr.: [...] "I was really pretty happy with the album. [...] The only complaint I had was that it was rather rushed. [...] But I thought it was closer to the type of music I wanted to put out. [...] And still is, actually." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{bridge of}} [...] "Lamb of God" [...] paraphrases {{the chorus of}} [...] "Across the Universe" [...] (from 1970's Let It Be), whose lyric [...] "Nothing's gonna change my world" [...] {{inspired}} the song. Manson elaborated that: [...] "Mark David Chapman <b>came</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> proved him very wrong. That was always something growing up that was very sad and tragic to me". The song uses the assassinations of JFK and John Lennon to criticize the media's veneration of death, and for turning tragedy into televised spectacle. [...] "Burning Flag" [...] is a heavy-metal song reminiscent of American industrial metal band Ministry. The album ends with an interlocking group of songs: [...] "Valentine's Day", [...] "The Fall of Adam", [...] "King Kill 33°" [...] and [...] "Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)", as each song abruptly ends and is instantaneously followed by the intro of the proceeding track.|$|E

500|$|Germany {{initially}} {{tried to}} implicate British mines or torpedoes, but relented {{when confronted with}} evidence {{that it was one}} of their own torpedoes—which had been assigned to UB-13—that had sunk Tubantia. The Germans, however, presented a forged log from UB-13 that showed her nowhere near Tubantia at the time of the attack. Further, they reported, UB-13 had fired that specific torpedo at a British warship on 6 March—ten days before Tubantia was sunk—which would have been under her previous commander, Kapitänleutnant Neumann. The U.S. Minister to the Netherlands, Henry van Dyke, writing in Fighting for Peace in 1917, called this explanation [...] "amazing" [...] and derided it:This certain U-boat had fired this particular torpedo at a British war-vessel somewhere in the North Sea ten days before the Tubantia was sunk. The shot missed its mark. But the naughty undisciplined little torpedo went cruising around in the sea on its own hook for ten days waiting for a chance to kill somebody. Then the Tubantia <b>came</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> the wandering-Willy torpedo promptly, obstinately, ran into the ship and sank her. This was the explanation. Germany was not to blame.|$|E
500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny <b>came</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I found that I was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E
500|$|Canadian {{animator}} and {{creator of}} The Ren & Stimpy Show, John Kricfalusi, guest animated the couch gag for the episode. This {{was the second}} time The Simpsons had chosen a guest director for its opening sequence, following the previous season's episode [...] "MoneyBART", which was guest directed by British graffiti artist and political activist Banksy. Previously, Kricfalusi had criticized The Simpsons staff in the show's early years by saying that [...] "the show succeeded despite the writing" [...] and similarly derogatory comments. The producers responded with the fourth season episode [...] "The Front" [...] (1993), in which The Ren & Stimpy Show is nominated for a cartoon award. During the award ceremony, the clip from the nominated episode is merely a black screen with the text [...] "Clip not done yet", a comment on the slow production time of the show. The show was mentioned again in the season six episode [...] "Another Simpsons Clip Show" [...] (1994), when Lisa claims that Ren & Stimpy recycles animation to make new episodes, while referencing Itchy & Scratchy's habit of doing the same. Despite this, Kricfalusi changed his tone in an interview with Aaron Simpson in 2007 and claimed that The Simpsons made it easier to do more edgy work: [...] "Well it started with Bakshi’s [...] and Pee Wee Herman. Those were kid shows, but with layers of perversion in them. Then The Simpsons <b>came</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> did edgy material in prime time cartoons." ...|$|E

500|$|Debut {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest albums of 1993 and the 1990s in general. In 2013, John Hamilton of Idolator called the album [...] "highly influential", and wrote [...] "in spite of its advancing age, Debuts futurism has aged exquisitely." [...] The album has also been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop. Stereogum's Tom Breihan wrote: [...] "House music didn't quite have critical respect before Björk <b>came</b> <b>along,</b> <b>and</b> plenty of American writers didn't know what to make of the sound of Debut when it came out. [...] Debut didn't just establish Björk; it helped make sounds like that cool to a segment of the music-dork universe that might've remained deaf to its charms otherwise. At this point, it's virtually impossible to imagine a big publication slamming an adventurous dance-pop album for [...] "cheap electronic gimmickry," [...] and Debut is a big part of that change." [...] Celebrating the album's twenty-year anniversary, Emily Mackay of NME wrote the album [...] "put the lie to the post-grunge assumption that heartfelt, passionate solo artistry came in the form of acoustic guitar and heartbreak, creating a new breed of singer-songwriter." [...] Dubbing it an [...] "influential masterpiece", she found influences of the album in the work of musicians such as M.I.A., Grimes, These New Puritans and Tune-Yards, writing: [...] "It's in fascinatingly individual artists like those that you'll find [...] influence — not, as many would have you believe, in every pretty-faced girl with a big voice." [...] Mackay also noted that the album's legacy echoes through dance-pop artists like Lady Gaga and Robyn.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{this success}} of [...] "Vaya con Dios", in 1953 the couple started to host The Les Paul and Mary Ford Show, their own daily {{television}} program broadcast from their Mahwah home. The show, which was five minutes long and sponsored by Listerine, ran from 1953-60 on NBC {{television and in}} syndication. In early 1955, rock and roll <b>came</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> eventually threatened the popularity of many performers including Paul and Ford.

2500|$|Fire was {{a serious}} danger to wooden ships like Liberty, {{particularly}} steamers due to their use of fireboxes and boilers.

[...] The schooner Oregon, tied at the dock and loading cargo, was damaged by the fire.
