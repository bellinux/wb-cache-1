25|$|Type III has {{relatively}} high early strength. Its typical compound composition is: 57% (C3S), 19% (C2S), 10% (C3A), 7% (C4AF), 3.0% MgO, 3.1% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 1.3% free CaO. This cement {{is similar to}} type I, but ground finer. Some manufacturers make a separate clinker with higher C3S and/or C3A content, but this is increasingly rare, and the general purpose clinker is usually used, ground to a specific surface area typically 50–80% higher. The gypsum level may also be increased a small amount. This gives the concrete using this type of cement a three-day <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> equal to the seven-day <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> of types I and II. Its seven-day <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> is almost equal to 28-day compressive strengths of types I and II. The only downside is that the six-month strength of type III is the same or slightly {{less than that of}} types I and II. Therefore, the long-term strength is sacrificed. It is usually used for precast concrete manufacture, where high one-day strength allows fast turnover of molds. It may also be used in emergency construction and repairs, and construction of machine bases and gate installations.|$|E

However, entrained air entails a trade off with strength, as each 1% of air may decrease <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> 5%. If too much air becomes {{trapped in the}} concrete {{as a result of}} the mixing process, Defoamers can be used to encourage the air bubble to agglomerate, rise to the surface of the wet concrete and then disperse.|$|E

25|$|Separate paste mixing {{has shown}} that the mixing of cement and water into a paste before {{combining}} these materials with aggregates can increase the <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> of the resulting concrete. The paste is generally mixed in a high-speed, shear-type mixer at a w/cm (water to cement ratio) of 0.30 to 0.45 by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders, superplasticizers, pigments, or silica fume. The premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment.|$|E
25|$|When {{water is}} mixed with Portland cement, the product sets in a few hours, and hardens {{over a period of}} weeks. These {{processes}} can vary widely, depending upon the mix used and the conditions of curing of the product, but a typical concrete sets in about 6hours and develops a <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> of 8MPa in 24hours. The strength rises to 15MPa at 3days, 23MPa at 1week, 35MPa at 4weeks, and 41MPa at 3months. In principle, the strength continues to rise slowly as long as water is available for continued hydration, but concrete is usually allowed to dry out after a few weeks and this causes strength growth to stop.|$|E
25|$|Bones protect {{internal}} organs, such as {{the skull}} protecting the brain or the ribs protecting the heart and lungs. Because {{of the way that}} bone is formed, bone has a high <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> of about 170 MPa (1800 kgf/cm²), poor tensile strength of 104–121 MPa, and a very low shear stress strength (51.6 MPa). This means that bone resists pushing(compressional) stress well, resist pulling(tensional) stress less well, but only poorly resists shear stress (such as due to torsional loads). While bone is essentially brittle, bone does have a significant degree of elasticity, contributed chiefly by collagen. The macroscopic yield strength of cancellous bone has been investigated using high resolution computer models.|$|E

25|$|The start zone of an {{avalanche}} must be steep {{enough to allow}} snow to accelerate once set in motion, additionally convex slopes are less stable than concave slopes, because of the disparity between the tensile strength of snow layers and their <b>compressive</b> <b>strength.</b> The composition {{and structure of the}} ground surface beneath the snowpack influences the stability of the snowpack, either being a source of strength or weakness. Avalanches are unlikely to form in very thick forests, but boulders and sparsely distributed vegetation can create weak areas deep within the snowpack through the formation of strong temperature gradients. Full-depth avalanches (avalanches that sweep a slope virtually clean of snow cover) are more common on slopes with smooth ground, such as grass or rock slabs.|$|E

The timber {{is used for}} plywood, light construction, pulp and paper, boxes and crates, dug-out canoes, and {{furniture}} components. Kadamba yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a hand sheet. The wood can be easily impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density and <b>compressive</b> <b>strength.</b> The wood has a density of 290–560kg/cu m at 15% moisture content, a fine to medium texture; straight grain; low luster and has no characteristic odor or taste. It is easy to work, with hand and machine tools, cuts cleanly, gives a very good surface and is easy to nail. The timber air dries rapidly {{with little or no}} degrade. Kadamba wood is very easy to preserve using either open tank or pressure-vacuum systems.|$|E
25|$|Degree of {{acetylation}} (DA) for soluble chitosan {{ranges from}} 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions. A {{study was conducted}} to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of chitosan. Varying DA was obtained using acetic anhydride or alkaline hydrolysis. It was found that decreasing acetylation created an increase in <b>compressive</b> <b>strength.</b> Biodegradation was examined by use of lysozyme, which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading chitosan in vivo by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by phagocytic cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied. When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated chitosan, cell viability decreased with increasing DA. Also, chitosan has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion. Thus, controlling the DA of chitosan is important for regulating the degradation time. This knowledge could help {{in the development of a}} nerve guidance conduit from chitosan.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this investigation is to examine how various material properties, governed by code specification, affect the seismic response of a twelve- story reinforced concrete building. This study incorporates the pushover and response history analysis to examine how varying steel yield strength (Fy), 28 day nominal <b>compressive</b> concrete <b>strength</b> (f’c), modes, and ground motions may affect the base shear capacity and displacements of a reinforced concrete structure. Different steel and concrete strengths {{were found to have}} minimal impact on the initial stiffness of the structure. However, during the post-yielding phase, higher steel and concrete <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths</b> resulted in larger base shear capacities of up to 22 %. The base shear capacity geometric median increased as f’c or Fy increased, and the base shear capacity dispersion measure decreased as f’c or Fy increased. Higher mode results were neglected in this study due to non-convergent pushover analyses results. According to the response history analysis, larger yield and concrete <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths</b> result in lower roof displacement. The difference in roof displacement was less than 12 % throughout. This displays the robustness of both analysis methods because material properties have insignificant impact on seismic response. Therefore, acceptable yield and <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths</b> governed by seismic code will result in acceptable building performance...|$|R
