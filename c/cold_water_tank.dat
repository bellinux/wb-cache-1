40|$|Bibliography: leaves 156 - 160. The {{extraction}} of gold from ore {{that has been}} mined {{is the most important}} part of the process which eventually produces gold bullion. The process most commonly used today is that of carbon-in-pulp gold extraction (CIP). One of the main reasons for this is that it is the most economically efficient method of extracting gold from ore. The process uses activated carbon to absorb gold from a cyanide leach solution. Slurry containing the gold bearing ore and the activated carbon flow in a counter-current fashion. This counter-current flow enables a high percentage of the gold to be recovered. Gold can then be recovered through an elution process. Large amounts of activated carbon are used in the process and a formal multi variable control study of the adsorption section of the CIP process could provide further economic savings by extracting more gold with controlled amounts of carbon. A study was performed to identify the chemical mechanisms involved in the adsorption section of a CIP plant. It was felt that the workings of the process could best be established by designing a simple simulator of the process. The simulator was designed with four reactor tanks, in which the carbon absorbs gold from the leached slurry. The simulator uses a continuous transfer of carbon. In order to fully understand the operation of the HERIG, a simulation study was performed. This simulated model was a simplified version of the actual rig. The level changes of <b>COLD</b> <b>water</b> in the <b>tanks</b> were assumed to be instantaneous and the heat transfer coefficients were assumed to be the same for all four of the tanks. The calculation of the heat transfer coefficients was investigated thoroughly and care was taken to obtain accurate values. The simulator designed was a lumped parameter model. The pipes containing the HOT stream were divided into many small section, in each of which a constant temperature was assumed. A sum of the contributions of all the sections submerged under the <b>COLD</b> <b>water</b> was used to calculate the heat transferred into the <b>COLD</b> <b>water.</b> The <b>COLD</b> <b>water</b> in the <b>tank</b> is stirred continuously and is assumed to be at a constant temperature. The level of <b>COLD</b> <b>water</b> in each <b>tank</b> on the HERIG represents the mass of carbon in each of the tanks on a CIP plant. A change in the HOT water pipe temperature (concentration of Au in slurry) was examined as a function of a change in the level of <b>COLD</b> <b>water</b> in a <b>tank</b> (mass of carbon in a reactor). A steady state and dynamic analysis verified that trends observed from the CIP model were in fact mimicked by the trends observed on the HERIG. It was then decided to perform a formal control study of the HERIG, since the numerous similarities found between the CIP and HERIG enabled relevant conclusions to be drawn about the control of CIP from the control of the HERIG...|$|R

Acanthamoeba spp were isolated from water drawn from six bathroom <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> taps (<b>tank</b> supplied), five in the presence of limescale, and from one kitchen <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> tap (mains supplied).

40|$|Protection of our environment, {{and greater}} use of {{renewable}} energy are two major topics discussed throughout the world in recent years. It is imperative that every one understands the importance of leading a sustainable life-style. This project was aimed at utilising solar energy for domestic space heating. A conceptual design of solar wall was proposed. It was suggested that the disadvantages of the Trombe wall could be largely overcome by using heat pipes as a thermal diodes between the solar energy source and the thermal mass of the wall. A computer model of such a wall was developed to predict its performance and this model was used to optimise the geometry and the materials {{in the design of}} the solar panel and the wall into which it was to be incorporated. A prototype panel of this design was manufactured and subjected to an experimental testing program. In the first phase of the testing program the panel was heated by a hot water bath and the heat output was measured in another <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank.</b> As a result of these first tests, some modifications were made to the panel which was then tested again to ensure that it would meet the design requirements. In the second testing phase, the panel was subjected to solar radiation as the heat input, and its behaviour as a solar panel determined and compared with typical flat plate collectors. After obtaining satisfactory results from these experiments, a prototype wall was constructed. To measure the useful space heating effect of the wall, a calorimeter box was constructed on the room side of the wall. Auxiliary equipment and instrumentation enabled monitoring of the net energy requirement of maintaining this box at the same temperature as the surrounding room. Time constraints required that the wall be tested during summer time, but the temperature distribution across the wall and the average energy output from the wall to the room was able to be obtained under these conditions and compared with the predictions of the computer model. From this comparison, the model was modified to match the actual results as closely as possible. The modified model then able to be used to predict the winter performance of the wall. Both quantitative and qualitative conclusions about the wall concept and its performance were able to be drawn, and some recommendations for further work made...|$|E
40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{research}} was to ascertain what effects a temperature increase in the order of 10 degrees to 12 degrees C would have on the near-shore periphyton assemblage of Western Lake Superior. To this end a field station, complete with holding tanks and a hot water source, was constructed on a rock ledge of the Lake Superior shore near Castle Danger, Minnesota. During the summer and fall of 1971 and 1972 periphyton covered rocks from the local area of the lake were placed in the experimental holding tanks where they were exposed to a continuous flow of lake water. In addition, denuded rocks were included as part of a regrowth study. One system provided a flow-through of unheated lake water while in the other the temperature was raised above ambient. Growth patterns were followed under both sets of conditions. Periphyton samples were collected on a weekly basis from the ambient control and heated water tanks and were analyzed for photosynthetic pigment concentration, dray and organic weight and total cell count. A quantitative and qualitative examination of the phyletic distribution of algae from the two systems was emphasized. Some of the more important findings and conclusions were as follows: 1. 	Diatoms were found to be the most prevalent algal type in both heated and cold water tanks. 2. 	Normal populations of Lake Superior periphytic diatoms (control), in terms of percent composition of the entire assemblage, were not greatly altered by the temperature increases used {{during the course of this}} study. 3. 	Three of the most common algal genera; Synedra, Navicula, and Achnanthes, showed essentially no difference in maximum growth levels attained in cold or heated water other than the fact that, in heated regrowth samples, peak concentrations were reached in a shorter period of time. 4. 	Several of the periphytic diatoms common to Lake Superior would continue to survive at temperatures well in excess of normal seasonal maxim. 5. 	Lake Superior contains genera of non-filamentous green algae which have species capable of adapting to extremely high ambient water temperatures. 6. 	The warm water system was more favorable to green filamentous algae, such as Mougeotia and Zygnema, than was the cold water system. 7. 	A prevalent green alga found in Lake Superior, Ulothrix zonata, was inhibited by the warmer water conditions. 8. 	In general, green algae common to Lake Superior are favored by temperatures in excess of those normally found in the lake. 9. 	Under conditions of these experiments blue-green algae did not increase as a result of thermal addition. 10. 	Analysis of pheo-pigments indicated that a substantial amount of “apparent” chlorophyll a was actually pheophytin a, a degradation product. Hence, the pheophytin analysis is important to any study dealing with the chlorophyll content of periphyton. 11. 	Concentrations of pheo-pigments were higher in the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> than in the warm water system. 12. 	Supplementary observations have suggested that a separate invertebrate community occupied each of the tanks. While the above findings and conclusions indicate that a great deal more needs to be learned of the effects of thermal additions on Lake Superior, this study has pointed out that, if near-shore areas of the lake were warmed to the extent that could occur as the result of a thermal-electric generating station discharge, changes in the phyletic composition of the local periphyton community could be expected. The very nature of a change from diatoms to greens could have serious repercussions on benthic grazers and indeed the entire foodweb of the affected area. Water Resources Research Cente...|$|E
