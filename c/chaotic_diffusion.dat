500|$|For {{a system}} where the orbits of Planet Nine and the objects are {{inclined}} the resonant dynamics is more complex, combining extended periods of stable resonances with periods of <b>chaotic</b> <b>diffusion</b> of their semi-major axes. The distance of the closest approaches varies with the inclinations and orientations of the orbits, in some cases weakening the phase protection and allowing close encounters. The close encounters can then alter the object's orbit, producing stochastic jumps in its semi-major axis as it hops between resonances, including higher order resonances. This results in a <b>chaotic</b> <b>diffusion</b> of an object's semi-major axis until it is captured in a new stable resonance and the secular evolution of its orbit removes it from the chaotic region near its boundary.|$|E

40|$|That both {{normal and}} {{anomalous}} <b>chaotic</b> <b>diffusions</b> are suppressed {{by the presence}} of quenched disorder for a large class of maps was established by G. Radons. (1) In this paper, we consider simple maps (which exhibit normal diffusion) modified by discrete disorder. By decomposing the mean square displacement (MSD) sigma(2) (t) of the system into three terms, namely, sigma(2) (t) = sigma(0) (2) (t) + sigma(1) (2) (t) + 2 sigma(01) (t), we find that the MSD of the random walk which corresponds to disorder, sigma(1) (2) (t), enhances that of the original unmodified map, sigma(0) (2) (t) and that the term 2 sigma(01) (t), which describes the correlation between the diffusion fronts of the previous two diffusive processes, just essentially cancels the sum of sigma(0) (2) (t) and sigma(1) (2) (t). In consequence, the trajectories of the system are effectively localized. In this formalism, exact numerical calculations without any round-off error can be achieved, the numerical errors coming only from the limited sampling of the initial conditions...|$|R

The family lies in a particularly interesting region of the phase space, crossed by several two-body and three-body mean motion resonances. Also, members of this family can have close encounters with large asteroids, such as Ceres. We have identified the mean motion resonances which contribute to the long-term dynamical evolution of the family and our results confirm that the members of this family can be classi-fied into a number of groups, exhibiting different dynamical behavior. We show {{for the first time that}} in the Lixiaohua region, apart from the <b>chaotic</b> <b>diffusion</b> in proper eccentricity and inclination (ep and Ip), there is at least one extended chaotic zone where several resonances overlap, thus giving rise to <b>chaotic</b> <b>diffusion</b> in proper semi-major axis (ap) as well. Using a code of Monte Carlo type, we simulate the evolution of the family, according to the model which combines the <b>chaotic</b> <b>diffusion</b> (in ap, ep and Ip), Yarkovsky/YORP thermal effect and random walk in ap due to the close encounters with massive asteroids.

40|$|We {{consider}} the quantum evolution of classically chaotic systems {{in contact with}} surroundings. Based on ¯h-scaling of an equation for time evolution of the Wigner’s quasiprobability distribution function in presence of dissipation and thermal diffusion we derive a semiclassical equation for quantum fluctuations. This identifies an early regime of evolution dominated by fluctuations in the curvature of the potential due to classical chaos and dissipation. A stochastic treatment of this classical fluctuations leads us to a Fokker-Planck equation which is reminiscent of Kramers ’ equation for thermally activated processes. This reveals an interplay of three aspects of evolution of quantum noise in weakly dissipative open systems; the reversible Liouville flow, the irreversible <b>chaotic</b> <b>diffusion</b> which is characteristic of the system itself, and irreversible dissipation induced by the external reservoir. It has been demonstrated that in the dissipation-free case a competition between Liouville flow in the contracting direction of phase space and <b>chaotic</b> <b>diffusion</b> sets a critical width in the Wigner function for quantum fluctuations. We also show how the initial quantum noise gets amplified by classical chaos and ultimately equilibrated {{under the influence of}} dissipation. We establish that there exists a critical limit to the expansion of phase space. The limit is determined by <b>chaotic</b> <b>diffusion</b> and dissipation. Making use of appropriate quantum-classical correspondence we verify the semiclassical analysis by the fully quantum simulation in a chaotic quartic oscillator. 1 I...|$|E
