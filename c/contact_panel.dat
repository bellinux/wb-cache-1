40|$|The multimarket contact {{hypothesis}} {{holds that}} more contacts between firms {{competing in the}} same markets may induce more collusion. This paper tests the hypothesis for the Italian banking market, analysing the behaviour of the largest Italian banks from 1990 to 1996. Market rivalry is gauged by changes in loan market shares and interest rates in each Italian province. Different measures of multimarket contacts are built. We estimate the effects of increasing multimarket contacts, concentration indicators, banksÂ’ costs and loan growth on variations in market shares and interest rates. No support is found for the multimarket contact hypothesis. Geographical overlap in banking is positively correlated with changes in market shares, confirming the thesis of an overall increase in competition within the Italian banking system. Greater multimarket links also seem to correspond to lower lending rates. banks, antitrust policy, multimarket <b>contacts,</b> <b>panel</b> data...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some micro-level {{evidence on}} the role of the socio-demographic characteristics of the population and the characteristics of the data collection process as predictors of survey response. Our evidence is based on the public use files of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), a longitudinal household survey covering the countries of the European Union, whose attractive feature is the high level of comparability across countries and over time. We use individual-level information to predict response in the next wave given response in the current wave, focusing on how the probabilities of contact failure and refusal to cooperate vary with the socio-demographic composition of the national populations and the characteristics of the data collection process. We model the response process as the outcome of two sequential events; (i) the contact between the interviewer and an eligible interviewee, and (ii) the cooperation of the interviewee. Our model allows for dependence between the ease of contact and the propensity to cooperate, taking into account the censoring problem caused by the fact that we observe whether a person is a respondent only if she has been <b>contacted.</b> <b>Panel</b> data, survey response, bivariate probit model. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{sets out}} to answer, experimentally, the {{question}} "how much influence does the contact tightness between steel frame and facings have on the overall thermal resistance of a wall <b>panel?</b> " The <b>contact</b> tightness has been equated to the mean contact gap between those two items. Accurate methods for both control and measurement of this gap have been utilised for this task. The experiment was devised so that precision adjustments to the contact gap could be made externally, and the wall panel was repeatedly adjusted and its thermal resistance measured, with no disturbance to {{any other part of}} the wall. The results showed that the mean contact gap could be adjusted between a mini-mum of 0. 5 mm and a chosen maximum of 3 mm. Variations solely in the tightness of fit between frame and facing (equated here to the mean contact gap) were found to produce up to- 30 % variation (16 % per face), from 1. 30 to 1. 51 m 20 C/W, in the rated R-Values of the test panels studied.

40|$|Of all large space {{structural}} systems, space stations {{present a}} unique challenge and requirement to advanced control technology. Their operations require control system stability over an extremely {{broad range of}} parameter changes and high level of disturbances. During shuttle docking the system mass may suddenly increase by more than 100 % and during station assembly the mass may vary even more drastically. These coupled with the inherent dynamic model uncertainties associated with large space structural systems require highly sophisticated control systems that can grow as the stations evolve and cope with the uncertainties and time-varying elements to maintain the stability and pointing of the space stations. The aspects of space station operational properties are first examined, including configurations, dynamic models, shuttle docking <b>contact</b> dynamics, solar <b>panel</b> interaction, and load reduction to yield a set of system models and conditions. A model reference adaptive control algorithm along with the inner-loop plant augmentation design for controlling the space stations under severe operational conditions of shuttle docking, excessive model parameter errors, and model truncation are then investigated. The instability problem caused by the zero-frequency rigid body modes and a proposed solution using plant augmentation are addressed.

30|$|The {{volume was}} {{originally}} conceived {{in the form}} of an exploratory conference panel, which I organized, and which was sponsored by the Comparative Studies in Religion Section of the American Academy of Religion (AAR) Annual Meeting in 2014 in San Diego, CA. The title of that panel was “Religion at the Crossroads: Experimentation, Innovation, and Change in Hinduisms and Buddhisms as Practiced in Contemporary Asia.” With the exception of the historian of religion John Stratton Hawley, who graciously served in the role of respondent at that annual meeting, all of the participants on that panel have contributed articles to this themed journal collection. Aware that a panel on a topic similar to the one that I had proposed, titled “Being in the Borderlands: The Negotiation of Boundaries in South Asian Religious Communities,” had been held in 2012, at a meeting in conjunction with the annual AAR conference, I consulted with Purushottama Bilimoria, the <b>panel’s</b> <b>contact</b> person, to see if we could combine the papers.

40|$|The {{influences}} of globalization have permeated {{various aspects of}} life in contemporary society, from technical innovations, economic development, and lifestyles, to communication patterns. The present research proposed a construct termed global orientation to denote individual differences in the psychological processes of acculturating to the globalizing world. It encompasses multicultural acquisition as a proactive response and ethnic protection as a defensive response to globalization. Ten studies examined the applicability of global orientations among majority and minority groups, including immigrants and sojourners, in multicultural and relatively monocultural contexts, and across Eastern and Western cultures. Multicultural acquisition is positively correlated with both independent and interdependent self-construals, bilingual proficiency and usage, and dual cultural identifications. Multicultural acquisition is promotion-focused, while ethnic protection is prevention-focused and related to acculturative stress. Global orientations affect individuating and modest behavior over and above multicultural ideology, predict overlap with outgroups over and above political orientation, and predict psychological adaptation, sociocultural competence, tolerance, and attitudes toward ethnocultural groups over and above acculturation expectations/strategies. Global orientations also predict English and Chinese oral presentation performance in multilevel analyses and the frequency and pleasantness of intercultural <b>contact</b> in cross-lagged <b>panel</b> models. We discuss how the psychological study of global orientations contributes to theory and research on acculturation, cultural identity, and intergroup relations.

5000|$|Phone {{connectors}} {{with three}} conductors are also commonly used as unbalanced audio patch points (or insert points, or simply inserts), with the output on many mixers {{found on the}} tip (left channel) and the input on the ring (right channel). This is often expressed as [...] "tip send, ring return". Other mixers have unbalanced insert points with [...] "ring send, tip return". One advantage of this system is that the switch <b>contact</b> within the <b>panel</b> socket, originally designed for other purposes, {{can be used to}} close the circuit when the patch point is not in use. An advantage of the tip send patch point is that if it is used as an output only, a 2-conductor mono phone plug correctly grounds the input. In the same fashion, use of a [...] "tip return" [...] insert style allows a mono phone plug to bring an unbalanced signal directly into the circuit, though in this case the output must be robust enough to withstand being grounded. Combining send and return functions via single [...] in TRS connectors in this way is seen in very many professional and semi-professional audio mixing desks, due to the halving of space needed for insert jack fields which would otherwise need two jacks, one for send and one for return. The tradeoff is that unbalanced signals are more prone to buzz, hum and outside interference.|$|R

This systematic review investigated whether domestic VOC exposure {{increases the risk}} of developing and/or exacerbating asthma and allergic disorders. We systematically searched 11 databases and three trial repositories, and <b>contacted</b> an international <b>panel</b> of experts to identify published and unpublished experimental and epidemiological studies. 8455 potentially relevant studies were identified; 852 papers were removed after de-duplication, leaving 7603 unique papers that were screened. Of these, 278 were reviewed in detail and 53 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Critical appraisal of the included studies indicated an overall lack of high-quality evidence and substantial risk of bias in this body of knowledge. Aromatics (i. e. benzenes, toluenes and xylenes) and formaldehyde were the main VOC classes studied, both in relation to the development and exacerbations of asthma and allergy. Approximately equal numbers of studies reported that exposure increased risks and that exposure was not associated with any detrimental effects. The available evidence implicating domestic VOC exposure in the risk of developing and/or exacerbating asthma and allergy is of poor quality and inconsistent. Prospective, preferably experimental studies, investigating the impact of reducing/eliminating exposure to VOC, are now needed in order to generate a more definitive evidence base to inform policy and clinical deliberations in relation to the management of the now substantial sections of the population who are either at risk of developing asthma/allergy or living with established disease...|$|R

The first section defines reputation, its attributes and dimensions. The second section describes previous studies and processes to measure reputation. The third section describes the situation and particular characteristics of Latin America and Venezuela and describes how is understood the reputation in the region. The last section analyzes the principal values found in the studied countries and related those with the Hofstede’s cultural differences indexes. My practical research was based on previous studies of Pohjoisranta Oy and emphasis in the opinions of different specialists and professionals in Venezuela. The research was divided into two parts. For the first part, I used qualitative and quantitative methods. The sample was selected intentionally. I <b>contacted</b> a <b>panel</b> of Venezuelan specialists to adapt the questionnaire to Venezuelan context. For the second part, the research method used was quantitative. I contacted Venezuelan professionals who evaluated the values of reputation (attributes). In order to study {{the relation between the}} values it was used factor analysis. In the initial factor analysis was applied the extraction Method principal axis factoring. For the final factor analysis, the factor extraction method was maximum likelihood. A good reputation in Venezuela is based on six categories: Corporate Culture and Leadership, Community Responsibility, Financial Excellence, Public Image, Operational Dynamics. Later, I made a briefly comparison between Venezuela and the others countries based Hofstede’s indexes. There are many similar values between the countries especially between Finland, Sweden and Venezuela. Latvia shows more differences. But the results do not show clear relations between cultural differences and reputation attributes and dimensions. These results leave plenty a room for discussion and future investigations and it invites to combine different methods to analyze corporate reputation in different perspectives in the future.

Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of orally administered H 1 -antihistamines {{in the treatment of}} primary MCAS compared with placebo and other pharmacologic treatments. Methods We systematically searched five databases and three trial repositories and <b>contacted</b> an international <b>panel</b> of experts to identify published and unpublished trials. Results A total of 36 potentially relevant studies were identified. Of these, five crossover trials, enrolling a total of 71 patients (63 adults), met the eligibility criteria. All five of these studies were judged to be at moderate or high risk of bias. Two studies compared an H 1 -antihistamine with placebo, two compared two different H 1 -antihistamines, and one study compared H 1 - and H 2 -antihistamines with oral cromolyn sodium. Four of the five randomized controlled trials were historic (reported from 1983 – 1993), small (enrolling 8 – 15 patients), and used agents and/or dosing regimens that are now less commonly used in clinical practice (i. e. azelastine, chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine, and ketotifen). The fifth trial, which enrolled 33 adults with cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis found 4 weeks of treatment with the second-generation H 1 -antihistamine rupatadine, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvements in quality of life, symptom control (itching, wheals and flares, flushing, tachycardia, and headache, but not gastrointestinal symptoms), and reduction in itching and whealing after standardized skin provocation to elicit Darier's sign.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the idea of}} providing sound insulation of the room by using a magnetic suspension. It {{is based on the}} invention of the Abrakitov V. E. : sound bridge problem is solved by the avoidance of mechanical <b>contact</b> between the <b>panel</b> and the main structure by a magnetic suspension of sound-insulating vacuum panel. The problem is considered on the example of the cabin for private talks. The implementation of sound insulation from airborne sound is technically uncomplicated task, but there are some problems with the structural component of the sound - the sound energy transfer from box floor to office floor and further through the building structures, sometimes at great distance. Modern methods of eavesdropping can use successfully this way. This paper suggests using a magnetic suspension in soundproof rectangular cabins for confidential talks, which excludes leakage of speech information by more effective isolation of the structural sound. If it is necessary to stop the voice information leakage fundamentally by both air sound and structural sound ways, the authors propose to make a cabin from two steel spherical shells, exhausting all air between the walls and supporting the inner shell by the magnetic suspension in suspended condition. In addition, a spherical cabin is the only effective way of isolation from infrasound. The proposed soundproof rectangular and spherical cabins for confidential talks should be designed, manufactured and tested by experts in the field of acoustic, magnetic suspension, autonomous air regeneration and providing a vacuum.

For a given material the model requires a significant amount of testing to determine the yield stress and failure strain as a function of the three-dimensional state of stress, strain rate and temperature. In addition, experiments are required to validate the model. Currently the model has been developed for Aluminum 2024 and validated against a series of ballistic impact tests on flat plates of various thicknesses (Refs. 1 to 3). Full development of the model for Titanium 6 Al- 4 V is being completed, and mechanical testing for Inconel 718 has begun. The validation testing for the models involves ballistic impact tests using cylindrical projectiles impacting flat plates at a normal incidence (Ref. 2). By varying the thickness of the plates, different stress states and resulting failure modes are induced, providing a range of conditions over which the model can be validated. The objective of the study reported here was to provide experimental data to evaluate the model under more extreme conditions, using a projectile with a more complex shape and sharp <b>contacts,</b> impacting flat <b>panels</b> at oblique angles of incidence...|$|R
40|$|Transparent {{conducting}} oxides (TCOs) {{are important}} materials widely used for transparent <b>contacts</b> in flat <b>panel</b> displays, light emitting diodes, and solar cells. While Sn-doped In 2 O 3 (ITO) {{continues to be}} the TCO of choice, the increasing cost of raw In has resulted in an increasing interest in developing In-free alternatives to ITO. In this work, two metal oxide systems were investigated for their viability as In-free TCO materials;First, Nb- or Ta-doped anatase TiO 2 was selected due to the recent reports of high conductivity in pulse laser deposited (PLD) films. Thin films doped with either 15 mol% Nb or 20 mol% Ta were deposited on glass and SrTiO 3 (STO) substrates using RF magnetron sputtering techniques. In all cases, maximum conductivity was achieved when the films crystallized in the anatase structure of TiO 2. Films sputtered on STO possessed similar electrical and optical properties as PLD films on STO, yet at a much lower deposition temperature while films deposited on glass had much lower conductivity, due to dramatically reduced mobility. Two-dimensional x-ray diffraction analysis showed that doped TiO 2 films sputter deposited on STO were biaxially textured along the (004) direction. This texturing was not observed in films deposited on glass, which were composed of randomly-oriented crystalline anatase. Biaxial texturing in the film helps to reduce grain boundary resistance, thereby increasing carrier mobility and further enhancing conductivity;The Cu-based delafossite system (CuBO 2, B is a 3 + metal cation) was selected as the second TCO material system due to its natural p-type conductivity, a rarity among existing TCOs. Study of this system was two-pronged: (1) application of codoping techniques to achieve bipolar conductivity; and (2) investigate stability of mixed B cation delafossites. CuAlO 2 and CuGaO 2 were both codoped with varying ratios of donors and acceptors in an attempt to achieve bipolar conductivity. Very little change in the electrical properties of the two materials was observed. Synthesis of multiple mixed B cation delafossite compositions was attempted. Through the course of investigation, it was determined that stability of the delafossite phase is likely controlled by the electrical properties of the metal cations...|$|R

This BHPS teaching/sampler dataset contains only Wave 1 respondents, and follows them for 13 waves, selecting broadly the same variables at each wave. There are some (fixed) variables which are only included at wave one, {{and there are a}} few variables which only appear intermittently, or are introduced later in the panel. The dataset contains a mix of original variables and derived variables. In order to reduce the complexity of the data's structure and to make the data more accessible to inexperienced users, the dataset is in a rectangular format. Users are not required to undertake potentially problematic record/file merges in order to analyse the data longitudinally. Variable names are the same as those in the original BHPS dataset such that variables are prefixed A for Wave 1, B for Wave 2, C for Wave 3 and so on. For example, the variable EAGE records the respondent's age at the date of the Wave 5 interview. The main BHPS is carried out by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex. The main objective of the survey is to further understanding of social and economic change at the individual and household level in Britain, to identify, model and forecast such changes, their causes and consequences in relation to a range of socio-economic variables. The BHPS is designed as a research resource {{for a wide range of}} social science disciplines and to support interdisciplinary research in many areas. The unique value of the survey resides in that fact that: it follows the same representative sample of individuals (the panel) over a period of years it is household-based, interviewing every adult member of sampled households it contains sufficient cases for meaningful analysis of certain groups such as the elderly or one parent families it allows for linkage of data both from other surveys and from local area statistics The BHPS was designed as an annual survey of each adult (aged 16 +) member of a nationally representative sample of more than 5, 000 households, making a total of approximately 10, 000 individual interviews. The same individuals are re-interviewed in successive waves and, if they split off from original households, all adult members of their new households are also interviewed. Children are interviewed once they reach the age of 16, and there is also a special survey of 11 - 15 year old household members from Wave 4. Efficient fieldwork practices, training videos for interviewers and regular <b>contact</b> with the <b>panel</b> members ensures that the sample remains broadly representative of the population as it changes over time. For the second edition (November 2011), erroneous syntax used to match files across waves has now been corrected. Main Topics : This dataset is the third BHPS sampler. It is based around the theme of time use, leisure activity and membership of social organisations and allows for respondents' behaviour to be tracked over time. A complete list of variables is included in the documentation. The first BHPS teaching dataset covered the themes of work, family and health, and the second covered social and political attitudes. They are both available at the UK Data Archive (UKDA) under SNs 4901 and 5038 respectively...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} cryostat {{has been}} developed for cooling a wide panel evenly over its surface to a temperature of - 423 F (approximately equal to - 253 C) by use of liquid helium. Originally, the cryostat was {{to be used in}} measuring apparent strains in wide aluminum/lithium panels as functions of temperature in order to develop data for temperature compensation of the readings of strain gauges on a tank containing liquid hydrogen. Relative to the cryostat used previously for this purpose, the improved cryostat can be prepared for a test in less time, and it loses less helium during each test. Each wide panel to be tested is instrumented with thermocouples in preparation for a test. The previous cryostat was made of two aluminum halves that, for each test, were sandwiched together and sealed around the instrumented wide panel to be tested. The panel was thus enclosed in a plenum. The cryostat and adjacent panel areas protruding from the cryostat were then coated with a thermally insulating foam. During a test, liquid helium was made to flow into the plenum through a port on the bottom. The helium vaporized and expanded, filling the plenum with cold helium gas, which eventually flowed out of the plenum through a port on the top. The nature of the flow was such that {{a significant portion of the}} helium did not come into contact with the wide panel; hence, cooling was less efficient than it might otherwise have been. After completion of each test, the foam and the cryostat were separated from the panel. The cryostat was cleaned and prepared for installation on another instrumented wide panel for the next test. It took 28 hours to install the cryostat onto the instrumented panel, apply the foam, and perform ancillary operations in preparation for a test. The volume of liquid helium consumed during each test was 750 liters. The improved cryostat (see figure) includes an upper section and a lower section, both of which include permanent housings made of a thermally insulating foam 2 -in. (approximately equal to 5 -cm) thick. A liquid-helium- injection manifold is attached to the inside of the top section. The bottom section includes an outlet for helium gas. The manifold contains slots that, when the cryostat is installed on the panel, are located approximately 1 in. (approximately equal to 2. 5 cm) from the wide panel. The array of slots spans a substantial portion of the area of the panel. The top and bottom sections of the cryostat are sealed to the panel by use of polytetrafluoroethylene cord and aluminum tape. Liquid helium is fed into the manifold from the top. The helium leaves the manifold through the slots and thus impinges directly on the panel. Hence, all the helium entering the cryostat must come into <b>contact</b> with the <b>panel</b> before leaving the cryostat. After a test, the cryostat is removed from the panel and reinstalled onto another panel for the next test. Installation of the cryostat on an instrumented panel takes a negligible amount of time, in comparison with the 28 hours associated with the previous cryostat. The amount of liquid helium consumed during a test in the improved cryostat is 500 liters - 250 liters less than before...|$|R
