This cross-sectional linked database study involved secondary quantitative analysis of 1903 participants from wave 1 of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing with available pharmacy claims data. Cognitive impairment was assessed using a cut-off of ≤ 23 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> use was calculated using the proportion of days covered for antihypertensive, antithrombotic, and lipid-modifying medications. For each class of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication,</b> participants were categorized as belonging {{to one of three}} medication use groups: (1) not dispensed any medications (reference); (2) poor adherence (proportion of days covered < 80 %); and (3) good adherence (proportion of days covered ≥ 80 %). Controlling for demographic and health variables, {{there was no evidence of}} an independent association between impaired cognitive function and use of antihypertensives [good adherence OR (95 % CI) : 1. 16 (0. 88, 1. 52), poor adherence OR (95 % CI) : 1. 39 (0. 95, 2. 04) ]; antithrombotics [good adherence OR (95 % CI) : 1. 26 (0. 93, 1. 70), poor adherence OR 95 % CI) : 1. 13 (0. 80, 1. 59) ]; or lipid-modifying agents [good adherence OR (95 % CI) : 0. 95 (0. 71, 1. 25), poor adherence OR (95 % CI) : 0. 88 (0. 64, 1. 22) ].

40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed in {{clinical}} practice that drug treatment associated with hypotension {{can result in}} falls and syncope, but there is actually very little evidence to support this. Therefore the data in all patients whose <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> were stopped at a falls/syncope clinic were analysed to see if their symptoms were altered and if renewal of these medications was necessary at subsequent visits.  Of 338  consecutive referrals, <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> had been stopped in 65  (19 %). At follow up 78 % reported improvement in their original presenting symptoms and renewal of medication was not necessary in 77 % off antianginals, 69 % off antihypertensives, and 36 % off antiarrhythmics. It was concluded that adjusting <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> could help {{in the management of}} falls and syncope and may obviate the need for other treatment.

40|$|Objective: There {{are limited}} number of studies {{describing}} the reasons and interventions of non-adherence to <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> in United Arab Emirates (UAE). We aimed to implement and evaluate the behavioral and educational tools that indicate the reasons of non-adherence in patients with cardiovascular diseases and improve patient’s adherence to their <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications.</b> Methods: In this prospective interventional study, we recruited patients (n =  300) with cardiovascular diseases from three family medicine clinics in Al Ain, UAE in 2010. We assessed patients’ responses to a validated brief medication questionnaire (BMQ). Results: At {{the end of the}} study, we observed a significant improvement in adherence. When we compared pre- and post-interventions, the mean (± standard deviation, SD) score for non-adherence to current regimen were 4. 1  ±  0. 2 vs. 3. 0  ±  0. 3 (p =  0. 034); indication of negative believes or motivational barriers scores was 1. 8  ±  0. 4 vs. 0. 9  ±  0. 1 (p =  0. 027); the indication of recall barrier scores was 1. 6  ±  0. 1 vs. 0. 8  ±  0. 1 (p =  0. 014); and the indication of access barrier scores was 1. 6  ±  0. 2 vs. 0. 7  ±  0. 2 (p =  0. 019).

40|$|The use of <b>{{cardiovascular}}</b> <b>medications</b> {{can have}} a variety of neuropsychiatric consequences. Many cardiovascular agents cause higher rates of fatigue and sedation than placebo, and case reports of medication-induced mood syndromes, psychosis, and cognitive disturbances exist for many cardiovascular drugs.

40|$|Objective:To {{assess whether}} the {{difference}} in risk of cardiovascular mortality between {{urban and rural areas}} of Serbia could be explained by differences in the use of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication.</b> Methods: The Serbian cohorts of the Seven Countries Study, Velika Krsna (VK), Zrenjanin (ZR) and Belgrade (BG), were enrolled in 1962 - 1964 and were followed up for 25 years. The survivors of these cohorts were re-examined in 1987, 1988 and 1989, respectively. This second examination of elderly men aged 65 to 84 years included a questionnaire about current use of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication,</b> risk factors and diseases and a physical examination. All subjects were followed until death or the predefined censor date (10 years after baseline). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate the risk of cardiovascular mortality in the rural cohorts compared to the urban cohort and to adjust for confounding. Main outcome measure: Cardiovascular death. Results: A total of 227 men from VK, 184 men from ZR and 287 men from BG were followed for a mean duration of 7. 4 years and was complete for all subjects. After exclusion of 13 subjects with missing medication data, the incidences of cardiovascular mortality in VK, ZR, and BG were 60, 74, and 26 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The prevalence of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> use was 38 % in VK, 52 % in ZR, and 59 % in BG. The greatest difference in use of specific medication was observed for betablockers (0 % in VK and ZR, 13 % in BG). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, diseases and age, the relative risks (RRs) of cardiovascular mortality were 2. 12 [95 % CI: 1. 44 ¿ 3. 12], and 2. 27 [95 % CI: 1. 56 ¿ 3. 30] in VK, and ZR compared to BG. Additional adjustment for the use of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> increased these RRs to 2. 40 [95 % CI: 1. 61 ¿ 3. 60] and 2. 55 [95 % CI: 1. 72 ¿ 3. 78], respectively.

40|$|Objective: Psychiatric {{disorders}} {{are associated with}} an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and may result in additional risk of non-adherence. No data on the influence of concomitant psychiatric drug use on patients' beliefs and persistence related to <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> are available. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess to what extent the use of concomitant psychiatric drugs is associated with patients' beliefs about and persistence with chronic <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication.</b> Methods: An observational study in patients using <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> was conducted. A mailed questionnaire containing socio-demographical questions and a measure of beliefs about medication (Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire - specific) was sent to patients selected from fifteen participating pharmacies. Persistence was evaluated based on pharmacy records. Results: Of the 1547 included patients, 551 responded to key questions in the questionnaire and were included for beliefs about medication analysis. In concomitant users of psychiatric drugs significantly higher necessity (17. 0 vs. 16. 0) and higher concerns (14. 3 vs. 13. 3), as well as higher proportion of ambivalent (34. 5 % vs. 25. 6 %) and lower proportion of indifferent patients (24. 1 % vs. 33. 0 %) were found compared with non-users (p &# 60; 0. 05). 65. 2 % (n = 1009) of patients were persistent on all their cardiovascular drugs. There was no significant association between concomitant use of psychiatric drugs and non-persistence (OR = 1. 2; 95 % CI 0. 9 - 1. 5).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{correlates of}} laboratory monitoring errors in elderly {{health maintenance organization}} (HMO) members at the initiation of therapy with <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications.</b> DESIGN: Cross-sectional study in 10 HMOs. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: From a 2 million-member sample, individuals aged 65 and older who received one of seven <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), amiodarone, digoxin, diuretics, potassium supplements, and statins) {{and did not have}} recommended baseline monitoring performed during the 180 days before or 14 days after the index dispensing. MEASUREMENTS: The proportion of members receiving each drug for whom recommended laboratory monitoring was not performed. Laboratory monitoring error rates stratified by sex, age group, chronic disease score, and HMO site were examined, and logistic regression was used to identify predictors of laboratory monitoring errors. RESULTS: Error rates varied by medication class, ranging from 23 % of patients receiving potassium supplementation without serum potassium and serum creatinine monitoring to 58 % of patients receiving amiodarone who did not have recommended monitoring for thyroid and liver function. Highest error rates occurred in the youngest elderly for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, digoxin, diuretics, and potassium supplements, although in patients receiving amiodarone and statins, errors were most frequent in the oldest elderly. Errors occurred more frequently in patients with less comorbidity.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of prescription medication use among older people increases with advancing age and {{is related to}} their comorbidities. <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> is the medication category {{that is the most}} commonly prescribed.

The treatment was simplified after consultation considering the number of medication classes, drugs, and pills. Adverse effect (11 % of consultations) is the main reason for interrupting a medication. The number of medication before consultation is an important factor to decide whether the treatment needs to be simplified. The medication cost is not modified.

OBJECTIVE: To examine how many patients with an indication for treatment with <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> can be identified by ad hoc case-finding when all patients with overweight/obesity are invited for risk assessment. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the baseline measurements of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, a population-based prospective cohort study in 6673 persons aged 45 - 65 years. We calculated the proportion of participants with a treatment indication using the risk prediction Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE-NL 2011), for lean, overweight and obese participants. Participants {{with a history of}} cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or rheumatoid arthritis or using <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> were not eligible for ad hoc case-finding because they were already identified as being at risk and/or had been treated. RESULTS: Of the study population, 30 % had already been identified and/or treated with <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> and were therefore not eligible for ad hoc case-finding. Of the eligible participants, 47 % were lean, 41 % overweight and 12 % obese.

40|$|Recently, drug {{interactions}} with grapefruit juice (GFJ) have received considerable attention from basic scientists, physicians, industry and drug regulatory agencies. GFJ {{has been shown}} to inhibit cytochrome P- 450 3 A 4 isoenzyme and P-glycoprotein transporters in the intestine and liver. The GFJ-induced inhibitory effects are considered to be responsible for alterations in drug bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes when drugs are ingested concurrently with GFJ. However, little or no interaction is observed when GFJ is taken concomitantly with parentally administered drugs. It is well known that risk factors for cardiovascular disease increase with advancing age, while hepatic metabolic activity decreases in elderly individuals. It is, therefore, possible that the combination of GFJ and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> may pose a health risk, especially in elderly patients. A number of studies have shown interactions of GFJ with cardiovascular drugs such as calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, and statins. Such interactions are likely to change the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs, consequently causing undesirable health effects. Therefore, health care professionals and the public need to be advised of the potential risks associated with the concomitant use of GFJ and interacting <b>medications,</b> especially <b>cardiovascular</b> drugs and agents with a narrow therapeutic index. This review focuses on the adverse interactions of GFJ and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications,</b> and the proposed underlying mechanisms of such interactions...|$|R

BackgroundChronic kidney disease is now recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. We sought to determine if cardiovascular medications were utilized less in patients with renal dysfunction following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and if the association of decreased medication use was independent of comorbid conditions. We also examined associations between <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> use and mortality at 6 months. MethodsData from the National Veterans Adminstration (VA) Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program were merged with the national VA pharmacy database. Prescription rates within 6 months of discharge for CABG were obtained for four classes of medicines: beta blockers, lipid-lowering agents, antiplatelet agents, and angiotensin antagonists. Utilization of medications in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 60 to 90, 30 to 60, and 90. ResultsIn a retrospective analysis of 19, 411 patients, the frequency of nonprescription increased with declining GFR. Decreased utilization for patients with GFR 30 to 60 and < 30 remained highly significant after adjustment for age, race, hypertension, diabetes, and prior myocardial infarction. In patients with more advanced renal dysfunction (GFR < 60), <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> use for all medication classes was associated with survival at 6 months after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Cumulative protection was seen with use of medication from each additional class. ConclusionIn a large VA population undergoing CABG, renal disease is associated with highly significant decreases in utilization of cardiovascular medications. Nonprescription of medications was associated with adverse outcomes in those with renal dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|In general practice, {{it is too}} {{time-consuming}} {{to invite}} all patients for cardiovascular risk assessment. To examine how many patients with an indication for treatment with <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> can be identified by ad hoc case-finding when all patients with overweight/obesity are invited for risk assessment. A cross-sectional analysis of the baseline measurements of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, a population-based prospective cohort study in 6673 persons aged 45 - 65 years. We calculated the proportion of participants with a treatment indication using the risk prediction Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE-NL 2011), for lean, overweight and obese participants. Participants {{with a history of}} cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or rheumatoid arthritis or using <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> were not eligible for ad hoc case-finding because they were already identified as being at risk and/or had been treated. Of the study population, 30 % had already been identified and/or treated with <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> and were therefore not eligible for ad hoc case-finding. Of the eligible participants, 47 % were lean, 41 % overweight and 12 % obese. Of the participants with overweight, 12 % had a treatment indication and of the participants with obesity, 19 % had a treatment indication. Of all participants with a treatment indication 24 % were not yet treated. Of all participants with a new treatment indication, 70 % had overweight or obesity. Of the participants with a treatment indication, 24 % were not yet treated. Inviting patients with overweight/obesity for cardiovascular risk assessment may help to detect 70 % of these residual patients with a treatment indicatio...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the 5 -yr prevalence and incidence rates of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> and cardiovascular disease {{before and after}} onset of type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) in children and adolescents. METHODS: Children and adolescents (< 19 [*]yr) with T 1 D (n[*]=[*] 925), defined as those who received at least two insulin prescriptions, and a four times larger reference cohort (n[*]=[*] 3591) with the same age and gender in the Dutch PHARMO Record Linkage System (RLS) were studied in a retrospective cohort study between 1999 and 2009. The date of first insulin dispensing {{was selected as the}} index date. RESULTS: The overall prevalence rate of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> use was substantially higher in the T 1 D cohort before (2. 2 vs. 1. 0 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and after (9. 2 vs. 3. 2 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) the index date. After the index date angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (2. 0 %) and statins (1. 5 %) were the most prevalent cardiovascular medications in the T 1 D cohort. The highest incidence rate of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> use was observed in the first year after the index date [28. 1 per 1000 person years (PY) ]. Furthermore, three type 1 diabetic patients were hospitalized due to cardiomyopathy (n[*]=[*] 2) and heart failure (n[*]=[*] 1) and one child from the reference group was hospitalized due to cardiomyopathy in the 5 [*]yr after the index date. CONCLUSIONS: Children with T 1 D were more likely to use cardiovascular medications in the years before and after the onset of diabetes. Our study emphasizes the importance of routine screening tests and timely treatment of CVD risk factors in the pediatric population with diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Ischaemic {{heart disease}} and {{congestive}} heart failure are common and important conditions in family practice. Effective treatments may be underutilized, particularly in women and the elderly. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the rate of prescribing of evidence-based <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> and determine if these differed by patient age or sex. Methods We conducted a two-year cross-sectional study involving all hospitals in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Subjects were all patients admitted with ischaemic heart disease with or without congestive heart failure between 15 October 1997 and 14 October 1999. The main measure was the previous outpatient use of recommended medications. Chi-square analyses followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine age-sex differences. Results Usage of recommended medications varied from approximately 60 % for beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to 90 % for antihypertensive agents. Patients aged 75 and over were significantly less likely than younger patients to be taking any of the medication classes. Following adjustment for age, there were no significant differences in medication use by sex except among women aged 75 and older who were more likely to be taking beta-blockers than men in the same age group. Conclusions The use of evidence-based <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> is rising and perhaps approaching reasonable levels for some drug classes. Family physicians should ensure that all eligible patients (prior myocardial infarction, congestive failure) are offered beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} {{a leading cause of}} death {{worldwide}} (Kishore et al., 2011), therefore how to prevent and treat this condition is of great importance to health care professionals and patients. Patients struggle to afford these medications which can ultimately influence their health outcome. Treatment of cardiovascular disease conditions may require several drugs and this causes an increase in health cost to the patient (Burapadaja Siriporn et al., 2007). The promotion of the use of generic medication and generic substitution is seen as one of the approaches to improve access to <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> (Kishore et al., 2011; Kesselheim et al., 2008). Generic medications {{play an important role in}} reducing health care costs and in increasing access to healthcare. A large number of branded or innovator drugs and molecules are no longer protected by their patents or will be reaching patent expiration soon. Therefore there is an increased interest in research on generic drug competition and its effect on the market. Once generics enter the market, they have many effects on areas such as market share, prices and quantities sold (Gonzalez et al., 2008). The objective of this study was to determine the usage patterns of generic <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> and possible cost savings that can be achieved by maximum generic substitution in the private community pharmacy health care environment in the Johannesburg area. Ten oral solid drug pairs experiencing generic substitution were investigated at four private community pharmacies that provided pharmaceutical products and services. The study was a quantitative, retrospective study of medical claims. Data on computerized drug claims were provided by a South African pharmaceutical service provider. Data was extracted and analysed of patients who receive one or more cardiovascular drugs for the period of June 2009 to May 2011. The results of this study showed that the <b>cardiovascular</b> (CVS) <b>medications</b> under study accounted for 21 817 of the total number of 282 109 items dispensed at all pharmacies for the study period which equals to 7. 7...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{examine whether}} {{arterial}} stiffness {{is a risk}} factor for falls in community-dwelling older people. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Community population, Sydney, Australia. Participants Community-dwelling older adults (mean age 79. 8 ± 4. 4, 52. 2 % female; N = 481). Measurements Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured in the supine position after lying for 10 minutes. Demographic, medical, and medication characteristics and levels of physical activity were obtained in clinical interviews and questionnaires, and falls were recorded with monthly falls diaries for 12 months. Results Participants in the top quintile of PWV (high PWV) {{were more likely to have}} higher seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate, unsatisfactory control of blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and lower physical activity levels. These participants were also more likely to be male and taking <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications.</b> Of the 473 participants available for follow-up, 212 (44. 8 %) reported one or more falls. In modified Poisson regression analyses, high PWV was {{a risk factor for}} falls (relative risk = 1. 37, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 06 - 1. 78) after adjusting for use of psychotropic and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications,</b> age, sex, body mass index, seated SBP, heart rate, and diabetes status. Conclusion In community-dwelling older people, high PWV (as a measure of arterial stiffness) was a risk factor for falls after adjusting for potential demographic, anthropometric, disease, and medication confounders. Further research is required to investigate mediators for this association and the effect of lowering arterial stiffness on falls in older people. © 2014, The American Geriatrics Society...|$|R
40|$|Does present use of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> reflect {{elevated}} cardiovascular risk scores estimated {{ten years}} ago? A population based longitudinal observational study Mette Brekke 1 *, Jørund Straand 1, 2 Background: It is desirable that those {{at highest risk}} of cardiovascular disease should have priority for preventive measures, eg. treatment with prescription drugs to modify their risk. We wanted to investigate to what extent present use of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medication</b> (CVM) correlates with cardiovascular risk estimated by three different risk scores (Framingham, SCORE and NORRISK) ten years ago. Methods: Prospective logitudinal observational study of 20 252 participants in The Hordaland Health Study born 1950 - 57, not using CVM in 1997 - 99. Prescription data obtained from The Norwegian Prescription Database in 2008. Results: 26 % of men and 22 % of women aged 51 - 58 years had started to use some CVM during the previous decade. As a group, persons using CVM {{scored significantly higher on}} the risk algorithms Framingham, SCORE and NORRISK compared to those not treated. 16 - 20 % of men and 20 - 22 % of women with risk scores below the highris...|$|E

40|$|Background Exercise {{rehabilitation}} {{is highly}} recommended by current guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease, but its implementation is still poor. Many clinicians experience difficulties in prescribing {{exercise in the}} presence of different concomitant cardiovascular diseases and risk factors within the same patient. It was aimed to develop a digital training and decision support system for exercise prescription in cardiovascular disease patients in clinical practice: the European Association of Preventive Cardiology Exercise Prescription in Everyday Practice and Rehabilitative Training (EXPERT) tool. Methods EXPERT working group members were requested to define (a) diagnostic criteria for specific cardiovascular diseases, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and other chronic non-cardiovascular conditions, (b) primary goals of exercise intervention, (c) disease-specific prescription of exercise training (intensity, frequency, volume, type, session and programme duration), and (d) exercise training safety advices. The impact of exercise tolerance, common <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> and adverse events during exercise testing were further taken into account for optimized exercise prescription. Results Exercise training recommendations and safety advices were formulated for 10 cardiovascular diseases, five cardiovascular disease risk factors (type 1 and 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia), and three common chronic non-cardiovascular conditions (lung and renal failure and sarcopaenia), but also accounted for baseline exercise tolerance, common <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> and occurrence of adverse events during exercise testing. An algorithm, supported by an interactive tool, was constructed based on these data. This training and decision support system automatically provides an exercise prescription according to the variables provided. Conclusion This digital training and decision support system may contribute in overcoming barriers in exercise implementation in common cardiovascular diseases...|$|R
40|$|Background : Patient {{participation}} in medication management during hospitalization {{is thought to}} reduce medication errors and, following discharge, improve adherence and therapeutic use of medications. There is, however, limited understanding of how patients participate in their medication management while hospitalized. Objective : To explore patient {{participation in}} the context of medication management during a hospital admission for a cardiac surgical intervention of patients with cardiovascular disease. Design : Single institution, case study design. The unit of analysis was a cardiothoracic ward of a major metropolitan, tertiary referral hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Multiple methods of data collection were used including pre-admission and pre-discharge patient interviews (n = 98), naturalistic observations (n = 48) and focus group interviews (n = 2). Results : All patients had changes made to their pre-operative <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> as a consequence of surgery. More patients were able to list and state the purpose and side-effects of their <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> at pre-admission than prior to discharge from hospital. There was very little evidence that nurses used opportunities such as medication administration times to engage patients in medication management during hospital admission. Discussion and Conclusions : Failure to engage patients in medication management and provide opportunities for patients to learn about changes to their medications has implications for the quality and safety of care patients receive in hospital and when managing their medications once discharged. To increase the opportunity for patients to participate in medication management, a fundamental shift in the way nurses currently provide care is required...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. A {{large number}} of {{medicinal}} drugs used in cardiology have been related {{to a variety of}} side effects in the lungs. The list of such drugs has increased as new drugs have been introduced in recent years. Lung disease due to medication may appear as parenchymal disease, angeitis, or mediastinal disease. Airway injury may be caused by medication, giving rise to cough, bronchospasm, and obstructive bronchiolitis. In addition, systemic reactions such as lupus erythematosus are commonly observed in conjunction with lung injury. In this review, the side effects on the respiratory system of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medications</b> are described, with an emphasis on the nosological entities that are most frequently observed.
