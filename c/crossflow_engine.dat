50|$|Furthermore, the Kent <b>Crossflow</b> <b>engine</b> {{was used}} as the {{regulation}} engine in Formula Ford, although it was originally proposed to be the pre-crossflow 1498 cc Cortina GT unit in 1967 (before the establishment of the series). In Europe, Formula Ford switched to the Zetec, but American Formula Ford continued to be Kent-powered until 2010; the SCCA having approved the use of the Honda L15A i-VTEC for Formula F.|$|E
25|$|The Bluebird 810 {{was sold}} in export markets as the Datsun 160B, Datsun 180B, Datsun 200B and Datsun 810. Australian {{magazine}} Wheels called the 200B 'a 180B with 20 more mistakes.' In Japan the range gradually received upgraded motors which could pass the 1978 emissions standards; these models carry 811 series chassis numbers, with Japanese market vehicles were installed with a NAPS badge on the rear deckled that identified emission control technology having been installed. This process began in October 1977 and continued until August 1978. This meant replacing the earlier L-series engines with the new <b>crossflow</b> Z <b>engines,</b> based on the L.|$|R
50|$|The Ford team ran {{modified}} Escort Mk Is, {{fitted with}} an 1850 cc {{version of the}} <b>crossflow</b> Kent <b>engine</b> and uprated with various other parts from other Ford models. Each Ford car had two drivers. The British Leyland team entered two teams. The first team ran three Triumph 2.5PI Mark 2s, which were {{more powerful than the}} Fords but were significantly heavier; two cars carried a three-man crew, Brian Culcheth preferring to stick with a conventional two-man crew. The second Leyland team ran Austin Maxis, Austin 1800s (some badged Morris) and a lone Mini Clubman. Citroën used the venerable DS21. Moskvich used the Moskvich 412 with 1500 cc engine.|$|R
2500|$|There was a 1300GT {{performance}} version, with a tuned 1.3L <b>Crossflow</b> (OHV) <b>engine</b> with a Weber carburetor and uprated suspension. This version featured additional instrumentation with a tachometer, {{battery charge}} indicator, and oil pressure gauge. The same tuned 1.3L engine {{was also used}} in a variation sold as the Escort Sport, that used the flared front wings from the AVO range of cars, but featured trim from the more basic models. Later, an [...] "executive" [...] version of the Escort was produced known as the [...] "1300E". This featured the same 13" [...] road wheels and flared wings of the Sport, but was trimmed in an upmarket, for that time, fashion with wood trim on the dashboard and door cappings.|$|R
50|$|A {{sporting}} derivative (1.3 L Supersport) {{was offered}} in Europe for the 1980 model year, using the 1.3 L Kent <b>Crossflow</b> <b>engine,</b> effectively {{to test the}} market for the similar XR2 introduced a year later, which featured a 1.6 L {{version of the same}} engine. Black plastic trim was added to the exterior and interior.

50|$|The {{lightweight}} {{sports cars}} were built by various manufacturers. The Royale RP4, Merlyn MK 16, Aldon F100 and the Nerus Silhouette {{are examples of}} Formula F100 cars. Cars were fitted with a 1.300cc Ford Kent <b>Crossflow</b> <b>engine.</b> The engine was derived of the Formula Ford 1600. Despite the 300cc smaller engine, the cars were only slightly slower than Formula Ford due to their superior aerodynamics. All cars were fitted with spec Hewland transmission and Firestone tyres.|$|E
50|$|C Sports Racer (CSR) is a {{class in}} the Sports Car Club of America. it {{consists}} of open top prototype style cars. The maximum displacement is 1615cc, in a 2 valve <b>crossflow</b> <b>engine,</b> with a minimum weight of 1300lbs w/driver. Two cycle or 4 valve/4 cycle motors between 850cc and 1300cc are permitted with a minimum weight of 1200lbs. Supercharging and turbocharging are permitted within limits, and with a maximum displacement of 765cc. Some CSRs are Formula Atlantic cars converted by adding bodywork to the chassis.|$|E
50|$|Although {{obsolete}} for piston-ported two-stroke <b>engines,</b> <b>crossflow</b> scavenging is {{now very}} common in four stroke engines, where their inlet and exhaust valves are mounted {{on opposite sides of}} the cylinder head. As the inlet and exhaust strokes of the four stroke cycle happen on different strokes of the piston—the upward exhaust stroke, pushing exhaust gases out, is followed by the downward inlet stroke allowing the fresh charge in—the flow is as two isolated single flows, rather than as an unstable loop.|$|R
5000|$|Smaller overall packaging: {{because of}} the camshaft's {{location}} inside the engine block, OHV engines are more compact than an overhead cam engine of comparable displacement. [...] For example, Ford's 4.6 L OHC modular V8 {{is larger than the}} 5.0 L I-head Windsor V8 it replaced. GM's 4.6 L OHC Northstar V8 is slightly taller and wider than GM's larger displacement 5.7 to 7.0 L I-head LS V8. The Ford Ka uses the Kent <b>Crossflow</b> OHV <b>engine</b> to fit under its low bonnet line. Because of the generally more compact size of an engine of a given displacement, a pushrod engine of given external dimensions can have significantly greater displacement than an OHC engine of the same external size. As a result, the pushrod engine can sometimes produce just as much power as the OHC engine, but with greater torque (contrary to popular belief, this is simply due to the greater displacement of the pushrod engine vs the OHC engine rather than any inherent advantage of the pushrod design for torque production).|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, [...] "Crossflow" [...] is {{also used}} to refer {{specifically}} to Ford Motor Company's Kent <b>Crossflow</b> 4-cylinder OHV <b>engine,</b> and its short-block [...] "Valencia" [...] derivative which has been used in cars from the 1960s up to the present day, albeit with the addition of fuel injection and a modern engine management system. The term was also briefly used in the early 1980s in Australia for the revised 4.1 litre inline six-cylinder engine in Ford's Australian large family car, the Falcon. This was in response to the post-1979 fuel crisis where the Falcon was a comparatively fuel-inefficient car compared to its contemporary rivals.|$|R

40|$|We present {{two general}} {{interactive}} PC-based modeling and visualization software systems {{developed for the}} study of two types of environmental water flows: buoyant jet mixing and urban drainage problems. VISJET ([URL] is arguably the most robust software with advanced graphics for the prediction of mixing and transport of effluent discharges into a stratified <b>crossflow.</b> The prediction <b>engine</b> is a Lagrangian model for buoyant jets with three-dimensional trajectories, and is based on extensive basic experiments and turbulence model calculations. It can be used in outfall design and environmental impact assessment, and as an educational or training tool. VISFLOOD ([URL] is based on the numerical solution of the Saint-Venant equations, and caters for the simulation of unsteady flood propagation in urban drainage systems. Both software systems are fully interactive with data interrogation; the 3 D visualization is fully integrated with the model engine, and enables the user to appreciate the context of the problem in a most effective way. Both models have been well-validated against laboratory and field data, and have been applied to many actual engineering projects.

50|$|The early Mark III Cortinas {{came with}} the same 1,300 and 1,600 cc engines as the Mark II Cortinas, except for the 1,600 cc GXL. These engines are known as the Kent, <b>crossflow</b> <b>engine</b> or over head valve (OHV) engine. There was also the {{introduction}} of the 2000 cc engine, the single overhead cam engine, now known as the Pinto engine. SOHC. The OHV Kent unit was fitted with a single choke carburetor and was used for the early models up to GT trim, the SOHC twin choke carburetor Pinto unit was used for the GT and GXL models. The GXL was also offered in 1,600 in the later Cortina Mark IIIs.|$|E
50|$|For {{adapting}} the Kent Crossflow for {{front wheel drive}} the ancillaries were repositioned, and the cylinder block shortened by 30mm. This decision was taken {{in order for the}} engine to fit transversely across the Fiesta engine bay, whilst still allowing the transmission unit to be comfortably removed for clutch replacement. This difference however means that very few parts of the Valencia engine are interchangeable with a Crossflow. Interestingly however, Ford ended up installing the <b>Crossflow</b> <b>engine</b> into the Fiesta anyway, when the market demanded a 1.3L capacity, and later a 1.6L version for the North American market models - ultimately the 1.6L Crossflow also was used in the Mk1 Fiesta XR2 when the North American market Fiesta ceased production in 1980.|$|E
50|$|In {{trying to}} fill a need for light transports, the first {{prototype}} pickup truck (on A1 basis) was developed by Bernar Nahum in 1970. Series production began the following year, equipped with the 1.3-liter Ford <b>Crossflow</b> <b>engine</b> also used in saloons. The P2 also received the new nose of the facelifted A1. In the 1980s this was upgraded to the 1.6-liter Ford Pinto, as seen in other Anadols as well. After 1983, the 600D version was released, with a 1.9-liter diesel engine which necessitated a slight bulge in the hood. Always high in demand, and used extensively by the Turkish Post (PTT), the pickup continued in production until 1991, when 36,892 had been built. Many saloons have also been converted to pickup trucks.|$|E
5000|$|November 1978 brought {{minor changes}} to the Laurel, {{including}} squaring off of the front headlights. The highest trim level, [...] "Medalist", received air conditioning in addition to its OHC four-cylinder two-litre diesel engine. The 1800 cc cars switched to the newer Z18 <b>crossflow</b> <b>engine</b> and all Laurels now met the Showa 53 (1979) gasoline vehicle emission regulations. Later, in October 1979, a two-litre four-cylinder gasoline option (Z20-series) was added in several markets. Also new were the options of automatic transmission and the SGL equipment grade on diesel vehicles. In February 1980 an electric sunroof and the a hardtop version of the Medalist was added. This was the first year in which a sunroof was a model option. In July 1980 Limited a special edition [...] "gold medalist" [...] top-of-the-line trim was released.|$|E
50|$|The MG J-type is {{a sports}} car that was {{produced}} by MG from 1932 to 1934. This 2-door sports car used {{an updated version of}} the overhead camshaft, <b>crossflow</b> <b>engine,</b> used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 and previously fitted in the MG M-type Midget of 1929 to 1932, driving the rear wheels through a four-speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was from the D-Type with suspension by half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock absorbers all round with rigid front and rear axles. The car had a wheelbase of 86 inches (2184 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm). Most cars were open two-seaters, but a closed salonette version of the J1 was also made, and some chassis were supplied to external coachbuilders. The open cars can be distinguished from the M type by having cut-away tops to the doors.|$|E
50|$|The MG P-type is {{a sports}} car that was {{produced}} by MG from 1934 to 1936. This 2-door sports car used {{an updated version of}} the overhead camshaft, <b>crossflow</b> <b>engine,</b> used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 and previously fitted in the J-type Midget of 1932 to 1934, driving the rear wheels through a four-speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was a strengthened and slightly longer version of that used in the J-type with suspension by half-elliptic springs all round with rigid front and rear axles. Steering was initially by a Marles Weller and later a Bishop Cam system. The two-seat car had a wheelbase of 87 inches (2210 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm). Most cars were open two seaters, but streamlined Airline coupé bodies were also made. The P-type was also available as a four-seater, a car that suffered from a lack of power and poor rear ground clearance. Whereas J, K and L-type MGs differentiated between versions with the use of numbers, with 1 indicating a four-seater (i.e., J1) and 2 a two-seater (i.e., J2), {{this was not the case}} with the P-type (or its six-cylinder sister, the N-type Magnette), and there is no clue to the type in the name.|$|E
50|$|An overbored Lawrencetune 1650 cc {{version was}} made {{available}} in 1967 (32 built) to ameliorate the power shortage, for the Marcos 1650 GT. The 1650 also had bigger disc brakes {{and a standard}} Webasto sunroof, but proved somewhat less than reliable. It and the 1500 were both replaced by Ford's new Crossflow four not much later, in late 1967. The 1600 {{proved to be the}} most popular model yet, with 192 cars built until early 1969. Weight was 740 kg and disc brakes up front were standard, although power assist was an optional extra. Production ended in October 1969 as the new steel chassis was not well suited for the <b>crossflow</b> <b>engine.</b> A new model, the 2 litre, appeared at the January 1969 London Show with the engine changed to the Ford Essex V4 engine (3006E) from the Ford Corsair - while a V6 engine had already appeared {{at the top of the}} lineup in 1968. Also in 1969 (June), the plywood chassis was gradually replaced by a square section steel one, which shortened production time and saved on cost. These steel framed cars required a lower sill panel and have reshaped rear bumpers, as well as some subtle interior differences. The wooden chassis had also begun to meet a certain amount of resistance from buyers. There seem to have been no V4-engined wooden cars made, although there is a few months overlap between the introduction dates.|$|E
