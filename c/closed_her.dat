5|$|When Guggenheim <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> {{gallery in}} 1947 {{to move to}} Venice, artists like Pollock had to find new representation. The Betty Parsons Gallery, which opened the {{previous}} year, began representing Pollock, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still. Parsons was already representing Adolph Gottlieb, Hedda Sterne and Theodoros Stamos. It was while Pollock showed at Parsons' gallery that he started making his iconic drip-paintings in 1947. It was also here that Barnett Newman exhibited his first breakthrough works in 1950. Rothko, who had arrived at his distinctive mural sized paintings in 1947, first exhibited them at the Parsons Gallery.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Conrad {{began dating}} actor Kyle Howard. Howard {{expressed}} concern that appearing on reality television would interfere with his acting career; consequently, their relationship was not documented on The Hills. (After three years together, Conrad and Howard ended their relationship in 2011.) Upon {{the conclusion of the}} fourth season of the series that December, Conrad wished to leave the series to pursue other career opportunities. However, per the producers' requests, she filmed ten episodes for the following season, in which she <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> storylines. Conrad made her final appearance on the series in May 2009, attending Montag and Pratt's wedding after much deliberation during the mid-season finale of the fifth season. However, in the July 2009 issue of Cosmopolitan, she stated that producers had pressured her into a reconciliation with Montag throughout the season, adding that she was displeased when they would not allow otherwise. Conrad was replaced by former Laguna Beach castmate Kristin Cavallari until the series' conclusion in July 2010.|$|E

5|$|These ongoing {{victories}} belied {{the changing}} conditions applicable to Levants hunt for enemy vessels off Gibraltar. American vessels had become scarce, especially since Spain had <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> ports {{to them in}} the winter of 1777 in retaliation for privateer attacks on Spanish ships. French trading vessels remained at sea but were occasionally accompanied by naval escorts large enough to prevent their capture by Gibraltar's small Royal Navy squadron. Levant was careened on a beach at Gibraltar over Christmas 1778 and then returned to sea, but her next capture was not until 14 March 1779 when in company with Captain Rich's Enterprise she seized a French vessel, Thésée. A further victory followed on 1 April when Levant, still in company with Enterprise, took Eclair, a French xebec carrying wine and brandy from Marseilles.|$|E
5|$|During the menstrual {{period of}} the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber. However, during sex with Vyasa, Ambika noticed his dark {{appearance}} and <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> eyes. Vyasa declared to Satyavti that due to Ambika's cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa's grim appearance. As the result the child would be wan, Vyasa told his mother, who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber; she remembered Vyasa's grim appearance (and repulsive odour), and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son {{would be the most}} intelligent man, and she would no longer be a slave. Vyasa told Satyavti of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to the maid.|$|E

None of the efforts for reinstatement proved fruitful.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} depicts complex {{personality and}} devotion to Mary. Her head is gently leaning to her right, {{her eyes are}} half <b>closed,</b> <b>her</b> hands are crossed in devotion; this reminds {{that she is a}} virgin, humble servant of the Lord, merciful mother and patron of the people. At the same time, her head is surrounded by an aureola with golden rays and her body is usually covered in elaborate gold and silver clothes and crowns; these are the symbols of her divine and majestic role as the Queen of Heaven. The painting also reminds of Tota pulchra es (You are all beautiful), an old Catholic prayer.|$|E

She competed at her first global senior competition the following month, the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. Hachlaf recorded the fifth fastest qualifying time in the heats stage, {{but she did not}} manage to finish the semi-finals, dropping out mid-race. She <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> year with an appearance at the 2009 Jeux de la Francophonie, where she won another silver medal, just beaten by her compatriot Seltana Aït Hammou.

Interestingly, her time in this event at the qualification round, would have won the 100 m backstroke event. Her final career appearance {{was one of the}} finest farewell of all-time in swimming sport: she won her beloved 200 m backstroke event with the greatest margin in any short distance events of the swimming sport, collecting her fifth individual gold medals and defending her titles for three consecutive Olympic Games.|$|E
