50|$|In January 2013, it was {{announced}} that TV Guide Network would be renamed TVGN. The name change and new logo, which de-emphasizes the channel's ties to TV Guide magazine took effect on April 15, 2013. The immediate effect of the purchase by CBS saw the summer series Big Brother After Dark move from Showtime 2 to TVGN, along with same-day repeats of The Young and the Restless moving to the network from Soapnet, which ceased operations in December 2013. Fellow CBS soap The Bold and the Beautiful soon also joined the TVGN lineup, along with eventual same-week repeats of Survivor and The Amazing Race, and repeats of CBS event programming such as the Grammy Awards. CBS Television Distribution's syndicated newsmagazine Entertainment Tonight began to package and produce all of TVGN's red carpet coverage as a <b>cable</b> <b>extension</b> of that program, though the network's existing programming agreements with competing program/website PopSugar continue to be maintained.|$|E
5000|$|The former Family Channel {{is one of}} the few known {{instances}} in which the amount of channel drift allowed was limited to some degree. Launching as religious network CBN Satellite Service (a <b>cable</b> <b>extension</b> of televangelist Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network) in 1977, it later incorporated family-oriented secular programs by 1984, which became the channel's dominant form of programming for nearly two decades. In 1990, CBN agreed to sell the network to International Family Entertainment, but with strings attached: the channel's name was required to contain the word [...] "Family" [...] for the next 25 years (having incorporated the word in its name since 1988 as The CBN Family Channel, then as The Family Channel and later Fox Family after being sold to News Corporation), and it is required to air CBN's flagship program The 700 Club twice each weekday as well as a day-long CBN telethon each January in perpetuity as part of a long-term time-buy. Following its sale to News Corporation, CBN made another long-term time-buy on the station to air a daily half-hour CBN talk show, then known as Living the Life, to the lineup. After The Walt Disney Company acquired the channel from News Corporation in 2001, Disney planned to reformat the channel as [...] "XYZ" [...] (a reverse reference to the American Broadcasting Company's abbreviation) and shift its target to a more hip audience such as college students or young women; possibly to avoid redundancies with the existing family-friendly Disney Channel. To create XYZ, the Family Channel would have had to cease to exist — Disney would have had to create XYZ as an entirely new network, and negotiate carriage agreements with pay television providers from scratch (something that, in modern times, is fairly common, but would have been much more disruptive to one of the most widely distributed channels on cable). Nonetheless, under the ABC Family brand, the channel drifted from its strictly family-friendly format under Disney ownership; the channel gradually dropped series aimed at children from its schedule and incorporated programs aimed at young adults featuring profanity, some violence, and some sexual content, alongside its family-oriented series and films, and now airs a standard disclaimer before each broadcast of The 700 Club in which The Walt Disney Company disowns any connection to the show. Disney further denied the [...] "Family" [...] stipulation existed in late 2015 when it announced plans to rename the channel [...] "Freeform" [...] in January 2016.|$|E

40|$|Myosin V motors are {{believed}} to contribute to cell polarization by carrying cargoes along actin tracks. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Myosin Vs transport secretory vesicles along actin cables, which are dynamic actin bundles assembled by the formin For 3 at cell poles. How these flexible structures are able to extend longitudinally in the cell through the dense cytoplasm is unknown. Here we show that in myosin V (myo 52 myo 51) null cells, actin cables are curled, bundled, and fail to extend into the cell interior. They also exhibit reduced retrograde flow, suggesting that formin-mediated actin assembly is impaired. Myo 52 may contribute to actin cable organization by delivering actin regulators to cell poles, as myoV defects are partially suppressed by diverting cargoes toward cell tips onto microtubules with a kinesin 7 -Myo 52 tail chimera. In addition, Myo 52 motor activity may pull on cables to provide the tension necessary for their extension and efficient assembly, as artificially tethering actin cables to the nuclear envelope via a Myo 52 motor domain restores actin <b>cable</b> <b>extension</b> and retrograde flow in myoV mutants. Together these in vivo data reveal elements of a self-organizing {{system in which the}} motors shape their own tracks by transporting cargoes and exerting physical pulling forces...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study how the rider movements change the motorcycle behaviour while executing significant manoeuvres. It is well known how the inertial characteristics of human body are comparable to the motorcycle ones: to describe the dynamical behaviour of the whole system, it is necessary to understand the body-vehicle interactions. At this aim both motorcycle and rider are equipped through sensors. The motorcycle dynamic was measured by means of an inertial platform, the suspensions shaking by linear potentiometer, the steering angle by inductive rotary sensor and the speed by a proximity sensor on the wheel. In order to identify the rider motions - while running on a race track- an original measurement system was developed in a previous work [8]: the pilot is equipped by a rigid ergal staff, constrained to the back by a multi cross belts system. Three target points are defined on the staff; these targets are pointed by six <b>cable</b> <b>extension</b> potentiometers placed on the motorcycle. A set of non linear equations are written to fully identify the translational and the cardanic rotational 3 D movements of the riding body with respect to the motorcycle. To understand the rider-motorcycle interaction, both steady state manoeuvres (steering pad) and transient manoeuvres (Iso lane change, slalom) were performed...|$|E
30|$|EFOSs measure {{just one}} {{component}} of the electric field, but with a much longer dipole (2 – 3  km for the NOMan experiment) {{than that of the}} OBEMs (~ 5.4  m), and therefore yield better signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios (Utada et al. 2013). An EFOS consists of a recorder and a cable drum attached to an anchor. The EFOS is deployed to the seafloor via free fall, and the cable drum is then caught and towed by a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) KAIKO 7000 II to extend the cable that generates the long electric dipole. An EFOS was deployed at NM 03 in 2010 as the part of the pilot survey. In 2012, the recorder was replaced and the measurements were continued. Three additional EFOSs were deployed, at NM 01, NM 14, and NM 16. The direction of the <b>cable</b> <b>extension</b> was restricted by the recorder side because of the instrumental design and a technical reason of the ROV operation (Utada et al. 2013). All of the EFOS recorders happened to settle facing between N 40 °E and N 170 °E after free fall deployment; therefore, the cables were extended approximately in the N 110 °E direction (Table  1), which is subparallel to the direction of Pacific Plate motion. The EFOS recorders at sites NM 01, NM 14, and NM 16 were retrieved using the ROV KAIKO 7000 II in 2014, and the recorder at NM 03 was retrieved using ROV KAIKO Mk-IV in 2015. Further information about the EFOSs is listed in Table  1.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} {{of water in}} soil on a potential, gravimetric or volumetric basis is considered, with studies concentrating on the {{measurement of}} water by dielectric and neutron moderation methods. The ability of the time-domain reflectometry technique to measure water content simultaneously at different spatial locations is an important advantage of the technique. The reported apparent dielectric by the TRASE� time-domain reflectometer and Pyelab time-domain reflectometry systems is sensitive to change in <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> length. In some soil, e. g. a commercial sand, the response to increasing extension length of <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> is linear. For other soil a linear response occurs for certain lengths of cable at different moisture contents. A single model accounting for clay content, <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> length, time-domain reflectometry system, probe type and inherent moisture conditions explained 62. 2 % of variation from the control (0 m <b>extension)</b> <b>cable.</b> The <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> causes {{a decrease in the}} returning electromagnetic-wave energy; leading to a decline in the slope used in automatic end-point determination. Calibration for each probe installation when the soil is saturated, and at small water contents is recommended. The ability of time-domain reflectometry, frequency-domain and neutron moderation techniques in measuring soil water content in a Brown Chromosol is examined. An in situ calibration, across a limited range of water contents, for the neutron moderation method is more sensitive to changing soil water content than the factory supplied 'universal' calibration. Comparison of the EnviroSCAN� frequency-domain system and the NMM count ratio indicates the frequency-domain technique is more sensitive to change in soil water conditions. The EnviroSCAN� system is well suited to continuous profile-based measurement of soil water content. Results with the time-domain reflectometry technique were disappointing, indicating the limited applicability of time-domain reflectometry in profile based soil water content measurement in heavy-textured soil, or soil with a large electrical conductivity. The method of auguring to a known depth and placement of the time-domain reflectometry probe into undisturbed soil is not recommended. A time-domain reflectometry system is adapted for in situ measurement of water in an iron ore stockpile. The laboratory calibration for water content of the processed iron ore compares favourably to a field calibration. In the field study, the 28 m <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> used to connect the probes to the time-domain reflectometry affected the end-point determination of the time-domain reflectometry system. To account for this, 0. 197 should be subtracted from the reported apparent dielectric before calculation of volumetric moisture content...|$|R

40|$|The mode of {{functioning}} {{of the majority of}} eddy probe system is grounded on the active oscillator method that gives the parameter instability at the effect of environment temperature on the components of eddy probe system (non-contact eddy probe, <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> and probe driver). GlobalTest has developed a new way of eddy current monitoring grounded on excitation in a probe of damped oscillations by an impulse power source for decrease of environment temperature effect on the components of eddy probe system. The discrete excitation process made possible measurement of a current probe heat-resistance and also measurement of an <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> during measurement of displacement and an automatic response correction depending on heat-resistance value. The way used in a sensor allows to reduce an error at the effect of environment temperature on active resistance of a non-contact eddy probe and an <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> and to obtain height displacement sensitivity.
