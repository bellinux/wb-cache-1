50|$|The {{practical}} {{limit to}} the length of a tensioned <b>cutting</b> <b>wire</b> is the tendency of the wire to sag under the force of gravity, which requires higher tension for longer wires. Some CNC cutting machines place the ends of the wire above and below the workpiece, with the wire being mostly vertical, to counter this problem.|$|E

50|$|The board-style {{cheese slicer}} has been {{expanded}} to include marble, stainless steel, and plastic cutting boards. Several other designs of handles and wire holders have also been invented to hold the <b>cutting</b> <b>wires</b> of cheese slicing boards.

Based on a Lancia truck, the armoured car was an advanced design for its day. For firepower the vehicle was equipped with twin turret mounted machine guns. The initial ten vehicles featured a further small turret on top with yet another machine gun. This gave the vehicle considerable firepower for the time. As a result of experiences in World War I, steel rails were installed {{over the top of the}} vehicle for <b>cutting</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E

5000|$|For under {{eight months}} of age, but after the horns are {{starting}} to grow attached to the skull, so a cup dehorner or a Gigli saw, a type of surgical <b>cutting</b> <b>wire,</b> is used. There are several different types of cup dehorners, but they all serve the same function of removing the horn and growth ring. Since the horn is tougher it takes more force to remove it so tools that provide some leverage are need. Gigli saw wire is used on horns of older calf’s horns that have grown too large for the cup dehorners.|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{applicability}} of <b>wire</b> <b>cutting</b> in determining the fracture resistance of poly-acrylamide (p-AA) hydrogels with different cross-link densities was investigated. From the results obtained in <b>cutting</b> tests with <b>wires</b> of different diameters, the material fracture resistance, Gc, was evaluated. Since <b>wire</b> <b>cutting</b> technique was initially proposed for elastic-perfectly plastic materials, specific testing problems arisen from the application of this method to our systems, which {{showed no sign of}} plasticity, were discussed...|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>wire</b> <b>cutting</b> EDM, <b>wire</b> burning EDM, or {{traveling}} wire EDM, this process uses spark erosion to machine or remove material from any electrically conductive material, using a traveling wire electrode.

The frame holding the wires is often a replaceable and or adjustable unit so the spacing can be changed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{consortium}} {{was set up}} {{to remove}} the wreck of the MV Tricolor, a Norwegian registered vehicle carrier operated by Wilh. Wilhelmsen. The consortium consisted of Smit Salvage BV, Scaldis Salvage & Marine Contractors NV, URS Salvage & Marine Contracting NV and Multraship Salvage BV. The contract for the wreck-removal with this consortium was signed on 11 April 2003. Starting in July 2003, the operation was declared complete on October 27, 2004. The salvage method included a carbide-encrusted <b>cutting</b> <b>wire</b> used to slice the wreck into nine sections of 3000 tonnes each. This technique was similar to one Smit had used in salvaging the Russian submarine, K-141 Kursk.|$|E
50|$|Mortars, which lobbed a shell {{in a high}} arc over a {{relatively}} short distance, were widely used in trench fighting for harassing the forward trenches, for <b>cutting</b> <b>wire</b> {{in preparation for a}} raid or attack, and for destroying dugouts, saps and other entrenchments. In 1914, the British fired a total of 545 mortar shells; in 1916, they fired over 6,500,000. Similarly, howitzers, which fire on a more direct arc than mortars, raised in number from over 1,000 shells in 1914, to over 4,500,000 in 1916. The smaller numerical difference in mortar rounds, as opposed to howitzer rounds, is presumed by many {{to be related to the}} expanded costs of manufacturing the larger and more resource intensive howitzer rounds.|$|E
5000|$|After the United States' {{entry into}} World War II, {{complaints}} arose from Army soldiers and Marines issued World War I-era bronze or alloy-handled trench knives {{such as the}} U.S. Mark I trench knife for use in hand-to-hand fighting. The Mark I was relatively expensive and time-consuming to manufacture, and reports from the field indicated that the knife's large 'brass-knuckle' fingerguard handle {{made it difficult to}} secure in conventional scabbards while limiting the range of useful fighting grip positions. [...] Another criticism was that the Mark I's relatively thin blade was prone to breakage when used for common utility tasks such as <b>cutting</b> <b>wire</b> or opening ammunition crates and ration cans. [...] A final impetus came from the War Department, which had determined the need for a new multipurpose knife capable of fulfilling the roles of both a fighting and a utility knife, {{while at the same time}} conserving strategic metal resources.|$|E
50|$|On 16 October 1939 telegraphic {{lines in}} the region of Huelgoat were cut. Perrot was accused by {{authorities}} of sabotage. The gendarmes searched his estate twice and interrogated him, but he was released as he had an alibi. However, one gendarme publicly accused him of <b>cutting</b> the <b>wires,</b> and Perrot accused the gendarme of defamation.

50|$|Lineman's, {{linesman}}'s (US English), linesman pliers (Canadian English), combination pliers, or side-cutting pliers are {{a type of}} pliers used by electricians {{and other}} tradesmen primarily for gripping, twisting, bending and <b>cutting</b> <b>wire</b> and cable. Linemen's pliers owe their effectiveness to their plier design, which multiplies force through leverage. Lineman's pliers have a gripping joint at their snub nose and cutting edge in their craw. Some versions include either an additional gripping or crimping device at {{the crux of the}} handle side of the pliers' joint. Lineman's pliers typically are machined from forged steel and the two handles precisely joined with a heavy-duty rivet that maintains the pliers' accuracy even after repeated use under extreme force on heavy-gauge wire. Lineman's pliers usually have grips for better handling than bare metal handles; the grips may also provide insulation for protection against electric shock when working with live circuits, although most models are marked as not listed for such use. Some pliers are certified to withstand a specified voltage, e.g. 1000V.|$|E

5000|$|War Office, 26th September, 1916.His Majesty the KING {{has been}} graciously pleased to award the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officers, Non-commissioned Officers and Men:—...2nd Lt. Edward Felix Baxter, late L'pool R.For most {{conspicuous}} bravery. Prior to {{a raid on}} the hostile line he was engaged during two nights in <b>cutting</b> <b>wire</b> close to the enemy's trenches. The enemy could be heard {{on the other side}} of the parapet.Second Lieutenant Baxter, while assisting in the wire cutting, held a bomb in his hand with the pin withdrawn ready to throw. On one occasion the bomb slipped and fell to the ground, but he instantly picked it up, unscrewed the base plug, and took out the detonator, which he smothered in theground, thereby preventing the alarm being given, and undoubtedly saving many casualties.Later, he led the left storming party with the greatest gallantry, and was the first man into the trench, shooting the sentry with his revolver. He then assisted to bomb dugouts, and finally climbed out of the trench and assisted the last man over the parapet.After this he was not seen again, though search parties went out at once to look for him. There seems no doubt that he lost his life in his great devotion to duty.|$|E
