50|$|In 1988 the California Coastal Conservancy began {{buying the}} land {{surrounding}} the light station, and in 1991 {{the station was}} added to the National Register of Historic Places. However, the California State Park System declined to take over the land at that time because of state budget shortfalls; instead, the station was managed for nine years by a non-profit organization, the North Coast Interpretive Association. Beginning in 1996, the NCIA organized a major restoration of the station to the state it {{would have been in the}} 1930s, after it was electrified, including a return to active duty of the main lens of the light. In 1999, the original third-order Fresnel lens was reinstalled after being upgraded to meet more modern standards. Before it could be used the light had to be as reliable as a Directional <b>Code</b> <b>Beacon,</b> which is commonly used at airports. The restored lighthouse was opened to the public in August 2001, and used in filming the Warner Bros. 2001 drama film The Majestic. In 2002, California State Parks purchased the light station for four million dollars. The NCIA, which then became the Point Cabrillo Light Keeper Association, continued to run the station for the state park system. The station won the Governor's Historic Preservation Award in 2007, and the Preservation Design Award of the California Preservation Foundation in the same year.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — <b>Beacon</b> <b>codes</b> are {{a set of}} {{very limited}} National Airspace System (NAS) resource. Currently, the <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> {{allocation}} process {{is based upon the}} concept of discreet <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> assignment to each ARTCC. Due to the mismatch between the limited number of <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> subsets available and the volume of traffic, duplicate <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> assignment is unavoidable under the current scheme. In this paper, the spatial and temporal structure of enroute NAS traffic is analyzed. This analysis provides the foundation of exploiting the inherent structure of NAS traffic to enable a more efficient <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> assignment, i. e. with fewer <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> changes per flight...|$|R

40|$|<b>Beacon</b> <b>codes</b> or squawk {{codes are}} {{a set of}} limited National Airspace System (NAS) resource. The Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRS) was {{deployed}} for civilian use by FAA after World War II. With the increase in demand for codes resulting from the growth in air traffic, {{the current system of}} <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> allocation leads to code reassignments which are inefficient. Also, the current system is vulnerable to code shortages as the traffic grows. This paper describes a new algorithm of <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> assignment that eliminates the need for “reassignment ” and is also more scalable to increasing traffic in the NAS. The method, Space-Time Adjacency (STA) algorithm, assigns unique codes to flights by exploiting the temporal and spatial opportunities in individual flightplans. Five high traffic volume days across different seasons of 2007 were used to test the algorithm performance and robustness. The results show that this method of code assignment required zero reassignments...|$|R

50|$|Four {{of the ten}} {{provincial capital}} {{airports}} in Canada have ended up with codes beginning with YY, including YYZ for Toronto, Ontario, YYJ for Victoria, British Columbia, YYT for Saint John's, Newfoundland, and YYG for Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Canada's largest airport is YYZ for Toronto-Pearson (YTZ was used for Toronto City Airport, so YYZ is the station code for a village called Malton, which is where Toronto Pearson International Airport is actually located). YUL is used for Montreal-Trudeau (UL was the ID <b>code</b> for <b>beacon</b> {{in the city of}} Kirkland, now the location of Montreal-Trudeau). While these codes make it difficult for the public to associate them with a particular Canadian city, some codes have become popular in usage despite their cryptic nature, particularly at the largest airports. Some airports have started using their IATA codes as marketing brands. Calgary International Airport has begun using its airport code YYC as a marketing brand and name for the airport authority web site (yyc.com)., while Vancouver International Airport advertises as YVR (yvr.com).|$|R
50|$|The {{transponder}} {{has a small}} required set {{of controls}} and is simple to operate. It has a method to enter the four-digit transponder code, {{also known as a}} <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> or squawk code, and a control to transmit an ident, which is done at the controller's request (see SPI pulse below). Transponders typically have 4 operating modes: Off, Standby, On (Mode-A), and Alt (Mode-C). On and Alt mode differ only in that the On mode inhibits transmitting any altitude information. Standby mode allows the unit to remain powered and warmed up but inhibits any replies, since the radar is used for searching the aircraft and exact location of aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are some}} general {{aviation}} concerns that ADS-B removes anonymity of the VFR aircraft operations. [...] The ICAO 24-bit transponder code specifically {{assigned to each}} aircraft will allow monitoring of that aircraft when within the service volumes of the Mode-S/ADS-B system. Unlike the Mode A/C transponders, there is no code [...] "1200"/"7000", which offers casual anonymity. Mode-S/ADS-B identifies the aircraft uniquely among all in the world, {{in a similar fashion}} as a MAC number for an Ethernet card or the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) of a GSM phone. However, the FAA is allowing UAT-equipped aircraft to utilize a random self-assigned temporary ICAO address in conjunction with the use of <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> 1200. 1090 ES equipped aircraft using ADS-B will not have this option.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} site still {{houses a}} VOR navigational <b>beacon,</b> <b>code</b> BNN. The airspace above the airfield and nearby Chesham {{is known as}} the Bovingdon stack and is a holding area for aircraft approaching Heathrow Airport, 32 km to the south. Aircraft are requested to join the hold, typically at an altitude of 14000-16000 feet, and then fly a 'race-track' pattern around the Bovingdon VOR beacon, separated at intervals of 1000 feet from other aircraft. Each aircraft is then instructed to descend to a lower available altitude as the lowest aircraft leaves the hold to make its final approach to Heathrow. At busy times, therefore, there may be up to 10 aircraft holding at the available 1000 foot separations between 7000 feet and 16000 feet and these may be seen circling overhead on a clear day.|$|R

40|$|Indoor {{localization}} is {{a fundamental}} capability for service robots and indoor applications on mobile devices. To realize that, the cost and the performance are of great concern. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight signal encoding and decomposition method {{in the context of}} a low-cost Visible Light Communication (VLC) -based indoor localization system. In this paper, a Gold-sequence-based tiny-length <b>beacon</b> <b>code</b> selection method is firstly introduced. Accordingly, an asynchronous blind signal decomposition method is created for the signal decomposition of mod-ulated light sources. It is based on the correlation properties of Gold-sequences. It is able to decompose the mixed light-signals in real-time. The average decomposition time-cost of each frame is 0. 8 s. Under typical indoor conditions, the proposed decomposition method achieves the-state-of-the-art accuracy and stability of its kind.

40|$|Reading and {{understanding}} algorithms {{is not an}} easy task and often neglected by educators in an introductory programming course. One proposed solution to this problem is the incorporation of a technological support tool to aid program comprehension in introductory programming. Many researchers advocate the identification of beacons and the use of chunking as support for <b>code</b> comprehension. <b>Beacon</b> recognition and chunking can also be used as support in the teaching model of introductory programming. Educators use a variety of different support tools to facilitate program comprehension in introductory programming. Review of a variety of support tools fails to deliver an existing tool to support a teaching model that incorporates chunking and the identification of beacons. The experimental support tool in this dissertation (BeReT) is primarily designed to encourage a student to correctly identify beacons within provided program extracts. BeReT {{can also be used to}} allow students to group together related statements and to learn about plans implemented in any semantically and syntactically correct algorithm uploaded by an instructor. While these requirements are evident in the design and implementation of BeReT, data is required to measure the effect BeReT has on the indepth comprehension of introductory programming algorithms. A between-groups experiment is described which compares the program comprehension of students that used BeReT to study various introductory algorithms, with students that relied solely on traditional lecturing materials. The use of an eye tracker was incorporated into the empirical study to visualise the results of controlled experiments. The results indicate that a technological support tool like BeReT can have a significantly positive effect on student comprehension of algorithms traditionally taught in introductory programming. This research provides educators with an alternative way for the incorporation of in-depth code comprehension skills in introductory programmin...|$|R
40|$|Positioning is a {{fundamental}} issue in mobile robot applications, {{and it can be}} achieved in multiple ways. Among these methods, triangulation based on angle measurements is widely used, robust, and flexible. In this thesis, we present an original beacon-based angle measurement system, an original triangulation algorithm, and a calibration method, which are parts of an absolute robot positioning system in the 2 D plane. Also, we develop a theoretical model, useful for evaluating the performance of our system. In the first part, we present the hardware system, named BeAMS, which introduces several innovations. A simple infrared receiver is the main sensor for the angle measurements, and the beacons are common infrared LEDs emitting an On-Off Keying signal containing the beacon ID. Furthermore, the system does not require an additional synchronization channel between the beacons and the robot. BeAMS introduces a new mechanism to measure angles: it detects a beacon when it enters and leaves an angular window. This allows the sensor to analyze the temporal evolution of the received signal inside the angular window. In our case, this feature is used to <b>code</b> the <b>beacon</b> ID. Then, a theoretical framework for a thorough performance analysis of BeAMS is provided. We establish the upper bound of the variance and its exact evolution {{as a function of the}} angular window. Finally, we validate our theory by means of simulated and experimental results. The second part of the thesis is concerned with triangulation algorithms. Most triangulation algorithms proposed so far have major limitations. For example, some of them need a particular beacon ordering, have blind spots, or only work within the triangle defined by the three beacons. More reliable methods exist, but they have an increasing complexity or they require to handle certain spatial arrangements separately. Therefore, we have designed our own triangulation algorithm, named ToTal, that natively works in the whole plane, and for any beacon ordering. We also provide a comprehensive comparison between other algorithms, and benchmarks show that our algorithm is faster and simpler than similar algorithms. In addition to its inherent efficiency, our algorithm provides a useful and unique reliability measure, assessable anywhere in the plane, which can be used to identify pathological cases, or as a validation gate in data fusion algorithms. Finally, in the last part, we concentrate on the biases that affect the angle measurements. We show that there are four sources of errors (or biases) resulting in inaccuracies in the computed positions. Then, we establish a model of these errors, and we propose a complete calibration procedure in order to reduce the final bias. Based on the results obtained with our calibration setup, the angular RMS error of BeAMS has been evaluated to 0. 4 deg without calibration, and to 0. 27 deg, after the calibration procedure. Even for the uncalibrated hardware, BeAMS has a better performance than other prototypes found in the literature and, when the system is calibrated, BeAMS is close to state of the art commercial systems...|$|R
