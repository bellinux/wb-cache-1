40|$|Abstract. The cables of {{cable-stayed}} bridges have a non-linear behaviour {{caused by}} their shape variation, when the stress conditions change. This {{is a most}} interesting theme, namely, {{the study of the}} effective <b>cable</b> <b>modulus</b> of elasticity on the exactness of the analysis, during the erection of the bridges. In the present paper, we examine the influence of the neglected component of the weight of the cable, which is parallel to the direction of the chord of the cable. We obtain an easy used and useful formula by means of which we can estimate the exactitude of the well-known Dischinger’s formula and, also, Hajdin’s and other’s one. We, finally, draw useful diagrams. 1...|$|E

In this thesis, to investigate the problem of openings in beams, choose small circular opening as consideration. By using manual calculation and personal computer software (ANSYS) to analysis the beam behaviours under point loads. The aspects will analyse the beam with opening through four input variables which are the density of prestressed <b>cable,</b> <b>modulus</b> of elasticity, point load 1 and point load 2, and then gain the output of parameters. The results include general situations of stress, strain, and deflection. Base on the past research and experimental test of literature, conclude manual results getting from software calculation, analysis the characteristics and the behaviours of the prestressed concrete beam with small circular opening. The objective of this project is based on the four input variables which are point load 1, point load 2, modulus of elasticity, and density of prestressed cable, to gain the three output parameters which are maximum deflection, maximum stress, and maximum strain. The statistic for the random input variables and output parameters had been computed by using the ANSYS software and illustrate the properties of the output parameters using histogram plots, cumulative distribution curves, and history plots. The influence of random input variables on the individual output parameters. Hence, the analysis was success and results collected were accurate and fit into use...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The natural {{frequencies}} of vibration {{and the corresponding}} mode shapes of a suspension bridge with varying bending stiffness of cables are determined, and the changes that occur in these characteristics with respect to parametric changes in the bridge are examined. Single span L= 64, 0 m suspension steel footbridge with hangers and flexible cables is selected as an initial model used to study the dynamic characteristics of a suspension system. Based on FEA parameter studies are presented in which the vibration characteristics are studied {{as a function of}} structural and material parameters, such as <b>cable</b> flexural stiffness, <b>modulus</b> of elasticity and mass density of structural components. It is generally found that the main cable bending stiffness contributes a considerable effect on the {{natural frequencies}} of the suspension system...|$|R
40|$|Energising a coil {{results in}} a {{transverse}} force on the strands pushing the cable towards {{one side of the}} jacket. This load causes a transverse compressive strain in strands and in particular in strand crossover points. Besides this, contact surfaces interfere by micro-sliding resulting in friction and anomalous contact resistance behaviour versus force. Two Central Solenoid Model Coil conductors have been tested previously in a cryogenic press and now the experimental results are presented for the Toroidal Field Model Coil (TFMC) conductor (DP 4). The press can transmit a variable (cyclic) force of at least 650 kN/m directly to a cable section of 400 mm at 4. 2 K. The magnetisation of the conductor and the interstrand resistance (Rc) between various strands inside the cable can be measured by varying pressure. The force on the cable and the displacement are monitored simultaneously {{in order to determine the}} effective <b>cable</b> Young's <b>modulus</b> and the mechanical heat generation due to friction and deformation. The mechanical heat generation, the coupling loss time constant n¿ and the Rc of the full-size ITER TFMC conductor have been studied under load up to 40 full loading cycles. The evolution of Rc is comparable to the behaviour found for the CS Model Coil type of conductors. A significant decrease of the cable coupling current time constant, n¿ and mechanical heat generation after cyclic loading is foun...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} field in a coil {{results in a}} transverse force on the strands pushing the cable towards {{one side of the}} jacket. A special cryogenic press has been built to study in a unique way the mechanical and electrical properties of full-size ITER Cable-in-Conduit (CIC) samples under a transverse, mechanical load. The press can transmit a variable (cyclic) force of at least 650 kN/m to a cable section of 400 mm at 4. 2 K. The jacket around the cable is partly opened in order to transmit the transverse force directly onto the cable. A superconducting dipole coil provides the AC {{magnetic field}} required to perform magnetisation measurements with pick-up coils. In addition the interstrand resistance (Rc) between various strands selected from topologically different positions inside the cable is measured. The force on the cable as well as the displacement are monitored simultaneously {{in order to determine the}} effective <b>cable</b> Young's <b>modulus</b> and the mechanical heat generation due to friction and deformation as the force is cycled. The mechanical heat generation, the coupling loss time constant nτ and Rc of a full-size ITER conductor have been studied under load for the first time. An important result is the significant decrease of nτ, after cyclic loading. It is also observed that the mechanical heat generation decreases with cycling...|$|R
40|$|The large {{currents}} in the cable-in-conduit conductors (CICC) {{destined for the}} high field magnets in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), cause huge transverse forces on the strands compressing the cable against {{one side of the}} conduit. This load causes transverse compressive strain in the strands at the crossovers contacts. Moreover, the strands are also subjected to bending and contact surfaces micro-sliding, which results into friction and anomalous contact resistance versus force behavior. Three Nb/sub 3 /Sn central solenoid model coil (CSMC) conductors were tested previously in the Twente Cryogenic Cable Press up to 40 cycles with a transverse peak load of 650 kN/m. This press can transmit a variable (cyclic) transverse force directly to a cable section of 400 mm length at a temperature of 4. 2 K (or higher). To explore life-time cycling, we tested a CSMC Nb/sub 3 /Sn conductor up to 40, 000 cycles. The coupling loss and the associated interstrand resistance between various strands and strand bundles are measured at various loads. The force on the cable and the displacement are monitored {{in order to determine the}} effective <b>cable</b> Young's <b>modulus</b> and the mechanical heat generation. Some aspects of strand deformation in CICC's are discussed. The test results are discussed in view of previous press results and data extracted from the ITER model coil tests...|$|R
40|$|Combined stayed {{roof with}} the span equal to 60 m is {{considered}} in the paper. The framework of the roof is formed by two groups of structural members, which are placed in longitudinal and transversal directions. The main girder and pylons, which form the main frame, just as suspenders are the members, placed in the longitudinal direction. Transversal frames, which are formed by the trusses and columns, are the members, placed in transversal direction. Structural steel S 355 is considered as a materials of all rigid members – pylons, columns and girders. Three variants of materials for suspenders were considered. Steel <b>cables</b> with <b>modulus</b> of elasticity of 1. 70 ٠ 105 MPa and tensile strength of steel wire of 1960 MPa were the first variant. Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) with the modulus of elasticity of 1. 65 ٠ 105 MPa, tensile strength of 2800 MPa and ultimate strain in tension of 1. 8 % was the second variant. Hybrid composite element, consisting from steel, CFRP and Kevlar components with the volume fractions of 0. 6, 0. 2 and 0. 2, correspondingly, was the last variant of suspenders. The dependences of material consumption and main geometrical parameters of combined stayed roof were obtained for three above mentioned variants of suspender materials. They were obtained {{on the basis of}} numerical experiment, which was carried out using the software LYRA 9. 4. It was stated that the rational values of the number of suspenders, transversal frame bay and height of pylon are equal to 8, 6 m and 18 m, correspondingly...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} modeling and analysis of cable-stayed bridges under the action of moving vehicles. Accurate and efficient finite elements are used for modeling the bridge structure. A beam element is adopted for modeling the girder and the pylons. Whereas, a two-node catenary cable element derived using exact analytical expressions for the elastic catenary, is adopted for modeling the cables. The vehicle model {{used in this study}} is a so-called suspension model that includes both primary and secondary vehicle suspension systems. Bridge damping, bridge-vehicle interaction and all sources of geometric nonlinearity are considered. An iterative scheme is utilized to include the dynamic interaction between the bridge and the moving vehicles. The dynamic response is evaluated using the mode superposition technique and utilizing the deformed dead load tangent stiffness matrix. To illustrate the efficiency of the solution methodology and to highlight the dynamic effects, a numerical example of a simple cable-stayed bridge model is presented.

40|$|Bolting is {{currently}} the most commonly accepted rock reinforcing method of dealing with rock strata instability in both surface and underground mines as well as civil engineering. Bolts are installed in fractured rock mass to build composite beams in weak strata or to attach weak excavation surfaces to deeper and competent rock layers to achieve stability. After opening, rock mass around the excavation space experiences stress redistribution and rock fracturing occurs in this process. Bolts installed in the fractured rock mass around excavations normally bear combined tensile and shear loads due to the opening and sliding of rock fractures. Direct shear restraint and high normal stress are applied by the bolt to the fracture surfaces to minimise their displacements. This mechanism allows the excavation surfaces to stabilise and makes them self-supporting. In the interactive process of rock mass and bolt, two load transfer mechanisms are involved: the axial tensioning (axial shearing at the bolt-grout interface, in essence) and the lateral shearing. Axial tensioning was the common focus in past studies, whereas lateral shearing is attracting more attention at present. The strength of the bolt when subjected to both shear and tensile loads is smaller than bolt strength when subjected to tensile load only. Thus, ignoring the shear load in bolting design probably leads to a higher safety factor. Hence, a deep understanding of bolt behaviour subjected to combined loads is essential in bolting system design and assessment. In the past, a number of experimental and theoretical investigations were conducted on the shear behaviour of the rock discontinuity reinforced by rock bolts and a few preliminary conclusions were drawn. Yet, few studies were performed on the shear behaviour of cable bolted rock discontinuities. Thus, this research investigated the shear performance of cable bolted rock discontinuities both experimentally and theoretically to provide more knowledge in this area. A series of experimental studies were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour of cable bolted concrete joints (representing rock discontinuity) and relevant influencing factors. Double shear tests with joint friction were carried out and test results were analysed in respect of joint shear strength, joint shear displacement, joint shear stiffness, cable pre-tension effect, cable wire surface profile effect, cable failure mode and the shear force-axial force relationship. Double shear tests without joint friction were also carried out using a modified double shear test apparatus. By comparing the double shear tests with and without joint friction, the joint friction and the cable dowel effects on the shear behaviour of cabled concrete joints were studied. British standard single shear tests were also carried out on four cable bolts and were compared with double shear tests. The comparison showed that the joint shear strength from the British standard single shear tests was {{much smaller than the}} double shear test results and the reason was analysed. Bolts used in underground rock engineering include Fibre Glass (FG) bolts, steel rebar bolts and cable bolts. Since these three types of bolts have different mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, shear strength and axial tensile modulus, their reinforcing effect on rock discontinuities are expected to be different. Thus in this study, cable bolts were compared with FG bolts and steel rebar bolts in terms of reinforcing concrete joints with consideration of their basic mechanical properties. Comparison showed that the influence of their basic mechanical properties on their reinforcing effect on concrete joints was evident. Since the mechanical properties of FG bolts was completely different from the other two types, the FG bolt reinforcing effect on the concrete joint was entirely different. The reinforcing effect of cable bolts and steel rebar bolts was more similar due to their similar mechanical properties. Apart from the experimental investigations, an analytical study was also carried out based on the statically indeterminate beam theory and some conclusions drawn from existing test results, with consideration of most pertinent influencing factors. An analytical model was proposed and compared with the double shear test results, which showed close agreement. In the light of the proposed theoretical method, parametric investigations were performed on four influencing factors, including cable pre-tension, joint friction coefficient, concrete strength and cable installation angle. From the parametric investigations, it was known that the joint friction coefficient and the concrete strength influenced the cable bolted joint shear strength in a consistent manner. However, the cable pre-tension and the cable installation angle affected the cabled joint shear strength in an inconsistent manner. In addition, the cable pre-tension showed opposite influences on cabled joint shear strength when changing the <b>cable</b> failure <b>modulus,</b> which was consistent with the double shear tests on the plain wire cable and the indented wire cable...|$|R
