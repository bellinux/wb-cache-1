30|$|The {{second reason}} why states with large state-funded HCBS {{programs}} experience lower efficiency {{could be because}} of problems in targeting. Since state programs require that services be provided for all eligible individuals, states are limited {{in their ability to}} carve-out services by geography or <b>cost.</b> <b>Waiver</b> programs require that the participants be nursing home certifiable and cost neutral. Waivers, therefore ensure the substitution of high cost institutional service with less expensive HCBS. Correct targeting has long been recognized as an important ingredient for achieving cost effectiveness in HCBS (Grabowski [2006]; Kemper [1988]).|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of sales laws, broadly speaking, {{should be to}} facilitate the contribution which private bargains can make to achieving desired social goals, such as economic efficiency, and to prevent bargains from yielding unacceptable outcomes, such as the exploitation of weak parties. These objectives cannot be realized, however, without {{an understanding of the}} contribution which bargains can make toward achieving particular social goals, the requisite conditions for bargaining effectiveness, and the situations in which exploitation is possible. The unfortunate regulatory choices often made by the Uniform Commercial Code (the Code) are generally explicable as resting on misapprehensions as to {{one or more of these}} matters. I have elsewhere sought to document these misapprehensions in three areas. Initially, I argued that the two goals of optimizing the costs which defective products yield and preventing parties from bearing concentrated losses when defects occur can best be achieved through bargains, but only if the parties thereto are sufficiently informed. I concluded, therefore, that the state should either fill information gaps where they exist or structure the transactions of uninformed parties. The Code, misunderstanding this, neither provides information nor structures bargains. I have also argued that consumer buyers cannot bargain rationally with respect to clauses requiring them to waive defenses against third party financers of sales, nor can they rationally contract out of the holder in due course rule, because the information to price the risks which the inability to assert defenses against financers imposes on such buyers is lacking and cannot be made available except at prohibitive <b>cost.</b> <b>Waiver</b> of defense clauses should thus be prohibited and the holder in due course rule, as applied to consumer sales, should be repealed. The Code fails to do either. Finally, I have argued that the problems posed by unequal bargaining power between sellers and buyers, except as such inequality arises from differential access to information, are not susceptible to sensible solution by the judicial process. The Code, in part because it rests on erroneous assumptions as to how economic power shapes bargains, delegates much of the task of regulating that power to the courts. This article further documents the allegation that the Code 2 ̆ 7 s regulation of sales transactions frequently rests on misapprehensions regarding the manner in which bargains operate, and thus fails to maximize the contribution of bargains to social welfare. Its subject will be the law regulating the parties 2 ̆ 7 rights when sellers deliver non-conforming goods...|$|E

50|$|The Foundation is {{actively}} involved in programs that improve air quality throughout the state of California, and has administered the California Department of Consumer Affairs—Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR) Smog Check Referee program and Call Center since 2004. Referee Centers are located on 31 Community College campuses and two vocational centers, and offer {{students the opportunity to}} gain on-the-job training in the automotive industry. Over 100 students are trained through these centers each year. The Referee program assists consumers with routine California Smog Check appointments and specialized services such as locating hard-to-find parts, certifying exemptions, and issuing <b>cost</b> <b>waivers.</b> In addition, the Foundation operates a Call Center that assists consumers in scheduling smog check appointments and answering questions about automotive smog issues.|$|R
50|$|In early 2000, the Canadian Firearms Program {{released}} a report that showed that implementation costs were rising. Major backlogs in registration—largely {{as a result of}} firearm owners waiting until the last minute to apply—general increase in <b>costs,</b> fee <b>waivers</b> for early applications, and high error rates in applications submitted by firearm owners were all cited as contributing factors to the rising costs. Although not reported, many political scientists believe the real reason behind rising costs and time was due to government inefficiency, and not the fault of gun owners.|$|R

This paper presents the latest program trends in the three Medicaid home and community-based services programs (waivers, home health, and state-plan personal care) and reports {{a national survey of}} cost control policies used on waiver programs in 2002. The findings show slowing annual rates of participation growth on individual programs, widespread use of <b>cost</b> controls on <b>waivers</b> including waiting lists, and the persistence of large interstate variations in Medicaid’s provision of these services...|$|R

5000|$|In December 2010, Baruah e-mailed the Indo-Asian News Service {{reporting}} that his elder son (19) has been abducted in Bangladesh [...] "to exert mental pressure {{on his family}} and {{to force him to}} surrender." [...] Later, the ULFA said that his son was beaten sorely by the kidnappers [...] "to pressure him to disclose his father's whereabouts, sources of income and business", but was allowed to leave after painstaking interrogation. The organisation further claimed that Baruah's son was terrified to stay tight-lipped about his kidnapping. In his e-mail, Baruah also wrote: [...] "My son is not important or bigger than my people and the cause for which we are struggling. No one can make me or my family weak just because my son has been kidnapped, and let me tell you, we are prepared to sacrifice our son but at no <b>cost</b> I would <b>waiver</b> on my stand." [...] He described the incident as a stratagem of Indian officials but they denied the accusation.|$|R
40|$|The Medicaid {{program is}} a unique example of a federal/state partnership, {{administered}} by states under federal program standards and regulations, and funded through shared federal and state government responsibility for program <b>costs.</b> Program <b>waivers</b> and other individual state options give states flexibility to tailor the program to meet state-specific needs and constraints. The Medicaid expansion provision contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Supreme Court ruling making program expansion voluntary provides both the opportunity and the necessity for increased state-based response to health reform efforts. State-based health reform activities through Medicaid program changes, waivers and innovative strategies {{are likely to become}} more important in health reform than federal policies. This qualitative, descriptive study reviews the evolution of Medicaid and examines the current Medicaid program through the lens of state response to the ACA 2 ̆ 7 s Medicaid expansion. The research classifies states {{on the basis of their}} Medicaid expansion plans and examines their plans in the context of political, economic, demographic, and health care infrastructure characteristics. A comprehensive examination of the development and evolution of the innovative Medicaid model in Oregon is the centerpiece of this paper, providing a framework for review of other state-based Medicaid reform initiatives. Oregon is one of the leaders in state-based health reform efforts and is currently in the midst of ambitious Medicaid health reform initiatives. The research examines Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s model and its impact on health care access, quality, and cost and considers the potential application of the Oregon model (or parts of it) to other states.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the cost/benefit of tax {{incentives}} and performance indicators of Grendene S/A footwear company {{in the period of}} 2010 to 2014. The research is justified by the importance of companies seeking techniques and methodologies that are more advantageous corporately to achieve better performance. In this sense, the accounting is shown as an important tool, acting as a source of information for decision-making and wealth measurement of their investors. The methodology will be through case study in a company in the footwear sector, listed on the BM & FBovespa, with data in the periods of 2010 to 2014 available at the base of Economatica and the Financial Statements. Having the data has been identified, the modalities of tax incentives that the company benefited during the study, as well as the traditional performance indicators. To analyze the cost/benefit of tax incentives was used data from DVA and tax subsidies provided in the notes to DFPs. The results show that the company needs a constant and effective monitoring of {{the costs and benefits of}} tax waiver. Also identifies that the value of tax incentives received does not equal proportion the generation of net wealth. The results of this study confirm the theoretical basis that the benefits brought by tax incentives outnumber the <b>costs</b> of tax <b>waiver,</b> but may represent a dangerous dependence as to jeopardize the continuity of the company if they were removed...|$|R
40|$|In 2002, {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 1. 3 million persons living with HIV/AIDS in the U. S. with 40, 000 new infections reported annually. Among publicly funded programs, Medicaid was the largest public payer of HIV/AIDS care with 9. 3 billion spent in 2004. Since 1985, states have {{had the option of}} providing Medicaid long-term care services to eligible persons with HIV/AIDS through the 1915 (c) home and community-based service (HCBS) waiver program. While it is known that annual Medicaid HCBS waiver expenditures and participants continued to grow through the early 2000 s, albeit unevenly between states and programs, little is known about recent trends in waivers targeted to persons living with HIV/AIDS. This paper provides analyses of the most recent and comprehensive available data on national program data for all Medicaid HIV/AIDS waivers for the period 1992 - 2002, the results of a national survey of policies used on these waivers in 2002, and a comparison of the costs of serving persons with HIV/AIDS in institutions and in waiver programs. Among the significant results is the general {{decline in the number of}} HIV/AIDS waivers, participation rates on waivers and large numbers of unused waiver slots. Discussions with state officials also revealed that new treatment options have reduced effective demand for HIV/AIDS waiver services. Finally, the results indicate that even with stringent cost control requirements on many waivers, national public estimated <b>cost</b> savings on <b>waivers</b> compared to institutional care for persons living with HIV/AIDS was 155 million in 2002...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{pressing}} need to retain dually eligible elderly Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in the community. The {{objective of this}} study was to examine median personal care services (PCS) hours, and how increasing PCS to the median (for those below), might delay nursing home placement (NHP) and save cost. Methods: Retrospective study of PCS hours, costs, and NHP in a statewide home and community based waiver program in the Midwest serving 6525 dually eligible Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries aged 65 and older. Two Minimum Data Set-Home Care assessments and Medicaid claim files were examined to identify PCS hours and cost. A model was developed to estimate costs of increasing PCS to the median to compare retaining at home compared to NHP. Results: Participants with PCS greater than the median hours had a NHP rate of 25 %, compared to 36 % for those with less than median PCS hours. To attain a 25 % NHP rate of participants below the median, we estimated savings by subtracting the usual monthly <b>cost</b> of the <b>waiver</b> ($ 960) from the monthly NHP cost and adding the cost of the additional PCS ($ 15. 67 /hour). For this sample, a total of $ 155, 088 per month could be saved by adding PCS hours to the median. Conclusion: The NHP rate could be reduced from 25 – 36 %, and savings of nearly $ 2 million a year could be realized by increasing PCS hours to the median and retaining participants in the waiver program. Evaluating waiver participants who are below the median number and increasing those who need it could help retain participants in the home setting, where they most want to be, and allow for tremendous cost savings...|$|R
