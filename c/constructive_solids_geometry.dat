However another representation is possible: a shape may be described implicitly,in terms of the method of its construction.

40|$|Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) {{trees have}} some qualities {{that make them}} useful in solving many {{graphics}} related problems. The purpose is to describe what a BSP tree is, {{and how it can}} be used to solve the problem of hidden surface removal, and <b>constructive</b> <b>solid</b> <b>geometry.</b> The BSP tree is based on the idea that a plane acting as a divider subdivides space into two parts with one being on the positive side and the other on the negative. A polygonal solid is then represented as the volume defined by the collective interior half spaces of the solid's bounding surfaces. The nature of how the tree is organized lends itself well for sorting polygons relative to an arbitrary point in 3 space. The speed at which the tree can be traversed for depth sorting is fast enough to provide hidden surface removal at interactive speeds. The fact that a BSP tree actually represents a polygonal solid as a bounded volume also makes it quite useful in performing the boolean operations used in <b>constructive</b> <b>solid</b> <b>geometry.</b> Due to the nature of the BSP tree, polygons can be classified as they are subdivided. The ability to classify polygons as they are subdivided can enhance the simplicity of implementing <b>constructive</b> <b>solid</b> <b>geometry...</b>|$|R

40|$|Constraints are {{described}} for <b>Constructive</b> <b>Solid</b> <b>Geometry</b> which {{ensure that a}} scene composed of solids is described uniquely, up to a choice of the decomposition of compound solids into primitive ones. The constraints can be applied more easily to an Additive <b>Constructive</b> <b>Solid</b> <b>Geometry</b> which is also better suited to implementation on a parallel architecture. <b>Constructive</b> <b>Solid</b> <b>Geometry</b> (CSG) {{has been used in}} several model-based vision programs, most notably in ACRONYM 1. This paper examines {{some of the problems that}} arise with CSG and proposes constraints that make CSG a unique representation of scenes. It is also suggested that Additive <b>Constructive</b> <b>Solid</b> <b>Geometry</b> (ACSG) is more useful for vision because it leads to simpler computation of connectivity, within and between objects, and can be implemented more readily on a parallel architecture. The motivation for examining the properties of a formal modelling system arises from what we shall call the strong thesis of model-based vision. The principal tenet is that all image features required to verify a model can be derived automatically from a model and knowledge of the optics of image formation. That is, models should provide complete knowledge of visual form which can, in principle, be used to solve any visual problem. The subsidiary tenet is that there is a two-way mapping between image locations and instantiated models. Thus, in principle, it is possible for analysis to proceed both top-down from instantiated models to the image and bottom-up from the image to instantiated models. This latter property underlies the definition of visual knowledge as "knowledge which can be brought into a two-way, spatial mapping with an image " (compare with Sloman's similar definition 2). Thus, in model-based vision, models provide a justification for the particular image processing techniques used. They provide a deep knowledge of image processing and mediate between image processing and the rest of the system's knowledge. If models are to be used automatically by an intelligent vision program then it is important that the models and modelling processes are well formed and do not require human intervention...|$|R

40|$|Modeling {{two-dimensional}} and three-dimensional objects is {{an important}} theme in computer graphics. Two main types of models are used in both cases: boundary representations, which represent the surface of an object explicitly but represent its interior only implicitly, and <b>constructive</b> <b>solid</b> <b>geometry</b> representations, which model a complex object, surface and interior together, as a boolean combination of simpler objects. Because neither representation is good for all applications, conversion {{between the two is}} often necessary. We consider the problem of converting boundary representations of polyhedral objects into <b>constructive</b> <b>solid</b> <b>geometry</b> (CSG) representations. The CSG representations for a polyhedron P are based on the half-spaces supporting the faces of P. For certain kinds of polyhedra this problem is equivalent to the corresponding problem for simple polygons in the plane.
