When a <b>cyclical</b> <b>stock</b> is at a low PE ratio, alongside record-high profits that have grown for several years, the market is anticipating a downturn. When a cyclical reaches a high PE on very low earnings, the price may be ready for an upturn because earnings will be at or near their nadir.|$|E
40|$|Client {{mistrust of}} advisers, {{products}} and markets by Keith Redhead 2 The {{purpose of this}} paper is to show that the problem of trust relates to all three levels of financial engagement by a retail investor. (1) Engagement with the adviser who advises on financial products. (2) Engagement with the financial institutions that produce the financial products. (3) Engagement with the stock markets in which the financial products are invested. It is proposed that these three levels could be factors in a three-factor model analogous to multi-factor forms of the capital asset pricing model. At each level there are reasons for mistrust arising from perceptions of risk. This mistrust arises from the clients, the agencies with which the clients engage, and the nature of the engagement. The perceptions of risk, and the corresponding degrees of trust, are influenced by many factors. The degrees of trust are unlikely to be constant, and may even be <b>cyclical.</b> <b>Stock</b> market performance is one influence on trust. Also trust influences levels of investment, and thereby stock market performance. The relationship exhibits reflexivity. There appears to be a role for marketing in influencing levels of public trust; not only in investment products but also in advisers and markets. ...|$|E

In bad times, small, value and <b>cyclical</b> <b>stocks</b> are riskier than big, growth and noncyclical stocks, thereby explaining the value, size and cyclical premia. In contrast, in good times, value, big and noncyclical stocks generate higher average returns than do growth, small and <b>cyclical</b> <b>stocks,</b> {{despite the fact that they}} are not riskier. Furthermore, empirical tests of macroeconomic models highlight that average returns are commensurate with risk only in bad times.

40|$|We {{find that}} on average an {{announcement}} of rising unemployment is 'good news' for stocks during economic expansions and 'bad news' during economic contractions. Thus stock prices usually increase on news of rising unemployment, since {{the economy is}} usually in an expansion phase. We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. Unemployment news bundles two primitive types of information relevant for valuing stocks: information about future interest rates and future corporate earnings and dividends. A rise in unemployment typically signals a decline in interest rates, which {{is good news for}} stocks, as well as a decline in future corporate earnings and dividends, which is bad news for stocks. The nature of the bundle [...] and hence the relative importance of the two effects [...] changes over time depending {{on the state of the}} economy.

Based on research defined by Nordin brothers and Ismail (2014) and supported by Rostamy, Hosseini and Bakhshitakanlou (2013) these factors are leading indicators that affect stock returns of mining and resources. This research is using non-random sampilng method for macroeconomic data in Australia, and it is analyzed with regression. Variable USD/AUD, interest rates, oil prices, AORD index and gold prices are partially and simultaniously analyzed regarding effect to the stock returns of mining and resources in Australian capital market. The results showed that in Australian capital market, the USD/AUD do not have effect with stock returns of mining and resources, interest rates do not have effect with stock returns of mining and it has negative effect with stock returns of resources, other variabels such as oil prices, AORD index and gold price have positive effect with stock returns of mining and resources.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{investigate}} Chinese bull and bear markets. The Chinese {{stock market has}} experienced {{a long period of}} bear cycle from early 2000 until 2006, and then it fluctuated greatly until 2010. However, the <b>cyclical</b> behaviour of <b>stock</b> markets during this period is less well established. This paper aims to answer the question why the Chinese stock market experienced a long duration of bear market and what factors would have impacted this cyclical behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: By comparing the intervals of bull and bear markets between stocks and indices based on a Markov switching model, this paper examines whether different industries or A- and B-share markets could lead to different <b>stock</b> market <b>cyclical</b> behaviour and whether firm size can determine the relationship between the firm stock cycles on the market cycles. Findings: This paper finds a high degree of overlapping of bear cycles between stocks and indices and a high level of overlapping between the bear market and a fraction of stock with increasing stock prices. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} stock performance and trading behaviour are widely diversified. Furthermore, the paper finds that the same industry may have different overlapping intervals of bull or bear cycles in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. Firms with different sizes could have different overlapping intervals with bull or bear cycles.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} empirically {{the role}} of stock prices in the aggregate investment function for an emerging market, Malaysia. The neoclassical investment theory that relates investment to output and lending rate and augmented with stock prices is used as an empirical basis. Applying a series of time series techniques, we document evidence suggesting favorable effects of stock market increases on aggregate investment especially in the long run. Likewise, the stock market seems to anticipate future variations in output. Reasonably, as suggested by our empirical results using vector error correction modeling, variance decompositions and impulse response functions, the aggregate investment tends to respond faster and with larger magnitude to stock price shocks than real output does. Having noted these, our analysis does not rule out adverse short run real effects of <b>cyclical</b> variations in <b>stock</b> prices...|$|R
40|$|How does {{stock market}} {{volatility}} {{relate to the}} business cycle? We develop, and estimate, a no-arbitrage model to study the <b>cyclical</b> properties of <b>stock</b> volatility and the risk-premiums the market requires to bear the risk of ‡uctuations in this volatility. The level of stock market volatility cannot be merely explained by business cycle factors. Rather, {{it relates to the}} presence of some unobserved factor. At the same time, our model predicts that such an unobservable factor cannot explain the ups and downs stock volatility experiences over time— the “volatility of volatility. ” Instead, the volatility of stock volatility relates to the business cycle. Finally, volatility risk-premiums are strongly countercyclical, even more so than stock volatility, and are partially responsible for the large swings in the VIX index occurred during the 2007 - 2009 subprime crisis, which our model does capture in out-of-sample experiments...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in {{time series analysis}} allow proper modelling of nonlinearities in economic and financial variables. A {{growing body of research}} was dedicated to investigation of potential nonlinearities in conditional mean of many economic and financial variables, mainly concentrating in developed economies. However, nonlinearities in financial variables in developing economies have not been fully examined yet. In this article we investigate potential nonlinearity and <b>cyclical</b> behaviour of <b>stock</b> returns in Europe's two largest emerging stock markets, mainly in the Greek and Turkish stock markets. Specifically, we use STAR family models, which allow to model nonlinearities in the conditional mean, for modelling monthly returns on stock exchange indices of the Athens Stock Exchange and Istanbul Stock Exchange. Although we find no nonlinearity in conditional variance, we do find strong evidence in favour of nonlinear adjustment of stock returns. It is found that allowing for nonlinearity in conditional mean results in a superior model and provides good out-of-sample forecasts, which contradicts to efficient market hypothesis. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{cyclical}} co-movements between US stocks {{and interest rates}} by testing a simple model where divergence between stock and bond price behavior is explained by “stock market strength,” where the latter depends on the market climate about future corporate profits—as captured by the corporate bond quality ratio—and an unexplained stock market sentiment. Using two different regression techniques to check for robustness, we find evidence of a statistically significant <b>cyclical</b> correlation between <b>stocks</b> and bonds. On {{the basis of this}} finding, we then present a methodology to “deflate” a stock price index such that we can compare stock market strength over time. This is obtained by removing the effect of a changing discount rate—as measured by our regressions—on stock prices. For example, viewed in this light, the past five years in the US stock market reveal a wider fluctuation in stock market strength than we can observe on the basis of stock price indices alone.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the arbitrage opportunities between US industry-level credit and stock markets with a focus on dynamic lead-lag relationships given that these markets involve heterogeneous agents operating over various time horizons. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use daily data of 11 US industries stock markets and their credit counterparts to model the dynamic dependence and casual nexuses using time-frequency approach, namely, wavelet squared coherence (WTC). Findings: The WTC estimation results show that credit and stock markets are out of phase (counter <b>cyclical)</b> and <b>stock</b> markets lead their credit counterparts. The coherence between two markets increases during financial crises. The banks (utilities) industry credit and stock markets have relatively high (low) dependence. Research limitations/implications: The casual nexuses between stock and credit markets have multilateral dimensions. Greater interest in examining the relationship between stock markets and credit default swap (CDS) spreads emerged as an important albeit a complex area of research, and gained prominence especially at the onset and following the global financial crises of 2007 - 2008 which clearly showed that the positive views of CDSs contribution in creating a resilient and efficient financial sector was nothing further from the truth. Practical implications: The arbitrage and hedging opportunities between stock and credit markets are industry dependent and vary over investment time horizons. The utilities industry seems attractive for the investment with the objective to exploit arbitrage, but not for hedging. Originality/value: The paper, for the first time, employs time-frequency approach to assess the arbitrage opportunities between US industry-level credit and stock markets...|$|R

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the degree of {{correlation}} between stock prices and productivity at different levels, i. e. analysis of the correlations between certain components of the two variables and how correlations {{vary according to the}} different frequencies characterising these variables. It should be acknowledged that the approach used is only designed to isolate the stylised facts related to the cyclical components of the variables under review and not to explain them. In particular, the method chosen cannot be used to make forecasts or to provide a refi ned economic interpretation of these stylised facts. Nonetheless, this analysis, applied to the United States and the euro area over the period 1973 (1) - 1985 (4), highlights the following points: • in the United States, an increase (or reduction) in the cyclical component of the rate of stock returns is positively correlated with current or future increases (or reductions) in that of the productivity growth rate; • in the euro area, this correlation is less strong. It appears, for example, that a sharp fall in stock prices precedes a marked decline in productivity (link between stock prices and future productivity) and, as a result, in profi ts. This fall could then be interpreted as a normal, even desirable, adjustment mechanism for asset prices. Correspondingly, a sharp rise in stock prices should not automatically be interpreted as the emergence of a future bubble given that such rises appear to foreshadow an increase in productivity and therefore in profi ts. Over the most recent period 1986 (1) - 2002 (4), these correlations appear less pronounced, thus indicating a possible break. Our result is robust given that two complementary methods corroborate it and that it is similar to Estrella’s (2003) fi ndings for the United States. This pattern appears to suggest that the <b>cyclical</b> component of <b>stock</b> prices is in phase with that of productivity.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Business administration. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The central objective of my dissertation is to study the behavior of firm-specific volatility in countries around the world. Consistent with existing literature, I use firm-specific volatility to measure two important concepts: the information content of stocks and firm-specific risk. In Chapter One I hypothesize that the institutional environment in a country has direct consequences on firm-specific risk. A stronger institutional environment results in higher product market competition, higher firm turnover, and higher rates of technological innovation. Consistent with my predictions, I find that creative destruction explains a significant proportion of the cross-sectional differences in firm specific volatility in 40 countries. In Chapter Two I look at the cyclical fluctuations of comovement in the US and 27 other countries during the period 1980 - 2005. I find that, in general, comovement tends to be countercyclical. Additionally, I find wide cross-sectional variation in the strength of association between comovement and the business cycle. This strength of association positively correlates to a measure of variability in information production. In turn, I find that the information environment can reduce variability in information production and reduce <b>cyclical</b> fluctuations in <b>stock</b> return correlations. Finally, in Chapter I find that idiosyncratic risk has explanatory power on the cross-section of expected returns in international markets. I find strong support to the theory in all countries under study. In eight of the fifteen countries surveyed the relation is significantly positive while in the remaining seven countries the relation is zero. In no instance do I find the relation to be negative. In addition, the results from my analysis are economically significant. I find that after controlling for stock characteristics (beta, size, and momentum) the response in excess returns to a 1 % increase in monthly-expected idiosyncratic risk ranges across countries between zero and one half of a percent...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, I provide {{evidence}} that investment-specific technological change {{is a source of}} systematic risk. In contrast to neutral productivity shocks, the economy needs to invest to realize the benefits of innovations in investment technology. A positive shock to investment technology is followed by a reallocation of resources from consumption to investment, leading to a negative price of risk. A portfolio of stocks that produce investment goods minus stocks that produce consumption goods (IMC) proxies for the shock and is a priced risk factor. The value of assets in place minus growth opportunities falls after positive shocks to investment technology, which suggests an explanation for the value puzzle. I formalize these insights in a dynamic general equilibrium model with two sectors of production. The model's implications are supported by the data. The IMC portfolio earns a negative premium, predicts investment and consumption {{in a manner consistent with}} the theory, and helps price the value cross section. In the second chapter, based on joint work with Igor Makarov, we use heteroscedasticity of stock returns as an identification tool to isolate four robust factors in the U. S. industry returns. The first factor can be viewed as a proxy for economy wide demand shocks. The second factor is a portfolio of stocks producing investment goods minus stocks producing consumption goods (IMC). The third factor differentiates between <b>cyclical</b> vs. non-cyclical <b>stocks.</b> Finally, the fourth factor is consistent with a proxy for shocks to input good prices. The extracted factors are shown to be important in explaining the cross-section of expected returns. Unlike the CAPM or the Fama and French three factor model, they successfully price the cross-section of 48 industry portfolios and do a good job at explaining the 25 Fama and French size and book-to-market portfolios. (cont.) The fourth ("input") factor is found to be a robust predictor of the value-weighted market portfolio. In the third chapter, based on joint work with Jiro Kondo, we propose a new foundation for the limits to arbitrage based on financial relationships between arbitrageurs and banks. Financially constrained arbitrageurs may choose to seek additional financing from banks who can understand their strategies. However, a hold-up problem arises because banks cannot commit to provide capital and have the financial technology to profit from the strategies themselves. Wary of this, arbitrageurs will choose to stay constrained and limit their correction of mispricing unless banks have sufficient reputational capital. Using the framework of stochastic repeated games, we show that this form of limited arbitrage arises when mispricing is largest and becomes more substantial as the degree of competition between banks intensifies and arbitrageur wealth increases. by Dimitris Papanikolaou.
