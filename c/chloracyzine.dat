40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>chloracyzine</b> (2 -chloro- 10 -(3 -diethylaminopropionyl) -phenothiazine hydrochloride; {{antianginal}} drug) on myocardial oxygen consumption were studied in open-chest cats and cat isolated hearts using oximetry and polarography respectively. It {{was found that}} <b>chloracyzine</b> produced a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption accompanied by a reduction in coronary blood flow preceded by transient coronary dilatation. <b>Chloracyzine</b> produced an insignificant increase in arterial pressure; heart rate increased slightly in the open-chest experiments {{but not in the}} isolated heart. It is suggested that reduced oxygen uptake after <b>chloracyzine</b> is realized through improved efficiency in the use of oxygen...|$|E
