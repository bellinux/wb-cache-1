40|$|Although much {{research}} has focused on how imprisonment transforms the life course of disadvantaged black men, researchers have paid little attention to how parental imprisonment alters the social experience of childhood. This article estimates the risk of parental imprisonment by age 14 for black and white <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> 1978 and 1990. This article also estimates the risk of parental imprisonment for children whose parents did not finish high school, finished high school only, or attended college. Results show the following: (1) 1 <b>in</b> 40 white <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> 1978 and 1 <b>in</b> 25 white <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> 1990 had a parent imprisoned; (2) 1 <b>in</b> 7 black <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> 1978 and 1 <b>in</b> 4 black <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> 1990 had a parent imprisoned; (3) inequality in the risk of parental imprisonment between white children of college-educated parents and all other children is growing; and (4) by age 14, 50. 5 % of black <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> 1990 to high school dropouts had a father imprisoned. These estimates, robustness checks, and extensions to longitudinal data indicate that parental imprisonment has emerged as a novel—and distinctively American—childhood risk that is concentrated among black children and children of low-education parents...|$|R

40|$|This paper updates {{an earlier}} {{analysis}} that examined children’s likelihood of being {{included in a}} benefit at different ages. We find that up until 2007, <b>children</b> <b>born</b> between 2000 and 2007 {{were less likely to}} be included as a dependent child in a main benefit than <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> the 1990 s at all ages.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Immigrant HIV-infected {{adults in}} industrialized {{countries}} show a poorer clinical and virologic outcome compared with native patients. We aimed to investigate potential differences in clinical, immunological, and virologic outcome <b>in</b> Dutch HIV-infected <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands (NL) versus <b>born</b> <b>in</b> Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) {{in a national}} cohort analysis. METHODS: We included all HIV-infected children registered between 1996 and 2013. Descriptive statistics, mixed-effects models, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate differences between groups. RESULTS: In total, 319 HIV-infected children were registered. The majority of these <b>children</b> were <b>born</b> <b>in</b> SSA (n = 148, 47 %) or NL (n = 113, 36 %) and most were black (n = 158, 61 %). <b>Children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> NL were diagnosed at a median age of 1. 2 years and initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) at a median age of 2. 6 years, compared with 3. 7 and 5. 3 years, respectively, for <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> SSA (HIV diagnosis: P < 0. 001; cART initiation: P < 0. 001). Despite a lower initial CD 4 T-cell Z-score <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> SSA, their immunological reconstitution was similar to children from NL. Virologic suppression was achieved {{in the majority of}} all cART-treated children (NL: 96 %, SSA: 94 %). There was no difference in the occurrence or timing of virologic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Most immigrant HIV-infected children living <b>in</b> NL were <b>born</b> <b>in</b> SSA. <b>Children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> SSA were diagnosed and initiated cART at an older age than <b>children</b> <b>born</b> <b>in</b> NL. Despite initial differences in CD 4 T-cell counts and HIV viral load, the long-term immunological and virologic response to cART was similar in both groups...|$|R
