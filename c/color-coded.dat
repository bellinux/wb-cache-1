40|$|A {{widely used}} method in {{high-speed}} 3 D shape measurement, <b>color-code</b> fringe projection requires {{the projection of}} only one image. In traditional <b>color-code</b> method, the projected fringe is compounded by sinusoidal fringes, grayscale value distribution ranges from 0 – 255, and projection speed is limited to 120 frames/s. Consequently, measurement speed is restricted, and a nonlinear gamma of the projector exists, as well as high harmonics, which have a great influence on measurement accuracy. Binary <b>color-code</b> fringe defocused projection is proposed to solve the abovementioned problems. With the proposed method, projection speed can switch to tens of K frames/s because it only has two grayscale values (0 and 255). A standard sinusoidal <b>color-code</b> fringe can be generated by properly defocusing the binary <b>color-code</b> fringe, thereby overcoming the influence of nonlinear gamma and ultimately improving measurement accuracy. Experiment results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|<b>Color-coding</b> is a {{technique}} to design fixed-parameter algorithms for several NP-complete subgraph isomorphism problems. Somewhat surprisingly, not much work {{has so far been}} spent on the actual implementation of algorithms that are based on <b>color-coding,</b> despite the elegance of this technique and its wide range of applicability to practically important problems. This work gives various novel algorithmic improvements for <b>color-coding,</b> both from a worst-case perspective as well as under practical considerations. We apply the resulting implementation to the identification of signaling pathways in protein interaction networks, demonstrating that our improvements speed up the <b>color-coding</b> algorithm by orders of magnitude over previous implementations. This allows more complex and larger structures to be identified in reasonable time; many biologically relevant instances can even be solved in seconds where, previously, hours were required...|$|R

5|$|In the Case 1 diagram, B1 cells show {{canonical}} values, {{which are}} <b>color-coded</b> {{to show their}} row-wise distribution in B2 triplets. Colors reflect distribution but not location or values. For this case: the B2 top row triplet (r21) has 1 value from B1 middle triplet, the other colorings can now be deduced. E.g. the B2 bottom row triplet (r23) coloring is forced by r21: the other 2 B1 middle values must go to bottom, etc. Fill {{in the number of}} B2 options for each color, 3..1, beginning top left. The B3 color-coding is omitted since the B3 choices are row-wise determined by B1, B2. B3 always contributes 3! permutations per row triplet, or 63 for the block.|$|E

House and Senate congressional members distributed free tickets for the inaugural ceremony to the public by lottery or on a first‑come, first served basis because of overwhelming requests to attend the event.|$|E
5|$|The driver's {{clothing}} was <b>color-coded</b> {{in accordance with}} his faction, which would help distant spectators {{to keep track of}} the race's progress. According to Tertullian, there were originally just two factions, White and Red, sacred to winter and summer respectively. As fully developed, there were four factions, the Red, White, Green, and Blue. Each team could have up to three chariots each in a race. Members of the same team often collaborated with each other against the other teams, for example to force them to crash into the spina (a legal and encouraged tactic). Drivers could switch teams, much like athletes can be traded to different teams today.|$|E
5|$|The story tracks Joule Adams, one of {{the first}} volunteers for the utopian colony of Far Eden, who wakes after centuries in cryo-sleep to find that nothing has gone {{according}} to plan. With her three robotic machines known as corebot companions, Joule ventures throughout Far Eden to uncover the secrets behind the failed mission. The open world environment of Far Eden is subject to exploration and the collection of resources. Joule's weapons are <b>color-coded</b> to inflict damage on a particular set of enemies and, like her companions, can also be enhanced. The corebots support her in battle and puzzle solving.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} how people interpret <b>color-coding</b> systems used for visual communication. We approached this question by considering {{two types of}} assignment problems. There is an encoding assignment problem, in which a designer selects which color to pair with each concept in the color coding system, and a decoding assignment problem, in which the observer infers which color the designer paired with each concept in the <b>color-coding</b> system.|$|R

5|$|He {{started with}} a {{collection}} of seven basic statistics (assists, blocks, fouls, points, rebounds, steals, and turnovers) from Yahoo! Sports on every NBA player from the previous season and adjusted the stats for time in play. The software grouped the players into <b>color-coded</b> nodes and connected them with lines that represented statistical similarities. Alagappan had expected the software to create five groups of nodes by statistical advantages, which would each represent a position of play, but the software instead returned 13 node groups representing 13 mathematically described positions. The assignments compare player statistics and not individual style. Originally unconfident in his results, he explored the data on his own for a week before sharing his findings with his bosses and basketball statisticians including Ken Pomeroy, who replied in encouragement. He then applied and was accepted to speak at the 2012 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. By May 2012, at least four NBA teams and one MLB team had contacted Ayasdi about using their technology.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 Egyptian {{armor and}} {{anti-tank}} units {{on the west}} bank began moving to the crossing sites. Fifteen minutes later engineers completed the assembly of all 35 ferries and waited for the breaches to be opened. By 18:30 the bridgeheads were nearly five kilometers (3mi) deep. With Israeli artillery on the Bar Lev Line eliminated, the immobile SA-2 and SA-3 units were moved forward. From 22:30 to 01:30 after midnight, all bridges—eight heavy and four light—were laid, and along with the ferries, began transporting reinforcements to the opposite bank. In the far south of the canal, at 19th Division's sector, the sand turned into mud making it difficult to clear. Consequently, four ferries and three bridges assigned to that division were deployed seven hours behind schedule. Periodically the bridges were relocated to confuse Israeli air strikes targeting them—the Egyptians had opened 60 passages but were operating only 12 bridges, allowing each bridge to be moved to one of five passages. Throughout the night and up to the following morning, tanks and vehicles kept crossing the canal. Military police were responsible for directing this enormous traffic, utilizing <b>color-coded</b> signs.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} a city on the planet Efate. Here, as on all explorable planets in this game, the player observes the party and its {{surroundings}} from a directly overhead {{point of view and}} issues commands via hotkeys or clickable icons displayed onscreen. The explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions. Cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets, including a store for purchasing or selling armor, weapons and other items, a library, hospital, police station, and a starport for launching and outfitting a spaceship. Some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non-player characters are located. Building types are <b>color-coded</b> for easier player identification. The player directs the party's movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non-player characters, using objects or firing a weapon. Combat takes place in real-time and requires the player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons, reload, or move to a better position.|$|E
