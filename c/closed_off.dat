50|$|The {{soft palate}} is moveable, {{consisting}} of muscle fibers sheathed in mucous membrane. It {{is responsible for}} <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the nasal passages during the act of swallowing, and also for <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the airway.

5|$|In 2005, Federal Street, a major {{downtown}} thoroughfare {{that was}} <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> {{to create a}} pedestrian-oriented plaza, was reopened to through traffic. The downtown area has seen the razing of structurally unsound buildings and the expansion or restoration of others.|$|E
5|$|In {{systems like}} the London Underground, {{stations}} are simply <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> {{when they are}} overcrowded, such as the busy Oxford Circus tube station, which had to close more than 100 times in a year. That type of restriction is not necessary yet on the New York City Subway, according to MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz.|$|E

5|$|Erosion {{along the}} eastern border and {{deposition}} along the north coast altered {{the shape of the}} East Anglian coastline during Roman and Anglo-Saxon times (and continues to do so today).

5|$|Forest fires {{seasonally}} {{clear the}} park of dead vegetation, making way for new growth. These fires damage the income generated by tourism.

The Rim Fire in 2013 destroyed nearly $2 billion in assets and revenue, though natural woodland assets are renewable, and <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> much of the park to tourists. This rim fire was the third largest on record, and burned nearly 500 acres of wild habitat.|$|E

5|$|Four months later, in May 2005, {{a second}} spike {{had to be}} cut off by firefighters after it was {{discovered}} hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment {{put in place to}} prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E
5|$|Hooper {{was born}} in England but has not {{represented}} the national team at any level. In March 2011 {{it was thought that}} he may be eligible to represent Scotland. However, this possibility was later <b>closed</b> <b>off.</b> Since his move to Celtic he has been considered for England duty and was called up to the under-21 squad for a friendly but had to pull out due to injury. He was then included in the provisional squad for the 2011 European Under-21 Championship but did not go to the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, {{part of the}} {{mezzanine}} was <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> so the MTA {{could build}} a mockup of the proposed R211 subway car.

The dolphins are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the dolphins are caught one by one and killed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and 1980s the stand {{accommodated}} the away fans. Previously {{it was open}} to home supporters. The lower tier of the old stand was terracing and this was <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> {{by the turn of}} the 1980s due to it being a fire hazard as the terracing steps were wooden. The front concrete terracing remained and was one of the last standing areas at a Premiership ground.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, NY17 was rerouted onto a new limited-access highway, {{known as}} the Quickway, in the {{vicinity}} of Hancock and Cadosia. The former routing of NY17 remained state maintained as an extension of NY989 and NY990P between the two locations. All of NY990P was redesignated as NY268 between 1989 and 1993. In the floods of 2006 between June25 and July5, some of the areas along NY268 suffered serious landslides and, as a result, was temporarily <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> by the New York State Department of Transportation. The road was reopened to traffic in mid-July.|$|E

5|$|On the {{day before}} Reagan's 1987 visit, 50,000 people had {{demonstrated}} against {{the presence of the}} American president in Berlin. During the visit itself, wide swaths of Berlin were <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> to prevent further anti-Reagan protests. The district of Kreuzberg, in particular, was targeted in this respect, with movement throughout this portion of the city in effect restrained completely (for instance the subway line 1 was shut down).|$|E
5|$|Three dams {{were built}} {{from the island}} to the mainland. The center dam divided the dock area in half, another was further west and a third dam {{extended}} east across {{what would be the}} entrance. The two outer dams completely <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> the site from the sea. The center dam was built without much difficulty by simply tipping material to form an embankment, although some of the earth sank into the mud, so more had to be added.|$|E
