25|$|The {{national}} fiscal {{accounts for}} the previous full calendar year are released each year in April (next time 23 April 2015). As the compliance check for both the debt and deficit criteria always awaits this release in a new calendar year, the first possible month to request a compliance check will be April, which {{would result in a}} data check for the HICP and interest rates during the reference year from 1 April to 31 March. Any EU member state may also ask the European Commission to conduct a compliance check, at any point of time during the remainder of the year, with HICP and interest rates always checked for the past 12 months – while debt and deficit compliance always will be checked for the three-year period encompassing the last completed full calendar year and the two subsequent forecast years. As of 10 August 2015, none of the remaining euro derogation states without an opt-out had entered ERM-II, which makes it highly unlikely that any of them will request that the European Commission conduct an extraordinary compliance check ahead of the publication of the next regular <b>convergence</b> <b>report</b> scheduled June 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{the euro}} was {{scheduled}} to be adopted by Romania in place of the leu by 2014.

[...] The governor of the National Bank of Romania argued in November 2012 that it had been a financial benefit for Romania to not {{be a part of the}} euro area during the European debt crisis, but that the country in the years ahead would strive to comply with all the convergence criteria. In April 2013 Romania submitted their annual Convergence Programme to the European Commission, which for the first time did not specify a target date for euro adoption.

40|$|This note quantifies the {{movements}} {{in the distribution of}} future short-term market interest rates in reaction to the selection of countries that were to participate in stage three of Economic and Monetary Union as of 1 January 1999. We conclude that, before the various national central banks and the European Monetary Institute published their <b>convergence</b> <b>reports,</b> financial markets were already convinced that Italy would participate. They furthermore interpreted these reports, when published, as an indication that Italy would indeed participate. The official decision in May 1998 therefore came as no surprise. ...|$|R

The reason why the lime-green values are only estimates is that the [...] "outlier" [...] selection (ignoring certain states from the reference value calculation) besides depending on a quantitative assessment also depends on a more complicated overall qualitative assessment, and hence {{it can not be}} predicted with absolute certainty which of the states the Commission will deem to be outliers. So any selection of outliers by the lime-green data lines shall only be regarded as qualified estimates, which potentially could be different from those outliers which the Commission would have selected if they had published a specific report at the concerned point of time.|$|E

However, Jürgen Stark, a Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, has stated that [...] "Iceland {{would not be able}} to adopt the EU currency without first becoming a member of the EU". Iceland subsequently applied for EU membership. [...] As of the ECB's May 2012 <b>convergence</b> <b>report,</b> Iceland did not meet any of the convergence criteria. [...] One year later, the country had achieved compliance with the deficit criteria and had begun to decrease its debt-to-GDP ratio, but still suffered from elevated HICP inflation and long-term governmental interest rates. On 13 September 2013, a newly elected government dissolved the accession negotiation team and thus suspended Iceland's application to join the European Union until a referendum can be held on whether or not the accession negotiations should resume; if negotiations do resume, after they are completed the public will then have the opportunity in a second referendum to vote on [...] "whether or not Iceland shall join the EU on the negotiated terms".|$|E

50|$|The ECB {{publishes a}} <b>Convergence</b> <b>Report</b> {{at least every}} two years to check how well the EU members {{aspiring}} for euro adoption comply with the criteria. The first full <b>convergence</b> <b>report</b> was published in November 1996, and concluded that only 3 out of 15 EU member states (Denmark, Luxembourg and Ireland) were completely compliant with the criteria {{at that point in}} time. As a majority of states were not in compliance, the Council decided to delay the introduction of the euro by two years to 1 January 1999. In March 1998 a more positive second <b>convergence</b> <b>report</b> concluded that 11 out of 12 applying countries were prepared for the electronic introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, with only Greece failing to qualify by the deadline. Subsequent convergence reports have so far resulted in an additional 8 EU member states complying with all criteria and adopting the euro (Greece, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). The latest <b>convergence</b> <b>report</b> was published in June 2014, and checked for compliance in the reference year from May 2012 - April 2014, where Lithuania managed to fully comply - thus becoming the next 19th eurozone member. As the reference values for HICP inflation and long-term interest rates change on a monthly basis, any member state with a euro derogation has the right to ask the ECB for an updated compliance check, whenever they believe they have met all both economic and legal convergence criteria. For example, Latvia asked for such an extraordinary compliance check in March 2013 (outside the regular 2-year interval for automatic assessments).|$|E

These events typically occur during February-April (FMA), the main rainy season for Angola / northern Namibia. Eleven of these events have occurred in this sixty year period and each experiences increased rainfall somewhere in coastal Angola, and in ten cases, somewhere in northern Namibia. Attention is focussed on the five events with the largest and most widespread positive rainfall anomalies over Africa south of 10 oS; namely, 1963, 1986, 2001, 2006, 2011. All of these five events experienced increased moisture flux from the western tropical Indian Ocean, warm SST anomalies also in the south west Indian Ocean, and most also showed increased westerly moisture flux from the tropical south east Atlantic.
