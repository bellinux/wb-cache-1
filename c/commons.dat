5|$|Coke {{undertook}} {{the central}} role in framing and writing the Petition of Right. The ongoing struggles over martial law and civil liberties, along with {{the rejection of the}} Resolutions seriously concerned the <b>Commons.</b> Accordingly, Coke convinced the Lords to meet with the <b>Commons</b> in April 1628 in order to discuss a petition to the King confirming the rights and liberties of royal subjects. The <b>Commons</b> immediately accepted this, and after a struggle, the Lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by Coke to draft the eventual document. Hearing of this, the King sent a message to Parliament forbidding the <b>Commons</b> from discussing matters of state. The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their fear that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. Coke, despite the fear in Parliament, stood and spoke, citing historical precedents supporting the principle that members of the <b>Commons</b> could, within Parliament, say whatever they wished – something now codified as Parliamentary privilege.|$|E

After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts, Disraeli entered the House of <b>Commons</b> in 1837. In 1846 the Prime Minister at the time, Sir Robert Peel, split the party over his proposal to repeal the Corn Laws, which involved ending the tariff on imported grain. Disraeli clashed with Peel in the House of <b>Commons.</b> Disraeli became a major figure in the party. When Lord Derby, the party leader, thrice formed governments in the 1850s and 1860s, Disraeli served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of <b>Commons.</b>|$|E

5|$|In November 1834, the Leader of the House of <b>Commons</b> and Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Charles Spencer, Viscount Althorp, {{inherited}} a peerage, thus removing {{him from the}} House of <b>Commons</b> to the Lords. Melbourne had to appoint a new <b>Commons</b> leader and a new Chancellor (who by long custom, must {{be drawn from the}} <b>Commons),</b> but the only candidate whom Melbourne felt suitable to replace Althorp as <b>Commons</b> leader was Lord John Russell, who William (and many others) found unacceptable due to his radical politics. William claimed that the ministry had been weakened beyond repair and used the removal of Lord Althorp—who had previously indicated that he would retire from politics upon becoming a peer—as the pretext for the dismissal of the entire ministry. With Lord Melbourne gone, William chose to entrust power to a Tory, Sir Robert Peel. Since Peel was then in Italy, the Duke of Wellington was provisionally appointed Prime Minister. When Peel returned and assumed leadership of the ministry for himself, he saw the impossibility of governing because of the Whig majority in the House of <b>Commons.</b> Consequently, Parliament was dissolved to force fresh elections. Although the Tories won more seats than in the previous election, they were still in the minority. Peel remained in office for a few months, but resigned after a series of parliamentary defeats. Lord Melbourne was restored to the Prime Minister's office, remaining there for the rest of William's reign, and the King was forced to accept Russell as <b>Commons</b> leader.|$|E
5|$|In response, the House of <b>Commons</b> {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, the <b>Commons</b> met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition of right was the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it {{was passed by the}} <b>Commons</b> on 8 May and sent to the House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition of Right was ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of the <b>Commons</b> to freely speak, he bowed to the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.|$|E
