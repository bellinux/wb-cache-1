50|$|Moving eastward at 95 km/h (60 mph), {{shortly after}} the JMA {{downgraded}} Songda to a severe tropical storm early on October 13, the system completed an extratropical transition south of the Aleutian Islands. After the system weakened into a gale-force low and crossed the 180th meridian again in the afternoon, the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Portland dubbed it the Ides of October storm on the next day. On October 15, the system turned northeastward and underwent an explosive intensification. The Ocean Prediction Center (OPC) reported that Post-Tropical Cyclone Songda developed into a hurricane-force low approximately 165 mi west of Astoria, Oregon at 11:00 PDT (18:00 UTC), 6 hours before with the central pressure decreasing to 969 mb (hPa; 28.61 inHg).Shortly after reaching hurricane-force, the extra-tropical cyclone weakened to storm-force and arrived at the coastline of Vancouver Island. The low continued to track northward and quickly became attached to a weakening stationary front, associated with a <b>complex</b> <b>low</b> pressure system to the west, late on October 16.|$|E
50|$|The {{precursor}} tropical low to Cyclone Veli formed {{within the}} Australian region on February 5, about 725 km to the south-east of Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. During {{the next day}} the low moved eastwards and gradually developed further, before it became equivalent to a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, as it reached its 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 85 km/h. As the system continued to move eastwards it crossed 160°E and moved into the South Pacific basin during February 7, before the FMS named it Veli later that day on the basis of satellite derived evidence. During that day the system continued to move eastwards, before as it passed near to Espitru Santo, Veli started to move steadily towards the south-east. Early {{the next day the}} JTWC initiated advisories and started to monitor Veli as Tropical Cyclone 16P, with peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 45 km/h. During that day strong upper level north-westerlies caused vertical windshear to increase over Cyclones Veli and Uma and thus weakened them. During February 9, Cyclone Veli absorbed Uma and formed a <b>complex</b> <b>low,</b> which moved slowly south-eastwards and became extratropical. Damage within Vanautu was either minimal or went unreported, as the island nation was more concerned with the aftermath of Cyclone Uma.|$|E
40|$|Initiation of DNA {{replication}} critically {{depends on}} ori recognition {{as well as}} on catalytic activities of the initiator complex. For replication of papillomaviruses the catalytic activities for initiation are provided by the E 1 protein. Here, we show that the transcription factor E 2 acts to assemble E 1 into a complex active for ori distortion in two steps. First, cooperative DNA binding of E 1 and E 2 generates a sequence-specific ori recognition complex. In the second ATP-dependent step, E 2 is displaced and additional E 1 molecules are incorporated. The net result is a final <b>complex</b> with <b>low</b> sequence specificity deposited onto a specific sequence in the DNA. This may be a general strategy to accomplish specific positioning of protein <b>complexes</b> with <b>low</b> sequence specificity...|$|R
