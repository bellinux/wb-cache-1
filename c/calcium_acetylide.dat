The term is used loosely and {{can refer to}} substituted acetylides have the general structure RC≡CM (where R is an organic side chain). Acetylides are reagents in organic synthesis. The <b>calcium</b> <b>acetylide</b> commonly called calcium carbide is a major compound of commerce.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} β-diketiminate-supported {{magnesium}} and <b>calcium</b> <b>acetylide</b> complexes have been synthesized by σ-bond metathesis of magnesium n-butyl or magnesium and calcium amido precursors {{and a range}} of terminal acetylenes. The dimeric complexes have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The homoleptic bis(amido) and dialkyl complexes [M{X(SiMe 3) 2 } 2 (THF) 2] (M = Ca, Sr; X = N, CH) have been assessed for the atom-efficient, catalytic head-to-head dimerization of donor-functionalized terminal alkynes into butatrienes and aryl-/silyl-substituted terminal acetylenes into 1, 3 -enynes. Deuterium labeling studies of the catalytic reactions are suggested to imply that triene formation requires concerted proton delivery and rearrangement via an adjacent methylene group at a bimetallic alkaline-earth species...|$|E
40|$|Transformation between {{different}} types of carbon–carbon bonding in carbides often results in a dramatic change of physical and chemical properties. Under external pressure, unsaturated carbon atoms form new covalent bonds regardless of the electrostatic repulsion. It was predicted that <b>calcium</b> <b>acetylide</b> (also known as calcium carbide, CaC 2) polymerizes to form calcium polyacetylide, calcium polyacenide and calcium graphenide under high pressure. In this work, the phase transitions of CaC 2 under external pressure were systematically investigated, and the amorphous phase was studied in detail for the first time. Polycarbide anions like C 66 − are identified with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and several other techniques, which evidences the pressure induced polymerization of the acetylide anions and suggests {{the existence of the}} polyacenide fragment. Additionally, the process of polymerization is accompanied with a 107 fold enhancement of the electrical conductivity. The polymerization of acetylide anions demonstrates that high pressure compression is a viable route to synthesize novel metal polycarbides and materials with extended carbon networks, while shedding light on the synthesis of more complicated metal organics...|$|E
40|$|The beta-diketiminate-stabilized calcium amide [{ArNC(Me) CHC(Me) NAr} Ca{N(SiMe 3) (2) }(THF) ] (1) {{reacts with}} {{terminal}} acetylenes in hydrocarbon solvents to yield the corresponding <b>calcium</b> <b>acetylide</b> complexes [{ArNC(Me) CHCN(Me) Ar}Ca{C CR 1 }](2) (R- 1 = n-Bu, t-Bu, Ph, 4 -MeC 6 H 4, ferrocenyl, Ar = 2, 6 -di-isopropylphenyl, 2 a-e). Although in all instances solid and solution state data {{were consistent with}} the reaction products existing as dimeric species with aggregation occurring via three-center-two-electron bridging acetylide units, a further reaction of 1 with HC CSi(Pr-i) (3) demonstrated that both monomeric solvated [{ArNC(Me) CHC(Me) NAr}Ca{C CSi(Pr-i) (3) }(THF) (2) ] (3 b) or dimeric acetylide [{ArNC(Me) CHC(Me) NAr}Ca{C CSi(Pr-i) (3) }](2) (3 a) species could be isolated from the reaction depending Upon the exact conditions of the crystallization of the reaction product from solution. Further solution Studies demonstrated the presence of a monomer-dimer equilibrium in Solution. A van't Hoff analysis allowed Delta G degrees(298 K) for the dimerization reaction to be calculated as + 27. 0 kJ mol(- 1). The reaction of these hydrocarbon-soluble kinetically stabilized calcium acetylides with 1, 3 -dialkylcarbodiimides gave the corresponding heteroleptic calcium C-propargyl amidinate complexes [{ArNC(Me) CHCN(Me) Ar}Ca{((RN) -N- 2) (2) CC CR 1 }(THF) (n) ] (R- 1 = 4 -MeC 6 H 4, n = 0, 4 a; 4 -MeC 6 H 4, n = 1, 4 a center dot THF; R- 2 = Pr-i; R- 1 = Si(Pr-i(3)), R- 2 = Cy, n = 1, 4 b center dot THF) via insertion of the carbodiimide into the calcium-carbon sigma-bond. The latter complexes have been characterized in both solution and the solid state including single-crystal X-ray analysis of 4 a center dot THF. Extension of this reactivity to catalytic systems has allowed the application of amide 1 (5 mol %) to the catalytic hydroacetylenation of 1. 3 -di-isopropylcarbodiimide with phenylacetylene, yielding the corresponding propargyl amidine in 59 % yield following crystallization from hexane solution...|$|E
