40|$|A {{proficiency}} {{review of}} antituberculous drug susceptibility testing (DST) was {{undertaken by the}} regional tuberculosis reference laboratories of the Western Pacific Region of WHO to evaluate the performance of national reference laboratories (NRLs) {{and to ensure that}} the results from the participating laboratories are reliable and similar. A panel of 30 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with various patterns of resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and streptomycin was sent to the NRLs, and their DST results were analyzed by comparing them with the judicial results. The efficiency scores for each drug were 90 to 99 % (mean, 95 %) for isoniazid, 77 to 100 % (mean, 94 %) for rifampin, 82 to 97 % (mean, 90 %) for ethambutol, and 82 to 98 % (mean, 89 %) for streptomycin. Significant changes over time in the rates of accordance with the judicial results were observed for rifampin (P < 0. 0001) and streptomycin (P = 0. 0002), whereas no changes were observed for ethambutol (P = 0. 0880). The efficiency score for isoniazid was consistently good throughout the nine rounds. As a whole, NRL 02 showed the highest score (95 %) in accordance rates for all drugs, while NRL 03 (86 %) and NRL 04 (88 %) ranked lowest. <b>Continued</b> <b>proficiency</b> testing with subsequent technical assistance improved the DST quality of participating laboratories, demonstrating the importance of the current WHO/IUATLD external quality assurance program for DST proficiency testing...|$|E

Many rich programming environments have been created to motivate student interest and expertise in computer science. In the current study, we investigated whether a recently created environment, Robot Virtual Worlds (RVWs), can be used to teach computer science principles within a robotics context by examining its use in high-school classrooms. We also investigated whether the lack of physicality in these environments impacts student learning by comparing classrooms that used either virtual or physical robots for the RVW curriculum. Results suggest that the RVW environment leads to significant gains in computer science knowledge, that virtual robots lead to faster learning, and that physical robots may have some influence on algorithmic thinking. We discuss the implications of physicality in these programming environments for learning computer science. © 2013 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{and internationally}} {{comparable}} human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA genotyping {{is essential for}} HPV vaccine research and for HPV surveillance. The HPV Laboratory Network (LabNet) has designed international proficiency studies that can be issued regularly and in a reproducible manner. The 2011 HPV genotyping proficiency panel contained 43 coded samples composed of purified plasmids of 16 HPV types (HPV 6, - 11, - 16, - 18, - 31, - 33, - 35, - 39, - 45, - 51, - 52, - 56, - 58, - 59, - 66, - 68 a, and - 68 b) and 3 extraction controls. Tests that detected 50 IU of HPV 16 and HPV 18 and 500 genome equivalents for the other 14 HPV types in both single and multiple infections were considered proficient. Ninety-six laboratories worldwide submitted 134 data sets. Twenty-five different HPV genotyping assay methods were used, including the Linear Array, line blot/INNO-LiPA, PapilloCheck, and PCR Luminex assays. The major oncogenic HPV types, HPV 16 and HPV 18, were proficiently detected in 97. 0 % (113 / 116) and 87. 0 % (103 / 118) of the data sets, respectively. In 2011, 51 data sets (39 %) were 100 % proficient {{for the detection of}} at least one HPV type, and 37 data sets (28 %) were proficient for all 16 HPV types; this was an improvement over the panel results from the 2008 and 2010 studies, when < 25 data sets (23 % and 19 % for 2008 and 2010, respectively) were fully proficient. The improvement was also evident for the 54 laboratories that had also participated in the previous proficiency studies.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes {{the effectiveness of}} the U. S. Marine Corps' proficiency and conduct marks as measures of job performance for promotion decisions. The analysis uses big data techniques (factor analysis) and multivariate regressions on data of 360, 690 active duty Marines who held the paygrade of E 3 or E 4 between 2006 and 2016 to estimate the reliability, validity, accuracy, and practicality of proficiency and conduct marks. Overall, results show that proficiency and conduct marks are effective indicators of performance, with some room for improvement. Marks are statistically inconsistent between raters, and proficiency and conduct marks essentially measure the same type of performance. The factor analysis does show that proficiency and conduct marks together are the most important factors in the composite score for E 4 s and the second most important, behind experience, for E 3 s. Lastly, proficiency and conduct marks are the most predictive of future performance compared to all other composite score variables. The author recommends that the Marine Corps <b>continue</b> to use <b>proficiency</b> and conduct marks as a basis for promotion decisions, but that the Marine Corps should redefine the marks in order to improve interpretability and minimize redundancies.

40|$|Reading <b>proficiency</b> <b>continues</b> {{to elude}} {{a large number}} of school children, in particular, our {{economically}} disadvantaged students (Clark 2 ̆ 6 Akerman, 2006). In a continued effort to decrease the gap between the high-poverty and low-poverty students’ reading scores, this study examined the effect of third-grade and fifth-grade teachers’ use of higher-order thinking (HOT) question levels and student context (whole group, small group, and one-one-one) during reading workshop on economically disadvantaged students’ reading achievement. Teacher questionnaires and researcher observations were analyzed to determine the effect on reading CRCT scores and the two domains within the reading CRCT scores of Literary Comprehension and Reading Skills and Vocabulary Acquisition. In addition, intraclass correlation coefficients compared teacher reported use of HOT question levels to researcher observed teacher use of HOT questions. Results suggested the teachers were not cognizant of the higher-order thinking question level they used during reading instruction. Hierarchical regression analysis of the teachers’ use of HOT question levels suggested the questioning levels of remembering and understanding have a statistically significant effect on the reading CRCT scores of the economically disadvantaged students. However, the combined effect of all the HOT question levels did not statistically significantly affect the reading CRCT scores of third-grade and fifth-grade economically disadvantaged students. HOT questions during whole group reading instruction were statistically significant for the economically disadvantaged students’ scores on the reading CRCT and Literary Comprehension domain. In fifth-grade, student context had a negative correlation across each of the reading assessments with small group have the greatest negative correlation with reading CRCT scores. Recommendations for future research of HOT iii questions effecting economically disadvantaged students include exploring the teachers’ use of HOT questions in varying academic disciplines, the use of one-on-one instruction with economically disadvantaged students, and exploring if student context (i. e. whole group, small group, and one-on-one instruction) affects achievement based on the students’ grade-level...|$|R

Ten well-characterized strains of MAC (four macrolide susceptible, six macrolide resistant) were tested against clarithromycin and azithromycin (the latter only by BACTEC 460 TB, pH 6. 8). At each site, strains were tested against clarithromycin three times on each of three separate days (nine testing events per isolate) by using a common lot of microdilution trays and BACTEC 12 B medium, pH 6. 8; strains were tested once on three separate days against clarithromycin in 12 B medium at pH 7. 3 to 7. 4 and against azithromycin. Agreement among MICs (i. e., mode ± 1 twofold dilution) was 100 % for all strains and both drugs when BACTEC 460 TB was used, regardless of the pH of the medium, but varied when microdilution with either medium was used, particularly with susceptible strains. Agreement based on interpretive category, with NCCLS-recommended breakpoints, was 100 % for all strains with the BACTEC 460 TB method (both drugs and both pH values) and with microdilution using 7 H 9 broth. With microdilution and Mueller-Hinton broth, agreement by interpretive category was 100 % for eight isolates and > 90 % for two; errors occurred only in laboratories where personnel had minimal experience with this technique. MAC susceptibility testing may be performed by broth macrodilution or microdilution at either pH, with NCCLS-recommended interpretive breakpoints. However, because visual interpretation of broth microdilution end points is subjective, it is more prone to reader error; therefore, this method requires greater expertise than the BACTEC 460 TB.

40|$|In {{the global}} higher {{education}} (HE) environment characterised by rising accountability, fiscal pressures, fierce competition for student placements and increasing expectations for successful graduate employment, academic teaching <b>proficiency</b> <b>continues</b> to generate {{increasing amounts of}} attention among researchers. Given the critical importance of teaching styles and models in terms of meeting these expectations, and crucially those of students, to what extent does {{the concept of the}} ‘caring professor’ contribute to the longer-term satisfaction of students in subsequent work settings after graduating? Can the behaviours exhibited by the ‘caring professor’ be attributed to transformational leadership behaviours of teaching academics? And can any association be found between the students’ experiences of the behaviours of the ‘caring professor’ and their subsequent workplace engagement? This study, carried out in a Hong Kong higher education institution (HEI), explored {{the extent to which the}} idea of the ‘caring professor’ could be explained by the notion of transformational classroom leadership by examining the relationship between transformational classroom leadership and workplace engagement. Acting in a role of internal practitioner/researcher, I adapted the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) to measure transformational leadership in this HEI and examined the extent to which undergraduate and postgraduate cohorts perceived they experienced transformational leadership among teaching academics while completing their studies. In a series of cross-sectional surveys, alumni cohorts from years 2011 - 15 in the HEI were surveyed to retrospectively rate perceptions of transformational leadership among teaching academics, using a modified, 10 ‐ item instrument, and concurrently, cohorts’ levels of workplace engagement using a proprietary instrument. Findings indicated that, in the specific context, transformational leadership behaviours among teaching academics were reportedly observed in the instructional setting, and a positive relationship was established between alumni experience of transformational classroom leadership and subsequent workplace engagement. The hypothesis that the ‘caring professor’ exhibits transformational leadership behaviours was found to be plausible. Within its limited scope, the study provides a basis for further investigation of specific forms of behavioural assessment and associated professional development frameworks within the HE environment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether the PGCE adequately develops the WIL skills of student teachers. WIL skills have contributed extensively {{to the effectiveness}} of the facilitation of teaching and learning in schools. The definitions of WIL in this study refer to the skills required to succeed in practice. The four domains of Danielson provide the WIL skills, namely Preparation and Planning, the School Environment, Instruction and Professional Responsibilities. The study showed that there is a link between the four domains and the capacity of student teachers to integrate the theory they acquire at the HEIs and practice in the schools. The quantitative approach is referred to by Creswell (2005 : 39) as a type of educational research in which the researcher decides what to study, asks specific narrow questions, collects numeric data, which is numbered data from participants, analyzes these numbers using statistics, and conducts the inquiry in an unbiased, objective manner. As this study requires numeric data that ask specific questions, two questionnaires were distributed. One questionnaire was directed at school – based mentors and the other at PGCE student teachers. The mentors rated the students’ capacity in the four domains and the students rated themselves on the same items based on the four domains. The research instrument provides insight from school-based mentors with regard to whether there is a balance between the theoretical knowledge provided by HEIs and the WIL skills that student - teachers need. The questionnaires completed by PGCE student teachers provided perspectives from the students with regard to the relevance of their WIL skills for the schools at which they were placed. The hypothesis for this study is: The PGCE makes a significant contribution {{to the development of the}} WIL skills of ITE student teachers. Some of Some of the key findings in this study indicated that: • Constant curriculum changes in the schools create uncertainty for student teachers. • Student teachers need assistance to motivate learners to take pride in their work and achievements. • Managing learner behaviour is cause for concern for student teachers. • Language <b>proficiency</b> <b>continues</b> to be problematic in the teaching and learning environment, because it impacts on questioning, discussion techniques and the student teachers’ capacity to explain concepts. • Student teachers need assistance with the pacing of their lessons. • Adjusting their lessons, which requires spontaneity from student teachers is needed. • Opportunities need to be created for student teachers to gain access to the parents of their learners. • Student teachers need to devote more time to the development of reflective skills. • Excessive administrative tasks hamper delivery in the classroom and teacher and learner productivity. The findings strongly suggested that a significant relationship exists between the WIL skills of PGCE students and their effectiveness as facilitators of learning. The findings of the study indicated that the PGCE curriculum needs to incorporate the crucial WIL skills as identified in the four domains. The findings of this study supported the hypothesis that the PGCE makes a significant contribution to the development of the WIL skills of Initial Teacher Education student teachers (ITE) ...|$|R

Operation DESERT STORM began on 23 February 1991 and 7th ESB participated in all aspects of the offensive operations. The battalion returned home to Camp Pendleton by 24 April 1991.7th ESB deployed to Mogadishu, Somalia on 15 December 1992 in support of Operation RESTORE HOPE. From 15 December 1992 to 25 January 1993, EOD Company assisted in over 300 calls for support recovering and disposing of over 350,000 pounds of ordnance and over two million rounds of ammunition. Bulk Fuel Company employed and operated five AAFS and a Tactical Airfield Fuel Dispensing System (TAFDS) which serviced over 26 different nations during the operation. The battalion’s utilities section purified and provided over three million gallons of water to the multinational contingent.In January 1993, while the battalion was deployed to Somalia, the Santa Margarita River flooded, which severely damaged Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Camp Pendleton. The Marines of 7th ESB, purified drinking water, rebuilt eight miles of roads and rebuilt the levee that separates the MCAS and the Santa Margarita River.30 December 1994, Bridge Company was deactivated and its personnel and equipment redistributed throughout the battalion. In March 1995, Company A reactivated and constructed the Combat Skills Training Facility at Camp Deluz.During 1996, EOD techs provided range sweeps at multiple Marine Corps and Air Force installation across the southwestern U.S. Additionally, EOD also supported the U.S. Secret Service in Los Angeles and San Diego. February 1996, Company C deployed to the U.S. Army’s National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California where it acted as a ‘Soviet Engineer Battalion’ as opposition force against U.S. Army units.
