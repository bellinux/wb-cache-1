Members were asked to disagree, agree, or agree with provisos with the statement that read: [...] "Taken as a whole, government policies of the New Deal served to lengthen and deepen the Great Depression." [...] While only 6% of economic historians who worked in the history department of their universities agreed with the statement, 27% of those that work in the economics department agreed. Almost an identical percent of the two groups (21% and 22%) agreed with the statement [...] "with provisos" [...] (a <b>conditional</b> <b>stipulation),</b> while 74% of those who worked in the history department, and 51% in the economic department, disagreed with the statement outright.|$|E
