40|$|This paper models {{the gold}} {{standard}} as a state contingent <b>commitment</b> <b>rule</b> that is only feasible during peace. It shows that monetary policy during war, when the gold convertibility rule is suspended, can still be credible, if the policy maker's plan is to resume {{the gold standard}} at the old par value in the future. The DGE model developed in this paper suggests that the resumption of the gold standard was a sustainable plan, which replaced the gold standard as a <b>commitment</b> <b>rule</b> and made monetrary policy time consistent. The equilibrium is supported by trigger strategies, where private agents retaliate if a policy maker defaults its policy plan to resume the gold standard rule.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} a rational expectations model {{based on a}} Phillips curve that embodies persistence in inflation. As {{we assume that the}} central bank targets the natural rate of output, there is no inflation bias. We derive optimal monetary policy rules that are state-contingent and shock-dependent both in the case where the central bank follows a commitment strategy and where it pursues a discretionary procedure. Numerical solutions show that in the state-contingent part there always exists a trade-off between these two optimal rules, in that the <b>commitment</b> <b>rule</b> involves smaller expected deviations of inflation from its target; in the shock-dependent part there can be situations in which the discretionary rule is more effective in reducing the impact of the random shock on inflation and less effective in reducing the random shock on output. Only in the latter case it is possible that one rule is superior; otherwise it is generally the case that a trade-off exists between these two rules. ...|$|E

We analyze the determinants of optimal monetary policy in the standard New Keynesian model, when the central bank minimizes an explicit loss function and has full information about the structure of the economy, including the precise mechanism generating private sector’s expectations. The focus on optimal policy allows us to investigate how and to what extent a change in the assumption of how agents form their inflation expectations affects the principles of optimal monetary policy. It also provides a benchmark to evaluate simple policy rules. We find that departures from rational expectations increase the potential for instability in the economy, thereby strengthening the importance of managing (anchoring) inflation expectations. We also find that the simple <b>commitment</b> <b>rule</b> under rational expectations is robust when expectations are formed in line with adaptive learning...|$|E

40|$|In a {{discretionary}} regime {{the monetary}} authority can print {{more money and}} create more inflation than people expect. But, although these inflation surprises can have some benefits, they cannot arise systematically in equilibrium when people understand the policymaker’s incentives and form their expeziations accordingly. Because the policymaker {{has the power to}} create inflation shocks ex pest, the equilibrium growth rates of money and prices turn out to be higher than otherwise. Ther,zfore, enforced <b>commitments</b> (<b>rules)</b> for monetary behavior can improve matters. Given the repeated interaction between the policymaker and the private agents, it is possible that reputational forces can substitute for formal rules. Here, we develop an example of a reputational equilibrium where the outcomes turn out to be weighted averages of those from discretion and those from the ideal rule. In particular, the rates of inflation and monetary growth look more like. those under discretion when the discount rate is high. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis re-examines the {{suspension}} of the gold standard rule in Britain between 1797 and 1821 {{within the framework of}} the theory of credible and time consistent monetary policy. By combining both historical and theoretical analysis the thesis challenges the prevailing theory in which the gold standard is considered as a contingent rule and {{the suspension}} as an exogenously credible regime. Firstly, the thesis analyses what made the suspension credible in the absence of the gold standard rule. It is proposed that the suspension was a credible regime, because the resumption of the gold standard at the old par value in the future was a sustainable plan. It is shown that monetary policy during the bad state [...] such as war [...] can still be time consistent in the absence of the formal <b>commitment</b> <b>rule,</b> if the policy maker's plan is to resume the original <b>commitment</b> <b>rule</b> when the economy returns to the good state. The equilibrium is based on trigger strategies where private agents retaliate if a policy maker deviates from its policy plan to resume the gold standard rule. Secondly, the thesis aims to establish why the gold standard rule was suspended for twenty-four years. Both historical analysis and a dynamic general equilibrium model demonstrate that the gold standard was a shock amplifier when the shocks became persistent in the 1790 s, and suspension was used to restore monetary stability during the French Wars. As {{the suspension of}} cash payments was a credible regime, it maintained the value and circulation of paper currency that in turn stabilised production and consumption. Suspension increased the degree of flexibility in the economic policy as the monetary authority had an opportunity to stimulate the economy by issuing fiat money during the war, on the understanding that the fiat money so issued would be withdrawn from circulation before the gold standard resumed. Finally, it is explained why the gold standard was resumed after the relatively successful Suspension Period. The gold standard was seen as a solution to the problem that arose from the Bank of England's ambiguous role as a public and private institution. Rules were considered to be better than discretion, and the gold convertibility was a transparent principle, which maximised the long-run welfare of the society. The thesis demonstrates how already in the eighteenth century commitment to the gold standard rule had increased the efficiency of capital markets and enabled Britain to finance its eighteenth-century wars by using deficit finance. Maintaining these abilities through the gold standard was desirable. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of private sector adaptive learning {{for the conduct of}} monetary policy. The first contribution is to analyze the optimal monetary policy response to shocks and the associated macro-economic outcomes, when the central bank minimizes an explicit loss function. We assume the admittedly extreme case that the central bank has full information about the structure of the economy (a standard assumption under rational expectations) including the precise mechanism generating private sector’s expectations. The focus on optimal policy allows us to investigate to what extent a relatively small change in the assumption of how agents form their inflation expectations affects the principles of optimal monetary policy. Moreover, this analysis serves as a benchmark for the analysis of two simple policy rules that would be optimal under rational expectations with and without central bank commitment respectively. The second contribution is to show that a simple representation of the optimal commitment policy under rational expectations that exhibits history dependence is surprisingly robust to changes in the way inflation expectations are formed. It leads to macro-economic outcomes that are very close to those under the optimal policy. By responding persistently to cost-push shocks, the simple <b>commitment</b> <b>rule</b> is able to significantly lower the degree of inflation persistence estimated by the private agents and thereby stabilize inflation and inflation expectations...|$|E

40|$|We {{reassess}} {{the gains}} from {{monetary policy coordination}} {{within the confines of}} the canonical NOEM in the light of three issues. First, the literature uses a number of cooperative and non-cooperative equilibrium concepts that do not always clearly distinguish commitment and discretionary outcomes, and in some cases adopts inappropriate concepts. Second, our analysis is welfare based. Moreover, as with much of this literature, we adopt a linear-quadratic approximation of the actual non-linear non-quadratic stochastic optimization problem facing the monetary policymakers. Our second objective then is to re-assess welfare gains using an accurate approximation for such a problem, a feature that for the most part is lacking in previous studies. Finally, we examine the issue where the monetary authority is restricted to rules that are operational in two senses: first, the zero lower bound constraint is imposed on the optimal rule and second, we study simple Taylor-type <b>commitment</b> <b>rules</b> that unlike fully optimal rules are easily monitored by the public. monetary rules, open economy, coordination games, commitment, discretion, zero bound constraint...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} essays on communication in game theory. The first chapter develops {{a model of}} dynamic persuasion. A sender has a fixed number of pieces of hard evidence that contain information {{about the quality of}} his proposal, each of which is either favorable or unfavorable. The sender may try to persuade a decision maker (DM) that she has enough favorable evidence by sequentially revealing at most one piece at a time. Presenting evidence is costly for the sender and delaying decisions is costly for the DM. I study the equilibria of the resulting dynamic communication game. The sender effectively chooses when to give up persuasion and the DM decides when to make a decision. Resolving the strategic tension requires probabilistic behavior from both parties. Typically, the DM will accept the sender's proposal even when she knows that the sender's evidence may be overall unfavorable. However, in a Pareto efficient equilibrium, the other type of error does not occur unless delays costs are very large. Furthermore, the sender's net gain from engaging in persuasion can be negative on the equilibrium path, even when persuasion is successful. we perform comparative statics in the costs of persuasion. I also characterize the DM's optimal stochastic <b>commitment</b> <b>rule</b> and the optimal non-stochastic commitment rule; compared to the communication game, the former yields a Pareto improvement, whereas, the latter can leave even the DM either better or worse off. The second chapter studies a unidimensional Hotelling-Downs model of electoral competition with the following innovation: a fraction of candidates have "competence", which is unobservable to voters. In our model, competence means the ability to correctly observe a policy-relevant state of the world. This structure induces a signaling game between competent and incompetent candidates. We show that in equilibrium, proposing an extreme platform serves as a signal about competence, and has a strictly higher winning probability than that of the median platform. Polarization happens and the degree of it depends on how uncertain the state is and how much political candidates are office-motivated. The third chapter examines the dynamic extension of Che, Dessein, and Kartik (2011). They study strategic communication by an agent who has non-verifiable private information about different alternatives. The agent does not internalize the principal's benefit from her outside option. They show that a pandering distortion arises in communication. This chapter studies the long-run consequence of their model when a new agent-principal pair is formed in each period, and principals in later periods may learn some information from predecessors' actions. I show that informational cascade, in which communication completely breaks down, can arise, even when communication can benefit both parties. I also characterize the conditions under which effective communication between principal and agent can continue in perpetuity...|$|E
