40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{frequency}} regulation in power grids, while maximizing the social welfare. Two price-based controllers are proposed; the first one an internal-model-based controller and the second one based on a continuous gradient method for optimization. Both controllers can be implemented in a fully distributed fashion, with freedom in choosing a <b>controller</b> <b>communication</b> network. As a result, two real-time dynamic pricing models described by port- Hamiltonian systems are obtained.

40|$|Process {{networks}} are characterised by their large-scale and strong interaction effects. As such, a scalable control design approach, which {{can account for}} interactions, is required. This thesis addresses the problem of control design for process networks by developing a distributed approach, whereby local controllers which {{communicate with one another}} are used. This approach has the ability to address both the issues of scalability and interactions. The system is viewed as two interacting networks, a process network and controller network. Dissipative systems theory is adopted to facilitate a two step design approach. In the first step, the required dissipativity of the controllers is determined, such that the process network is stable, and satisfies specified H-infinity performance bounds. These bounds are determined from the dissipativity of the closed-loop process network. In the second step, the controllers are synthesised. Design approaches for both closed-form controllers, and MPC are developed. In both cases, once the first step is completed, the controllers may be synthesised independently in the second step. This approach is computationally tractable as, depending on the specific case, the calculations require either the solution of linear matrix inequalities or algebraic Riccati equations. Quadratic differential/difference forms are used as supply rates in the dissipativity based analysis. These capture more system information than traditional supply rates, thus providing sharper stability results. They also allow for weighted H-infinity norm bounds to be represented as closed-loop dissipativity conditions. The quadratic differential/difference form framework provides a convenient algebra for manipulations of the process and controller supply rates through polynomial matrix operations. In addition to the framework for closed-form and MPC design, several important extensions are developed. Including: multi-rate control, design for bounded unknown time delays, design for uncertainty, and design for changing network topology. Multi-rate control may facilitate decreased capital costs. In addition, there is a reduction in <b>controller</b> <b>communication</b> network traffic. Design for delays, model uncertainty and changing network topology provides robustness to changes in operating conditions, model error and failures of the <b>controller</b> <b>communication</b> network. In the case that the changing operating conditions are known, the controllers reconfigure to compensate for these changes...|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of ATM technology and increasing deployment of ATM networks, we anticipate a heterogenous environment for an ATM network. Switches and client stations from different vendors, each with potentially different control mechanisms, will be used within the same network. This diversity of control structures introduces great complexity into {{the development}} of ATM control software. In this and associated other documents, we propose a software architecture that manages this heterogenous environment. A key aspect of the software design is that the hardware details of a switch and its control mechanism is encapsulated in a low level software module called the Switch Controller (SC). The Node <b>Controller</b> <b>Communication</b> Protocol (NCCP) is presented that allows higher layer software modules {{to communicate with the}} SC. The NCCP is general enough to support general multipoint-to-multipoint communications. A general interface to the NCCP, the Node Controller Managed Object (NCMO) is also presented. The NCMO is an Application Programming Interface (API) to the NCCP for the higher level software modules. The development of the NCMO and the NCCP allows the higher layer modules to operate on an abstract switch model and not have to understand the details of every possible hardware switch that might be present in the network. This partitioning of functionality provides a clean interface between software modules and hence, a viable software architecture for the control of a heterogenous set of switches. 1.

The second one is the controller to steer the motor vehicle. The main board will be equipped with electronic components to communicate with a computer as well as photo detectors {{to communicate with the}} <b>controller.</b> <b>Communication</b> between the main board and the controller is transferred via infrared light. Both parts were simulated until the results matched the given specifications. The two circuits were then transferred to Eagle to make PCB layouts. The main board was ordered from Cogra and the controller etched by hand. Components were added to the main board by means of solder paste and fixated trough a reflow oven. Some components were added via hand soldering as were all components on the controller board. The cards were then tested to see how well the main board amplified the signal, from the controller, and where, on the frequency spectrum, the main board had the highest gain. Results show that the main board is working although not as good as in the simulations. The frequency of the IR diodes had to be adjusted to fit the main board.

30|$|SDN. There is a {{need for}} {{different}} reconfiguration policies that can apply to the network elements in EDHs at different time scales due to the dynamicity and density of this network, and this can also result in high signaling overhead. Moreover, the centralized nature of the conventional SDN approaches creates a bottleneck and thus reduces resilience and scalability. Owing to the fact that 5 G networks are deployed in a dense and heterogeneous area, the wireless link quality is very unreliable and unstable and this may temporarily prevent communication with the controller, if the <b>controller</b> <b>communication</b> channel uses in-band signaling. This lack of communication can result in isolated wireless networks. Furthermore, 5 G network can have cells with particular configuration policies. Therefore, it is evident that the flat organization of the conventional SDN controllers does not provide an effective and flexible management solution for EDHs that can meet the requirements for resilience and scalability. Moreover, which functions must exactly be implemented in each plane is still an open issue in the SDN paradigm, particularly in the wireless networks. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of EDHs that includes D 2 D, M 2 M, and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) communication results in very diversified and dynamic topologies, so that SDN and NFV are very complex to plan due to distinct mobility models and hardware constraints. In such scenarios, how the SDN controller advertises the edge Open-vSwitch (OVS) device or network hypervisor that which terminal node should forward packets. To answer this question, we identified two alternative approaches that could possibly be applied in this case. Former, a broker/middleware could be used to intermediate the messages between controller(s) and OVS devices. Last, standard protocols should be employed in order to reach a transparent communication, such as HTTP.|$|E

This research applies qualitative approach in relation to the use of clear and systematic description about the language phenomena. Document analysis is the design of this study.

The result of the study shows that three types of illocutionary acts (expositives, behabitives, and exercitives) are applied for different purposes.
