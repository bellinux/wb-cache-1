50|$|The {{disadvantage}} is {{that star}} quad, in combining two conductors, typically has more capacitance than similar two-conductor twisted and shielded audio cable. High capacitance causes an increasing loss of high frequencies as distance increases. The high-frequency loss {{is due to}} the RC filter formed by the output impedance of the <b>cable</b> <b>driver</b> and the capacitance of the cable.

40|$|A {{distribution}} amplifier (DA) {{is often used}} as a repeater in broadcast video applications to extend the reach of a link, most commonly 75 Ω coaxial cable. The data path in a DA consists of an SDI adaptive cable equalizer, SDI reclocker and SDI <b>cable</b> <b>driver.</b> In an operational system a video signal may be transmitted through multiple DAs or similar equipment, such as a video router, before reaching its final destination. The DA’s primary function is to reconstruct signal integrity of the incoming attenuated signal back to its original state by opening the waveform eye (equalizer), cleaning high-frequency jitter (reclocker) and setting appropriate slew rate and signal amplitude (<b>cable</b> <b>driver).</b> Low frequency jitter, below the loop bandwidth of the reclocker’s PLL, will be passed through. Adding several DAs in cascade will eventually result in accumulated low-frequency jitter {{commonly referred to as}} jitter peaking. Some SDI reclockers and equalizers are more susceptible to jitter peaking than others.

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the influence of working conditions on the duration of cutters participation in group work skidding. Two main theoretical assumptions were considered. First, working conditions that decrease the skidding efficiency increase the time of cutters assistance, because {{the group as a}} whole strives to improve efficiency, and second, the duration of assistance to the working group is specific regardless of working conditions. The research included 5 places of research (compartments) in Slovenian state forests, with 3 working groups consisting of two cutters and a <b>cable</b> skidder <b>driver.</b> All working groups used the cable skidder IWAFUJI–T 41.

The model accounts for 40. 7 % of the whole variability. After excluding the influence of working conditions between the groups, there are no typical differences in the duration of cutters assistance. Results imply that the number of working group members should be adjusted to working conditions. On the other hand, insignificant differences of cutters assistance duration between the groups show that the mere group daily standard is a motivational factor big enough for the rationalization of group work of workers who are not additionally educated and qualified for group work...|$|R

40|$|The LHCb {{experiment}} (Large Hadron Collider beauty) {{is one of}} {{the four}} experiments under construction at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN near Geneva. It is planned to start in 2007 and its goal is the study of b-quark physics. The LHC is a circular accelerator in which collide protons-protons at a center-of-mass energy of √s = 14 TeV. This generates a large number of high energy bb pairs which are predominantly produced in the same forward cone. The LHCb detector is therefore a forward single arm spectrometer designed to exploit the large bb production cross section (σbb ~ 500 μb) and to perform precise measurements of CP violation in b-hadrons decays. One of the actual greatest challenges in High Energy Physics is the discovery of the Higgs boson which is responsible for the Model Standard particles mass generation through the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking process. The Higgs mass is not known and cannot be predicted by the theory. However the recent results of LEP at CERN have shown that mH 0 > 114 GeV/c 2. Below ~ 150 GeV/c 2 the Higgs decay into two b-quarks H 0 &#x 2192; bb dominates. The two quarks emitted back-to-back in the H 0 rest frame form a string which fragments, giving rise to hadronization in jets containing b-hadrons. The aim of this thesis is to assess the feasibility to discover a Higgs boson with intermediate mass at LHCb by using the detector sensibility to b-hadrons in order to reconstruct these jets using jets reconstruction algorithms. The study is focused on the mechanisms in which the Higgs boson is produced in association with a gauge boson decaying leptonically H 0 + W± &#x 2192; bb + &# 8467;ν&# 8467; and H 0 + Z 0 &#x 2192; bb + &# 8467;+&# 8467;- for Higgs masses in the range 100 - 130 GeV/c 2. The gauge bosons decay produces hard leptons quite often isolated from the b-jets. Hence an isolated lepton with high transverse momentum is required in order to reject the large QCD background. Several important background channels which also provide two b-quarks and an isolated lepton – like tt &#x 2192; W+b W-b, Z 0 + W± &#x 2192; bb + &# 8467;ν&# 8467;, Z 0 + Z 0 &#x 2192; bb + &# 8467;+&# 8467;-, W± + b-jets, Z 0 + b-jets and generic bb – are studied in parallel. The idea is to find observables which behave differently for backgrounds and Higgs signal and to exploit these differences in the framework of a neural network, precisely in order to discriminate background from signal. The LHCb experiment needs a high capability to identify b-hadrons despite their very short lifetime τB ~ 1. 5 · 10 - 12 s. The Vertex Locator (VeLo) is a sub-detector placed around the p-p interaction point which has to provide accurate measurements of the b-hadrons production and decay points by reconstructing secondary vertices. The second part of this thesis is a technical contribution {{to the development of the}} VeLo analogue transmission line. It consists in testing several hardware and software methods to improve the VeLo analogue transmission between the on-detector part of the readout and the off-detector electronics. Because the ~ 60 m line introduces an important attenuation, several <b>cables</b> and line <b>drivers</b> configurations with frequency and gain compensation are studied in order to obtain the best results in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and channel crosstalk.
