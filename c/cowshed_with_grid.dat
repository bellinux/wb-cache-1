50|$|The castle mound is {{adjacent}} to Pen-y-Clawdd Court (a Grade I listed building), {{a stable and}} <b>cowshed</b> <b>with</b> adjoining range, and a barn, {{all of which are}} Grade II listed buildings. These buildings, along with the castle mound, are set in a roughly rectangular area about 150m by 135m. This area is a possible location for the bailey part of the castle. Some of the features of the mound may have been changed by landscaping around the later buildings.|$|R

We propose to base the method on unfoldings. Given a partial observation, as a possibly structured set of actions, our method determines the causal relation between events in the model that explain the observation. It can also synthesize parametric constraints associated with these explanations. The method is implemented in the tool Romeo. We present its application to the diagnosis of {{the example of a}} <b>cowshed</b> <b>with</b> pigs...|$|R

40|$|Thesis {{is focused}} on the {{measurement}} and evaluation of microclimate parameters in barns for dairy farming and the determination of the energy consumptions of selected technologies in these barns. The aim of this work was to design and eventually to implement adjustments in order to improve the parameters of cowshed microclimate and reducing the energy consumption of selected technologies in depends on results of the measurements. Three structurally different <b>cowsheds</b> <b>with</b> different slurry clearing technologies were selected for monitoring. I focused on the measurement of temperature and relative humidity in relation to temperature- humidity index and its impact on heat stress on dairy cows. I measured airflow in the cowsheds and I determinate concentrations and emissions of ammonia and methane in the cowsheds in different seasons. I monitored light intensity in the cowsheds and I determined the dependence of building solutions on the use of outdoor light to illuminate the interior of the barns. The energy consumption of the lighting system depending on the season and the consumption of additional fans on the air temperature were studied. On the bases of results of the experimental part I designed and implemented lighting system, controlled by light intensity in a cowshed and energy-saving ventilation in the cowshed - type K 105. I suggested a system of continuously monitoring of climatic parameters in the <b>cowshed</b> <b>with</b> immediate calculation of temperature- humidity index. Measurements have shown the dependence of gases concentrations on the way of slurry clearing technologies. The building solutions of cowsheds and type of ventilation proved a significant influence on the temperature- humidity index during the summer...|$|R
50|$|Many {{students}} from {{different parts of}} the world come to Brahmrishi Ashram at Virat Nagar, Pinjore, Haryana in India and are not charged. A school for formal education and another school for Sanskrit studies were established. Destitute and orphan children are given free education and maintenance. In this Ashram, a <b>cowshed</b> <b>with</b> 150 cows was organised and a hospital for health care in Ayurveda was established, and printing press facilities were set up. A monthly magazine was started. Many branches of the Mission were opened in different states of India. In 1985, Gurudev established a Metaphysical Science Research Institute in Chandigarh; it became an institute of repute in Northern India, running a college for B. Ed. in Yoga, and O.T. (Shiksha Shastri) based on Sanskrit studies.|$|R

50|$|At Pigeon bay, {{which was}} heavily timbered, {{with very little}} open ground, only cattle-grazing was possible. Here in 1844, Hay had 18 cows. By February 1844, they were grazing 50 cattle and 500 sheep. Within a few years all these {{settlers}} had much larger numbers of stock. Greenwood had about 1500 sheep {{towards the end of}} 1845 and Deans cattle had increased to 130 head. At this time, Rhodes imported 400 sheep. Thereafter the number of sheep increased rapidly. Sheep, however, appear to have been regarded as an investment for the future rather than a major source of immediate income. Cattle, on the other hand, not only provided prospect of a future trade in beef animals, but an immediate return from dairying. Deans, for example, built immediately at Riccarton a <b>cowshed</b> <b>with</b> ten double bails, {{and at the end of}} his first season sent a consignment of cheese to Wellington.|$|R
5000|$|The {{village was}} {{established}} in 1911 as [...] "Ein Hai" [...] (lit. Fountain of the Living) on privately-owned land. It was later renamed Kfar Malal after Moshe Leib Lilienblum (משה לייב לילינבלום), an early leader of the Hovevei Zion movement, whose acronym in Hebrew is MLL (מל"ל). The village was destroyed in the battles of World War I, resettled {{by a group of}} laborers and ravaged again in the 1921 Jaffa riots. In 1922, the land was transferred to the Jewish National Fund and Kfar Malal was rebuilt as a moshav. It suffered more attacks in the 1929 Arab riots. Ariel Sharon, Israel's eleventh prime minister, who was born in Kfar Malal, said that his mother slept with a rifle under her bed until her dying day due to the trauma of hiding in the <b>cowshed</b> <b>with</b> her children at night to escape roving Bedouin gangs.|$|R
