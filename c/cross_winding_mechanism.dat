40|$|Natural draft dry {{cooling tower}} (NDDCT) is an {{effective}} cooling technology which can be utilized in most of geothermal and concentrated solar thermal (CST) power plants. The experimental studies of the full scale cooling tower, especially the small size NDDCTs, are still not extensive. To fill this gap, Queensland Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence (QGECE) at The University of Queensland has built a 20 m high NDDCT. In this paper, the 1 D analytical model and the 3 D CFD model of this cooling tower were developed and its cooling performance was investigated at different ambient temperatures, hot water temperatures and velocities of <b>cross</b> <b>wind.</b> The result shows that the small size NDDCT is suitable for 2 ~ 3 MW CST power plants. The cooling performance decreases {{with the increase in}} the ambient temperature and the decrease in the hot water temperature. In terms of the <b>cross</b> <b>wind,</b> the heat rejection ratio decreases with the increase of the <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> velocity when <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> velocity is low. However, when velocities of the <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> become large enough, the heat dumped {{at the bottom of the}} tower can compensate some loss caused by <b>cross</b> <b>wind.</b> The results found in the present paper give reference for planed future experiments...|$|R

50|$|Sea water wave is {{generated}} by many kinds of disturbances such as Seismic events, gravity, and <b>crossing</b> <b>wind.</b> The generation of wind wave is initiated by the disturbances of <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> field {{on the surface of}} the sea water.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a comparison between}} two new methodologies to perform the <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> risk analysis on railway lines, developed within the European project Aerodynam-ic in Open Air (AOA, WP 2). The study consists {{in the evaluation of}} the probability of rail ve-hicle overturning when it is running on a railway line under the action of <b>cross</b> <b>wind.</b> According to both the methodologies, the <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> risk analysis is based on a meteo study and on the determination of Characteristic Wind Curves (CWC). The meteo study provides the probability of occurrence of wind gusts on a specific point of a railway line while the CWC computation allows to evaluate the gust wind speed that leads the vehicle to overcome the specific safety limits. The <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> risk is defined as the combined probability of the wind gust velocity occurrence and of the overcoming of the safety limit adopted for the defini-tion of the CWC. The two methodologies mainly differ in the calculation of the CWC, since one adopts a deterministic approach while the other is based on a stochastic procedure. This paper reports and compares the application of these new methodologies to the two samples of Rome-Naples high speed railway line...|$|R

40|$|We present {{new data}} from High Energy Density (HED) {{laboratory}} experiments designed {{to explore the}} interaction of a heavy hypersonic radiative jet with a <b>cross</b> <b>wind.</b> The jets are generated with the MAGPIE pulsed power machine where converging conical plasma flows are produced from a cylindrically symmetric array of inclined wires. Radiative hypersonic jets emerge from the convergence point. The <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> is generated by ablation of a plastic foil via soft-X-rays from the plasma convergence region. Our experiments show that the jets are deflected {{by the action of}} the <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> with the angle of deflection dependent on the proximity of the foil. Shocks within the jet beam are apparent in the data. Analysis of the data shows that the interaction of the jet and <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> is collisional and therefore in the hydro-dynamic regime. MHD plasma code simulations of the experiments are able to recover the deflection behaviour seen in the experiments. We consider the astrophysical relevance of these experiments applying published models of jet deflection developed for AGN and YSOs. Fitting the observed jet deflections to quadratic trajectories predicted by these models allows us to recover a set of plasma parameters consistent with the data. We also present results of 3 -D numerical simulations of jet deflection using a new astrophysical Adaptive Mesh Refinement code. These simulations show highly structured shocks occurring within the beam similar to what was observed in the experiment...|$|R
