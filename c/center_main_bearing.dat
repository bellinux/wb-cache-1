50|$|Fabio Taglioni was {{to develop}} a bike that {{conformed}} to US police specifications, and was bigger than any current model Harley-Davidson. Taglioni decided on an air-cooled 1257 cc 90° two-valve head V4 using a 180-degree crankshaft with roller bearing big ends. That crankshaft fitted into a horizontally split wet sump crankcase with a <b>center</b> <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> support. The bore was 84.5 mm, and the stroke 56 mm.

5000|$|In {{the absence}} of {{balancer}} shafts, the disadvantages include rotating plane imbalances on 1.rotating mass (crankshaft), 2.reciprocating mass (pistons and conrods), 3.torque generation and 4.compression, all of which generate rocking vibrations. [...] These imbalances can be countered to varying degrees with heavy counterweights on each crank throw, so most crossplane V8s have very heavy crankshafts. Early Chrysler Hemi V8 had heavy counterweights, but the middle two positions {{on both sides of}} the <b>center</b> <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> (the third of 5 mains) did not have any counterweight, as these positions are located close to the center of engine and deemed ineffective to counter rocking motions.|$|E

Heads used on the high performance 409 and 427 engines had larger ports and valves than those used on the 348 and the base 409 passenger car and truck engines, but externally were identical to the standard units. One minor difference between the 348 and 409/427 was {{the location of the}} engine oil dipstick: it was on the driver's side on the former and the passenger's side on the latter. No satisfactory explanation was ever offered for why this change was made. However, it did provide a fairly reliable way to differentiate between the smaller and larger versions of the engine.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{decisions}} made by the Marine Accidents Inquiry Agency during the period from 1950 to 1964, investigaion was carried out on the broken parts of engine and their causes. 1. In diesel engines, principal broken parts were propeller shaft, crank arm, crank pin bolt and <b>main</b> <b>bearing.</b> The crack or breakage of crank arm was caused mostly by the deviation of <b>center</b> line of <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> The breakage of crank pin bolts was due mostly to excessive or unbalanced tightening. 2. In hot balb engines, nearly one half of damaged engines were due to the breakage of crank arm. When start engine, neglect about exhaust remaining oil in cylinder caused the engine to rapid rotation, and so crank case, piston, cylinder or cylinder cover to damage. 1. 漁船機関損傷の部位とその原因を,デイーゼル機関. 焼玉機関別に海難審判庁の裁決より考察した. 2. 主軸受中心線偏移によるクランク アームのき裂又は折損が最も多く,殊に焼玉機関に於て著しく,早期の開放点検整備が強く要望される. 3. デイーゼル機関に於ては,更に主軸受の焼損及びクランク ピン. ボルトの折損が多く,之等は他の部分の損傷に直接影響のある所で,潤滑油系に対する充分な注意と,ボルト締め付けに際しての細心の留意が肝要である. 4. 焼玉機関の始動時の急回転による損傷が各部に見出され,特に始動失敗の折の慎重な処置が望まれる. 機関損傷の殆どが,極めて基本的な事項の不注意,不処置に起因し,取扱者の充分な点検整備の実行が遂行されるならば,著しく軽減される海難である...|$|R

40|$|Volvo Car Corporation uses a new {{generation}} of four cylinder inline engines in their automobiles. The engine family is known as Volvo Engine Architecture and the differences between the different engines are the different power outputs made possible with different engine boosts. The VEA engines utilise a bedplate design for their engines where the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports are casted into the bedplate. For the high performance engines the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports need to be sprayed with an aluminium alloy to get a strong bonding with the bedplate. The spraying is, however, expensive and an alternative solution is sought. Four design proposals, which are based on the current design of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, were proposed. These design proposals does not use any of the sprayed aluminium alloy material. Instead they have been designed with the goal of getting a mechanical bonding, instead of the chemical bonding that the aluminium alloy coating provides. The design proposals were evaluated by static simulations and dynamic simulations to investigate the influence on the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> in terms of: • radial deformations of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> profiles, • total pressure and asperity contact pressure and • friction losses. The contact behaviour between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, for the different design proposals, at high temperature were also investigated. The results from the simulations were compared to results from earlier work on the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports. None of the design proposals generally provided lower friction losses compared to the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> support. The differences in friction loss should also by weighed against the potential cost saving, which is a question for VCC. The sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports showed in general higher asperity contact pressure compared to the design proposals. Most of the bonding between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports occurred on the top surfaces and the sides of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports for the different design proposals. An investigation of getting fatigue failure in the bedplate should also be considered, if VCC should proceed with {{one or more of the}} design proposals.

5000|$|Crankshafts on six-cylinder engines {{generally}} have either four or seven <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> Larger engines and diesels {{tend to use}} seven bearings because of high loadings and to avoid crankshaft flex. Because of the six-cylinder engine's smooth characteristic, {{there is a tendency}} for a driver to load the engine at low engine speeds. This can produce crankshaft flex in four <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> designs where the crank spans the distance of two cylinders between <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> This distance is longer than the distance between two adjacent <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> on a V6 with four mains, because the V6 has cylinder bores on opposite banks which overlap significantly; the overlap may be as high as 100%, minus the width of one connecting rod (1.00" [...] or so). In addition, modern high-compression engines subject the crankshaft to greater bending loads from higher peak gas pressures, requiring the crankthrows to have greater support from adjacent bearings, so it is now customary to design straight-sixes with seven <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b>|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this paper is to find a method to study the {{lubrication}} character of the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> and load condition of the crankshaft about the marine two-stroke diesel engine.

The load of <b>main</b> <b>bearings,</b> the minimum of oil film thick, orbital path of journal, average of asperity contact pressure are explored.

50|$|Although {{this seems}} {{impossible}} at first glance, {{the geometry of}} the engine does permit this overlap.

The <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> are similarly confined and each <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> can be supported by only a thin wall across the crankcase.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the health {{monitoring}} of a wind turbine drivetrain in a system perspective. A 5 -MW reference drivetrain installed on a spar type floating wind turbine is selected. Degradation and damage in the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> which carries the axial loads can cause severe damage inside the gearbox as it causes non-torque loads entering the gearbox. Therefore, monitoring of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> is very important. In this paper, different fault cases of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> are considered and responses are obtained by the multi-body simulation. Gearbox failure is then evaluated in two different perspectives: one from the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> itself by analysing vibration, and one through studying the remaining fatigue life of another bearing inside the gearbox. The results reveal that not only the local vibration of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> housing is important, but also the consequence of this degradation on other components can be {{a key factor in}} the “system” failure. This is a step forward in monitoring the wind turbine drivetrains on a system level...|$|R
