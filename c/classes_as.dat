It is an Indo-European language in the Anglo-Frisian branch of the Germanic family. After the Norman conquest, the Old English language was displaced and confined to the lower social <b>classes</b> <b>as</b> Norman French and Latin were used by the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Base animals {{selected}} for the two-stage grading up process to any EU herd book purebred class require a minimum of 3/4 Limousin content. Graded up females using the two-stage process then become eligible for entry into the main section of all EU herd book purebred <b>classes</b> <b>as</b> initial registration (or T.I.) Limousins when they reach 15/16 Limousin content. They are then legally identified as Limousin (i.e. 100% Limousin) – the breed code 34 often substitutes for the word Limousin in French discussions and reports on cattle breeding.|$|E

The Nuclear Engineering department used training reactors at Bagley Hall and later proposed that the university acquire a nuclear reactor to be installed on-campus. In 1957, the AEC approved $100,000 in funding for the University of Washington to install a permanent nuclear reactor on the campus, {{the first of its}} kind in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Information {{is largely}} absent {{regarding}} any major administrative changes Salih {{made to the}} Emirate of Aleppo. His only known institutional innovation was the post of shaykh al-dawla (chieftain of the state) or raʾīs al-balad (municipal chief), who served as Salih's trusted confidant and permanent representative {{with the people of}} Aleppo. The post emulated that of the shaykh, who played a secondary role to an amīr in a princely Kilabi clan. The shaykh al-dawla played an important political role in the city and came from a prominent leading family. Salih assigned Ibn Mustafad to the post and utilized the aḥdāth, which consisted of young armed men from the city's lower and middle <b>classes,</b> <b>as</b> a police force. Although they cooperated with Salih, the aḥdāth were still an independent force. Sometime during his reign, Salih also acquired a number of Turkish ghilmān, though details about them are lacking in the sources.|$|E
