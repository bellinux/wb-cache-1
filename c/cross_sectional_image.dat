The accurate {{description of}} the anatomy of individual defects, from <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>images,</b> is more important than attempts to fit them into a preconceived classification. One hundred specimens of hearts with a ventricular septal defect were reviewed to identify those features that are of value in the interpretation of <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>images.</b> Three groups of defect were identified: those which abutted the central fibrous body, those with a margin partly formed by an area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves, and those with entirely muscular margins.

40|$|The present {{research}} investigates how mental visualization of a 3 D object from 2 D <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>images</b> {{is influenced by}} displacing the images from the source object, as is customary in medical imaging. Three experiments were conducted to assess people 2 ̆ 7 s ability to integrate spatial information over a series of <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>images</b> in order to visualize an object posed in 3 D space. Participants used a hand-held tool to reveal a virtual rod as a sequence of cross-sectional images, which were displayed either directly {{in the space of}} exploration (in-situ) or displaced to a remote screen (ex-situ). They manipulated a response stylus to match the virtual rod 2 ̆ 7 s pitch (vertical slant), yaw (horizontal slant), or both. Consistent with the hypothesis that spatial colocation of image and source object facilitates mental visualization, we found that although single dimensions of slant were judged accurately with both displays, judging pitch and yaw simultaneously produced differences in systematic error between in-situ and ex-situ displays. Ex-situ imaging also exhibited errors such that the magnitude of the response was approximately correct but the direction was reversed. Regression analysis indicated that the in-situ judgments were primarily based on spatiotemporal visualization, while the ex-situ judgments relied on an ad hoc, screen-based heuristic. These findings suggest that in-situ displays may be useful in clinical practice by reducing error and facilitating the ability of radiologists to visualize 3 D anatomy from <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R
