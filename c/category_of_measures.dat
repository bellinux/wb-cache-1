40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{the text of}} a presentation held at the European Science Foundation Congress ‘Towards Safer Road Traffic in Southern Europe’ (May 31 st – June 2 nd, 2001, Ankara, Turkey). In this paper, methods to measure emotions are reviewed and possible applications for traffic research are discussed. Several studies show that emotions have effects {{on all kinds of}} cognitive processing. Therefore it is likely that a number of driving tasks is affected by emotions as well. As yet, not much is known about the way in which driving behaviour is affected by emotions and what the consequences for traffic safety are. When doing research on this topic, one should first be able to recognise and measure an emotion. Therefore this paper presents three categories of methods to measure emotions. The first category is observing overt behaviour. Overt behaviour aims to measure actions or action tendencies, for example by listening to vocal patterns, looking at facial expressions, or watching bodily gestures. An investigation into horn honking behaviour {{is an example of the}} use of this method in traffic. The second category is formed by physiological measures, for example heart rate and skin conductance. In traffic, this measure can be used, for example by measuring heart rate while driving. The third category is self-reported behaviour, for example interviews, diaries or questionnaires. This measure can be used while driving, for example by asking subjects how they feel at a particular moment. It can also be used after driving, for example by asking subjects to fill in a questionnaire about the emotions felt while driving. Of each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures,</b> examples are given of past use of these measures in traffic research. Also, implications for further research are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Safe {{operation}} {{is a central}} objective for nuclear power plants that must be supported by the entity managing the operation, the control room system. Safe {{operation is}} dependent on how technology is used, so {{it is important to}} take human factors issues into consideration. During design or modification of the control room system, its ability to support safe operation must be assessed to ensure that safety-critical discrepancies are eliminated before implementation. Methods are a necessary tool in human factors evaluation, and there are many to choose from. One prerequisite for evaluation is knowing what to evaluate, and this knowledge determines which methods are most suitable. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> that can guide the choice of evaluation methods for assessing nuclear power plant control room systems. Measures targeted by human factors evaluation methods were compared with aspects that contribute to safe operation and measures proposed and used by other researchers. The conclusion of this paper is that measures targeted by human factors evaluation methods can be grouped into six categories: system performance, task performance, teamwork, use of resources, user experience, and identification of design discrepancies. These six categories can guide the choice of human factors evaluation methods to assess socio-technical systems.

Currently, three <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> {{are used}} to assess {{cardiovascular}} autonomic dysfunction: <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> the Ewing-test, <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> heart-rate variability, and <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> baroreflex sensitivity. We studied the determinants <b>of</b> these <b>measures</b> obtained from cardiovascular autonomic function tests in the Hoorn Study. Methods. The study group (n = 631) consisted of a glucose-tolerance-stratified sample from a 50 - to 75 - year-old group of people. Cardiac cycle duration (RR interval) and continuous finger arterial pressure were measured under three conditions: during (a) spontaneous breathing, (b) six deep breaths over one minute, and (c) an active change in position from lying to standing. From these readings, ten <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> autonomic function were assessed (three Ewing, six heart-rate variability and one baroreflex sensitivity). As possible determinants we considered age, sex, glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease, use of anti- hypertensive drugs, anthropometric factors, metabolic factors and lifestyle factors. Results. Multivariate analysis showed that eight of ten cardiovascular autonomic function measures were most strongly associated with glucose tolerance. Furthermore, measures were moderately associated with age, sex, waist-to-hip ratio, use of anti-hypertensive drugs, and insulin. The measures were weakly associated With coronary artery disease but not with lipids. The strongest determinants seemed to differ between subjects with and without diabetes: in the non-diabetic subjects the most strongly associated were age and use of anti-hypertensive drugs and in subjects with diabetes, insulin. No consistent differences in association between the three <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> were observed. Conclusion/interpretation.

40|$|Buildings {{are one of}} {{the main}} {{end-uses}} of energy and are responsible of roughly a third of total GHG emissions. Although the building sector presents the largest and most cost effective emission reductions possibilities, this sector is currently characterized by an oversized carbon footprint. Following current trends, GHG emissions from building are expected to double by 2050. Developing countries lead the growth of the building sector as it is closely coupled with demographic and economic drivers. These and other variables can be evaluated by their influence on energy demands and thus, can project trends on GHG emissions from the use-phase of buildings. Especially in developing countries, the residential sector accounts for most of the energy consumed in buildings. Three different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> mitigation <b>measures</b> {{can be used to make}} this sector more energy efficient: a better insulation of buildings, fuel switching to more convenient fuels and more energy efficient technologies.
