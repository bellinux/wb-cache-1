40|$|Abstract Background Malaria, due to Plasmodium ovale, can be {{challenging}} to diagnose due to clinically mild disease and low parasite burden. Two genetically distinct sub-species of P. ovale exist: Plasmodium ovale curtisi (classic) and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri (variant). It is presently unknown if the sub-species causing infection affects performance of malaria diagnostic tests. The aim of this work was {{to understand how the}} genetically distinct sub-species, P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri, affect malaria diagnostic tests. Methods Plasmodium ovale-positive whole blood specimens were sub-speciated by PCR and sequencing of 18 S rRNA and dhfr-ts. Parasitaemia, morphology, pan-aldolase positivity, 18 <b>S</b> <b>copy</b> number, and dhfr-ts sequences were compared between sub-species. Results From 2006 to 2015, 49 P. ovale isolates were identified, of which 22 were P. o. curtisi and 27 P. o. wallikeri; 80 % were identified in the last five years, and 88 % were acquired in West Africa. Sub-species did not differ by parasitaemia, 18 <b>S</b> <b>copy</b> number, or pan-aldolase positivity. Lack of Schüffner’s stippling was over-represented among P. o. wallikeri isolates (p =  0. 02). Several nucleotide polymorphisms between the sub-species were observed, but they do not occur at sites believed to relate to antifolate binding. Conclusions Plasmodium ovale is increasing among travellers to West Africa, although sub-species do not differ significantly by parasitologic features such as parasitaemia. Absence of Schüffner’s stippling may be a feature specific to P. o. wallikeri and is a novel finding...|$|R
40|$|In eukaryotes, {{the primary}} {{components}} of the ribosome are encoded by multicopy nuclear ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes: 28 / 26 S, 18 S, 5. 8 S, and 5 <b>S.</b> <b>Copies</b> of these genes are typically localized within tandem arrays and homogenized within a genome. As a result, nuclear rRNA gene families have become a paradigm of concerted evolution. In filamentous fungi of the subphylum Pezizomycotina, 5 S rRNA genes exist as a large and dispersed multigene family, with between 50 and 100 copies per genome. To determine whether these genes defy the concerted evolution paradigm, we examined the patterns of evolution of these genes by using sequences from the complete genomes of four species. Analyses of these sequences revealed (i) multiple 5 S gene types within a genome, (ii) interspecies clustering of gene types, (iii) multiple identical gene types shared among species, (iv) multiple pseudogenes within a genome, and (v) presence/absence variation of individual 5 <b>S</b> <b>copies</b> in comparisons of closely related species. These results demonstrate that the 5 S family in these species is characterized by birth-and-death evolution under strong purifying selection. Furthermore, our results suggest that birth-and-death evolution occurs at different rates in the genera examined, and that the multiplication and movement of 5 S genes across the genome are highly dynamic. As such, we hypothesize that a mechanism resembling retroposition controls 5 S rRNA gene amplification, dispersal, and integration in the genomes of filamentous fungi...|$|R
