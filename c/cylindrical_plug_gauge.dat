The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars.

30|$|Although {{classical}} OAT mosaicplasty has favorable clinical outcomes, gap {{spaces between}} the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> which end up with fibrocartilage filling remain as an issue to solve. When the coverage of a standard area with equally sized <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> is calculated it can only cover 80  % of the defect. Radulescu et al. reported in their histological study the mean HC ratio of the treated area as 70  % (Rădulescu et al. 2008). In case {{of the use of}} differently sized plugs the gap spaces area can be reduced but cannot be eliminated (Hangody et al. 2004). There are a number of studies focused on the gap spaces. Ma et al. combined OAT mosaicplasty with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell in their experimental animal study and concluded that this combination promotes integration of dead spaces between plugs (Ma et al. 2015). Chen concluded that tissue-engineered cartilage tissue can promote the integration of dead spaces between round plugs in their animal study (Chen 2014). The hexagonal design has intended to solve the gap interspace issue between the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> used in classical OAT mosaicplasty with changing the geometry of the autologous plugs. In the nature the honey bees produce their hive in combination of hexagonal cells. In 1999 Hales proved mathematically that hexagonal geometry is the way of build a construct with minimum amount of material without gaps (Hales 1999). Thus, the HOGS provides hexagonal arrangement with hexagonal prism shaped plugs which can be easily harvested and placed to the defect area with same surgical steps as in classical OAT mosaicplasty. Therefore we can presume that the learning curve of this technique would be short. Eventually, we observed in our study that application of OAT mosaicplasty with the new HOGS has no difference in surgical exposure and steps of the surgical procedure. However, the preparation step of the cartilage lesion has technically more difficult than harvesting the graft. Nevertheless, it was possible to align hexagonal prism shaped grafts without leaving interspaces in the defect area {{with the help of the}} geometrical nature of hexagons and obtain higher levels of coverage. We revealed according to these subjective observations HOGS can be an option to solve the gap space issue faced during the classical OAT mosaicplasty. But, it is obvious that future clinical or experimental studies have to prove the tissue quality of the cartilage tissue at the end of the treatment.|$|R

40|$|Six ball plugs {{were used}} to seal the oil lines in Jaguar {{cylinder}} heads using the press-fit process. The balls were made out of the 7075 Al alloy and were produced by forging, whereas the heads were made from the 319 Al alloy and were low pressure cast at the Essex Aluminum Plant (EAP), and machined at the Cleveland Engine Plant (CEP). The ball plugs were inserted at the CEP. Leaking was observed through the ball plugs during the CEP engine quality control operation. An investigation was launched to determine and eliminate {{the cause of the}} leaks. In order to isolate the main leak culprits, tests were subdivided into sections, which included: the heat treatment parameters applied to the 319 Al cylinder heads; metallurgical and geometrical characterization of the ball plug including: ball and casting microstructural analysis, hardness and homogeneity analysis, casting scratch and compression tests, characterization of the ball/casting hole wall interface, ball plug insertion and pressure tightness tests, effect of the insertion speed, ball lubrication and casting microhardness on the insertion force; geometrical investigation of the cylinder head boss design; leak mechanisms SEM/EDS investigation, as well as the Finite Element Analysis of the stress distribution in the ball and cylinder plug systems.

Following radial recoil, the true Poisson’s ratio of the solid phase of NP tissue increased linearly with increasing strain and demonstrated strain-rate dependency.

30|$|A focal full {{thickness}} {{cartilage lesion}} of knee joint {{is one of}} the commonly seen intraarticular pathologies among the joint cartilage problems. The clinical picture can be ranged from knee pain, locking and swelling to severe functional impairment. Moreover, large defects are more likely to cause functional impairment which is especially important in young and physically active individuals and athlete (Bentley and Minas 2000). The treatment of focal cartilage lesion in the knee joint is still a challenging issue (Richter et al. 2015). Lesions > 3  cm 2 have worse results compared to smaller defects (Solheim et al. 2013). The management techniques of full thickness cartilage lesions can be listed as osteochondral autograft transfer (OAT) mosaicplasty, mosaicplasty with synthetic plugs whole tissue transplantation, autologous chondrocyte implantation, cell based scaffold treatment, tissue engineered collagen matrices with autologous chondrocytes and bone marrow stimulation via microfracture (Bedi et al. 2010; Clavé et al. 2016). Among them OAT mosaicplasty is a method which has satisfactory outcomes (Lynch et al. 2015; Hangody et al. 2010; Oztürk et al. 2006). This method is based on the transfer of osteochondral grafts harvested from the non-weight bearing areas of knee to the lesion area. Furthermore, in classical OAT mosaicplasty the autologous osteochondral grafts are <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> of spongious bone covered with hyaline cartilage at one end. The advantages of OAT mosaicplasty are reconstruction of the articular cartilage with high percentages of hyaline cartilage, being a single stage procedure, low risk of disease transmission, and low cost. In spite of the favorable clinical results there are some pitfalls of mosaicplasty treatment especially in cases of large defects. Fibrocartilage filling of the gap spaces between <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> and insufficient donor cartilage reserves are among the disadvantages of classical OAT mosaicplasty. The new hexagonal osteochondral graft system (HOGS) investigated in this study is designed with the inspiration taken from the honey bees. This hexagonal geometry is used in several fields of technology (Kalogirou 2004; Kaushika and Sumathy 2003).|$|R

Restoration of surface congruency and stability of the reconstruction may be jeopardized by early mobilization. To investigate the biomechanical effectiveness of osteochondral transplantation, we performed a standardized osteochondral transplantation in eight intact human cadaver knees, using three <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> on a full-thickness cartilage defect, bottomed on one condyle, unbottomed on the contralateral condyle.

Following weight bearing motion two out of eight unbottomed mosaicplasties showed subsidence of the plugs according to Tekscan measurements. This study demonstrates that a three-plug mosaicplasty is effective in restoring the increased border contact pressure of a cartilage defect, which may postpone the development of early osteoarthritis.

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a large molecule with {{an important role in}} cartilage growth and metabolism, however, it first must reach the chondrocytes to exert its effect.
