Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as <b>castellation</b> and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E

[...] Each house also has its own entrance set under a smaller pointed arch. [...] The roof is of slate, and a chimneystack sits on top of each party wall.|$|E

60|$|Sir Nathaniel, without speaking, {{led the way}} to the east, {{down the}} hill. When they had descended and risen again, they found {{themselves}} on the eastern brink of a steep hill. It was of lesser height than that on which the Castle was situated; but it was so placed that it commanded the various hills that crowned the ridge. All along the ridge the rock cropped out, bare and bleak, but broken in rough natural <b>castellation.</b> The form of the ridge was a segment of a circle, with the higher points inland to the west. In the centre rose the Castle, on the highest point of all. Between the various rocky excrescences were groups of trees of various sizes and heights, amongst some of which were what, in the early morning light, looked like ruins. These--whatever they were--were of massive grey stone, probably limestone rudely cut--if indeed they were not shaped naturally. The fall of the ground was steep all along the ridge, so steep that here and there both trees and rocks and buildings seemed to overhang the plain far below, through which ran many streams.|$|E
