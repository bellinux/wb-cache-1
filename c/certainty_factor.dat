The number of points scored is inversely proportional {{to the number of}} answers chosen. For example, if a scholar chose one choice and got it right, they would score a point. If they chose two answers and one was right, they would score 1/2 a point. If they chose three and one was right, they would score 1/3 of a point, and so forth.

40|$|Uncertainty {{processing}} methods are analysed {{from the viewpoint}} of their sensitivity to small variations of <b>certainty</b> <b>factors.</b> The analysis makes use of the algebraic theory which defines the function for combining partial <b>certainty</b> <b>factors</b> by means of a group operation of the ordered Abelian group over the interval of uncertainty. Two approaches are introduced: (a) sensitivity analysis of the inference network and (b) calculation of second order probabilities. Sensitivity functions are defined as partial derivatives of the combining function with respect to their arguments. Based on the sensitivity functions, we define the path sensitivity which measures the sensitivity of a larger part of the inference network. If a set of samples of <b>certainty</b> <b>factors</b> is available instead of a single value, the second order probability distribution can be approximated by the distribution of an average value. It is shown that the parametric form of the distribution is completely determined by the combining function. ...|$|R

40|$|Error based pruning {{can be used}} {{to prune}} a {{decision}} tree and it does not require the use of validation data. It is implemented in the widely used C 4. 5 decision tree software. It uses a parameter, the <b>certainty</b> <b>factor,</b> that affects the size of the pruned tree. Several researchers have compared error based pruning with other approaches, and have shown results that suggest that error based pruning results in larger trees that give no increase in accuracy. They further suggest that as more data is added to the training set, the tree size after applying error based pruning continues to grow even though there is no increase in accuracy. It appears that these results were obtained with the default <b>certainty</b> <b>factor</b> value.

The framework solves {{some of the problems}} associated with zoning and geographic information systems (GIS), the first being the dilemma of selecting either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Favourability modeling with <b>certainty</b> <b>factors</b> is a good compromise, offering a valid quantitative method, where subjectivity or expert knowledge can be incorporated in the analysis, particularly when data are not sufficient or reliable. A second problem is associated with the popularity of thematic data which may limit the establishment of quantitative models. With favourability modeling, thematic data are transformed into continuous data, by considering the degree of relationship, using <b>certainty</b> <b>factors</b> in this paper, between the hazard and classes of each map. Another issue concerns the rigidity of some quantitative techniques. As it may be more effective to use surrogates, simply because of the cost, accessibility, or difficulty of measuring the original property, the FM approach provides the advantage of flexibility as results are generated independently from the input data. The technique is also capable of zoning more than one type of geological hazard. Landslide hazard maps were generated from a 1960 dataset, and compared with the occurrenc...|$|R
