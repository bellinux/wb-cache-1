40|$|High-intensity ultrashort laser pulses {{focused on}} metal targets readily {{generate}} hot dense plasmas which accelerate ions efficiently and can pave way to <b>compact</b> <b>table-top</b> accelerators. Laser-driven ion acceleration studies predominantly focus on protons, which experience the maximum acceleration owing to their highest charge-to-mass ratio.

Here, we present an experimental demonstration of how the nanostructuring of a copper target can be optimized for enhanced acceleration of carbon ions over protons or Cu-ions. Specifically, a thin (≈ 0. 25 μm) layer of 25 - 30 nm diameter Cu nanoparticles, sputter- deposited on a polished Cu-substrate, enhances the carbon ion energy almost 10 -fold at a laser intensity of 1. 2 x 10 (18) W/cm 2.

40|$|The {{necessity}} for <b>compact</b> <b>table-top</b> x-ray sources with higher brightness, shorter wavelength and shorter pulse duration {{has led to}} the development of complementary sources based on laser-plasma accelerators, in contrast to conventional accelerators. Relativistic interaction of short-pulse lasers with underdense plasmas results in acceleration of electrons and in consequence in the emission of spatially coherent radiation, which is known in the literature as betatron radiation. In this article we report on our recent results in the rapidly developing field of secondary x-ray radiation generated by high-energy electron pulses. The betatron radiation is characterized with a novel setup allowing to measure the energy, the spatial energy distribution in the far-field of the beam and the source size in a single laser shot. Furthermore, the polarization state is measured for each laser shot. In this way the emitted betatron x-rays can be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool to retrieve very subtle information of the electron dynamics within the plasma wave.

However, the fundamental acceleration principle, namely, to apply an external radiofrequency (RF) electric field to accelerate charged particles, remains unchanged.

40|$|High {{harmonic}} generation (HHG) is an established means of producing coherent, short wavelength, ultrafast pulses from a <b>compact</b> set-up. <b>Table-top</b> high-harmonic sources {{are increasingly being}} used to image physical and biological systems using emerging techniques such as coherent diffraction imaging and ptychography. These novel imaging methods require coherent illumination, and it is therefore important to both characterize the spatial coherence of high-harmonic beams and understand the processes which limit this property. Here we investigate the near- and far-field spatial properties of high-harmonic radiation generated in a gas cell. The variation with harmonic order of the intensity profile, wavefront curvature, and complex coherence factor is measured in the far-field by the SCIMITAR technique. Using the Gaussian-Schell model, {{the properties of the}} harmonic beam in the plane of generation are deduced. Our results show that the order-dependence of the harmonic spatial coherence is consistent with partial coherence induced by both variation of the intensity-dependent dipole phase as well as finite spatial coherence of the driving radiation. These findings are used to suggest ways in which the coherence of harmonic beams could be increased further, which would have direct benefits to imaging with high-harmonic radiation.

5000|$|By 1978, {{video games}} were well {{established}} in the U.S. coin-operated amusement industry, but their popularity was secondary to the industry stalwarts of pool and pinball. That changed {{with the introduction of}} a new game developed in Japan. While video games had been introduced to Japan soon after hitting the United States, the Japanese arcade industry had remained primarily focused on electro-mechanical driving and shooting games and a type of slot machine called the [...] "medal game" [...] that accepted and paid out in medals instead of currency {{so as not to be}} classified as a gambling game. In 1977, the arrival of Breakout, distributed locally by the Nakamura Manufacturing Company, and the advent of <b>table-top</b> game <b>units,</b> pioneered by Taito, created new demand for video games in snack bars and tea houses. Taito designer Tomohiro Nishikado decided to build on the popularity of Breakout by replacing the paddle in the game with a gun battery and the bricks in the game with rows of aliens that would descend line-by-line while firing at the player. Taito released this game in 1978 as Space Invaders.Space Invaders introduced or popularized several important concepts in arcade video games, including play regulated by lives instead of a timer or set score, gaining extra lives through accumulating points, and the tracking of the high score achieved on the machine. It was also the first game to confront the player with waves of targets that would shoot back at the player and the first to include background music during game play, a simple four-note loop. With its intense game play and competitive scoring features, Space Invaders became a national phenomenon as over 200,000 invader games—counting clones and knockoffs—entered Japanese game centers by the middle of 1979. While not quite as popular in the United States, Space Invaders became the biggest hit the industry had seen since the Great Depression as Midway, serving as the North American manufacturer, moved over 60,000 cabinets. The one-two punch of Space Invaders and the Atari game Asteroids (1979), which moved 70,000 units and popularized the recording of multiple high scores in a table, resulted in video arcade games completely displacing pinball and other amusements to become the central attraction of not just the shopping mall arcade, but also a variety of street locations from convenience stores to bowling alleys to pizza parlors. Many of the best-selling games of 1980 and 1981 such as Galaxian (1979), Defender (1980), Missile Command (1980), Tempest (1981), and Galaga (1981) focused on shooting mechanics and achieving high scores. Starting with Pac Man in 1980, which sold 96,000 units in the United States, a new wave of games appeared that focused on identifiable characters and alternate mechanics such as navigating a maze or traversing a series of platforms. Aside from Pac Man and its sequel, Ms. Pac-Man (1982), the most popular games in this vein were Donkey Kong (1981) and Q*bert (1982).|$|R
40|$|Highly {{efficient}} {{generation of}} strong-field terahertz (THz) pulses by using very short laser pulses ~ 30 fs has some challenges due to chromatic aberrations. Here, we demonstrate an optical-to-THz conversion efficiency of 0. 2 % using a 3 mJ pump pulse energy. This result {{paves the way}} for strong-field applications of THz radiation. Commercial Ti:sapphire laser systems delivering more than 20 mJ output pulse energy at the central wavelength of 800 nm with 150 fs pulse width is appropriate for <b>table-top,</b> <b>compact</b> terahertz (THz) sources [1]. The expected maximum THz output pulse energy can be scaled up to ~ 100 μJ, when employing optical rectification using tilted-pulse-fronts (TPF) and cryogenic cooling to mitigate THz absorption in the lithium niobate crystal. We have already demonstrated 0. 2 % optical-to-THz energy efficiency by using 150 fs Ti:sapphire laser pulses. In order to further scale up the THz output energy from the μJ to mJ-level, customized Ti:sapphire systems delivering J-level output pulse energy are promising. However, this kind of laser system has an extremely broadband infrared spectrum. When these ultrashort laser pulses (30 fs) are used for THz generation with the conventional TPF technique, there are several limitations [2]: (i) Effective interaction length for efficient THz generation will be shorter than longer pulses (150 fs). (ii) The diffracted optical beam from the grating will be expanded to an unmanageably large size due to the large bandwidth. (iii) Different spectral components will be imaged into different spatial volumes in the crystal. We systematically investigatedifferent imaging schemes including one concave mirror (f=- 100 -mm), two concave mirrors (f 1 =- 200 mm, f 2 =- 100 mm) and one bi-convex lens (f= 60 mm) for THz generation using TPF in lithium niobate driven by 30 fs Ti:sapphire laser pulses. The best results of 6 μJ THz output energy, 0. 2 % optical-to-THz conversion efficiency with 20 MV/m electric field in lithium niobate at room temperature pumped at 3 mJ is achieved from the simplest scheme with one bi-convex lens as the imaging element, shown in Fig. 1 (a). As exhibited in Fig. 1 (b) and (c), the single-cycle THz pulse holds a peak frequency at 0. 32 THz. The maintenance of 0. 2 % optical-to-THz efficiency from 150 fs to 30 fs is helpful for scaling up THz output energy from μJ to mJ-level when employing J-level ultrashort Ti:sapphiure laser pulses. Future work will be focused on cryogenic cooling of the generationcrystal, improving out-coupling of the THz pulse at the interface of lithium niobate and air, newly designing the generation lithium niobate crystals, trying contact-grating method to make a linear generation geometry, and finally scaling up the output THz energy by impinging the generation crystal with J-level laser pulses for THz generation...|$|R
