40|$|The {{structure}} of the present global capitalist world, which is composed of various sets of <b>capitalist</b> <b>systems,</b> can be clearly explained and described with the mathematical concept of 'measure' instead of the conventional term of 'value'. The history of the commodity world {{is that of the}} irreversible order of three measures: use-measure, exchange-measure and temporal exchange-measure. According to that order, sets of <b>capitalist</b> <b>systems</b> have 'grown' up to the present day. This process of capitalist 'growth' is a transformation process from the realeconomic world or space-time of use-measure to the rational space of null sets dominated by money. It may foretell the destiny of mankind's economic activities and the vicissitudes of human civilization...|$|R
5|$|Newspapers {{across the}} country defended the union workers, and the trio decided to assassinate Frick. They {{believed}} the assassination would arouse the working class to unite and revolt against the <b>capitalist</b> <b>system.</b> Berkman's plan was to assassinate Frick and then kill himself; Goldman was to explain Berkman's motives after his death; and Aronstam was to follow Berkman {{in the event that}} he failed in his mission. Emulating his Russian idols, Berkman tried to make a bomb, but when that failed, he went to Pittsburgh with the plan to use a handgun.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial crises, {{and unemployment}} in the United States, which were viewed as failings of the <b>capitalist</b> <b>system</b> that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used {{as a form of}} rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S. policy.|$|E
5|$|At the League's Fourth Conference in May 1888, {{factional}} divisions {{became increasingly}} apparent between Morris' anti-parliamentary socialists, the parliamentary socialists, and the anarchists; the Bloomsbury Branch were expelled for supporting parliamentary action. Under {{the leadership of}} Charles Mowbray, the League's anarchist wing were growing and called on the League to embrace violent action in trying to overthrow the <b>capitalist</b> <b>system.</b> By autumn 1889 the anarchists {{had taken over the}} League's executive committee and Morris was stripped of the editorship of Commonweal in favour of the anarchist Frank Kitz. This alienated Morris from the League, which had also become a financial burden for him; he had been subsidising its activities with £500 a year, a very large sum of money at the time. By the autumn of 1890, Morris left the Socialist League, with his Hammersmith branch seceding to become the independent Hammersmith Socialist Society in November 1890.|$|E
5000|$|When one {{speaks of}} power in {{connection}} with capitalism, one typically thinks of {{the powers of the}} capitalists and their diverse lieutenants. But <b>capitalist</b> <b>systems</b> are characterized by structural forms of power, the exercise of meta-power and various forms of relational control. [...] These systems operate to change the world, not only in material terms (production systems, products, infrastructures as well as depletion of resources, pollution of the environment, alteration of ecological systems) but in social and psychological terms (changing people’s levels of resources, their welfare; changing communities, occupations, lifestyles, cultural perspectives). <b>Capitalist</b> <b>systems</b> impact then not only on individuals, but communities, resource bases, and ecological systems. These are extraordinary powers shaping and reshaping human lives and destinies.|$|R
50|$|Left-wing {{terrorism}} (sometimes called Marxist-Leninist {{terrorism or}} revolutionary/left-wing terrorism) is terrorism meant to overthrow conservative or <b>capitalist</b> <b>systems</b> {{and replace them}} with Marxist-Leninist, socialist, or Anarchist societies. Left-wing terrorism also occurs within already socialist states as activism against the current ruling government.|$|R

5|$|In a {{twist on}} The Mansion of Happiness, McLoughlin Brothers and Parker Brothers {{released}} several {{games in the}} late 1880s based on the then-popular Algeresque rags to riches theme. Games such as Game of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded, Messenger Boy, Game of the Telegraph Boy, and The Office Boy allowed players to emulate the successful capitalist. Players began these games as company underlings, newbies, or gofers, and, with luck, won {{the game with a}} seat in the President's Office (rather than a seat in Heaven, as in The Mansion of Happiness) or as Head of the Firm. In Parker Brothers' The Office Boy, spaces designating carelessness, inattentiveness, and dishonesty sent the player back on the track while spaces designating capability, earnestness, and honesty advanced him toward the goal. Such games reflected the belief that the enterprising American– regardless of his background, humble or privileged– would be rewarded under the American <b>capitalist</b> <b>system,</b> and insinuated that success was equated with increased social status via the accumulation of wealth.|$|E
5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the <b>capitalist</b> <b>system,</b> the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E

50|$|Capitalism {{generally}} {{refers to}} an economic system where {{the means of production}} are largely or entirely privately owned and operated for a profit, structured on the process of capital accumulation.

40|$|Debates that {{emphasize}} rapid economic recovery from major crises can extinguish progressive views that examine fundamental issues for sound economic management of present-day <b>capitalist</b> <b>systems,</b> such as: {{the determination of}} appropriate modes of cooperation including the procedures for intervention during crises, the introduction of structural changes that enable domestic economies to pursue appropriate industrial policies as well as erect institutions that could withstand external shocks, and, more importantly, the pursuit of fundamental reforms in the international economic architecture {{to allow for the}} management of cross-border flows of resources as well as coordinated adjustments to economic imbalances. There remains a lot to be done to make present-day <b>capitalist</b> <b>systems</b> reach a balance between domestic and global goals and thereby allow them to enlarge economic welfare without compromising national sovereignty. ...|$|R
25|$|Most modern social liberals, {{including}} centrist or left-of-center political groups, {{believe that}} the capitalist economic system should be fundamentally preserved, but the status quo regarding the income gap must be reformed.

50|$|Although the Marxian {{school is}} {{considered}} heterodox, ideas {{that have come}} out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy; certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to capital accumulation and the business cycle, such as creative destruction, have been fitted for use in <b>capitalist</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a <b>capitalist</b> {{economic}} <b>system,</b> {{production is}} carried out for private profit, and decisions regarding investment and allocation of factor inputs are determined by business owners in factor markets. The means of production are primarily owned by private enterprises, and decisions regarding production and investment are determined by private owners in capital markets. <b>Capitalist</b> <b>systems</b> range from laissez-faire, with minimal government regulation and state enterprise, to regulated and social market systems, with the aims of ameliorating market failures (see economic intervention) or supplementing the private marketplace with social policies to promote equal opportunities (see welfare state), respectively.|$|R
25|$|The {{institution}} {{of slavery in}} the United States deprived multiple generations {{of the opportunity to}} own land. Legally, slaves could not own property, but in practice they did acquire capital — and generally perceived themselves as the lowest-ranking members of the <b>capitalist</b> <b>system.</b> As legal slavery came to an end, many freed people fully expected to gain ownership of the land they had worked.|$|E
