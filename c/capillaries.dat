The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called <b>capillaries.</b> Warm blood {{flows into the}} <b>capillaries,</b> helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more <b>capillaries,</b> and more heat can be released.

5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated <b>capillaries</b> in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the <b>capillaries</b> and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the <b>capillaries</b> into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} in the North Sea {{have shown that the}} overall incidence of decompression sickness for in-water and surface decompression is similar, but surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II (neurological) DCS than in-water decompression. A possible explanation is that during the final stage of ascent, bubbles are produced that are stopped in the lung <b>capillaries.</b> During recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, the diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that they pass through the pulmonary <b>capillaries</b> and reach the systemic circulation on the arterial side, later lodging in systemic <b>capillaries</b> and causing neurological symptoms.

In this study, we investigated the interrelationship of leukocyte margination with characteristics of functional <b>capillary</b> geometry and microhemodynamics in alveolar <b>capillary</b> networks. In 22 anesthetized rabbits we assessed functional <b>capillary</b> density, average <b>capillary</b> length, {{red blood cell}} velocity and leukocyte kinetics in alveolar <b>capillary</b> networks in vivo by intravital fluorescence microscopy. In alveolar wall areas of 12, 800 +/- 1, 800 mu m(2), we detected 3. 6 +/- 0. 5 sticking leukocytes and 21. 0 +/- 1. 9 functional <b>capillary</b> segments with an average <b>capillary</b> length of 35. 7 +/- 2. 1 mu m. We calculated that approximately 15 % of functional <b>capillary</b> segments are blocked by marginated leukocytes. Leukocyte margination was predominantly observed in <b>capillary</b> networks characterized by a high functional <b>capillary</b> density, short <b>capillary</b> segments and low red blood cell velocities. The multitude of interconnected <b>capillary</b> channels in these networks may allow alveolar blood flow to bypass marginated leukocytes. Hence, this interrelationship may be relevant for maintenance of adequate alveolar perfusion and low <b>capillary</b> network resistance despite excessive leukocyte margination in the pulmonary microvasculature.

40|$|SUMMARY. Various {{indices of}} <b>capillary</b> {{supply to the}} rat heart were studied in {{neonatal}} rats injected for 2 or 4 weeks with protamine sulfate in saline (subcutaneously, 60 mg/kg body weight, 2 times/day). Cardiac capillarization was evaluated not only by traditional indices for the <b>capillary</b> supply, such as mean <b>capillary</b> density and myocyte-to-capillary ratio, but also by a more advanced morpnometric method of <b>capillary</b> domains. This method allows the estimation of both the average radius of the Krogh tissue cylinder and its variability, which reflects the heterogeneity of <b>capillary</b> spacing found to be an independent morphological determinant of oxygen diffusion in the tissue. The results were evaluated with respect to regional differences (subendocardial vs. middle section), age differences, {{and the effect of}} protamine. No regional differences in <b>capillary</b> supply were found in this experimental situation. Hearts from older rats had significantly decreased <b>capillary</b> supply, expressed as lower <b>capillary</b> density, larger <b>capillary</b> domains, and greater radius of the tissue cylinder. On the other hand, the heterogeneity of <b>capillary</b> spacing decreased significantly with age. Protamine-injected animals, when compared to their control littermates, had a significantly higher cell-to-capillary ratio, lower <b>capillary</b> density, larger <b>capillary</b> domains, greater radius of the tissue cylinder, and larger variability in <b>capillary</b> spacing.

5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during decompression {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow bubbles {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal decompression to suddenly pass through the <b>capillaries</b> and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms. This could explain the difference in outcomes of in-water decompression versus surface decompression. Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods is about the same, that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in-water decompression. It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, bubbles are produced that are trapped by the lung <b>capillaries,</b> and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have a very}} {{efficient}} system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their <b>capillaries</b> per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand {{the pressure of the}} ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow.

The blood-brain barrier is not present in areas of the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids, such as the pineal gland, area postrema, and some areas of the hypothalamus. There is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which serves the same purpose as the blood–brain barrier, but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems.|$|E

From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine the volatility of nihonium. The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. Teflon <b>capillaries</b> at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the nihonium atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the nihonium atoms would be carried along the <b>capillaries</b> by a carrier gas. While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the Teflon <b>capillaries</b> at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the carrier gas.

40|$|<b>Capillary</b> {{pressure}} {{is one of}} the important parameters when describing flow in porous media. This parameter is nevertheless in some cases neglected, especially if no reliable measured data is available. The purpose of this work was to investigate how <b>capillary</b> pressure influences reservoir behaviour. The key question has been if the <b>capillary</b> pressure could be neglected when simulating reservoir production or if the <b>capillary</b> pressure has significant impact on the production performance. This problem was addressed by comparing the production from simulations of core floods without <b>capillary</b> pressure to simulations with <b>capillary</b> pressure included. A match without <b>capillary</b> pressure included was achieved by tuning the relative permeability curves. Then <b>capillary</b> pressure was introduced while keeping the other parameters identical. The total oil production was significantly lower when <b>capillary</b> pressure was included. The relative permeability of oil had to be increased and the relative permeability of the injected fluids had to be reduced to get a new match with <b>capillary</b> pressure. The relative permeability for the match with zero <b>capillary</b> pressure was then compared to the relative permeability for the match with <b>capillary</b> pressure included. The difference in relative permeability was found to be significant. The relative permeability of oil had to be increased and the relative permeability of the injected fluids had to be reduced in the match with <b>capillary</b> pressure included. It was concluded that the <b>capillary</b> pressure had an important 2 impact on production behaviour and therefore also on history matching of relative permeability.
