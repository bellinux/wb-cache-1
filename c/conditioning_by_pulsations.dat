The {{most likely}} cause of cable externalization is insulation abrasion, which often occurs at the can or between the right ventricular coil and superior vena cava (SVC) coil. We report a rare case of an adult male whose ICD lead cable was externalized at the proximal portion of the SVC coil. This lead became fixed to the wall at the subclavian vein and SVC and became bent between these adhesions.

40|$|Plant {{species can}} {{condition}} the physico-chemical and biological properties of soil {{in ways that}} modify plant growth via plant–soil feedback (PSF). Plant growth can be positively affected, negatively affected or neutrally affected <b>by</b> soil <b>conditioning</b> <b>by</b> the same or other plant species. Soil <b>conditioning</b> <b>by</b> other plant species has particular relevance to ecological restoration of historic ecosystems because sites set aside for restoration are often conditioned by other, potentially non-native, plant species. We investigated changes in properties of jarrah forest soils after long-term (35 years) <b>conditioning</b> <b>by</b> pines (Pinus radiata), Sydney blue gums (Eucalyptus saligna), both non-native, plantation trees, and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata; dominant native tree). Then, we tested {{the influence of the}} conditioned soils on the growth of jarrah seedlings. Blue gums and pines similarly conditioned the physico-chemical properties of soils, which differed from soil <b>conditioning</b> caused <b>by</b> jarrah. Especially important were the differences in conditioning of the properties C:N ratio, pH, and available K. The two eucalypt species similarly conditioned the biological properties of soil (i. e. community level physiological profile, numbers of fungal-feeding nematodes, omnivorous nematodes, and nematode channel ratio), and these differed from <b>conditioning</b> caused <b>by</b> pines. Species-specific <b>conditioning</b> of soil did not translate into differences in the amounts of biomass produced by jarrah seedlings and a neutral PSF was observed. In summary, we found that decades of soil <b>conditioning</b> <b>by</b> non-native plantation trees did not influence the growth of jarrah seedlings and will therefore not limit restoration of jarrah following the removal of the plantation trees...|$|R

5000|$|RT Aurigae is an F to G type Classical Cepheid {{variable}} which {{varies from}} magnitude +5.00 to +5.82 with {{a period of}} 3.728309 days. [...] The variability was discovered in 1905. [...] It was quickly recognised {{as a member of}} the class of Cepheid variables, but their nature was not understood at that time. Radial velocity changes were detected corresponding to the brightness variations, but the idea that these were caused <b>by</b> stellar <b>pulsations</b> and temperature changes was largely dismissed in favour of orbital motions of a binary star.

It is then possible to reduce the sampling error by performing a correct averaging. The reduction of the sampling error is confirmed by simulations. Validerad; 2004; 20060922 (ysko) </p...|$|R

40|$|Long-period (Pc 4 - 5) modulations of ionospheric {{cosmic noise}} {{absorption}} (CNA) at Siple, Antarctica (L= 4. 2) are rarely seen unaccompanied <b>by</b> <b>pulsations</b> {{in the local}} geomagnetic field. Conjugate modulations of ∿ 2 min period lasting about one hour were recorded near local noon by riometers at Siple and Roberval on October 30, 1983. The Siple magnetometer records show little evidence of pulsations at this time. The absence of a ground magnetic signature implies that if such events are caused by ULF hydromagnetic waves (e. g., a field line resonance), the waves are highly localized and effectively screened by the ionosphere. In addition, the possible existence of a recurrent particle precipitation structure in space was suggested by observations of absorption modulations with periods of 10 - 15 min which occurred on several days {{at about the same}} time of day. These modulations were also generally unaccompanied <b>by</b> magnetic <b>pulsations...</b>|$|R
