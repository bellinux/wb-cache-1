5000|$|Founded in January 2002, the Center for E-Commerce Infrastructure Development (<b>CECID)</b> is a {{research}} and development center in the University of Hong Kong committed to promoting e-commerce infrastructure development and standardization. A member of OASIS, W3C, RosettaNet, and the ebXML Asia Committee, <b>CECID</b> actively takes part {{in the development and}} implementation of international standards, such as Universal Business Language, Web Services, and RosettaNet. Through participation in these international and regional standards bodies, <b>CECID</b> follows closely the latest developments in e-commerce technology standards and promotes Hong Kong's e-commerce technology to technical communities overseas.|$|E
50|$|CECID's {{operation}} is primarily financed by R&D {{grants from the}} Innovation and Technology Commission of the Hong Kong Government for its two flagship research projects, namely Project Phoenix and Project Pyxis. In its completed Project Phoenix, <b>CECID</b> has produced several software packages that implement major ebXML specifications. These software packages include Hermes Message Service Handler, ebMail, and ebXMLRR Registry/Repository and are currently released under open source licenses on the freebXML.org website that <b>CECID</b> established in 2002. Commenced in 2004, Project Pyxis targets to develop enabling technology for e-business interoperability between trading partners and within large enterprises using various complementary and competing Web Services standards.|$|E

We, on behalf SKLSE, would like to thank all those who have helped us along the way, and truly express our appreciation for all of you. First of all, {{we would like to thank}} ebAC (ebXML Asian Committee) and Chairman of ebITG (ebXML Interoperability Test Group) Mr. Masahiko Narita for inviting us to attend the 7 th ebAC in Hong Kong, and join the ebITG and the ebIOT test Asian-wide afterwards. A big thanks goes to <b>CECID</b> (Center for E-Commerce Infrastructure Development) ...|$|E

40|$|Mango blossom gall midge, Procontarinia mangiferae (=Erosomyia mangiferae Felt), is an {{invasive}} pest {{that causes}} economic damage worldwide. The objectives {{of our study}} were to highlight the genetic and ecological abilities of this monophagous gall midge to invade new habitats and to evaluate its genetic structure on an isolated island. This study, carried out in subtropical Reunion Island, is {{based on data from}} population dynamics surveys and from molecular analyses (mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites). Using 11 microsatellite loci and an extensive sampling of 27 populations at 17 sites, we tested the genetic differentiation between populations sampled on different mango organs and cultivars at different seasons and under different climatic and cultural environments. We checked for the existence of a seasonal bottleneck. Our results showed that a single species, P. mangiferae, was present all year round with no genetic bottleneck at any of the sites sampled, regardless of the climatic and cultural conditions, and that it fed on inflorescences and young leaves. These characteristics showed the ecological plasticity of P. mangiferae, despite its low genetic diversity and, consequently, the invasive potential of this species. Populations in Reunion Island are structured into two clusters in sympatry and present in different proportions at each site. One cluster was more frequently found in the cultivated mango area. This work provides insights into the relationships between gall midges and tree host plants in a subtropical agro-ecosystem, as well as into the role of the population genetic structure in the establishment process of a monophagous invasive <b>cecid</b> fly.
