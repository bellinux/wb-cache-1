25|$|The {{issue of}} extramarital sex has been {{examined}} {{frequently in the}} United States. Many surveys asking about extramarital sex in the United States have relied on convenience samples. A <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> means surveys are given to whoever happens to be easily available (e.g., volunteer college students or volunteer magazine readers). Convenience samples do not accurately reflect {{the population of the}} United States as a whole, which can cause serious biases in survey results. It should not be surprising, therefore, that surveys of extramarital sex in the United States have produced widely differing results. These studies report that about 12–26% of married women and 15–43% of married men engage in extramarital sex.|$|E

40|$|Graduate {{students}} in applied {{areas such as}} psychology and public health often collect data for their dissertation projects and are typically faced with constraints that result in their samples being viewed as mere <b>convenience</b> <b>samples.</b> In describing their sampling plan and its limitations, students often struggle to evaluate {{the quality of their}} sampling procedures. This poster takes the view that all samples of human participants are <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> to some degree, {{if for no other reason}} than ethical considerations make participation voluntary and financial limits make pure random sampling exorbitantly expensive. According to this view, psychology and other applied fields are disciplines built on <b>convenience</b> <b>samples.</b> In spite of the use of <b>convenience</b> <b>samples,</b> applied statistics and data analysis procedures are useful in making advances in applied research. Because some <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> may be better than others, this poster session will examine factors and issues in sample selection. The aim is initiate discussion that will result in a framework that graduate students can use to address how to generalize their results...|$|R
40|$|Disease {{surveillance}} in wildlife populations involves {{detecting the}} presence of a disease, characterizing its prevalence and spread, and subsequent monitoring. A probability sample of animals selected from the population and corresponding estimators of disease prevalence and detection provide estimates with quantifiable statistical properties, but this approach is rarely used. Although wildlife scientists often assume probability sampling and random disease distributions to calculate <b>sample</b> sizes, <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> (i. e., samples of readily available animals) are typically used, and disease distributions are rarely random. We demonstrate how landscape-based simulation can be used to explore properties of estimators from <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> in relation to probability samples. We used simulation methods to model what is known about the habitat preferences of the wildlife population, the disease distribution, and the potential biases of the convenience-sample approach. Using chronic wasting disease in free-ranging deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as a simple illustration, we show that using probability sample designs with appropriate estimators provides unbiased surveillance parameter estimates but that the selection bias and coverage errors associated with <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> can lead to biased and misleading results. We also suggest practical alternatives to <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> that mix probability and <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling.</b> For example, a sample of land areas can be selected using a probability design that oversamples areas with larger animal populations, followed by harvesting of individual animals within sampled areas using a <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> method...|$|R
50|$|The {{results of}} the <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> cannot be {{generalized}} to the target population {{because of the potential}} bias of the sampling technique due to under-representation of subgroups in the sample in compare to the population of interest.

2500|$|Jaimie Veale {{gathered}} a <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> over the Internet of trans women's impressions of and opinions on Blanchard's typology. Of the people answering the survey, 52.5% {{had a negative}} response. [...] Of the 170 respondents, 33 said the typology was too narrow and restrictive, 15 said it {{did not apply to}} their experiences, and 5 that the typology was driven by questionable motives such as [...] "to encourage 'elitist divisionism'."

2500|$|An {{estimated}} 5000 {{women are}} killed per year from domestic violence, {{with thousands of}} others maimed or disabled. [...] Lisa Hajjar, an Associate Professor at the University of California, describes abuse against women in Pakistan as [...] "endemic in all social spheres". In an observational {{study published in the}} Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences based on a <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> of 218 women in the gynecology wards of three hospitals, 97% of the interviewed women said they had been victims of some form of assault, ranging from verbal abuse or threatened, to being subjected to beatings or non-consensual sex.|$|E
50|$|<b>Convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> is {{characterized}} with insufficient power to identify differences of population subgroups.|$|R
40|$|Survey {{experiments}} {{have become a}} central methodology across the social sciences. Researchers can combine experiments’ causal power with the generalizability of population-based samples. Yet, due to the expense of population-based samples, much research relies on <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> (e. g., students, online opt-in samples). The emergence of affordable, but non-representative online samples has reinvigorated debates about the external validity of experiments. We conduct two studies of how experimental treatment effects obtained from <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> compare to effects produced by population samples. In Study 1, we compare effect estimates from four different types of <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> and a population-based sample. In Study 2, we analyze treatment effects obtained from 20 experiments implemented on a population-based sample and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. The results reveal considerable similarity between many treatment effects obtained from convenience and nationally representative population-based samples. While the results thus bolster confidence in the utility of <b>convenience</b> <b>samples,</b> we conclude with guidance {{for the use of}} a multitude of samples for advancing scientific knowledge...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{there remains}} the {{widespread}} use of <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> in both entrepreneurship and family research. For example, a meta-analysis of the family research field by Bird et al. (2004) found that 66 % of all articles used <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling.</b> Thus, it was considered appropriate to combine both Australian and US samples for the final regression analyses. In total, 430 useable responses were received, and family firms numbered 293 and non-family consisted of 137 companies.|$|R

50|$|A {{sample that}} is not random is called a non-random sample or a non-probability sampling.

25|$|Nonprobability <b>{{sampling}}</b> {{methods include}} <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling,</b> quota sampling and purposive sampling. In addition, nonresponse effects may turn any probability design into a nonprobability design if {{the characteristics of}} nonresponse are not well understood, since nonresponse effectively modifies each element's probability of being sampled.|$|R
50|$|Outliers {{are also}} more likely in the <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> than in a {{population-based}} sampling. Outliers especially in a small sample size can skew the results.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> [...] {{is a type}} of non-probability {{sampling}} method where the sample is taken from a group of people easy to contact or to reach. For example, standing at a mall or a grocery store and asking people to answer questions would be an example of a <b>convenience</b> <b>sample.</b> This type of sampling is also known as grab sampling or availability sampling. There are no other criteria to the {{sampling method}} except that people be available and willing to participate. In addition, this type of sampling method does not require that a simple random sample is generated, since the only criteria is whether the participants agree to participate ...|$|E
50|$|Most {{studies of}} rates use a <b>convenience</b> <b>sample.</b> One {{study of a}} <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> of 9,265 people found that 1% of Internet users are clearly {{addicted}} to cybersex and 17% of users meet criteria for problematic sexual compulsivity, meaning they score above one standard deviation of the mean on the Kalichman Sexual Compulsivity Scale. A survey of 84 college-age males found that 2060% of a sample of college-age males who use pornography {{found it to be}} problematic. Research on Internet addiction disorder indicates rates may range from 1.5 to 8.2% in Europeans and Americans. Internet pornography users are included in Internet users, and Internet pornography {{has been shown to be}} the Internet activity most likely to lead to compulsive disorders.|$|E

30|$|The {{samples in}} 2015 and 2016 {{were from the}} same {{sampling}} frame but were recruited independently. All subjects were aged 18  years or above and had provided oral consent. A combination of stratified sampling (by sub-village) and <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> was applied for selecting participants in the 2014 needs assessment (except for the two village leaders), and {{the subjects in the}} 2015 intervention. Study subjects were recruited by using <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> in the three sub-villages through home visits and leaflet distribution. One subject would be invited from each of the households of the community. Households with more than one family member who participated in the education activities would nominate a study qualified subject to join the study. During the 2016 visit, <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> and snowball sampling were adopted for recruiting subjects in both the intervention and follow-up surveys without stratification. Again only one representative was invited from each household.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether results from crossnational studies using <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> which are not representative of the nation can provide valid cross-national comparisons. Analysis of data from the International Dating Violence Study (IDVS) of university students in 32 nations (n = 17, 404) enabled 18 tests of concurrent validity and found an average correlation of. 51 between variables measured by the IDVS measured and by nationally representative samples. Construct validity was also supported by 41 empirical tests. The concept of national context effects explains how samples that are not nationally representative can provide valid nation-to-nation differences. It was concluded that <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> that are not representative of the nation but are comparable across nations can provide valid tests of theories about differences between nations. Consequently, if a study can only be done using <b>convenience</b> <b>samples,</b> that should not deter proceeding...|$|R

50|$|Exploratory {{research}} is conducted {{to explore a}} problem to get some basic idea about the solution at the preliminary stages of research. It may serve as the input to conclusive research. Exploratory research information is collected by focus group interviews, reviewing literature or books, discussing with experts, etc. This is unstructured and qualitative in nature. If a secondary source of data is unable to serve the purpose, a <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> of small size can be collected. Conclusive {{research is}} conducted to draw some conclusion about the problem. It is essentially, structured and quantitative research, and the output {{of this research is}} the input to management information systems (MIS).|$|E
50|$|In some cases, the {{observed}} units may not form a sample from any meaningful population, but rather constitute a <b>convenience</b> <b>sample,</b> or {{may represent the}} entire population of interest. In this situation, we may study the units descriptively, or we may study their dynamics over time. But it typically does not make sense to talk about generalizing to a larger population of such units. Studies involving countries or business firms are often of this type. Clinical trials also typically use convenience samples, however the aim is often to make inferences about the efficacy of treatments in other patients, and given the inclusion and exclusion criteria for some clinical trials, the sample may not be representative of the majority of patients with the condition or disease.|$|E
30|$|Two {{questionnaires}} were identified. (1) <b>Convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> was executed {{for the pilot}} study. Based on the results, the items were adjusted minimally and a formal questionnaire was developed. An online questionnaire was distributed for <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> so as to collect the necessary amount of samples. The formal questionnaire was designed with Google forms. The link of the questionnaire was posted in BBS and social networks {{so that it could}} be completed voluntarily. (2) Invalid {{questionnaires were}} deleted when refining the samples so as to increase {{the reliability and validity of}} the information.|$|R
30|$|The {{online and}} on-campus Educational Psychology courses were {{delivered}} in parallel {{by the same}} lecturer and teaching assistants.

Educational Psychology course was selected for our research for both purposeful and <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> reasons (Forman, Creswell, Damschroder, Kowalski, & Krein, 2008). We wanted to examine SRL and transfer components in a context that is remote from the students’ major learning subjects: science and engineering (purposeful sampling), and we received full support and cooperation from the teaching staff and the students (<b>convenience</b> <b>sampling).</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{time is of}} the essence, many {{researchers}} turn to <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> for data collection, as they can swiftly gather data and begin their calculations. It is useful in time sensitive research because very little preparation is needed to use <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> for data collection. It is also useful when researchers need to conduct pilot data collection in order to gain a quick understanding of certain trends or to develop hypotheses for future research. By rapidly gathering information, researchers and scientists can isolate growing trends, or extrapolate generalized information from local public opinion.|$|R

In addition six adults with autism and one with a non-specific communication disability were identified by a day service using TEACCH. All parents of the children and adults were interviewed, and 53 professional support staff involved with the participants were sent questionnaires; 28 of these being returned. In measuring the effectiveness of TEACCH, 79% of respondents described TEACCH as effectively reducing inappropriate behaviour. Additionally other areas of improvement were noted by 86% in self-help skills, 73% in social skills, 82% in fine motor skills, 60% in gross motor skills and 90% in communication skills.|$|E
