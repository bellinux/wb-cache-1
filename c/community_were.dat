50|$|In 1870, a Lutheran-Evangelical <b>community</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in Baku. However, in 1937, the clerics {{as well as}} the representatives of other religious <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> banished or shot. The Lutheran <b>community</b> <b>was</b> not revived until 1994, {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union.|$|R
5|$|The {{ideas of}} the <b>community</b> <b>were</b> based on the {{theories}} of various German religious mystics and its primary object was the spiritualisation of the matrimonial state. The Church of England had dismissed Prince earlier in his career for his radical teachings. The Agapemonites predicted the imminent return of Jesus Christ. According to newspaper accounts, Prince's successor, John Hugh Smyth-Pigott, declared himself Jesus Christ reincarnate.|$|E
5|$|A high flying {{flagpole}} {{was presented}} to the oval by Alcoa. The American flag was hoisted on {{it for the first time}} by Joseph Iozzi, who was a disabled veteran of World War II. Nearly all of the fraternal organizations of the New Kensington <b>community</b> <b>were</b> represented at the dedication ceremony. The Reverend Monsignor Giustino Meniconzi, who was the Vicar-General of the Diocese of Ferentino, Italy, blessed the statue of Christ and the American flag.|$|E
5|$|Although {{social order}} was {{maintained}} throughout the plague years, {{the economy of}} the region was devastated. However, the surviving merchant <b>community</b> <b>were</b> very influential in the city and, {{in the wake of the}} catastrophe, set about increasing the council's influence around the market, buying many of the surrounding shops. The council also bought a set of wharves along King Street near Dragon Hall in 1397 and decreed that all goods entering Norwich by water be unloaded there. This ensured almost complete control of Norwich trade by the merchants who now dominated the council.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 640s, the Irish monk Fursey, having {{spent a year}} as a hermit, left East Anglia for Gaul. His monastery at Cnobheresburg (identified by some with Burgh Castle) was left in the hands of his half-brother, Foillan. In 651, shortly after his departure, the heathen threat he had {{foreseen}} became a reality, when Foillan and his <b>community</b> <b>were</b> driven out by Penda's forces and Anna, who encountered Penda at Cnobheresburg, was exiled.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} and fall of 1941, in {{reprisal}} for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish <b>community</b> <b>were</b> subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz Böhme, the German Military Governor of Serbia. Böhme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major Žarko Todorović from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.|$|E
5|$|From the Székelys, {{continuing}} warfare demanded increased military service, and {{the royal}} administration imposed special taxes on them. Although {{the leaders of}} the Székely <b>community</b> <b>were</b> exempted from taxation in 1554, but all the foot soldiers continued to be taxed, resulting in a double burden of military and monetary obligations for them. In 1562 many Székelys took up arms against John II Sigismund, but they were defeated. The Saxon towns continued to develop even in the years of upheaval. Their population, however, increased slowly, mainly {{as a consequence of the}} Saxons' traditional desire for segregation: even Hungarian craftsmen and merchants were prohibited from settling in their towns.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 June, the crowd {{continued}} west along the Thames, burning the houses of officials around Westminster and opening the Westminster gaol. They then moved back into central London, setting fire to more buildings and storming Newgate Prison. The hunt for Flemings continued, and those with Flemish-sounding accents were killed, including the royal adviser, Richard Lyons. In one city ward, the bodies of 40 executed Flemings were piled up in the street, and at the Church of St Martin Vintry, popular with the Flemish, 35 of the <b>community</b> <b>were</b> killed. Historian Rodney Hilton argues that these attacks may have been coordinated by the weavers' guilds of London, who were commercial competitors of the Flemish weavers.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to create a}} breed registry in 1903 and 1904 failed. In 1912, another attempt was made, this time successful, and a stud book was created in Dijon in 1913. With {{the creation of the}} stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered. However, by 1917, the physical characteristics of the breed were still not fixed, and leaders of the equine <b>community</b> <b>were</b> critical, and doubtful of whether the Auxois was a breed in its own right or still merely a subtype of the Ardennais. They were also unsure whether {{it was a good idea}} to accept the recognition of another regional breed, of which France had many.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Mumbai {{deals with the}} growth of a {{collection}} of seven islands on the west coast of India to become the commercial capital of the nation, {{and one of the most}} populous cities in the world. Although human habitation existed since the Stone Age, the Kolis, a Marathi fishing <b>community,</b> <b>were</b> the earliest known settlers of the islands. The Maurya Empire gained control of the islands during the 3rd century BCE, and transformed it into a centre of Hindu and Buddhist culture and religion. Later, between the 2nd century BCE and 9th century CE, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, Abhiras, Vakatakas, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas, before being ruled by the Silharas from 810 to 1260.|$|E
40|$|Within China six Early Viséan rugose coral <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> recognized, {{they are}} : 1) the Siphonophyllia {{community}}, 2) the cool water Gangamophyllum community, 3) the Thysanophyllum community, 4) the Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites community, 5) the island Humboldtia community and 6) {{the cold water}} Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma community. In northwest China, the Siphonophyllia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> distributed along the northern margin of the Tarim-Qaidam Oldland. The Gangamophyllum <b>community</b> <b>was</b> widespread north of the region occupied by the Siphonophyllia community, including north Tianshan, central Tianshan and east Junggar. In South China there were three rugose coral communities. The Thysanophyllum community occurs on {{the margin of the}} Upper Yangtze Oldland. The Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites <b>community</b> <b>was</b> confined to the southern and western part of the region occupied by the Thysanophyllum community. These two communities merge into each other without a distinct boundary. The Humboldtia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> found only in the Baoshan area. The Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma <b>community</b> <b>is</b> found in Xainza and Himalaya of Tibet. The distribution of the six Early Viséan rugose coral <b>communities</b> <b>was</b> controlled by the palaeogeographical background. The Gangamophyllum community occurs along the southern margin of the Siberia Oldland, while the Siphonophyllia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> distributed along the northern margin of Tarim-Qaidam Oldland. The Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma <b>community</b> <b>is</b> confined to the northern margin of the Gondwana Oldland. In the wide southern and western margin of Yangtze Oldland the distribution of the Thysanophyllum and the Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites <b>communities</b> <b>was</b> controlled by the bathymetry. The Humboldtia community probably lived in island seas far from the Yangtze Oldland...|$|R

5|$|The story survives {{through the}} Hundred Rolls, the great {{survey of the}} English {{hundreds}} made by Edward I, in 1274-5, on returning to his new kingdom from crusade. The scheme, impractical as it might seem, was supposedly based on contemporary sagas of Viking heroes. But the complaints of the local <b>community</b> <b>were</b> {{based on the fact}} that Southchurch had taken all the supplies home to his own manor of Southchurch, received 200 marks from the exchequer, yet never paid out any of what the owners of the goods were entitled to.|$|E
5|$|Arkwright had a {{reputation}} as a paternalistic employer who was concerned for the well-being of his employees and their families. A Sunday School was built at Cromford in 1785 and provided education to 200children. By 1789, the Cromford Estate was back in the ownership of the Arkwrights, who actively influenced its structure and construction. Cromford was given a market place to act as a new focus for the village. Arkwright organised a market every Sunday and as incentive to attend, gave annual prizes to those who attended most often. After Arkwright died in 1792 his son, Richard Arkwright junior, took over and sold most of his cotton mills outside Cromford and Matlock Bath. The mills in Cromford and Matlock Bath were probably retained to support the Willersley Estate. Societies and clubs were created in Cromford. The religious affairs of the <b>community</b> <b>were</b> of less interest to Arkwright, and it was not until 1797 that Arkwright junior established Cromford Church; his father had envisaged it as a private chapel for the Arkwright family at Willersley Castle. The family's attempts to make Cromford self-sustaining through establishing a market was successful, and the village expanded until about 1840. This was even though the mills had passed their zenith and begun to enter decline in this period.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Young Turk Revolution deposed Sultan Abdul Hamid II {{and a series}} of wars plagued the ailing empire's capital. The last of these, World War I, {{resulted}} in the British, French, and Italian occupation of Constantinople. The Armenian population of the city was also affected by the deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915, in which leaders of the Armenian <b>community</b> <b>were</b> arrested and mostly killed as part of the Armenian Genocide. To commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide, 24 April has now become the day of remembrance. The final Ottoman sultan, Mehmed VI, was exiled in November 1922 by Atatürk; the following year, the occupation of Constantinople ended with the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne and the recognition of the Republic of Turkey, declared by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, the Blue Cross Foundation {{found that}} there are four types of <b>communities</b> that can <b>be</b> {{identified}} based on their risk of uninsurance: entrenched-risk, unexpected-risk, resilient, and low-risk. Entrenched-risk <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that have {{a high concentration of}} foreign-born denizens, and therefore {{are less likely to be}} eligible for Medicare. Unexpected-risk communities have high uninsurance but were not expected to based on their geographical locations, like Cape Cod or Boston. Resilient <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that <b>were</b> expected to have high uninsurance but did not, like Worcester and north and south of Boston. Finally, low-risk <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that have high rate of insurance and were expected to have high rates of insurance based on their characteristics.|$|R

5|$|In the {{following}} years, companies applied {{the principles of}} corporate identity and corporate design to increase awareness and recognition by consumers and differentiation from competitors. Olivetti became famous for its attention to design through their corporate design activities. In 1936 Olivetti hired Giovanni Pintori in their publicity department and promoted Marcello Nizzoli from the product design department to develop design in a comprehensive corporate philosophy. In 1956, inspired by the compelling brand character of Olivetti, Thomas Watson, Jr., CEO of IBM, retained American architect and industrial designer Eliot Noyes to develop a corporate-wide IBM Design Program consisting of coherent brand-design strategy together with a design management system to guide and oversee the comprehensive brand identity elements of: products, graphics, exhibits, architecture, interiors and fine art. This seminal effort by Noyes, with his inclusion of Paul Rand and Charles Eames as consultants, {{is considered to be}} the first comprehensive corporate design program in America. Up to and during the 1960s, debates in the design <b>community</b> <b>were</b> focused on ergonomics, functionalism, and corporate design, while debates in management addressed Just in time, Total quality management, and product specification. The main proponents of design management at that time were AEG, Bauhaus, HfG Ulm, the British Design Council, Deutscher Werkbund, Olivetti, IBM, Peter Behrens, and Walter Paepcke.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{crossed the}} Ohio River {{a third time}} back into Indiana and across the {{southern}} fringes of Evansville. Here, the tornado ripped directly through the Eastbrook Mobile Home Park, obliterating numerous mobile homes and killing 20 people. Of about 350 mobile homes in the park, 100 were destroyed and another 125 were damaged. The coroner reported {{that most of the}} victims were probably killed instantly, many by spine and skull fractures. Several bodies were carried almost two hundred yards. The tornado then crossed into Warrick County, Indiana at the Angel Mounds State Historic Site. Several permanent homes were destroyed in this area, along with many others {{on the north side of}} Newburgh. Past Newburgh, the tornado reached its peak intensity (high-end F3) as it tore through an industrial park near Paradise. Further northeast, the tornado passed just south of Boonville and caused a fatality in a mobile home. The tornado then tore directly through the small community of DeGonia Springs, tossing vehicles and destroying homes. Some of the homes in the <b>community</b> <b>were</b> leveled, and three people were killed in a mobile home in this area. The tornado began to rapidly weaken as it passed just south of Tennyson, and then dissipated as it crossed into Spencer County, Indiana. Overall, the tornado damaged or destroyed 500 buildings, killed 25 people, and injured 230 others.|$|E
5|$|The usual form of burial {{during this}} period was inhumation. The {{earliest}} Mycenaean burials were mostly in individual graves {{in the form of}} a pit or a stone-lined cist and offerings were limited to pottery and occasional items of jewellery. Groups of pit or cist graves containing elite members of the <b>community</b> <b>were</b> sometimes covered by a tumulus (mound) in the manner established since the Middle Helladic. It has been argued that this form dates back to the Kurgan culture; however, Mycenaean burials are in actuality an indigenous development of mainland Greece with the Shaft Graves housing native rulers. Pit and cist graves remained in use for single burials throughout the Mycenaean period alongside more elaborate family graves. The shaft graves at Mycenae within Grave Circles A and B belonging to the same period represent an alternative manner of grouping elite burials. Next to the deceased were found full sets of weapons, ornate staffs as well as gold and silver cups and other valuable objects which point to their social rank.|$|E
