50|$|Pune has {{witnessed}} enormous industrial growth since 2000. Rapid urbanization {{in the recent}} past has put the city’s travel infrastructure to stress. With a large number of units have come up both in small scale as well as in heavy & medium scale industry etc., traffic in the city is rising at alarming rates. As the population of a city grows, share of public transport, whether road or rail-based, should increase. Experience has shown that, in cities like Pune where roads do not have adequate width and which cater to mixed traffic conditions comprising slow and fast moving vehicles, road transport can optimally carry 8,000 persons per hour per direction (phpdt). Being a thickly populated area, Pune’s traffic needs cannot be met by road-based system and additional flyovers. When traffic density increases beyond this level, average speed of vehicles comes down, journey time increases, air pollution goes up and commuters are put to increased level of inconvenience. The existing urban transport system of Pune City which is road-based has already come under stress leading to longer travel time, increased air pollution and rise in number of road accidents. Public Transport System is an efficient user of space and with reduced level of air and noise pollution. Thus when on a <b>corridor,</b> <b>traffic</b> density during peak hours crosses this figure, provision of rail-based mass transport should be considered. The preparation of detailed project report (DPR) work was undertaken by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and submitted their report on 15 August 2008. In 2010, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) delayed submitting the proposal to the Union government to make provisions in the annual budget for the project.|$|E
40|$|The corridors-in-the-sky concept imitates {{the highway}} system in ground transportation. The benefit {{expected}} from a corridor relies on its capability of handling {{high density traffic}} with negligible controller workload, the acceptance of extra fuel or distance, and the com-plexity reduction in underlying sectors. This work evaluates a selected corridor from these perspectives through simulations. To examine traffic inside the corridor, a <b>corridor</b> <b>traffic</b> simulation tool that can resolve conflicts is developed using C language. Prescribed conflict resolution maneuvers mimic corridor users ’ behaviors and conflict resolution counts mea-sure complexity. Different lane options and operational policies are proposed to examine their impacts on complexity. Fuel consumption is calculated and compared for <b>corridor</b> <b>traffic.</b> On the other hand, to investigate the complexity of non-corridor traffic in un-derlying sectors, the existing Airspace Concept Evaluation System tool is utilized along with the Automated Airspace Concept tool. The number of conflict resolutions is exam-ined and treated as the complexity measurement. The results show heavy traffic can be managed with low complexity for a historical traffic schedule simulated with appropriate operational policies and lane options. For instance, with 608 flights and peak aircraft count of 100, only 84 actions {{need to be taken}} in a 24 -hour period to resolve the conflicts for an 8 -lane corridor. Compared with the fuel consumptions with great circle trajectories, the simulation of <b>corridor</b> <b>traffic</b> shows that the total extra fuel for corridor flights is 26, 373 gallons, or 2. 76 %, which is 0. 38 % less than flying filed flight plans. Without taking climb and descent portions of <b>corridor</b> <b>traffic,</b> the complexity of underlying sectors is reduced by 17. 71 %. However the climb and descent portions will eliminate the reduction and the overall complexity of sectors is actually increased by 9. 14 %. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{key element}} in {{improving}} traffic operations and performing effective real time management {{is the ability to}} assess the effectiveness of the various alternatives prior to implementation. Simulation methods have long been recognized as the most effective tool for such an analysis, and various simulators have been developed by different agencies for freeway and arterial networks. While there have been individual tests of each software by various agencies, no comprehensive effort has been made to quantify and evaluate the performance of each model. The major difficulty includes the lack of detailed real data and the time-consuming manual effort to prepare input information for each software. To be sure there is no user-interface developed to data that can generate input files for different simulators with a common set of data. Recent installation of the state-of-the art video detection systems in the 1 - 394 freeway provides a unique opportunity to develop a comprehensive freeway database {{that can be used to}} create various test cases with detailed traffic database that can be used to create various test cases with detailed traffic information. Further, the 1 - 494 Integrated <b>Corridor</b> <b>Traffic</b> Management project being conducted by MN/DOT will be able to provide valuable <b>corridor</b> <b>traffic</b> data which can be used for evaluating freeway/arterial network models. By evaluating existing traffic simulation models the advantages/disadvantages of each model can be identified. Based on the evaluation results a comprehensive modeling approach for freeway/arterial networks can be developed. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a traffic simulation laboratory where various roadway design/operational alternatives can be evaluated with traffic simulators under an integrated database-simulation environment. The proposed research, Phase I, will evaluate existing freeway simulation models with detailed traffic data to be collected using machine-vision an loop detection systems.

40|$|This {{research}} has focused on developing an advanced dynamic <b>corridor</b> <b>traffic</b> control system that can assist responsible traffic professionals in generating effective control strategies for contending with non-recurrent congestion that often concurrently plagues both the freeway and arterial systems. The developed system features its hierarchical operating structure that consists of an integrated-level control and a local-level module for bottleneck management. The primary function of the integrated-level control is to maximize the capacity utilization of the entire corridor under incident conditions with concurrently implemented strategies over dynamically computed windows, including diversion control at critical off-ramps, on-ramp metering, and optimal arterial signal timings. The system development process starts with design of a set of innovative network formulations that can accurately and efficiently capture the operational characteristics of traffic flows in the entire corridor optimization process.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this report is to provide an {{efficient}} solution for the current transportation problem {{that exists in the}} north east <b>corridor.</b> <b>Traffic</b> between New York and Washington D.

30|$|The {{complexity}} of the IH- 635 Managed Lanes Project, located in Dallas County, Texas, posed several technical and constructive challenges, leading {{to the adoption of}} solutions different from the traditional. Two alternative solutions for the pier cap on one of the bridge crossings over IH- 35 E in the IH- 635 project were analyzed in this case study, a cast-in-place post-tensioned concrete cap and an innovative prefabricated steel–concrete composite cap. The approach was to use an estimation of direct costs for material and labor and consideration of construction time schedules. A supplementary numerical modeling confirmed that both alternatives behave elastically under imposed loads. The direct cost of material and labor for the two alternatives were close. However, the composite alternative required 13  days less construction time, resulting in substantial cost savings from traffic closing in the very busy traffic <b>corridor.</b> <b>Traffic</b> closing costs were substantially higher than the direct costs, especially for the post-tensioned cap. The quantification of the benefits allows more confidence in the utilization of the composites caps, leading to faster completion of bridge projects and substantial economic savings.|$|E
40|$|<b>Corridor</b> <b>traffic</b> {{control in}} the form of ramp {{metering}} is an effective strategy for alleviating the congestion on freeways. Due to capacity drop arising from the weaving effects, a weaving section often constitutes a typical bottleneck of heavy congestion on urban freeways during peak hours. This paper investigates the corridor control problem considering the weaving effects with fixed demand. The operational capacity of a weaving section link is introduced and assumed to decrease linearly with volume ratio, which is related to the adjacent on-ramp and off-ramp flows. Asymmetric flow interactions emerge among links {{as a result of the}} operational capacity for calculation of link travel times. A mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) is used to represent the corridor control problem. The objective is to minimize the total travel cost subject to the traffic equilibrium with queuing as well as the queue length constraints at on-ramps and flow capacity constraints on freeway main sections. A sensitivity analysis based algorithm is adopted to solve the corridor control model and its convergence is demonstrated with numerical examples. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|While {{transportation}} impacts {{are often}} masked by heavy growth in <b>corridor</b> <b>traffic</b> and latent travel demand, modeling enables measuring the real transportation impacts of rail projects.
