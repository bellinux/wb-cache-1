5|$|Also in the off-season, Luongo {{resigned}} {{his team}} <b>captaincy.</b> As Canucks management {{waited until the}} beginning of the 2010–11 season to announce his replacement, Kesler was seen by media and fans as a strong candidate, alongside Henrik Sedin. Henrik was eventually named captain prior to the season-opener and Kesler retained his alternate <b>captaincy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 1965, Leeds skipper Collins {{was injured}} in an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup game against Torino and Revie gave the <b>captaincy</b> to Bremner after {{initially}} handing the armband to Charlton {{for the remainder of}} the season; Charlton was keen to give up the <b>captaincy</b> as it prevented his superstitious ritual of coming out of the tunnel last on match days. Revie and Bremner had a strong bond of trust, which was why the manager gave him the <b>captaincy</b> at such a young age. Leeds finished second in the league in the 1965–66 campaign to Liverpool, who had finished six points clear at the top.|$|E
5|$|Conroy and Boughner were co-captains for {{the latter}} half of 2001–2002 after Dave Lowry was {{stripped}} of the <b>captaincy.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the <b>captaincies</b> is one of {{constant}} subordination, annexation and division. New donatary <b>captaincies</b> were carved out of territories which were too vast and difficult to administer directly and small <b>captaincies,</b> nominally in private hands but often abandoned by their donataries, were annexed by larger or more successful Crown <b>captaincies.</b> At least fifteen donatary <b>captaincies</b> were granted {{through the middle of}} the 18th century, carved out of royal <b>captaincies.</b> New royal <b>captaincies</b> were also carved out of existing ones.|$|R

5|$|Fourteen {{players have}} captained the team, {{beginning}} with Ed Westfall. Denis Potvin holds {{the record for}} the longest <b>captaincy</b> period, as he led the team from 1979 to 1987. The shortest <b>captaincy</b> period was held by Bryan McCabe, who only served for 56 regular season games. There have been two seasons where the Islanders did not have a captain: 1996–97 and 2000–01. The team's current captain is John Tavares, who was appointed on September 9, 2013, succeeding Mark Streit, who was traded during the previous off-season. Streit was the NHL's first team captain from Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Note: Conroy and Boughner {{shared the}} <b>captaincy,</b> {{in the later}} half of the 2001–02 NHL season, after Lowry was {{stripped}} of the role.Conroy was then named sole captain for the 2002–03 NHL season.|$|E
5000|$|During the Philippine Dynasty, {{some of the}} <b>captaincies</b> {{attained}} {{the status}} of provinces with royal governors (i.e. [...] "states"), and Portuguese Brazil thereafter {{was a mixture of}} donatary <b>captaincies,</b> royal <b>captaincies</b> and states.|$|R
25|$|The {{individual}} <b>captaincies,</b> {{now under}} {{the administration of the}} Portuguese Crown (and no longer called colonies or hereditary <b>captaincies,</b> but simply <b>captaincies</b> of Brazil), continued to exist as provinces or districts within the colony {{until the end of the}} colonial era in 1815.|$|R
50|$|Thirteen modern {{states have}} {{names of their}} {{predecessor}} <b>captaincies,</b> and several cities. The <b>captaincies</b> immortalized a set of Tupi-guarani place names, chiefly those of rivers and mountains.|$|R
5|$|Stovin {{joined the}} army {{at the age of}} seventeen, when he was {{commissioned}} as an ensign in the 52nd Foot on 22 March 1800. He served with the regiment in the expedition to Ferrol, and purchased promotion to lieutenant on 10 January 1801, he purchased a <b>captaincy</b> in the 62nd Foot on 20 November 1802, giving him command of a company. He was put on half-pay after the Peace of Amiens, but on 19 July 1803 took a <b>captaincy</b> in the 28th Foot.|$|E
5|$|Such was the {{disappointment}} at losing the Ashes, Collins was stripped {{not only of}} the New South Wales <b>captaincy</b> but also that of his local club, Waverley. Former players, including his former Waverley captain, the influential Monty Noble, publicly criticised Collins' <b>captaincy.</b> Hunter Hendry, viewing the match from the stands, suspected Collins threw the match. Despite his reputation as a gambler, there is no material evidence that Collins ever fixed the result of any cricket match.|$|E
5|$|The squad for {{the season}} {{consisted}} of the players listed in the tables below, as well as managers Jesualdo Ferreira and José António Camacho. Ljubinko Drulović took over the <b>captaincy</b> from Robert Enke.|$|E
50|$|Some {{complications}} {{result from}} <b>captaincies</b> being merged and recreated {{with the same}} name, but representing altered regions. At least {{a few of the}} later <b>captaincies</b> were islands or capes of negligible size. Dates are of independent captaincies; in some cases, new <b>captaincies</b> were created as administrative divisions or subcaptaincies of existing ones before becoming fully independent (i.e. Para was established as early as 1616 as a north and westward annex of Maranhão).|$|R
5000|$|In 1759, the {{heritability}} of the <b>captaincies</b> {{was totally}} abolished {{by the government}} of the Marquis of Pombal, with all captains becoming appointed by the Crown. The <b>captaincies</b> were officially renamed [...] "provinces" [...] on 28 February 1821.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the classic}} map of hereditary <b>captaincies</b> of Portuguese America {{when it was}} created, {{in the first half}} of the sixteenth century. We point out some of its shortcom - ings, and propose a new design on primary sources, namely: charts of donation and forais, as well as the cartography of the time, particularly the map of Bartolomeu Velho. The main changes proposed refer to: boundary lines of the northern <b>captaincies,</b> which should follow the meridians and not the parallels; the particular configuration of the southern <b>captaincies,</b> with lines following northwest direction; the division into portions, named quinhões, of the <b>captaincies</b> of Aires da Cunha and Joao de Barros and finally the existence of undistributed lands...|$|R
5|$|Two {{years after}} the Arnou-le-Faucon lawsuit, Carrouges was once again in court facing Count Pierre, this time in dispute over the lands {{administered}} by his recently deceased father. Carrouges III's death early in 1382 vacated the <b>captaincy</b> of the castle of Bellême, a post Carrouges IV believed would be his by right. However, due to the failed lawsuit two years earlier, Count Pierre passed Carrouges over for the <b>captaincy</b> {{and gave it to}} another of his followers. The infuriated Carrouges again brought legal action against his overlord and again he was defeated in court. The only lasting result of the action was the further separation of Carrouges and Count Pierre's court.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, and {{particularly}} after the fourth Test defeat, critics suggested that Walter Robins, {{one of the}} selectors, should captain England to bring a more attacking approach to the job. However, Robins' age counted against him; the selectors were satisfied with Yardley's <b>captaincy</b> in what were difficult circumstances, and retained him for the final Test. In that match, he failed twice with the bat, scoring 7 and 9 as England were humiliated, bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings. England lost the series 4–0. Yardley managed 150 runs {{at an average of}} 16.66, not passing fifty in a single innings. However, he once again topped the England bowling averages, taking nine wickets at an average of 22.66. Bowes believed that the pressure of <b>captaincy</b> had affected Yardley's batting. Bowes also cast doubt on Yardley's future, stating that other commitments may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer.|$|E
5|$|As {{a proven}} Test player {{and the senior}} spin bowler, Ring was chosen for his second tour of England in 1953, this time under the <b>captaincy</b> of Hassett. It proved not much happier than his 1948 experience, though in a less strong side his {{eventual}} wicket tally, 68 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 19.89, placed him third among the regular bowlers.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{administrative}} {{divisions of}} Brazil were the hereditary <b>captaincies</b> (capitanias hereditárias), stretches of land {{granted by the}} Portuguese Crown to noblemen or merchants with a charter to colonize the land. As the map shows, these divisions generally followed lines of latitude. Each of the holders of these <b>captaincies</b> {{was referred to as}} a captain donatary (capitão donatário). These <b>captaincies</b> were to be passed from father to son, but the Crown retained the power to revoke them, which the King indeed did in the 16th century.|$|R

5|$|As expected, the Australian team's leaders Ian Johnson and Keith Miller, {{retired from}} cricket after the tour. Harvey {{replaced}} Johnson as Victorian captain {{and was the}} logical choice as successor to the Test <b>captaincy,</b> as the most experienced {{member of the team}} (48 Tests). Queensland's captain, the veteran paceman Ray Lindwall, was no longer an automatic Test selection. However, both Harvey and Benaud had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. Harvey was surprisingly overlooked for the <b>captaincy,</b> which went to Ian Craig, who had replaced Miller as New South Wales skipper. Craig was only 22 and had played six Tests; he had yet to establish himself in the team. After several disappointing results against England, the selectors chose a youthful team. Harvey was named vice-captain to Craig for both the 1956–57 non-Test tour of New Zealand and the 1957–58 Test tour to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|At an {{emergency}} meeting held in Taunton a new club secretary was appointed and wealthy benefactors were sought, but Sainsbury retained the club <b>captaincy.</b> Somerset played second-class cricket for five seasons, until their readmission to the first-class {{game for the}} 1891 season.|$|E
5|$|Australia fell to {{successive}} defeats in {{the opening}} two Tests, Bradman making two ducks in his four innings, {{and it seemed that}} the <b>captaincy</b> was affecting his form. The selectors made another four changes to the team for the Third Test at Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|Between 1974 and 1977, Boycott {{elected to}} make himself {{unavailable}} for England. He claimed in 2006 that he had simply lost his appetite for Test cricket and the stress became too much for him. Boycott's biographer, McKinstry, speculates that the self-imposed exile {{may also have been}} linked to the appointments of Mike Denness and then Tony Greig to the England <b>captaincy,</b> in preference to Boycott. Boycott was very critical of Denness's <b>captaincy</b> and his standard of batting in his autobiography in 1987, citing it as a factor in his decision, along with the pressures at Yorkshire. His weak immune system was a recurring motivation for not touring the Indian subcontinent. This period of exile coincided with the peaks of several fast bowlers' careers, including Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Andy Roberts, and Michael Holding. However, he later came back to face the West Indies pace battery at its most fearsome in the late 70s and early 80s.|$|E
