40|$|<b>Claw</b> {{disorders}} {{cause problems}} in dairy cattle {{all over the}} world. Nutrition, feeding, environment, <b>claw</b> trimming routines, hormonal changes related to calving and genetics are among the factors which influence the pathogenesis. The colour of the <b>claw</b> horn (pigmentation) has been suggested to play a role. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if there were any associations between the colour of the sole horn and <b>claw</b> disorders detected at <b>claw</b> trimming. Altogether, 2607 cows on 112 farms were <b>claw</b> trimmed once and the colour (dark, mixed or light) of the right lateral hind <b>claw</b> and hind <b>claw</b> disorders were recorded by 13 trained <b>claw</b> trimmers.

25|$|Results {{have been}} mixed as the lack of {{mechanical}} grip {{has resulted in the}} more ingenious designers <b>clawing</b> back the deficit with aerodynamic grip– pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn has resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car 'dirty' (turbulent), preventing other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.|$|E
25|$|It was the Spaniards {{who gave}} the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic {{military}} fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback.

Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus a euphemism for being a white man—Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.|$|E

40|$|Crab chelae are a {{model system}} for {{studying}} {{the relationship between the}} biomechanics of an organism’s structure and its ecolgical role. This study investigated how chelae dimorphism may correlate with specialization in function in the land crab Cardisoma carnifx (Herbst 1791). This was achieved by comparing field observations of preferential <b>claw</b> usage during diurnal activities to a mechanical model drived from anatomical <b>claw</b> measurements, <b>claw</b> closing effort of captured specimens, and calculations of expected closing force. Behavior, mechanical scaling, and effort were also compared between males and females. Foraging, eating, and lead <b>claw</b> entering burrow showed significant differences in <b>claw</b> use frequency. It was also found that the major and minor <b>claws</b> scaled differently with respect to carapace length, with the major <b>claw</b> displaying positively allometric scaling and the minor <b>claw</b> displaying near-isometric scaling. Measurement of <b>claw</b> closing effort with respect to <b>claw</b> length showed high correlation in male minor and female major <b>claws.</b> In males, expected force measurements showed a greater rate of growth in the minor <b>claw</b> than in the major <b>claw</b> with respect to <b>claw</b> lengh, but in females, expected force in the major <b>claw</b> exhibited a greater rate of growth. A possible explanation for the differences in design between sexes may be that there are functional differences between male nd female chelae, such as the primary use of male minor <b>claw</b> and female major <b>claw</b> in gripping objects when stressed...|$|R

In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and <b>clawing</b> at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred.
