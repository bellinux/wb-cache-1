40|$|The first {{association}} {{one gets}} when thinking about independence in is that independence is good. We {{all want to}} be independent and free. For me, coming form Slovenia, this feeling is perhaps even deeper. Slovenia regained its independence after a thousand years of being ruled by Germans, Austrians, Italians, Hungarians and Serbs. Nevertheless, we have always cherished {{the fact that we are}} different and have tried hard to maintain our independence as much as possible. What is interesting is that even though it took us a thousand years to reach independence, we are now trying very hard to join the European union. We are trading our independence for a value of belonging to EU. And the feelings of pride that we are achieving its standards are comparable to the feelings of pride when we became independent from Yugoslavia. This is a strange contradiction. When I lecture about independence to medical students, I do that in a context of family as a unit of care. I try to describe family as a system and how it develops over time and the problems it faces during various stages.

40|$|Abstract. A {{fundamental}} goal of computational complexity (and {{foundations of}} cryptography) {{is to find}} a polynomial-time samplable distribution (e. g., the uniform distribution) and a language in NTIME(f(n)) for some polynomial function f, such that the language is hard on the average with respect to this distribution, given that NP is worst-case hard (i. e. NP � = P, or NP � ⊆ BPP). Currently, no such result is known even if we relax the language to be in nondeterministic sub-exponential time. There has been a long line of research trying to explain our failure in proving such worst-case/average-case connections [FF 93,Vio 03,BT 03,AGGM 06]. The bottom line of this research is essentially that (under plausible assumptions) non-adaptive Turing reductions cannot prove such results. In this paper we revisit the problem. Our first observation is that the above mentioned negative arguments extend to a non-standard notion of average-case complexity, in which the distribution on the inputs with respect to which we measure the average-case complexity of the language, is only samplable in super-polynomial time. The significance of this result {{stems from the fact that}} in this non-standard setting, [GSTS 05] did show a worst-case/average-case connection. In other words, their techniques give a way to bypass the impossibility arguments. By taking a closer look at the proof of [GSTS 05], we discover that the worst-case/averagecase connection is proven by a reduction that ”almost ” falls under the category ruled out by the negative result. This gives rise to an intriguing new notion of (almost black-box) reductions. After extending the negative results to the non-standard average-case setting of [GSTS 05], we ask whether their positive result can be extended to the standard setting, to prove some new worst-case/average-case connections. While we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> unconditionally, we are able to show that under a mild derandomization assumption, the worst-case hardness of NP implies the average-case hardness of NTIME(f(n)) (under the uniform distribution) where f is computable in quasi-polynomial time. ...|$|E

40|$|By {{examining}} how care is {{practiced in the}} community in Thailand {{from the perspective of}} people with disabilities (PWDs), this paper attempts to trace how “disability” enhances communication between PWDs and people in the community, and how it organizes the human network towards formation of a new community that shares commonality and sociality. PWDs have needs for care which the public care system <b>does</b> <b>not</b> suffi ciently support. The more severe their disability, the greater will be demand for care to meet their basic daily care needs. Therefore, most Thais with disabilities who live in a community depend on care given by family or neighbors. It is not uncommon in Thai society for family take care of a disabled member with the cooperation of a wider network of kin. In addition to family support, most PWDs can utilize inexpensive community services. Thus, PWDs live closely with people in the community. In my investigation in Thailand, however, the role of “care” is not only in providing services for PWDs. It also functions as a tool for building relationships between PWDs and people in the community, as well as among PWDs. Through the practice of care, PWDs construct new relationships and re-defi ne what they <b>can</b> and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do.</b> This means <b>that</b> disability no longer depends solely on the physical condition of PWDs, but rather that it must be defi ned as being created in the social processes involving both the PWDs and the surrounding environment. Relationships among PWDs as well as between PWDs and non-PWDs are based on the fact of “disability. ” Due to this common premise, PWDs and community members can have basic communication, and PWDs can gain care from them smoothly. In their community, PWDs manage their life and getting care by using disability as a skill of communication. Through cooperative activities of care, PWDs are creating a new community by sharing the common experience of disability and care, extending the practice of care into the public sphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{dedication}} of oncologists to their patients is undeniable. Patients given {{what can be}} a devastating diagnosis look to their physician for hope, guidance, and answers. The physician, in turn, must assimilate information from a staggering amount of resources and outlets and then form a plan that satisfies current practices and guidelines while still being consistent with the most current regulations set by a multitude of sources for oversight. Do all this for every patient in {{a time in which}} the number of new and continuing patients is ever increasing, and {{it is hardly surprising that}} the shocking overload can lead to physician burnout and, quite possibly, poorer patient care. Overload, be it information, task, knowledge, or expectation, is real, and to avoid succumbing, cancer care providers need to acknowledge that the problem exists by identifying the sources and admit that the problem of overload is out of control. Only then can providers begin to realize what <b>can</b> and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>done,</b> so <b>that</b> they can focus attention on what they are doing when they are doing it—an application of mindfulness. To take control of the avalanche of incoming information, providers need to make good use of filters, set time aside to evaluate inbound intelligence, and identify and (importantly) rely on a narrow set of trusted resources. Although strategies on coping with overloads abound, the physician needs to be diligent in applying the available options to keep burnout at bay. Back when information came in the form of the newspa-per, a weekly news magazine (e. g., Time, Newsweek), or the evening news, it was much easier to feel well informed.

It is similar with Computer System major that has taken advantage of the Internet to provide a variety of information to both academic and community service in the field of information technology. But it is still using manual method to organize and inventory data associated with inventory and borrowing system of lab in a site. One way to ease the data organization is to design an information system that can record and organize all the data held by the Computer System. Design and Implementation phase begins with system requirement analysis. Its objection is to get a proper system specification. In design phase, Data Flow Diagram is used to represent data in a logic way. The result from design phase then implements with PHP programming language, associated with Database Management System MySQL, and Javascript to generate a dynamic web-based information system. System Information inventory and Loan goods on the laboratory computer system, has two categories of access rights, there are super admin and admin (operator), where the super admin have all permissions and the lending system inventory information communications system laboratory, while the operator is further divided into three parts ie (embedded, networking, and software engineer) where each lab has one operator and one other <b>can</b> <b>not</b> access <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> belong to its access.
