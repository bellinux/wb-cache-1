In cells, the isolated <b>C</b> 1 <b>domains</b> of RasGRP 1, RasGRP 3 and RasGRP 4 α co-localize with membranes and relocalize in response to DAG, whereas the <b>C</b> 1 <b>domains</b> of RasGRP 2 and RasGRP 4 β do not. Only the <b>C</b> 1 <b>domains</b> of RasGRP 1, RasGRP 3 and RasGRP 4 α recognize DAG as a ligand within phospholipid vesicles and do so with differential affinities.

We now report the primary structures and biochemical properties {{of a family}} of evolutionarily conserved mammalian proteins, referred to as E-Syts, for extended synaptotagmin-like proteins. E-Syts contain an N-terminal transmembrane region, a central juxtamembranous domain that is conserved from yeast to human, and five (E-Syt 1) or three (E-Syt 2 and E-Syt 3) C-terminal <b>C</b> 2 <b>domains.</b> Only the first E-Syt <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain,</b> the <b>C</b> 2 A <b>domain,</b> includes the complete sequence motif that is required for Ca 2 + binding in <b>C</b> 2 <b>domains.</b> Recombinant protein fragments of E-Syt 2 that include the first <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> are capable of Ca 2 +-dependent phospholipid binding at micromolar concentrations of free Ca 2 +, suggesting that E-Syts bind Ca 2 + through their first <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> in a phospholipid complex. E-Syts are ubiquitously expressed, but enriched in brain. Expression of myc-tagged E-Syt proteins in transfected cells demonstrated localization to intracellular membranes for E-Syt 1 and to plasma membranes for E-Syt 2 and E-Syt 3. Structure/function studies showed that the plasma-membrane localization of E-Syt 2 and E-Syt 3 was directed by their C-terminal <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> <b>domains.</b> This result reveals an unexpected mechanism by which the <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> <b>domains</b> of E-Syt 2 and E-Syt 3 functions as a targeting motif that localizes these proteins into the plasma membrane independent of their transmembrane region. Viewed together, our findings suggest that E-Syts function as Ca 2 +-regulated intrinsic membrane proteins with multiple <b>C</b> 2 <b>domains,</b> expanding the repertoire of such proteins to a fourth class beyond synaptotagmins, ferlins, and MCTPs (multiple <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> and transmembrane region proteins) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the nervous}} system of the marine mollusk Aplysia, protein kinase C plays {{important}} roles in plasticity and learning. Aplysia PKCs are differentially regulated in sensory neurons of {{the nervous system}}. The facilitating neurotransmitter serotonin activates the Ca 2 +-dependent PKC Apl I but not the Ca 2 +-independent PKC Apl II. The mechanisms underlying this differential PKC activation still remain unclear. To better understand putative mechanisms regulating PKC activity we sought to characterize Aplysia PKC structural domains. This thesis has explored the characteristics of C 1 and <b>C</b> 2 <b>domains</b> from Aplysia PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II and whether differences in PKC activation {{can be attributed to}} differences in these domains. First, we demonstrate that the presence of the <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> of PKC Apl II lowers the affinity of the <b>C</b> 1 <b>domain</b> for the protein kinase C activator, phorbol ester. This <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> mediated inhibition of activator binding can be overcome by elevating phosphatidylserine concentrations. Further, phosphatidic acid is much more potent than phosphatidylserine in reducing <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> mediated inhibition. Second, we present a comparison of the C 1 and <b>C</b> 2 <b>domains</b> of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II. The <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> of PKC Apl I binds to lipids constitutively, while the <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> of PKC Apl II does not. In contrast, the <b>C</b> 1 <b>domains</b> of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II exhibit only small differences in lipid interactions. This suggests that while the <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> of PKC Apl I assists lipid mediated activation that of PKC Apl II hinders activation. Finally, we show that there are two primary autophosphorylation sites in the <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> of PKC Apl II. These sites map to residues serine 2 and serine 36 located in loop 1 of the <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain.</b> In vitro, phosphorylation of serine 36 increased binding of the <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> to phosphatidylserine membranes. In vivo, the PKC activator phorbol ester stimulated PKC Apl II phosphorylation at serine 36 and PKC phosphorylated at this residue translocated more efficiently to membranes. Moreover, mutation of serine 36 to alanine significantly reduced membrane translocation of PKC Apl II. As a whole, these data suggest a phosphorylation dependent mechanism regulating <b>C</b> 2 <b>domain</b> membrane binding of Ca 2 +-independent PKCs. This mechanism of Ca 2 +-independent PKC plasma membrane localization {{may play a role in}} generating persistent PKC activity and the eventual modulation of synaptic plasticity in the nervous system of Aplysia...|$|R
