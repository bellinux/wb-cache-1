2500|$|The term [...] "green coffee bean" [...] {{refers to}} unroasted mature or {{immature}} coffee beans. These have been processed by wet or dry methods for removing the outer pulp and mucilage {{and have an}} intact wax layer on the outer surface. When immature, they are green. When mature, they have a brown to yellow or reddish color and typically weigh 300 to 330mg per dried coffee bean. Nonvolatile and volatile compounds in green coffee beans, such as caffeine, deter many insects and animals from eating them. Further, both nonvolatile and volatile compounds contribute to {{the flavor of the}} coffee bean when it is roasted. Nonvolatile nitrogenous compounds (including alkaloids, trigonelline, proteins, and free amino acids) and carbohydrates are of major importance in producing the full aroma of roasted coffee and for its biological action. Since the mid 2000s, green <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> has been sold as a nutritional supplement and has been clinically studied for its chlorogenic acid content and for its lipolytic and weight-loss properties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{physicochemical}} characteristics of <b>coffees</b> <b>extracted</b> using 7 different extraction methods were investigated. The pH values of <b>coffees</b> <b>extracted</b> via different extraction methods ranged from 5. 26 to 5. 54, and <b>coffee</b> <b>extracted</b> by Ibrik {{had the highest}} pH among all samples. The soluble solid content and titratable acidity of <b>coffee</b> <b>extracted</b> using an Espresso machine {{were significantly higher than}} those obtained using other extraction methods. Furthermore, the total phenol and caffeine contents of <b>coffee</b> <b>extracted</b> using an Espresso machine were 6. 46 and 2. 65 mg/mL, respectively.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antioxidant}} {{activity and the}} protective effect against human low density lipoprotein oxidation of coffees prepared using different degrees of roasting was evaluated. Coffees with the highest amount of brown pigments (dark coffee) showed the highest peroxyl radical scavenging activity. These coffees also protected human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against oxidation, although green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> showed more protection. In a different experiment, <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> were incubated with human plasma prior to isolation of LDL particles. This showed, for the first time, that incubation of plasma with dark, but not green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> protected the LDL against oxidation by copper or by the thermolabile azo compound AAPH. Antioxidants in the dark <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> must therefore have become associated with the LDL particles.

40|$|The {{contractile}} or relaxant {{activities or}} both of aqueous extracts of green and roasted coffees were assayed on isolated guinea pig tracheal spirals. Contractile and relaxant activities were compared with histamine and theophylline, respectively. Green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> induced concentration dependent contraction, but the maximal tension never exceeded 76. 3 % +/- 5. 2 of a maximal histamine contraction (0. 69 +/- 0. 07 g/mm 2 v 0. 52 +/- 0. 05 g/mm 2; p (0. 01). One gram of green coffee dust had a biological activity equivalent to 1. 23 +/- 0. 1 mg of histamine. The pD 2 value of histamine was - 5. 17 +/- 0. 05. The potency of green coffee was unaffected by mepyramine maleate (1 micrograms/ml, final bath concentration) while that of histamine was reduced 500 fold. Tissues contracted with histamine were not significantly relaxed by green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts.</b> By contrast, roasted <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> induced concentration dependent relaxation of uncontracted and histamine contracted tissues. Tissues contracted with green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> were also completely relaxed by roasted <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts.</b> The pD 2 value of theophylline was - 4. 10 +/- 0. 03. The relaxant activity of 1 g of roasted coffee was equivalent to 1. 95 +/- 0. 16 mg of theophylline. The potency of these extracts was significantly reduced after propranolol (1 micrograms/ml; dose ratio 1. 56). Our results show that <b>coffee</b> dust <b>extracts</b> have considerable biological activity which changes from a contractile to a relaxant action {{as a consequence of}} processing. The greater incidence of adverse reactions to green coffee dust(s) in coffee workers {{may be related to the}} contractile activity present in green coffee dust...|$|R

This gradient pressure causes the caffeine molecules to migrate from the green coffee into the GCE. Because GCE is saturated with the other water-soluble components of green coffee only the caffeine molecule migrates to the GCE; the other water-soluble coffee elements are retained in the Green Coffee. This is what makes the GCE caffeine selective and specific.|$|E

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al 28 th International Symposium on Chromatography celebrado en Valencia (España) del 12 al 16 de septiembre de 2010. Coffee {{beverage}} {{has been}} associated with antibacterial and antioxidant capacities. This investigation aimed at identifying and quantifying natural compounds in coffee that contribute to these properties. Coffee chemical compounds (chlorogenic acid) and aqueous extracts of green regular and decaffeinated Arabica and Robusta coffee beans were tested. Antioxidant properties of the <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> were determined by TEAC and 2 -deoxyribose degradation assays. An extract from Vietnam Robusta green coffee beans possessing the highest antioxidant capacity among the samples, was selected and its antibacterial effect against Campylobacter jejuni, which is considered the most common causes of bacterial foodborne diarrheal disease throughout the world, was determined. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Vietnam Robusta green coffee against Campylobacter jejuni was performed. Chemical composition of the extracts was established by CZE. Antioxidant and MIC results were correlated with the concentration of one of the major coffee compounds in the extracts. Chlorogenic acid, the most abundant phenol antioxidant naturally present in <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts,</b> showed bacteriostatic activity and antioxidant capacity against either ABTS•+ or hydroxyl radicals. In conclusion, CZE analysis allowed chemically characterize the green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> and identify chlorogenic acid as a main antioxidant and bacteriostatic compound of the extracts.

40|$|Production of soluble (instant) coffee powders {{typically}} involves {{extraction of}} roasted coffee by water followed by evaporation {{in order to}} concentrate extracts before spray or freeze drying to produce dry coffee powder. In the course of evaporation, deposition of dissolved material from <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> is {{a major cause of}} fouling at the heat exchange surfaces of evaporators. Therefore, in order to improve the design and optimization of evaporation processes of <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts,</b> better understanding of the deposition mechanism and kinetics is needed. In this study, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the initial formation of nanometer scale deposits on surfaces exposed to <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts.</b> OWLS measurements were complemented by light scattering from extract solutions, gravimetry of macroscopic deposits, and scanning electron microscopy imaging of deposited layers. Primary molecular-scale layers of about 1 mg m^− 2 were rapidly formed in the first stage of deposition, even at ambient temperature, followed by the secondary deposition with kinetics strongly dependent on temperature. Secondary deposition rates were low and largely independent of the extract concentration at ambient temperature, but became strongly dependent on the extract concentration at elevated temperatures. In particular, activation energies for the deposition between 25 ◦C and 70 ◦C were much higher for the original extract (13. 3 mass %, solids) than for diluted extracts (up to 1. 3 mass %, solids). Furthermore, heating of the original extracts above 60 ◦C resulted in rapid aggregation of suspended macromolecules into large clusters, while only gradual aggregation was observed in diluted extracts...|$|R
