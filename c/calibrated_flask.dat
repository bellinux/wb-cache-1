30|$|The {{contents}} of two injection vials, each having an amount equivalent to 30  mg of active ingredient was filtered through Whatmann No. 40 filter paper and transferred into two separate 100 -mL <b>calibrated</b> <b>flask.</b> It was then dissolved with methanol and acetonitrile for method A and B, respectively.

30|$|Saline {{water in}} still is heated by solar radiation. The water vapor formed is {{condensed}} at the inner glass surface, {{and the water}} droplets are glided along the glass. The condensed water is collected in a <b>calibrated</b> <b>flask.</b> The depth of the saline water in the solar stills is maintained constant manually using the feed water tank and control valves. The present experimental study aims to study the effect of still surface area variation on fresh water productivity and the efficiency of single-slope basin solar stills.|$|E
30|$|To {{carry out}} the {{pharmaceutical}} analysis, 5 -FU tablets were grounded using a mortar and a fraction corresponding to stock solution of 1  mM was weighed and completed to the volume with double distilled water in a 100 -ml <b>calibrated</b> <b>flask.</b> After sonication for 10  min, to affect complete dissolution suitable aliquots of the clear supernatant, liquid was taken and diluted with buffer solution of pH 7. The oxidation peak current of 5 -FU was measured using differential pulse voltammetric technique.

30|$|An {{accurately}} {{measured volume}} equivalent to 5  mg was dissolved in 25  mL methanol and acetonitrile for method A and B, respectively. The solutions were then mixed well and filtered through Whatmann No. 40 filter paper.

A convenient aliquot from resulting solutions was then subjected to analysis.|$|R
30|$|Job?s {{method of}} {{continuous}} variation (Rose 1964) was employed. Master equimolar solution of gabapentin was prepared in water whereas NIN was prepared in methanol {{and made up}} to volume with the same solvent. A series of 10 ?mL portions of master solution of gabapentin with NIN was made up comprising different complementary proportions (0 : 10, 1 : 9, 2 : 8 ?? 9 : 1) in 10 -mL <b>calibrated</b> <b>flasks.</b> The absorbance of the resulting solutions were measured at the wavelength of maximum absorption after the appropriate time against reagent blanks treated similarly.|$|R
30|$|Aliquots {{containing}} 2.00 – 50.00  μg mL− 1 {{of standard}} KT (100  μg mL− 1) were transferred quantitatively to 10  mL <b>calibrated</b> standard <b>flasks.</b> To each flask, 2  mL of TCNQ was added {{and the reaction}} mixture was heated at 50  °C for 10  min. The solutions were then cooled and completed to the volume with acetonitrile solvent, and absorbances were measured at 842  nm against the reagent blank.|$|R
30|$|For both HPLC and spectrofluorimetry, ten Urorec® {{capsules}} {{were carefully}} weighed and powdered {{to get a}} homogenous fine powder in a mortar. An appropriate weight of this powder equivalent to one capsule content was weighed, transferred into the <b>calibrated</b> <b>flask</b> and then dissolved in the mixture of methanol:water (1 : 1, v/v) in an ultrasonic bath. The final mixture was filtered {{by the use of}} a 0.45 μm membrane filter, and the filtrate was diluted with the mixture of methanol:water (1 : 1, v/v) and phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0) to obtain the certain concentration in the linearity range of SIL for HPLC and spectrofluorimetry, respectively.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{spectrophotometric}} determination of iron in seafood slurry samples based on microwave assisted digestion has been developed. The stabilized slurry (200 μl) is introduced in a flow system and transported by an air carrier stream to a digestion coil positioned inside the microwave oven. After the digestion step (10 or 20 min at maximum power) the flushing solution is {{collected in a}} <b>calibrated</b> <b>flask.</b> A 200 μl-digested sample is introduced in a flow injection system and the iron determined at 512 nm with 1, 10 -phenanthroline. The proposed method features a linear range from 50 to 200 μg l- 1 (r > 0. 999) presenting a precision, expressed as RSD, of 3. 7 % (n = 10) for repeatability and 5. 0 % (n = 30) for reproducibility. Accuracy was assessed by using Standard and Certified Reference Materials...|$|E
30|$|The powder X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) {{patterns were}} determined by X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX-III) using Cu-Kα radiation. The Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surface area of the catalyst was measured using an ASAP 2010 apparatus (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA). The catalyst sample was dried, with 0.3 g of the dried sample taken, and outgassing under vacuum for 5 h at 250 °C using nitrogen as an adsorption gas at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and BET surface area were then obtained. The surface acidity of the catalysts was measured using temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH 3 -TPD) employing a BEL-CAT TPD analyzer with a TCD detector (BEL Japan Inc., Osaka, Japan). The Si/Al ratio of catalyst was verified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Spectro Ciros Vision, PECTRO Analytical Instruments, Kleve, Germany). For measurements, sample (50 mg) was dissolved with nitrohydrochloric acid (5 ml) using a microwave oven. The decomposed solution was transferred through filter paper into a 100 -ml <b>calibrated</b> <b>flask,</b> and the volume was adjusted to 100 ml with ultra-pure water.|$|E
30|$|Aliquots {{containing}} 0.50 – 18.50  μg mL− 1 {{of standard}} KT (100  μg mL− 1) were transferred quantitatively to 10  mL <b>calibrated</b> standard <b>flasks.</b> To that, 1  mL of DNPH solution was added followed by addition of 1  mL of 2  N methanolic potassium hydroxide and the volume {{was brought to}} 5  mL with methanol. The solutions were incubated in water bath at 60  °C for 15  min. The solutions were cooled to room temperature and diluted up to the mark using methanol, and absorbances were measured at 424  nm against the reagent blank.|$|R
5000|$|A {{volumetric}} flask (measuring flask or graduated flask) {{is a piece}} of laboratory glassware, a type of laboratory <b>flask,</b> <b>calibrated</b> to contain a precise volume at a particular temperature. Volumetric flasks are used for precise dilutions and preparation of standard solutions. These flasks are usually pear-shaped, with a flat bottom, and made of glass or plastic. The flask's mouth is either furnished with a plastic snap/screw cap or fitted with a joint to accommodate a PTFE or glass stopper. The neck of the {{volumetric flask}}s is elongated and narrow with an etched ring graduation marking. The marking indicates the volume of liquid contained when filled up to that point. The marking is typically calibrated [...] "to contain" [...] (marked [...] "TC" [...] or [...] "IN") at 20 °C and indicated correspondingly on a label. The flask's label also indicates the nominal volume, tolerance, precision class, relevant manufacturing standard and the manufacturer’s logo. The volumetric flasks are of various sizes, containing from 1 to 20 000 mL of liquid.|$|R
40|$|A flow {{injection}} system incorporating a stopped-flow microwave-heated reactor was constructed for {{the preparation of}} solutions for subsequent analysis by atomic spectrometric techniques. Slurry samples were injected into the manifold and transported into a glass reactor mounted inside a microwave oven. Nitric acid was flushed into the reactor, which was then sealed and the contents were heated by an appropriate microwave programme so that the pressure was held at 400 Ib in-* for 5 min. During this period the presssure was continuously monitored. After cooling, the reactor was vented and the contents were flushed out into a <b>calibrated</b> <b>flask</b> and diluted to volume. The procedure was evaluated by the determination of some minor elements in cocoa powder (for which the results were {{compared with those of}} two other digestion procedures), Horse Kidney (International Atomic Energy Agency Certified Reference Material H- 8) and coal [National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material 1632 b Trace Elements in Coal (Bituminous) ]. A comparison of the results showed no significant difference (95 % confidence) for the trace element contents of these materials between the flow injection method and other two methods of sample preparation. An analysis of variance showed no indication of sample slurry inhomogeneity. Low recoveries were obtained for the coal material, perhaps owing to incomplete dissolution of the silicate constituents...|$|E
