40|$|Unregulated {{biomedical}} {{waste management}} (BMWM) {{is a public}} health problem. This has posed a grave threat to not only human health and safety {{but also to the}} environment for the current and future generations. Safe and reliable methods for handling of biomedical waste (BMW) are of paramount importance. Effective BMWM is not only a legal necessity but also a social responsibility. This article reviews the current perspectives on BMWM and rules, conventions and the treatment technologies used worldwide. BMWM should ideally be the subject of a national strategy with dedicated infrastructure, cradle-to-grave legislation, <b>competent</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>authority</b> and trained personnel. Improving the management of biomedical waste begins with waste minimisation. These standards, norms and rules on BMWM in a country regulate the disposal of various categories of BMW {{to ensure the safety of}} the health-care workers, patients, public and environment. Furthermore, developing models for the monitoring of hospital health-care waste practices and research into non-burn eco-friendly sustainable technologies, recycling and polyvinyl chloride-free devices will go in long way for safe carbon environment. Globally, greater research in BMWM is warranted to understand its growing field of public health importance...|$|E

5000|$|The EMA {{along with}} the European Commission, which handles {{approval}} of marketing materials, are approving generics and brand-name drugs {{in about a year}} on average, according to the EMA. In fiscal year 2014, the FDA had not approved any of about 1500 such applications by the end of 2014. The slow pace of the FDA review (6-12 months even for a priority review) has not allowed the market to correct itself in a timely manner, i.e. not allowed manufacturers to begin to produce and offer a product, when a price is too high. The following suggestions have been made: prioritize review of applications for essential drugs, i.e. move them up in the queue. If the FDA felt unable to make this largely economic evaluation about priority, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation could do this.

40|$|The United Nations Millennium Development Goals {{galvanized}} global {{efforts to}} alleviate {{suffering of the}} world's poorest people through unprecedented public-private partnerships. Donor aid agencies have demonstrably saved millions of lives that might otherwise have been lost to disease through increased access to quality-assured vaccines and medicines. Yet, the introduction of these health interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) continues to face a time lag due to factors which remain poorly understood. A recurring theme from our partnership engagements was that an optimized regulatory process would contribute to improved access to quality health products. Therefore, we investigated the current system for medicine and vaccine registration in LMICs {{as part of our}} comprehensive regulatory strategy. Here, we report a fact base of the registration timelines for vaccines and drugs used to treat certain communicable diseases in LMICs. We worked with a broad set of stakeholders, including the World Health Organization's prequalification team, national <b>regulatory</b> <b>authorities,</b> manufacturers, procurers, and other experts, and collected data on the timelines between first submission and last approval of applications for product registration sub-Saharan Africa. We focused on countries with the highest burden of communicable disease and the greatest need for the products studied. The data showed a typical lag of 4 to 7 years between the first regulatory submission which was usually to a regulatory agency in a high-income country, and the final approval in Sub-Saharan Africa. Two of the three typical registration steps which products undergo before delivery in the countries involve lengthy timelines. Failure to leverage or rely on the findings from reviews already performed by <b>competent</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>authorities,</b> disparate requirements for product approval by the countries, and lengthy timelines by manufacturers to respond to regulatory queries were key underlying factors for the delays. We propose a series of measures which we developed in close collaboration with key stakeholders that could be taken to reduce registration time and to make safe, effective medicines more quickly available in countries where they are most needed. Many of these recommendations are being implemented by the responsible stakeholders, including the WHO prequalification team and the national <b>regulatory</b> <b>authorities</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa. Those efforts will be the focus of subsequent publications by the pertinent groups...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{the decline}} in {{childhood}} caries prevalence, seen particularly in 1980 s, in recent years {{there have been reports}} that the declining trend has stopped or even reversed in some countries. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyse data from previous epidemiological studies on early childhood caries in the Czech Republic, conduct a secondary analysis of trend in dental caries prevalence, and discuss issues related to national oral health surveillance. Methods Since the 1990 s, caries prevalence in preschool children was monitored by two independent bodies: Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) that conducted 5 cross-sectional surveys over the period 1994 – 2006, and Institute of Dental Research (IDR) that conducted 4 studies over the years 1998 – 2010. Both study series differed in methods of sample selection and approaches to examiner training. For the assessment of the caries prevalence trends, regression modelling was used for the following oral-health indicators: caries experience, mean number of teeth with untreated caries (dt) and percentage of caries-free children. Results In both study series, a significant overall trend of declining caries experience and level of untreated caries, and an increasing trend of percentage of caries-free children was observed (p[*] Conclusions Both study series identified a significant decline of caries prevalence particularly in the 1990 s and early 2000 s. By the end of the investigated period, flattening of the caries decline was observed. The positive trend was observed in the absence of any systematic preventive initiatives on a population level. With respect to the above the authors assume that in the Czech Republic there still is a potential for further caries reduction in preschool population. This, however, cannot be expected without any health policy interventions. Oral health surveillance in the Czech Republic should be promoted by <b>competent</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>authorities.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Vaccines {{that are}} {{designed}} for use only in developing countries face regulatory hurdles that may restrict their use. There are two primary reasons for this: most <b>regulatory</b> <b>authorities</b> are set up to address regulation of products for use only within their jurisdictions and <b>regulatory</b> <b>authorities</b> in developing countries traditionally have been considered weak. Some options for regulatory pathways for such products have been identified: licensing {{in the country of}} manufacture, file review by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency on behalf of WHO, export to a country with a <b>competent</b> national <b>regulatory</b> <b>authority</b> (NRA) that could handle all regulatory functions for the developing country market, shared manufacturing and licensing in a developing country with <b>competent</b> manufacturing and <b>regulatory</b> capacity, and use of a contracted independent entity for global regulatory approval. These options have been evaluated on the basis of five criteria: assurance of all regulatory functions {{for the life of the}} product, appropriateness of epidemiological assessment, applicability to products no longer used in the domestic market of the manufacturing country, reduction of regulatory risk for the manufacturer, and existing rules and regulations for implementation. No one option satisfies all criteria. For all options, national infrastructures (including the underlying regulatory legislative framework, particularly to formulate and implement local evidence-based vaccine policy) must be developed. WHO has led work to develop this capacity with some success. The paper outlines additional areas of action required by the international community to assure development and use of vaccines needed for the developing world...|$|R

At the request of several stakeholders, the International Organization for Biological Control of Noxious Animals and Plants/West Palaearctic Regional Section (IOBC/WPRS) organized an initiative with the objective of merging all relevant international documents into one document, to provide more specific guidance, and to harmonize the regulation of IBCAs in European countries and in other countries of the IOBC/WPRS.

40|$|Introduction: Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) {{who also}} exhibit severe to {{moderate}} ranges of intellectual disability (ID) still face many challenges (i. e. less evidence-based trials, less inclusion in school with peers). Methods: We implemented a novel model called the Developmental and Sequenced One-to-One Educational Intervention (DS 1 -EI) in 5 - 9 -year-old children with co-occurring ASD and ID. The treatment protocol was adapted for school implementation by designing it using an educational agenda. The intervention {{was based on}} intensity, regular assessments, updating objectives, encouraging spontaneous communication, promoting skills through play with peers, supporting positive behaviours, providing supervision, capitalizing on teachers’ unique skills, and providing developmental and sequenced learning. Developmental learning implies that the focus of training is what {{is close to the}} developmental expectations given a child’s development in a specific domain. Sequenced learning means that the teacher changes the learning activities every 10 - 15 minutes to maintain the child’s attention {{in the context of an}} anticipated time agenda. We selected 11 French institutions in which we implemented the model in small classrooms. Each institution recruited participants per dyads matched by age, sex and developmental quotient. Patients from each dyad were then randomized to a DS 1 -EI group or a Treatment as usual (TAU) group for 36 months. The primary variables – the Childhood Autism Rating scale (CARS) and the psychoeducational profile (PEP- 3) – will be blindly assessed by independent raters at the 18 -month and 36 -month follow-up. Discussion and baseline description: We enrolled 75 participants: 38 were randomized to the DS 1 -EI and 37 to the TAU groups. At enrolment, we found no significant differences in participants’ characteristics between groups. As expected, exposure to school was the only significant difference (9. 4 (± 4. 1) h/week in the DS 1 -EI group versus 3. 4 (± 4. 5) h/week in the TAU group, Student’s t-test, t= 5. 83, p<. 001).
