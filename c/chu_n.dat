Their influence may also dominate the relationship between the different interstellar gas phases. How do superbubbles form and evolve? How do they affect the local and global ISM? The Magellanic Clouds provide a superior opportunity to study this shell-forming activity, since both stellar content and gaseous structure can be examined in detail.

40|$|We present both low and high-dispersion {{abundance}} {{analyses of}} giants {{drawn from the}} zero proper motion sample near NGC 121. For the sample of 35 stars, the mean metallicity of the SMC field near NGC 121 is [Fe/H]=- 1. 3 with a real dispersion of 0. 4 dex. The most metal-rich stars are at - 0. 5 dex and the most metal-poor stars at - 2. 1 dex. The velocity {{dispersion of the sample}} is 25 km/s. The dispersion of various kinematic samples in the SMC is independent of age. The RGB colors are consistent with Galactic globular clusters of similar metallicity. The field population, however, does not have an extended blue horizontal branch, and the main sequence turnoff extends 1 magnitude brighter than the turnoff in M 5. Evidently active star formation in this region started roughly at the age of the Galactic globular cluster M 5 and extended for about 6 Gyrs, and then stopped. Comment: AASTeX, 2 pages, 1 figure.

40|$|The {{cell cycle}} was {{examined}} in embryo and root explants of Vicia faba in culture {{to test whether}} or not polyploidy and aneuploidy affected organogenetic potential. Nuclear DNA contents and the mitotic index were measured in the 0 - 1 mm apical segment of primary roots of 5 -day old seedlings and at various times following transfer to modified MS in darkness or <b>Chu's</b> <b>N</b> 6 medium in an 8 h light/ 16 h dark cycle (N 6 -MS programme) at 20 Â°C. Mature embryos were dissected and cut longitudinally. Each half was cultured on the N 6 -MS programme. Root explants grown on MS in darkness developed into callus {{but there was no}} subsequent organogenesis. Only on the N 6 -MS programme were new roots initiated from root-derived callus. Using the N 6 -MS programme, embryo-derived callus became green and after 3 to 4 months, produced roots and shoots. Approximately 40 of these cultures regenerated plantlets. Polyploidy occurred within 24 h of culture irrespective of both tissue source and culture protocol. Variations in chromosome number from 2 n= 2 x= 12 were also routinely observed. Thus, calluses had the ability to initiate roots and shoots regardless of persistent polyploidy and aneuploidy. Compared with the baseline of cell cycle data for roots in vivo, the proportions of cells in the different cell cycle phases remained constant. Thus, in V. faba induction of organogenesis seems more related to culture protocols than to specific changes to the cell cycle. The mitotic index was significantly lower in vitro compared with meristems of intact roots. Â© 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R

The IRAS Vela shell {{was first}} {{seen as a}} ring of {{infrared}} emission in the IRAS maps of the Gum-Vela region coincident with the Gum Nebula. We have studied the kinematics of the molecular material (12 CO) associated with the IRAS point sources and Southern Dark Clouds seen in this region and established {{the presence of a}} giant expanding Shell of molecular gas. The estimated mass, size and expansion velocity of the Shell lead us to conclude that it is the remnant of a GMC, in the process of disintegration through the influence of a central OB association (Vela OB 2). This scenario is further strengthened by various other phenomena seen in the region like enhanced star formation, globules with bright rims, clumpy nature of the molecular gas etc., all of which indicate the disruption of a molecular cloud. We conjecture that the IRAS Vela Shell is a nearby example of a ``super shell'' in its early stages of evolution and as such is an ideal opportunity to study these objects now widely seen both in our Galaxy and in new observations of the Magellanic Clouds. We present our observations and conclusions and also comment on the possible evolution of the Shell into a system of star forming complexes like the Gould's belt...|$|E

Four callus induction media (CIM) regimes; Murashige and Skoog (MS), Linsmaier and Skoog (LS), <b>Chu</b> (<b>N</b> 6) and N 6 *(N 6 medium fortified with 0. 35 gL- 1 L-proline and 0. 8 mgL- 1 AgNO 3) were evaluated for their potential to induce callus {{in the three}} genotypes. All the media were supplemented with sucrose and five levels of 2, 4 -Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 mgL- 1). Resulting calli were matured on MS and N 6 basal media supplemented with 60 g/L sucrose and similar concentration levels (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 mgL- 1) of 2, 4 -D while the subsequent embryogenic calli were regenerated on hormone-free media. Transformability of these varieties was assessed via histochemical analysis of β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene following Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Statistical analyses were done using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) and Graphpad Prism softwares with mean separations achieved at 95 % confidence intervals. Of the 2 OPVs, KSTP’ 94 recorded the highest callus induction frequency (84. 4 %) while Namba Nane (45. 6 %) had the lowest. Similarly, KSTP, 94 had the highest mean of mature somatic embryos (59. 7 %) while Namba Nane recorded the lowest (16. 4 %). Assessment of regeneration frequencies from embryogenic calli revealed no significant differences among the 3 lines although CML 144 had the highest mean number of juvenile plantlets (36. 7 %). Analysis of transformation frequency (upon selection of calli on media with basta) showed that Namba Nane recorded the lowest transformation frequency (average 13. 5 %) some words missing. Transformation frequency (based on GUS positive calli) of these varieties ranged from 0. 8 to 2. 1 %. This work therefore provides an empirical platform for potential introduction of useful genes into these varieties. Peer Revie...|$|E
