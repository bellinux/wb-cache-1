5000|$|The member {{countries}} of the Commonwealth, embracing peoples of diverse races, colours, languages and faiths, have long recognised racial prejudice and discrimination as a dangerous sickness and an unmitigated evil and are pledged to use all their efforts to foster human dignity everywhere. At their London Meeting, Heads of Government reaffirmed that apartheid in sport, as in other fields, is an abomination and runs directly counter to the Declaration of Commonwealth Principles which they made at Singapore on 22 January 1971.They were conscious that sport is an important means of developing and fostering understanding between the people, and especially between the young people, of all countries. But, they were also aware that, quite apart from other factors, sporting contacts between their nationals and the nationals of countries practising apartheid in sport tend to encourage the belief (however unwarranted) that {{they are prepared to}} condone this abhorrent policy or are less than totally committed to the Principles embodied in their Singapore Declaration. Regretting past misunderstandings and difficulties and recognising that these were partly the result of inadequate inter-governmental consultations, they agreed that they would seek to remedy this situation {{in the context of the}} increased level of understanding now achieved.They reaffirmed their full support for the international campaign against apartheid and welcomed the efforts of the United Nations to reach universally accepted approaches to the question of sporting contacts within the framework of that campaign.Mindful of these and other considerations, they accepted it as the urgent duty of each of their Governments vigorously to combat the evil of apartheid by withholding any form of support for, and by taking every practical step to discourage contact or competition by their nationals with sporting organisations, teams or sportsmen from South Africa or from any other country where sports are organised on the basis of race, colour or ethnic origin.They fully acknowledged that it was for each Government to determine in accordance with its law the methods by which it might best discharge these commitments. But they recognised that the effective fulfilment of their commitments was essential to the harmonious development of Commonwealth sport hereafter.They acknowledged also that the full realisation of their objectives involved the understanding, support and active participation of the nationals of their countries and of their national sporting organisations and authorities. As they drew a curtain across the past they issued a <b>collective</b> <b>call</b> for that understanding, support and participation with a view to ensuring that in this matter the peoples and Governments of the Commonwealth might help to give a lead to the world.Heads of Government specially welcomed the belief, unanimously expressed at their Meeting, that in the light of their consultations and accord there were unlikely to be future sporting contacts of any significance between Commonwealth countries or their nationals and South Africa while that country continues to pursue the detestable policy of apartheid. On that basis, and having regard to their commitments, they looked forward with satisfaction to the holding of the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton and to the continued strengthening of Commonwealth sport generally.Gleneagles (Scotland), 15 June 1977 ...|$|E
5000|$|Mr. President, I {{have the}} honour {{to take the}} floor today {{on behalf of a}} diverse group of 42 {{developing}} countries from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific, who are united by a common cause - to achieve lasting and comprehensive reforms of the UN Security Council.Our Group is bound by the firm conviction that expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of the Security Council is imperative to better reflect contemporary world realities, and achieve a more accountable, representative, transparent and more importantly a 'relevant' Security Council. Let me first express our Group’s congratulations to you on your election as the new Chair of the Intergovernmental Negotiation Process. Your appointment is a most welcome development as it brings not only fresh leadership but, hopefully, innovative ideas to what has been largely a stalled process. Mr. President,In your letter of 16 January by which you invited us to this meeting, you have identified the purpose of this meeting as providing member states with an “opportunity to exchange ideas on how to best structure our work in advance of the resumption of the IGN”.While we do believe that it is entirely the prerogative of the Chair of the IGN to decide on how he would like to structure the sessions of the IGN, it is indeed a very nice gesture on your part to have involved the member states in that process. Without elaborating on the substance of the positions held with respect to the question of UN Security Reform per se, and in the spirit with which this invitation was made to the member states, the L.69 Group would like to offer the following suggestions regarding the best way of structuring our work in the upcoming round of negotiations:One, The IGN was mandated to commence 'text-based negotiations' right from its very inception. The Chair at that time wanted this explicit assurance from member states themselves and to that end more than 138 countries, way more than two-thirds majority, made a formal and written submission to the Chair in 2009 asking him to table a negotiation text, in his capacity as Chair of the IGN process, which could then serve as a basis for our discussions. So, the mandate from {{more than two-thirds of the}} membership has already been granted thus making way for you to do what is the only logical next-step to move this process forward. Two, What is put inside that text is entirely at the discretion of the Chair, indeed it is your prerogative, provided that it is merely a starting point that is not be cast in stone but open to suggestions, amendments and edits from the floor. This will allow for the commencement of actual line by line and para by para negotiations. Such an approach should give those delegations who are concerned about omissions and positions not reflected as intended the assurance that the negotiation text is an evolving document with the flexibility to accommodate constructive views. Three, We propose that there should be a fixed schedule of meetings, commencing no later than the end of this month, whereby we can discuss each clause of the negotiation text, cluster by cluster, as was enunciated in UNGA Decision 62/557. Four, We must be very clear of our end objective while structuring the next steps. It cannot be an interminable process. The objective of this IGN process would be like all other Intergovernmental Processes which gradually narrow down the points of differences by arriving at what should be, ideally, a least bracketed text with the maximum possible convergences of opinions, as far as possible. Five, This is of particular importance! Because this year is a landmark year in the history of the United Nations, and if the United Nations is to be made “fit for purpose”, then its fitness for purpose should begin from its premier arm --- the UN Security Council. All our Heads of States and Governments unanimously called for “early reforms” way back in 2005 and expected a report on their <b>collective</b> <b>call</b> by the end of that session of the GA. However, ten years hence, we are yet to report back to them on what have we achieved. We must correct this for the 70th Anniversary Summit and we must ensure that we have an outcome to show to our leaders when they meet later this year. Mr. President, these, in a nutshell, are a few of our key submissions for your consideration. But before I conclude, please allow me to also flag a couple of other issues that may pose a challenge in building the momentum that you are trying to give to this process.One such issue is the often repeated call for “consensus to emerge even before the commencement of negotiations” as a pre-condition for beginning text-based negotiations. It is simply an anti-reform position, which suits only the interests of a limited minority of naysayers. No other process in the United Nations has ever been held back for complete consensus to be established before the Chair tables his zero draft. We, therefore, hope that you would choose to go by what Chairs are normally supposed to do and based on the mandate of the task assigned. In this case, the mandate given to you from the President of the General Assembly is very clear. H.E. Sam Kutesa, has on more than one occasion, emphasized the imperative of moving to text-based negotiations as the next logical step and has empowered you to proceed on that basis.Second, it is possible that there may be retrogressive calls asking for us to go back to Rev-2, a compilation dated in 2011. We would like to raise the point that the position of the L.69 Group to fully support the African Common Position is only reflected in the Rev-3 and not Rev-2, and therefore such calls would be tantamount to holding a veto over other Groups positions, which would be inimical and counterproductive to the process. In addition, the Revs remain a compilation text at best, a compendium of all existing positions, repeated several times over, and therefore, cannot be a substitute for a negotiation text. To conclude, we welcome this invitation to hear our views on structuring your work forward. You also are well aware that, barring one group, everyone in this room is on the same page with respect to offering ideas. However, we do hope that when it comes to making that decision on which ideas you chose to go by, you make a decision that is pragmatic and reflective of the majority.The L69 Group is committed to playing its part in ensuring your success, and we look forward to receiving a Chair’s proposal for a negotiation text at the first meeting of the IGN later this month. I thank you, Mr. President. Ambassador Inga Rhonda King, on Behalf of the L.69 Group, 11 February 2015 ...|$|E

Selecting the close-to-optimal {{collective}} algorithm {{based on}} {{the parameters of the}} <b>collective</b> <b>call</b> at run time is an important step in achieving good performance of MPI applications. In this paper, we focus on MPI collective algorithm selection process and explore the applicability of the quadtree encoding method to this problem. We construct quadtrees with different properties from the measured algorithm performance data and analyze the quality and performance of decision functions generated from these trees. The experimental data shows that in some cases, the decision function based on a quadtree structure with a mean depth of 3 can incur as little as a 5 % performance penalty on average. The exact, experimentally measured, decision function for all tested collectives could be fully represented using quadtrees with a maximum of 6 levels. These results indicate that quadtrees may be a feasible choice for both processing of the performance data and automatic decision function generation. ...|$|E

While broadly endorsing the project of public sociology, Craig Calhoun is apprehensive about its popular appeal to non-elites – soci-ologists laying siege to the commanding heights of our discipline – when we might be better served protecting university autonomy from outside imposters. He wonders whether public sociology is but a ‘current fad ’ rooted in ‘feel-good populism’, the last hurrah of 1960 s baby-boomers. In responding to him and my other critics, I will defend the seriousness and coherence of public sociology as a distinct realm within a national and global disciplinary division of sociological labour, and as an antidote to external subversion...|$|E

The user can define a composition of arrays with one <b>collective</b> <b>call</b> over an MPI communicator. Another call then constructs a distribution of messages, e. g., to exchange halo regions. This greatly simplifies the coding of halo exchanges, since the developer never has to define the halos explicitly. It allows flexible decompositions and variable halo widths without additional code. This flexibility {{has been used in}} the LES-COAST model, a large eddy simulation, to change a one-dimensional decomposition into a two-dimensional decomposition. This resulted in a maximum rank count about ten times higher for the application. In the NEMO model, replacement of hand-coded halo exchanges resulted in a lower overall model performance. The performance of the Gabriel library depends on the implementation of MPI derived datatypes in the underlying MPI-library, which is less than expected. In conclusion, Gabriel offers scalability, verification and ease of use for models on regular grids...|$|E

40|$|A <b>collective</b> <b>call</b> {{was issued}} {{last week by}} doctors from across Ireland and the UK, urging their governments to take long-promised action against cut-price alcohol.

The Irish, British and Ulster Societies of Gastroenterology said they were united in the belief that cheap alcohol available in supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations has played a substantial role in the startling increase in alcohol-related diseases that had emerged in recent years. Prof Aiden McCormick, President of Irish Society of Gastroenterology (ISG), called on the Irish Government to introduce a 1 per cent levy on alcohol advertising and sponsorship expenditure. The ISG recommended that the funding generated from this levy would be ring-fenced to fund an Institute of Alcohol Studies, which would spearhead health services research into alcohol harm reduction. “We feel it appropriate that the industry which profits from alcohol consumption should fund research into harm reduction,” Prof McCormick said...|$|E
40|$|Weight loss {{maintenance}} {{has emerged}} as a significant challenge in efforts tackling overweight and obesity, and their associated risks of morbidity and mortality (Colagiuri et al., 2010; NHMRC, 2013; Stubbs & Lavin, 2013). The antidote to the health risks associated with overweight and obesity is weight loss; however, only successful weight loss maintenance results in sustained health benefits (NHMRC, 2013). The statistics show that, while most people can lose weight using traditional behavioural based weight loss strategies, most people regain this lost weight (Wing & Phelan, 2005). Limited, yet cumulative, evidence suggests that the hitherto under explored variable of emotional eating, along with its theoretical underlying mechanism of action, avoidance, may explain significant unaccounted for variance within the weight loss maintenance puzzle (Bryne, 2002; Kayman, Bruvold & Stern, 1990; van Strien, Herman, & Verheijden, 2012). Within the literature addressing overweight and obesity there has been a limited, yet <b>collective,</b> <b>call</b> for researchers to explore novel psychological treatment interventions targeting emotional eating in the context of weight loss maintenance (Koenders & van Strien, 2011; Neve, Morgan & Collins, 2011; Teixeria et al., 2010). An aim of this thesis is to answer this call. In reviewing the problem of emotional eating and weight loss maintenance, as well as the theoretical understanding that avoidance develops and maintains this behaviour, it was reasoned that the psychological treatment intervention Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) would be best suited to tackling this challenge (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2012). This was reasoned because ACT explicitly targets avoidance and related psychological processes within its therapeutic treatment interventions. Consequently, this thesis constitutes the first treatment intervention study to quantitatively bring together ACT and its two core processes of experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion with emotional eating in the context of weight loss maintenance. The global aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of a 1 -day ACT group workshop treatment intervention for people who had recently lost weight targeting emotional eating to facilitate weight loss maintenance, using a randomised controlled trial design comparing a treatment group to a wait-list control group. Participants (N = 111) volunteered after responding to research advertisements inviting people who struggle with emotional eating and weight loss maintenance to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to the 1 -day ACTing on Weight group workshop which was the treatment group, or to the wait-list condition (i. e., the control group). Pre and post-treatment data was collected. The number of people who completed the pre-measures was n = 43 for the treatment group and n = 56 for the control group, and for the post-measures at three months the number of participants was n = 28 and n = 32 respectively. The following variables were psychometrically measured and analysed using multivariate statistics including mediation analyses: emotional eating, weight, weight loss maintenance, body mass index (BMI), waistline, experiential avoidance, weight related experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, satisfaction with life, positive and negative affect, general health and obesity related well-being. The results show that the participants who attended the 1 -day ACTing on Weight group workshop were significantly more likely than the control group to maintain their weight and report decreases in emotional eating, as well as report more weight loss. They were also more likely to report significant improvements in weight related experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, negative affect, general health and obesity related well-being while satisfaction with life, positive affect, and general experiential avoidance showed non-significant improvements. Further to these main effects, mediational analyses revealed that weight related experiential avoidance was found to serve as a mediator of the effect of the 1 -day ACTing on Weight group workshop on 10 of the 13 outcome variables including weight, BMI, five emotional eating scales, satisfaction with life, positive affect and obesity related well-being. In addition, cognitive fusion was found to serve as a mediator of the effect of the 1 -day ACTing on Weight group workshop on 9 of the 13 outcome variables including four emotional eating scales, satisfaction with life, general health, positive affect, negative affect and obesity related well-being. The practical implications of the findings are simple. They show that a 1 -day ACT group based workshop can decrease emotional eating and improve weight loss maintenance, and related outcomes. The relative brevity of the treatment intervention compared to the previous intervention research also suggests that this approach could be a time and cost effective way to augment weight loss maintenance (Forman, Butryn, Hoffman, & Herbert, 2009; Forman & Butryn et al., 2012; Niemeier, Leahey, Palm Reed, Brown, & Wing, 2012). The theoretical implications are more remarkable for both the relatively distinct domains of the literature of weight loss maintenance and ACT which have been amalgamated through this research. In terms of the weight loss maintenance literature, this study shows that when avoidance, as the theorised common mechanism of action underlying emotional eating is explicitly targeted in a psychological intervention, it can be significantly decreased, which in turn significantly decreases emotional eating. This finding was not surprising given the extent to which all the emotional eating theories purport this to be the case, the finding is however empirically novel (Evers, Stok, & de Ridder, 2010; Kaplan & Kaplan, 1957; Kayman et al., 1990). Also novel is that this study revealed a yet to be published finding showing that cognitive fusion is also a mechanism of action underlying emotional eating. This shows that weight related experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion both increase emotional eating. The practical implication is that future treatment refinement should consider both of these variables in order to optimise successful weight loss maintenance treatment. Through the paradigm of ACT theory and research, these findings support ACT’s therapeutic and unified model of behaviour change. Specifically the findings confirm the theory that experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion serve as mediators of change in ACT treatment interventions. In addition, the results add to the growing list of treatment intervention studies showing that ACT is likely to be helpful for the spectrum of unhelpful eating behaviours as found in recent research (Barnes & Tantleff-Dunn, 2010; Juarascio, Forman, & Herbert, 2010; Lillis & Kendra, in press). Further, this research contributes evidence that supports the proposition that ACT is a transdiagnostic treatment intervention that can be applied to a wide range of health concerns because it targets common underlying mechanisms of action responsible for the development and maintenance of problems as opposed to targeting symptom specific content (Smout, Hayes, Atkins, Klausen, & Duguid, 2012). The primary rationale for this study stems from the continuing rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity both within Australia and the developed world. As prevalence rises, so to do the adverse health and financial consequences of morbidity and mortality related to overweight and obesity. Finding ways to facilitate improvements in the rates of successful weight loss maintenance to in turn improve morbidity and mortality is presently an unsolved problem. The findings of this research provide some novel answers and direction for future treatment refinement for the problem of emotional eating and unsuccessful weight loss maintenance...|$|E
