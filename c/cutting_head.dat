25|$|A {{string trimmer}} is a powered {{handheld}} device {{that uses a}} flexible monofilament line instead of a blade for cutting grass and trimming other plants near objects. It consists of a <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> {{at the end of}} a long shaft with a handle or handles and sometimes a shoulder strap. String trimmers powered by an internal combustion engine have the engine on the opposite end of the shaft from the <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> while electric string trimmers typically have an electric motor in the <b>cutting</b> <b>head.</b> Used frequently in lawn and garden care, the string trimmer is more popularly known by the brandnames Weedeater or Weedwhacker. The string trimmer was invented in 1971 by George Ballas of Houston, Texas.|$|E

25|$|The newly invented Western Electric {{moving coil}} or dynamic {{microphone}} {{was part of}} the Wide Range System. It had a flatter audio response than the old style Wente condenser type and didn't require electronics installed in the microphone housing. Signals fed to the <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> were pre-emphasized in the treble region to help override noise in playback. Groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts. The chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch that could be crowded together, resulting in longer playback time. Additionally, the problem of inner groove distortion, which plagued lateral cuts, could be avoided with the vertical cut system. Wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus avoiding the microscopic irregularities of cast blocks of wax and the necessity of planing and polishing.|$|E

2500|$|His first {{project was}} to find a method of disc cutting that {{circumvented}} a Bell patent in the Western Electric moving-iron <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> then used, and on which substantial royalties had to be paid. He invented the moving-coil disc <b>cutting</b> <b>head,</b> which not only got around the patent but offered greatly improved sound quality. He led a small team which developed the concept into a practical cutter. The other principal team members were Herbert Holman and Henry [...] "Ham" [...] Clark. Their work resulted in several patents.|$|E
2500|$|Returning {{to work in}} 1953, he {{accepted}} a position as a Mechanical Engineering Specialist with Shell, where he developed {{a new type of}} self-powered drill driven by a turbine running on the lubricating mud that is pumped into the borehole during drilling. Normally a well is drilled by attaching rigid sections of pipe together and powering the <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> by spinning the pipe from the surface, but Whittle's design removed the need for a strong mechanical connection between the drill and the head frame, allowing for much lighter piping to be used. [...] He gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in 1954 on The Story of Petroleum.|$|E

2500|$|A {{different}} format, CD-4 (not to {{be confused}} with compact disc), by RCA, encoded the front-rear difference information on an ultrasonic carrier, which required a special wideband cartridge to capture it on carefully calibrated pickup arm/turntable combinations. CD-4 was even less successful than the two matrixed formats. (A further problem was that no <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> were available that could handle the HF information. That was remedied by cutting at half the speed. Later, the special half-speed <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> and equalization techniques were employed to get a wider frequency response in stereo with reduced distortion and greater headroom.) ...|$|R
40|$|Abrasive {{water jetting}} (AWJ) has gaind more {{popularity}} in recent timres {{as a method}} of machining everything from non metallic materials to high grade steels. Recent developments in hydraulic power supply and AWJ nozzle head designs now make cutting operations much more competitive. Previously multiple <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> in parallel operation were used to achieve higher performance but with high power <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> the high performance can be achieved withour compromising operational flexibility. In this paper different cutting situations are compared with regard to cutting capability and cost efficiency wherein the abrasive load ratio plays an important role. Here a model os derived to analyze cutting parameters for optimal operating conditions offering a new tool to predict and enhance performance of abrasive waterjet machining...|$|R
50|$|Horizontal {{directional}} drilling {{is done with}} the help of a viscous fluid known as drilling fluid. It is a mixture of water and, usually, bentonite or polymer continuously pumped to the <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> or drill bit to facilitate the removal of cuttings, stabilize the bore hole, cool the <b>cutting</b> <b>head,</b> and lubricate the passage of the product pipe. The drilling fluid is sent into a machine called a reclaimer which removes the drill cuttings and maintains the proper viscosity of the fluid. Drilling fluid holds the cuttings in suspension to prevent them from clogging the bore. A clogged bore creates back pressure on the <b>cutting</b> <b>head,</b> slowing production.|$|E

40|$|The <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> of {{the first}} 18 {{instruments}} in six sets of clinically used Lightspeed instruments (sizes 20 - 65) were examined in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three sets had been used by full-time faculty and discarded as follows: instrument sizes 20 - 32. 5 after 18 treated root canals; instrument sizes 35 - 47. 5 after 36 treated root canals; and instrument sizes 50 - 65 after 54 treated root canals. Three other sets had been used by a private clinician who discarded all Lightspeed instruments after preparing 20 root canals. The <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> of the 108 instruments were examined {{for the presence of}} surface debris, metal strips, metal flash, disrupted cutting edges, microfractures, tears, pitting and fretting and fatigue cracks. Fewer instruments ultrasonically cleaned before examination in the SEM had debris than those not cleaned before examination. The prevalence of metal strips and metal flash was similar for both groups. In contrast, microfractures and tears were more prevalent in instruments used by the full-time faculty group, who used their instruments more frequently before discarding them. Pitting and fretting occurred equally frequently in both groups whilst no fatigue cracks were noted in any of the 108 instruments. Overusage of Lightspeed instruments may predispose the flutes of the <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> to microfractures and clinicians should be aware of this possibility...|$|R

5000|$|Railroad wheels {{need to have}} a {{specific}} profile, as the profile wears into degraded shapes their performance becomes irregular and eventually unsafe. Most wheels are re-profiled using some variation of a wheel lathe or milling machine however it is impractical to either position steam locomotives over a lathe or to remove the wheels for re-profiling (although shop lathes do re-profile dis-mounted drive wheels when the locomotive is already disassembled). A winch, (known colloquially as [...] "The Lidgerwood" [...] on some railroads) would move the locomotive while <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> were mounted on brake shoe brackets and forced against the wheels; as the locomotive moved against the <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> the wheels were cut back to a desirable profile. In a locomotive maintenance facility of the steam engine era (that generally ended in the mid-1950s in the USA) the place where this was done was sometimes known as the [...] "Lidgerwood Track".|$|R
50|$|The {{extent and}} {{hardness}} of Brisbane tuff deposits {{has often been}} a barrier to building tunnels in Brisbane due to its 100—150 megapascal strength.

50|$|Together with a music director, Jay Wilbur, Haddy was in sole {{charge of}} the {{technical}} side of the company's work until the young Kenneth Wilkinson joined him in 1931. Although the company was based at Tonbridge in Kent, Crystalate made many of its recordings at the acoustically excellent town hall of West Hampstead in north west London. At first the company rented the hall, and was later able to buy the freehold for £1,250. During the 1930s Haddy gradually developed improved <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> and dynamic pickups, {{with the aim of}} widening the usable frequency range of his records. At that time, recordings were cut directly on wax, and the existing <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> were restricted to a bandwidth of about 50-8,000Hz. After experimenting with other techniques, Haddy opted for the moving-coil principle which Paul Voigt of Edison Bell and Alan Blumlein of EMI had separately advocated back in the 1920s. His first efforts were restricted to a 7,500Hz upper limit but the sound quality was nonetheless much improved. The repertoire recorded by Haddy for Crystalate was mainly light music and comedy records, with artists such as Sandy Powell, Charles Penrose, and Leslie Sarony.|$|R
