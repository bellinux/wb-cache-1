5|$|Cervical cancer {{nearly always}} {{involves}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a virus with numerous strains, several of which predispose to precancerous {{changes in the}} cervical epithelium, particularly in the transformation zone, {{which is the most}} common area for cervical cancer to start. HPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, reduce the incidence of cervical <b>cancer,</b> <b>by</b> inoculating against the viral strains involved in cancer development.|$|E

5|$|Outdoor air pollutants, {{especially}} chemicals {{released from}} the burning of fossil fuels, {{increase the risk of}} lung cancer. Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with slightly increased risk.

Outdoor air pollution is estimated to account for 1–2% of lung cancers.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung <b>cancer</b> <b>by</b> an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E

Blum has two remaining half-siblings, an older brother and sister. The following year, during his rookie season in the WHL, his mother {{was diagnosed with a}} form of juvenile cancer.

5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial <b>cancer</b> <b>by</b> 300–400%.|$|E

Kritschgau claims to work for not only the Department of Defense but also a congressional lobbying firm known as Roush. Mulder sees Scully and her doctor about the chip. Scully's family is skeptical, particularly her brother Bill, who is quite upset with Mulder. Scully decides to go ahead and have the chip inserted in her neck.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly {{reproduce}} HeLa cells {{in a laboratory}} setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, by 1954, Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the polio vaccine. To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory. Additionally, Chester M. Southam, a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to observe if cancer could be transmitted {{as well as to}} examine if one could become immune to <b>cancer</b> <b>by</b> developing an acquired immune response.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>by</b> preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} operates six {{research centres}} and institutes, the Centre for Neuroscience Studies, GeoEngeering Centre, High Performance Computing Virtual Laboratory, Human Mobility Research Centre, Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Institute, and the Southern African Research Centre. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory's director, Arthur B. McDonald, {{is a member}} of the university's physics department. The observatory managed the SNO experiment, which demonstrated that the solution to the solar neutrino problem was that neutrinos change flavour (type) as they propagate through the Sun. The SNO experiment proved that a non-zero mass neutrino exists. This was a major breakthrough in cosmology. In October 2015, Arthur B. McDonald and Takaaki Kajita (University of Tokyo) jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physics for illustration of neutrino change identities and identification of mass. This is the first Nobel Prize awarded to a Queen's University researcher. In 1976 urologist Alvaro Morales, along with his colleagues, developed the first clinically effective immunotherapy for <b>cancer</b> <b>by</b> adapting the Bacille Calmette-Guérin tuberculosis vaccine for treatment of early stage bladder cancer.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, {{the male}} lead in Cold Feet, an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in {{different}} stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in Hear My Song and Go Now. Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play him—English writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youth—but Nesbitt {{wanted to take the}} opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an ordinary man from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of Love Lies Bleeding. Cold Feet was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. Cold Feets first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with testicular cancer, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action <b>Cancer.</b> <b>By</b> the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting that Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.|$|E
