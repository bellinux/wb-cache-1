25|$|Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is {{harvested}} mechanically, {{either by}} a <b>cotton</b> <b>picker,</b> {{a machine that}} removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Farm {{workers and}} female <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> {{are exposed to}} {{residual}} impacts of pesticide use in cotton production, in addition to dust, ultraviolet radiation, etc. Cotton picking causes various health hazards among <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> with varied health cost. A soil bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is incorporated in cotton seed through genetic modification and it has resistance against certain bollworms of cotton. So it is considered that Bt cotton fields have less pesticide exposure compared to non-Bt cotton fields. This {{study was designed to}} examine and compare the impacts and health cost of cotton picking among female <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> working in Bt and non-Bt cotton fields. Methods The study used the data collected from Vehari district of Pakistani Punjab. Health hazards and associated health cost of the respondents involved in Bt cotton picking were compared with those who harvested non-Bt cotton. Comparative use of the personal protective measures among those respondents was also examined. Health cost function and its determinants were analyzed using ordinary least square method. Results Findings of the study showed that 61  % <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> from Bt <b>cotton</b> households reported one or more health effects of pesticide during picking season whereas this percentage for non-Bt cotton households was 66  %. Health impacts included skin problems, headache, cough, flu/fever, eye irritation and sleeplessness, however, percentage of these health impacts was comparatively higher among non-Bt cotton households. Health cost from exposure to pesticide use in cotton was US$ 5. 74 and 2. 91 per season for non-Bt cotton and Bt cotton households, respectively. Education, picking in Bt cotton fields and preventive measures were significantly related with health cost. Conclusion <b>Cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> working in Bt cotton fields are found to have less occupational health hazards compared to those working in non-Bt cotton fields. Thus generating awareness among <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> for adopting precautionary measures during harvesting and the use of Bt cotton seed can result in a decline in the ill-effects of cotton picking...|$|R
