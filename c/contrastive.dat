5|$|Unmarked phrase {{order is}} subject–object–{{predicate}}. While the predicate generally has {{to remain in}} clause-final position, the other phrases are free to change order or to wholly disappear. The topic tends to be placed clause-initially, new information rather {{at the end of}} the clause. Topic can be overtly marked with bol, which can also mark <b>contrastive</b> focus, overt additive focus ('even, also') can be marked with the clitic č, and overt restrictive focus with the clitic l ('only').|$|E

25|$|Mazahua's most {{distinctive}} feature is its abnormally-large phoneme inventory, around sixty phonemes, or {{twice the number}} in English. There are eight vowel phonemes, seven <b>contrastive</b> nasal vowels, {{and as many as}} forty-five consonants.|$|E
25|$|Shilha has thirty-three phonemic consonants. Like other Berber {{languages}} and Arabic, it has both pharyngealized ("emphatic") and plain dental consonants.

25|$|Consonant {{length is}} <b>contrastive</b> in Nobiin, e.g. dáwwí 'path' vs. dáwí 'kitchen'. Like vowel length, {{consonant}} length {{is not very}} stable; long consonants tend to be shortened in many cases (e.g. the Arabic loan dùkkáán ‘shop’ is often found as dùkáán).|$|E
25|$|In addition, Unami is {{analysed}} {{as having}} <b>contrastive</b> long voiceless stops: p·, t·, č·, k·; and long voiceless fricatives: s·, š·, and x·. The raised dot /·/ {{is used to}} indicate length of a preceding consonant or vowel. A full analysis and description {{of the status of}} the long consonants is not available, and more than one analysis of Delaware consonants has been proposed. Some analyses only recognize long stops and fricatives as predictable, i.e. as arising by rule. The <b>contrastive</b> long consonants are described as having low functional yield, that is, they differentiate relatively few pairs of words, but nonetheless do occur in contrasting environments. Both languages have rules that lengthen consonants in certain environments.|$|E
25|$|At least 2,500 years ago, {{the first}} Nubian {{speakers}} migrated into the Nile Valley from the southwest. Old Nubian {{is thought to}} be ancestral to Nobiin. Nobiin is a tonal language with <b>contrastive</b> vowel and consonant length. The basic word order is subject–object–verb.|$|E
25|$|Crow {{has three}} pronominal forms: bound; {{emphatic}} and contrastive; and interrogative-indefinite pronouns.

25|$|The clearest {{and most}} {{important}} example of Prague school structuralism lies in phonemics. Rather than simply compiling a list of which sounds occur in a language, the Prague school sought to examine how they were related. They determined that the inventory of sounds in a language could be analysed {{in terms of a}} series of contrasts. Thus in English the sounds /p/ and /b/ represent distinct phonemes because there are cases (minimal pairs) where the contrast between the two is the only difference between two distinct words (e.g. 'pat' and 'bat'). Analyzing sounds in terms of <b>contrastive</b> features also opens up comparative scope—it makes clear, for instance, that the difficulty Japanese speakers have differentiating /r/ and /l/ in English is because these sounds are not <b>contrastive</b> in Japanese. Phonology would become the paradigmatic basis for structuralism {{in a number of different}} fields.|$|E
25|$|<b>Contrastive</b> vowel {{length for}} Munsee high vowels has been reintroduced, {{and also for}} the front mid vowels. For modern Munsee it is {{necessary}} to recognize long /i·, o·, e·, a·/ and short /i, o, e, a/. Innovating instances of short /i, o, and e/ arise from for example reduplicating syllables and loan words.|$|E
25|$|Just as open syllables {{have ten}} vowels, so too do closed syllables: /æ/ /ɪ/ /ɛ/ /u̯æ~ʊ/ /u̯ɛ/ /u̯ɪ/ /eɪ/ /oʊ/ /aɪ/ /aʊ/. It {{is worth noting}} that in Yangon MSB no vowel quality exists in both closed and open syllables, and that {{therefore}} nasalisation cannot be said to be a <b>contrastive</b> feature in and of itself.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} and third lines, Shakespeare {{emphasizes}} pronouns by putting them in metrically strong positions, encouraging the reader to place <b>contrastive</b> accent on them, thereby emphasizing the antithetical relationships plaguing the Speaker. This technique is common in the Sonnets, and continues through this sonnet. The second line has a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending (one of six in this sonnet).|$|E
25|$|Like English, Dutch did {{not develop}} i-mutation as a {{morphological}} marker and shares with most Germanic languages the lengthening of short vowels in stressed open syllables, {{which has led}} to <b>contrastive</b> vowel length that is used as a morphological marker. Dutch has an extensive vowel inventory. Vowels can be grouped as back rounded, front unrounded and front rounded. They are also traditionally distinguished by length or tenseness.|$|E
25|$|Transitives or causatives are morphologically <b>contrastive</b> in Hindustani, {{leading to}} the {{existence}} of related verb sets divisible along such lines. While the derivation of such forms shows patterns, they do reach a level of variegation so as to make it somewhat difficult to outline all-encompassing rules. Furthermore, some sets may have as many as four to five distinct members; also, the meaning of certain members of given sets may be idiosyncratic.|$|E
25|$|This vowel {{shortening}} in affixed/modified forms {{exists in}} all dialects, however the other dialects have retained <b>contrastive</b> length to some extent, whereas Kalaw Lagaw Ya has largely lost it for 'morphophonological' length, where the stressed vowel in non-emotive words (see below) {{of one or}} two syllables is automatically lengthened in the nominative-accusative; this also applies to words of three syllables with second syllable stress (as in mœrààpI 'bamboo').|$|E
25|$|Infants {{begin the}} process of {{language}} acquisition by being able to detect very small differences between speech sounds. They can discriminate all possible speech contrasts (phonemes). Gradually, as they are exposed to their native language, their perception becomes language-specific, i.e. they learn how to ignore the differences within phonemic categories of the language (differences that may well be <b>contrastive</b> in other languages – for example, English distinguishes two voicing categories of plosives, whereas Thai has three categories; infants must learn which differences are distinctive in their native language uses, and which are not). As infants learn how to sort incoming speech sounds into categories, ignoring irrelevant differences and reinforcing the <b>contrastive</b> ones, their perception becomes categorical. Infants learn to contrast different vowel phonemes of their native language by approximately 6 months of age. The native consonantal contrasts are acquired by 11 or 12 months of age. Some researchers have proposed that infants may be able to learn the sound categories of their native language through passive listening, using a process called statistical learning. Others even claim that certain sound categories are innate, that is, they are genetically specified (see discussion about innate vs. acquired categorical distinctiveness).|$|E
25|$|Vowel {{length is}} phonologically <b>contrastive</b> in Ojibwe, but is {{frequently}} not indicated by syllabics writers; {{for example the}} words aakim 'snowshoe' and akim 'count him, them!' may both be written ᐊᑭᑦ. Vowel length is optionally indicated by placing a dot above the character, {{with the exception of}} , {{for which there is no}} corresponding short vowel and hence no need to indicate length. The practice of indicating vowel length is called 'pointed syllabics' or 'pointing'. In the pointed variant, the word 'snowshoe' would be written ᐋᑭᑦ.|$|E
25|$|Different {{analyses}} of the Munsee vowel system have been proposed. Goddard (1979) presents an analysis in which Munsee and Unami have the same vowel system, unchanged from the Proto-Eastern-Algonquian vowel system (discussed in the History section below). In this analysis, there are four long vowels /i·, o·, e·, a·/ and two short vowels /a, ə/. Vowel length is indicated with a raised dot (·). However, in modern Munsee there are several sources of new short /i, o, e/ that arise from such sources as reduplication, loan words, and other various phonological changes, and that cannot be derived from other underlying vowels. Hence an analysis {{in which there are}} four positions that have <b>contrastive</b> vowel length as well as /ə/, is appropriate.|$|E
25|$|This stage {{began its}} {{evolution}} as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European {{that had lost}} its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels {{as well as one}} or two overlong vowels. The consonant system was still that of PIE minus palatovelars and laryngeals, but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from PIE proper. Mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants of PIE, {{but it would have been}} strained, and the period marked the definitive break of Germanic from the other Indo-European languages and the beginning of Germanic proper, containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively. This stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts, the loss of the <b>contrastive</b> accent inherited from PIE for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the word root, and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} framework {{used for}} American English from the 1940s to the 1990s {{was based on}} the idea of pitch phonemes, or tonemes. In the work of Trager and Smith there are four <b>contrastive</b> levels of pitch: low (1), middle (2), high (3), and very high (4). (Unfortunately, the important work of Kenneth Pike on the same subject had the four pitch levels labelled in the opposite way, with (1) being high and (4) being low). In its final form, the Trager and Smith system was highly complex, each pitch phoneme having four pitch allophones (or allotones); there was also a Terminal Contour to end an intonation clause, as well as four stress phonemes. Some generalizations using this formalism are given below. It {{should be noted that the}} American linguist Dwight Bolinger carried on a long campaign to argue that pitch contours were more important in the study of intonation than individual pitch levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{loss of the}} Proto-Indo-European <b>contrastive</b> accent {{got rid of the}} {{conditioning}} {{environment for}} the consonant alternations created by Verner's law. Without this conditioning environment, the cause of the alternation was no longer obvious to native speakers. The alternations that had started as mere phonetic variants of sounds became increasingly grammatical in nature, leading to the grammatical alternations of sounds known as Grammatischer Wechsel. For a single word, the grammatical stem could display different consonants depending on its grammatical case or its tense. As a result of the complexity of this system, significant levelling of these sounds occurred throughout the Germanic period {{as well as in the}} later daughter languages. Already in Proto-Germanic, most alternations in nouns were leveled to have only one sound or the other consistently throughout all forms of a word, although some alternations were preserved, only to be levelled later in the daughters (but differently in each one). Alternations in noun and verb endings were also levelled, usually in favour of the voiced alternants in nouns, but a split remained in verbs where unsuffixed (strong) verbs received the voiced alternants while suffixed (weak) verbs had the voiceless alternants. Alternation between the present and past of strong verbs remained common and was not levelled in Proto-Germanic, and survives up to the present day in some Germanic languages.|$|E
25|$|Apart from Wallace, {{a number}} of {{scholars}} considered the role of sexual selection in human evolution controversial. Darwin was accused {{of looking at the}} evolution of early human ancestors through the moral lens of the 19th century Victorian society. Joan Roughgarden, citing many elements of sexual behaviour in animals and humans that cannot be explained by the sexual-selection model, suggested that the function of sex in human evolution was primarily social. Joseph Jordania suggested that in explaining such human morphological and behavioural characteristics as singing, dancing, body painting, wearing of clothes, Darwin (and proponents of sexual selection) neglected another important evolutionary force, intimidation of predators and competitors with the ritualised forms of warning display. Warning display uses virtually the same arsenal of visual, audio, olfactory and behavioural features as sexual selection. According to the principle of aposematism (warning display), to avoid costly physical violence and to replace violence with the ritualised forms of display, many animal species (including humans) use different forms of warning display: visual signals (<b>contrastive</b> body colours, eyespots, body ornaments, threat display and various postures to look bigger), audio signals (ing, growling, group vocalisations, drumming on external objects), olfactory signals (producing strong body odors, particularly when excited or scared), behavioural signals (demonstratively slow walking, aggregation in large groups, aggressive display behaviour against predators and conspecific competitors). According to Jordania, most of these warning displays were incorrectly attributed to the forces of sexual selection.|$|E
