5000|$|Numerous {{states have}} emissions-testing {{programs}} to limit pollution from on-road vehicles, such as cars and light-duty trucks. Each of these vehicles must meet specific emissions targets before {{being allowed to}} obtain or renew vehicle registrations. Many of these programs are administered on the local and county level. For example, the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Car</b> Check is a vehicle emissions-testing program for all vehicles registered in Lake and Porter counties in Indiana. The two counties were designated as non-attainment areas for ozone levels in 1977 by the Environmental Protection Agency. By 1990, the two counties were reclassified as severe non-attainment areas, a designation which requires states to create State Implementation Plans to attain and maintain certain air pollution standards. Although the counties were again reclassified in 2010, this time as attainment areas, the two counties will maintain their vehicle inspection and maintenance program {{because it is a}} [...] "key piece of Indiana's plan to prevent backsliding so that the area can remain in attainment." ...|$|E

5000|$|The car's {{bodywork}} also {{interacts with}} the flow through the diffuser. In addition to creating downforce, the front wing and nose try to keep [...] "clean air" [...] flowing around, and more importantly under, the <b>car.</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>air</b> under the <b>car</b> prevents flow separation from occurring in the diffuser, which would severely rob its performance. The rear wing also affects the diffuser. When the wing is mounted low {{and close to the}} diffuser, the low pressure under the wing helps suck air through the diffuser. Cars, such as the Toyota Eagle MkIII and the Jaguar XJR-14 employed two-tier wings to enhance this effect. One profile was mounted high, in order to hit relatively <b>clean</b> <b>air.</b> The other profile was mounted almost flush with the bodywork behind the chassis. This wing's profile is used to drive the diffuser, creating that low pressure area to help move air from the underbody. According to Hiro Fujimori, aerodynamicist for the Toyota Eagle MkIII project, this bi-plane wing produced 18% more downforce for the same drag as a normal wing. Conversely, equal downforce levels could be attained for significantly reduced drag with this [...] "Red Baron" [...] wing.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically test the effect that {{restrictive}} <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> laws have on the level of smoking. Restrictive <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> laws refers to the laws which prohibit smoking in private workplaces as well as in public places. The data employed in this study consist of a time series of cross sections of the fifty states of the U. S., and Washington D. C., over the time period from 1975 through 1985, Since states where sentiment is strongly against cigarettes are more likely to pass a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law, endogeneity between cigarette demand and the <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law is a problem. A two step estimation model is used to control for endogeneity. Both a single equation and a two equation model of cigarette demand were estimated. The single equation results indicate that a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law has a significant negative effect on cigarette demand. However, the two equation model indicates that cigarette demand has a significant negative effect on the probability of passing a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law. The results indicate that when endogeneity is controlled for the <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law dose not have a significant effect on cigarette demand. This does not imply that the enactment of a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law would not reduce the level of smoking if such a law were imposed in all states, but rather that only states with low levels of smoking are able to pass restrictive clean sir laws. ...|$|R
