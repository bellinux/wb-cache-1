40|$|Fluidic <b>Cat</b> <b>Crackers</b> (FCC) {{using the}} {{catalyst}} regeneration cycle are candidates for more power efficient operation {{by the use}} of high temperature dirty gas expanders. In a previous paper, a computer simulation was described for the steady state operation of the primary mechanical components, specifically the axial compressor and hot gas expander. The present work expands upon the steady state model to add the dynamic characteristics of these elements as well as the effects of the controlling process valves. In many applications the expander will develop more power than the axial compressor can absorb. A power absorbing source, specifically an electrical generator, converts the mechanical excess power into electrical energy. A review of the mechanical equipment and the electrical generator operating modes and controls is needed so that the process designer and operator will know how the system will respond if process upsets were to occur. The program code developed can simulate these elements for specific processes and demonstrate the logic control scheme proposed by the process designer. This information will therefore allow the process operator, process designer and mechanical equipment supplier an understanding of the interplay of the system control elements and define specific operating limits...|$|R
50|$|Polybutene {{is similar}} to but {{different}} from polyisobutylene (PIB). Polybutene is typically made from <b>cat</b> <b>cracker</b> mixed C4s (after the stream is Merox treated to remove sulfur and amines, and contain 1-butene, 2-butene, and isobutylene. Ethylene steam cracker C4s are also used as supplemental feed for polybutene. On the other hand, PIB is produced from essentially pure isobutylene made in a C4 complex of a major refinery. The presence of isomers other than isobutylene can have several effects including: 1) lower reactivity due to steric hindrance at the terminal carbon in, e.g., manufacture of polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride (PIBSA) dispersant manufacture; 2) the molecular weight—viscosity relationships of the two materials may also be somewhat different.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the noise from}} a <b>Cat</b> <b>Cracker</b> exhaust stack, used {{for the purpose of}} converting heavy oil into gasoline products. Following the upgrading of the <b>Cat</b> <b>Cracker,</b> there were persistent community complaints of an irregularly varying noise that sounded like an “overflying jet aircraft”. This paper describes a detailed study of the <b>Cat</b> <b>Cracker</b> noise involving: field tests on-plant and in the community; scale model tests in the laboratory; theoretical predictions using thin aerofoil unsteady aerodynamic theory; and a study of atmospheric propagation effects using the Parabolic Equation method. The objective {{of the study was to}} i) identify methods of reducing the noise levels, and ii) establish the cause of the irregularity of the noise level in the community. The laboratory tests used a ? scale model to explore qualitatively the nature of any potential interaction between the two principal elements in the stack. The study concluded that the cause of the noise was an interaction between the turbulent flow from a valve and a Multi-Holed Orifice (MHO) downstream of the valve. The irregular variations in the noise where predicted to be atmospheric effects. Following the investigation the valve and the MHO were subsequently replaced by three MHO’s in series which gave a reduction in noise levels at the stack tip of up to 14 dB. Noise measurements in the community demonstrated a similar level of noise reduction. In some weather conditions the <b>Cat</b> <b>Cracker</b> noise can still be heard, albeit at a much reduced level. Work is continuing to reduce the noise even further...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 145 - 160 The hot gas {{expander}} (PRT) is {{an integral}} part of the refinery?s fluid <b>cat</b> <b>cracker</b> unit?s PRT train. Since 1995, the PRT has experienced four unplanned outages due to blade and steam baffle bolting failures. These failures were extensive and very expensive. The cost (mechanical repair and lost opportunity) added up to tens of millions of dollars along with tremendous stress and strain on the organization, to which no cost can be attributed. A PRT reliability upgrade project was initiated to improve the reliability of the PRT train with the objective of achieving back-to-back four-year reliable runs. The project was also to evaluate potential opportunities for debottlenecking without compromising reliability. The purpose of this paper is to share the methodology and various tools used to carry out a vigorous technical and economic assessment and to share results for a PRT upgrade project. As a result, key indicators and activities have been established to keep this machine available...|$|E

40|$|Fluidic <b>cat</b> <b>crackers</b> {{using the}} {{catalyst}} regeneration cycle have significant power recovery potential. Typically, the regenerator takes the spent coked catalyst and burns off the coke {{in an air}} pressurized atmosphere. The hot pressurized flue gas, leaving the regenerator section, contains the potential for power conversion from the heat energy and pressure head. Many existing systems recover the heat energy by means of carbon monoxide or waste heat boilers, but fail to utilize the pressure energy which can be recovered {{by the use of}} high temperature, dirty gas expanders. The use of an expander in the regenerator system introduces additional complexity. Analysis of the system operation during "off-design" conditions must be determined in order to properly design and size all turbo machinery and process components. A computer simulation model has been developed which allows the equipment vendor to size the air string components and assist the process designer in the evaluation of the many possible operating conditions. The digital computer model simulates the performance of the axial compressor, power recovery expander, regenerator section, and system pressure drops. The program can simulate the process system design conditions for compatibility with the axial compressor and the power recovery expander. It can predict off-design operation, such as the variation of ambient air inlet temperature and its effect on the compressor-expander power balance. It can test the startup procedures so that component design limitations are not exceeded. This paper will cover some of the basic modeling concepts for the axial compressor, regeneration and hot gas expander...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 7 - 18 A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} to identify the most likely cause of failure for a <b>cat</b> <b>cracker</b> hot gas expander in which the ?classic? failure mechanisms did not fit the evidence collected after the failure. Because the classic root cause analysis (RCA) did not provide a probable theory for the failure cause, a comprehensive engineering analysis was required to positively rule out causes that proved improbable {{and focus on the}} most likely theory. Included is a review of the failure mechanisms considered in the search for the cause of blade failure in the expander. This paper provides a discussion of how common failure mechanisms were eliminated leading to a theory in which catalyst deposits that built up and eventually shed off of expander blades led to supersonic flows in a converging-diverging nozzle created by blade deposits. The cycling of the blade loading form successive buildup and shedding of multiple deposits on the same blades and resulting changes from subsonic to supersonic flows in the blade throats area suspected to have created blade cracks in an unexpected location leading to the eventual failure of this machine...|$|E
