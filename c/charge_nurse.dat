40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the work of <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> in {{intensive}} care units (ICUs) as first-line managers. The practical part of the thesis aims at assessing the experience with nursing management in day-to-day routine, especially with the management of change introduction, conflict resolution and motivation of employees. It further compares different charge nurses' career beginnings. The second part of the research deals with personal typology of <b>charge</b> <b>nurses.</b> Twenty six ICU <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> were included into the study. The results indicate that <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> are not being specifically prepared for their job and that they particularly lack any special education in management. They usually solve conflicts either by compromise or via a directive. Most <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> intend to introduce changes into daily practice and they perceive changes as positive. Conversely, they describe the attitude of their subordinates towards changes as negative. <b>Charge</b> <b>nurses</b> generally know the motivators of their employees; however, they excessively and inappropriately use praising as motivation tool. Although not standardized and not used generally, a formal evaluation of employees is considered by <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> as a possible way to improve motivation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{theoretical}} model for information integration to support the deci¬sion making of intensive care <b>charge</b> <b>nurses,</b> and physicians in charge – that is, ICU shift leaders. The study focused on the ad hoc decision-making and immediate information needs of shift leaders during the management of an intensive care unit’s (ICU) daily activities. The term ‘ad hoc decision-making’ was defined as critical judgements that are needed for a specific purpose at a precise moment with the goal of ensuring instant and adequate patient care and a fluent flow of ICU activities. Data collection and research analysis methods were tested in the identification of ICU shift leaders’ ad hoc decision-making. Decision-making of ICU <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> (n = 12) and physicians in charge (n = 8) was observed using a think-aloud technique in two university-affiliated Finnish ICUs for adults. The ad hoc decisions of ICU shift leaders were identified using an application of protocol analysis. In the next phase, a structured online question¬naire was developed to evaluate the immediate information needs of ICU shift leaders. A national survey was conducted in all Finnish, university-affiliated hospital ICUs for adults (n = 17). The questionnaire was sent to all <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> (n = 515) and physicians in charge (n = 223). Altogether, 257 <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> (50 %) and 96 physicians in charge (43 %) responded to the survey. The survey was also tested internationally in 16 Greek ICUs. From Greece, 50 <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> out of 240 (21 %) responded to the survey. A think-aloud technique and protocol analysis were found to be applicable for the identification of the ad hoc decision-making of ICU shift leaders. During one day shift leaders made over 200 ad hoc decisions. Ad hoc decisions were made horizontally, related to the whole intensive care process, and vertically, concerning single intensive care incidents. Most of the ICU shift leaders’ ad hoc decisions were related to human resources and know-how, patient information and vital signs, and special treatments. Commonly, this ad hoc decision-making involved several multiprofessional decisions that constituted a bundle of immediate decisions and various information needs. Some of these immediate information needs were shared between the <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> and the physicians in charge. The majority of which concerned patient admission, the organisation and management of work, and staff allocation. In general, the information needs of <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> were more varied than those of physicians. It was found that many ad hoc deci-sions made by the physicians in charge produced several information needs for ICU <b>charge</b> <b>nurses.</b> This meant that before the task at hand was completed, various kinds of information was sought by the <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> to support the decision-making process. Most of the immediate information needs of <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> were related to the organisation and management of work and human resources, whereas the information needs of the physicians in charge mainly concerned direct patient care. Thus, information needs differ between professionals even if the goal of decision-making is the same. The results of the international survey confirmed these study results for <b>charge</b> <b>nurses.</b> Both in Finland and in Greece the information needs of <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> focused on the organisation and management of work and human resources. Many of the most crucial information needs of Finnish and Greek ICU <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> were common. In conclusion, it was found that ICU shift leaders make hundreds of ad hoc decisions during the course of a day related to the allocation of resources and organisation of patient care. The ad hoc decision-making of ICU shift leaders is a complex multi-professional process, which requires a lot of immediate information. Real-time support for information related to patient admission, the organisation and man¬agement of work, and allocation of staff resources is especially needed. The preliminary information integration model can be applied when real-time enterprise resource planning systems are developed for intensive care daily managemen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{information}} technology adequately supports clinical care in many intensive care units (ICUs), it provides much poorer {{support for the}} managerial information needed to coordinate multi-professional care. To gain a general view of the most crucial multi-professional information needs of ICU shift leaders a national survey was conducted, focusing on the information needs of <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> and intensivists. Methods Based on our previous observation study an online survey was developed, containing 122 information need statements related to the decision-making of ICU shift leaders. Information need statements were divided into six dimensions: patient admission, organisation and management of work, allocation of staff and material resources, special treatments, and patient discharge. This survey involved all ICU shift leaders (n = 738) who worked {{in any of the}} 17 highest level ICUs for adults in university hospitals in Finland during the autumn of 2009. Both charge nurses’ and intensivists’ crucial information needs for care coordination were evaluated. Results Two hundred and fifty-seven (50 %) <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> and 96 (43 %) intensivists responded to the survey. The consistency of the survey was found to be good (Cronbach’s α scores between. 87 –. 97, with a total explanatory power of 64. 53 %). Altogether, 57 crucial information needs for care coordination were found; 22 of which were shared between shift leaders. The most crucial of these information needs were related to organisation and management, patient admission, and allocation of staff resources. The associations between working experience, or shift leader acting frequencies, and crucial information needs were not statistically significant. However, a statistically significant difference was found between the number of ICU beds and the ICU experience of <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> with information needs, under the dimension of organisation and management of work. The information needs of <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> and intensivists differed. Charge nurses’ information needs related to care coordination, were more varied, and concerned issues at a unit level, whereas intensivists focused on direct patient care. Conclusions The reliability and validity of our survey was found to be good. Our study findings show that care coordination at an ICU is a collaborative process among ICU shift leaders with multiprofessional information needs related to organisation and management, patient admission, and allocation of staff resources. Study findings can be used to identify the most crucial information needs of ICU shift leaders when new {{information technology}} is developed to support managerial decision-making during care coordination. </p...|$|R

40|$|Content removed due to {{copyright}} restrictions Appendices K 4. 1, 4. 2, 4. 3, 5. 1, 5. 2, 5. 3 (Profile sheets) This {{study examines}} {{the impact of}} new ideas {{in the context of}} two hospitals. Concepts derived from systems theory have been used as a framework for the study which proposes that the innovative behaviour and characteristics of <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> are modified by individual and organizational factors. This proposition is also examined over time and a training intervention. In the empirical section of this research, the statistical analysis yielded nine distinct clusters of variables. Examination, of these clusters, and of the relationships between particular variables, led to the identification of important combinations. In particular, it was established that there is a positive relationship between measures of self assurance and interpersonal adequacy, as measured by the CPI, and judgements made by nurses in the ward Kardex. These judgements are influenced by the charge nurses' perception of the organization. A positive relationship was also demonstrated between the general and specific measures of innovative behaviour, and the perception by <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> of the climate of the organization. In the propositional extension of the study, the effects of training and time on psychological characteristics and innovative behaviour were quantitatively and qualitatively examined. The planned training intervention devised for the study did result in significant shifts in psychological mindedness, social presence and socialization as measured by the CPI. The POI measures for inner directedness, existentiality and capacity for intimate contact showed significant differences over time, but not training. There was also evidence of innovative behaviour by <b>charge</b> <b>nurses</b> at both hospitals over the seven month period of the study. It appears, therefore, that levels of general and specific innovativeness vary with {{the extent to which the}} organization is seen as facilitating or restrictive. Innovativeness is a relative concept, linked with social factors which influence perception. There is evidence in this study that training aimed at increasing knowledge and self confidence, can cause significant changes in these social factors...|$|R
