25|$|After {{hitting a}} {{historical}} low of 1.47 children born per female, the total fertility {{rate of the}} EU started to increase again, to reach a level of 1.60 in 2008. The positive trend was observed in all member states {{with the exception of}} Luxembourg, Malta and Portugal. The largest increases over this period were observed in Bulgaria (from 1.23 children per woman in 2003 to 1.57 in 2009), Slovenia (from 1.20 to 1.53), the Czech Republic (from 1.18 to 1.49) and Lithuania (from 1.26 to 1.55). In 2009, the Member States with the highest fertility rates were Ireland (2.06), France (2.00), Sweden (1.94), and the United Kingdom (1.90), all approaching the replacement level of 2.1 children born per female. The lowest rates were observed in Latvia (1.31), Hungary and Portugal (both 1.32) and Germany (1.36). The increasing fertility rate has also been accompanied by an upward trend in the natural increase of the population which is due to the moderate increase of the <b>crude</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rate</b> that reached 10.9 births per 1000 inhabitants in 2008, an increase of 0.3 compared with 2007. The increase was observed in all member countries except Germany. The EU crude death rate remained stable at 9.7 per 1000 inhabitants. The relatively low fertility rate means retirement age workers are not entirely replaced by younger workers joining the workforce. The EU faces a potential future dominated by an ever-increasing population of retired citizens, without enough younger workers to fund (via taxes) retirement programs or other state welfare agendas.|$|E
25|$|Russia entered {{stage two}} of the {{transition}} in the 18th century, simultaneously {{with the rest of}} Europe, though the effect of transition remained limited to a modest decline in death rates and steady population growth. The population of Russia nearly quadrupled during the 19th century, from 30 million to 133 million, and continued to grow until the First World War and the turmoil that followed. Russia then quickly transitioned through stage three. Though fertility rates rebounded initially and almost reached 7 children/woman in the mid-1920s, they were depressed by the 1931-33 famine, crashed due to the Second World War in 1941, and only rebounded to a sustained level of 3 children/woman after the war.

50|$|Usually {{developing}} countries {{have a positive}} or high natural increase rate. Developed countries have a negative/neutral or low natural increase rate, but many developed countries have their population increasing due to immigration despite their negative RNI. These countries also have the lower rate of death. This is because {{developing countries}} and developed countries are in different stages of the demographic transition. Developing countries are generally in the earlier stages of the transition meaning they have high fertility, which would show an increase in <b>crude</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rates.</b> Developed countries usually have lower or more stable fertility rates so they don't show as high rates in natural increase. This {{can be applied to}} mortality rates as well, because developing countries generally have higher mortality rates than developed countries. High mortality rates are due to differences in deaths from chronic and acute diseases.|$|R
30|$|Thirdly, the childbearing {{performance}} {{of individuals in}} a metropolitan area (i.e. metropolitan area-level fertility) is not well captured by readily available aggregate fertility data such as those from the US vital statistics. In particular, vital statistics report <b>crude</b> <b>birth</b> rates—defined as the annual number of births occurring in a metropolitan area per 1000 persons living in the area. This is a somewhat crude measure of metropolitan fertility since it normalises the number of births occurring in a metropolitan area to the entire metropolitan population {{rather than to the}} population most likely to have children (i.e. women of childbearing age). Say for the sake of exposition that a metropolitan area’s <b>crude</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> increase over time. We cannot be sure if the increase in <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> is due to an actual increase in childbearing activity in the area, which is what we are really interested to know, or to a relative decline in the (male) population in that area during this time. The aggregate fertility measure I construct using the CPS, known as the general fertility rate—defined as the annual number of births occurring in a metropolitan area per woman age 15 to 44 (i.e. the childbearing age)—overcomes this shortcoming by normalising births to a more “at risk” population (i.e. women of childbearing age), enabling me to conduct the analysis with a more refined measure of fertility (Namboodiri 1996).|$|R

40|$|Background: Educated {{women are}} known to take {{informed}} reproductive and healthcare decisions. These result in population stabilization and better infant care reflected by lower <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> and infant mortality rates (IMRs), respectively. Materials and Methods: Our objective was to study the relationship {{of male and female}} literacy <b>rates</b> with <b>crude</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> (CBRs) and IMRs of the states and union territories (UTs) of India. The data were analyzed using linear regression. CBR and IMR were taken as the dependent variables; while the overall literacy rates, male, and female literacy rates were the independent variables. Results: CBRs were inversely related to literacy rates (slope parameter = - 0. 402, P < 0. 001). On multiple linear regression with male and female literacy rates, a significant inverse relationship emerged between female literacy rate and CBR (slope = - 0. 363, P < 0. 001), while male literacy rate was not significantly related to CBR (P = 0. 674). IMR of the states were also inversely related to their literacy rates (slope = - 1. 254, P < 0. 001). Multiple linear regression revealed a significant inverse relationship between IMR and female literacy (slope = - 0. 816, P = 0. 031), whereas male literacy rate was not significantly related (P = 0. 630).

We find that the presence of banks is associated to lower children-to-women ratios and <b>crude</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> even after controlling for a large set of socio-economic factors. To account for possible endogeneity of bank location we instrument for the presence of some banking activity in a given county in 1840 with the existence of at least a bank in that county in 1820. The results of using this identification strategy are in line with the OLS ones, namely that fertility in 1850 is negatively affected by financial development. Next we explore the relationship between banking activity and fertility in the state of Pennsylvania, where, by law, most banks were created before 1820. This allows us to treat banks in 1840 as exogenous and confirm the existence of a strong negative causal effect from financial development to fertility. Finally, we show that our results are robust to measuring banking activity with the number of cities with at least a bank in a given county...|$|R

Life expectancy rose at a very fast pace. The very high fertility rates, resulted in an extremely youthful populations which, combined with low mortality schedules, resulted in crude death rates (CDRs) of 3 to 4 per thousand population, that is, lower than rates ever achieved in developed and most developing countries. The maximum range between <b>crude</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> (CBRs) and <b>crude</b> death rates, therefore, reached, in some countries, particularly in the Gulf, the unprecedented levels of 4. 5 to 5 per cent a year.

During the 100 years between 1950 and 2050, the relationship between CBRs and CDRs, therefore, is characterized by four distinct phases. This may be illustrated with data from Jordan.
