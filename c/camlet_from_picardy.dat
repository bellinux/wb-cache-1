Mounds are built to place, for a better performance, the guns at the same level as the Counterscarp.|$|R

He remained for more than eight years, composing Masses and motets that gained him a sufficient reputation in Italy that he was appointed to direct the city theatre of Genoa.|$|R

2500|$|Before Rollo's arrival, its populations did {{not differ}} <b>from</b> <b>Picardy</b> or the Île-de-France, which were {{considered}} [...] "Frankish". Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east (Roumois and Pays de Caux) around the low Seine valley and in {{the west in the}} Cotentin Peninsula, and were separated by traditional pagii, where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers. Rollo's contingents who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the Atlantic coast included Danes, Norwegians, Norse–Gaels, Orkney Vikings, possibly Swedes, and Anglo-Danes from the English Danelaw under Norse control.|$|R
50|$|Doedelzak is {{the actual}} generic term for the {{bagpipes}} in the Netherlands and the Flemish (Dutch) speaking northern part of Belgium, the region where painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder lived and worked. Formerly ''''pijpzak'''' and ''''moezelzak'''' were common. The latter two names, generic at one time, survive in the piposa (pipe au sac) <b>from</b> <b>Picardy</b> and muchosa (muse au sac) in the actual Belgian province of Hainaut. According to certain sources, muse once was the earliest generic name for this family of instruments in {{a large part of}} Europe and survives itself in the actual French generic name of cornemuse for all bagpipes.|$|R
50|$|General Chevert {{was ordered}} to flank the Hanoverian {{position}} with four brigades of troops <b>from</b> <b>Picardy,</b> la Marine, Navarre, and Eu. At 9 AM, this force advanced toward the Obensburg in three battalion columns and quickly overwhelmed the Jägers. The Duke of Cumberland, seeing his position threatened from the rear, ordered his reserves and the grenadier battalions protecting the guns to recapture the Obensburg. The use of these grenadier battalions in the counterattack on the Obensburg meant that {{they were no longer}} available in the center when the main French attacks went in against the Hanoverian center.|$|R
50|$|Robert de Clari (or Cléry, {{the modern}} {{name of the}} place, on the commune of Pernois) was a knight <b>from</b> <b>Picardy.</b> He participated in the Fourth Crusade with his lord, Count Peter of Amiens, and his brother, Aleaumes de Clari, and left a chronicle of the events in Old French. Robert's account of the crusade is {{especially}} valuable because of {{his status as a}} lower vassal; most other eyewitness accounts are from the leadership of the crusade, such as nobles like Villehardouin. Robert's descriptions often shed light on some of the crusader activities that are otherwise glossed over by the nobler sources.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{historian}} Benjamin Sulte, {{the first}} colonists of Quebec, {{were from the}} parts of France where the production of beer and cider {{is more important than}} that of wine.

Pierre Boucher, Governor of Trois-Rivières, was questioned about the colony during a trip to France. He reported: [...] "Wine is served to rich families, beer is left to those who are less wealthy, while others are content with a drink called the bouillon. The poorer ones drink only water, which is of excellent quality." ...|$|R

40|$|This article explores medieval French {{attitudes towards}} {{physical}} intra-familial violence, and asks why some acts of brutality {{were defined as}} reprehensible and deviant 'violence', while others were lauded as normal patriarchal discipline of a deviant victim. Using legal records <b>from</b> <b>Picardy</b> and Paris, repertoires of violent gestures are analysed and set {{in the context of}} the interplay of the practice of domestic violence, canon law discussions, and contemporary legal proceedings. Thirteenth-century legal and moral discourse condemned excessive domestic violence; yet, paradoxically, the power of violence to communicate and to correct was widely acknowledged. The article concludes by exploring popular literature's engagement with this ambivalence. © The Social History Society 2009...|$|R
