50|$|The {{application}} dossier {{for marketing}} authorization {{is called a}} New Drug Application (NDA) in the USA or Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the European Union and other countries, or simply registration dossier. Basically, this consists of a dossier with data proving that the drug has quality, efficacy and safety properties suitable for the intended use, additional administrative documents, samples of finished product or related substances and reagents necessary to perform analyses of finished product as described in that dossier. The content and format of the dossier must follow rules {{as defined by the}} competent authorities. For example, since 2003, the authorities in the United States, the European Union and Japan ask for the <b>Common</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Document</b> (CTD) format, and more recently, its electronic version - the electronic <b>Common</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Document</b> (eCTD).|$|E

We determined a pairing of the test drug and a comparator for each trial. In the case of three-armed trials with a test drug, active control, and placebo, we assessed two pairs; i.e., the test drug and the active control, and the test drug and the placebo and adjusted their possible associations in the nested random-effect model.|$|R

It is still difficult to predict, however, that increasing proportions of male subjects may yield better outcomes, because the gender proportion in clinical trials seems confounded by several factors affecting both the gender proportion and clinical outcomes, and {{it is almost impossible to}} adjust such potential confounders in retrospective analysis. Although drug companies routinely examine possible differences in efficacy by sex in study reports, they rarely become a focal point of discussion in the publications such as <b>common</b> <b>technical</b> <b>documents</b> for NDAs and review reports.|$|R

Generic manufacturers may file an abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) that incorporates the safety/effectiveness data submitted by original innovator drug manufacturer and adds only bioequivalence studies. Therefore {{it is very difficult}} and challenging task to approve a drug by the manufacturing companies, simultaneously submitted in all the {{regulatory authorities}}. Regulatory authorities are responsible to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy including manufacturing, distribution of the drug product. There is lot of challenges for the pharmaceutical industry to development and filling of generic drug application, which can be overcoming by the common format of submission. This is due to the different regulatory procedure of the various countries. Through the international conference on harmonization (ICH) process <b>common</b> <b>technical</b> <b>documents</b> (CTD) has been developed for USA, EU, JAPAN, INDIA AND CANADA.

40|$|Introduction: There are {{concerns}} over the quality of generic medicines in Pakistan. This is due to perceived non-compliance with good manufacturing practice (GMP), whereby {{the quality of the}} raw materials is not being assessed. If not addressed, this will impact on the potential for generics exports from Pakistan, as well as on patient care. Consequently, {{there is a need to}} assess the current assessment and regulatory situation in Pakistan and to recommend a way forward that ensures the future quality of products. Objective: To assess the quality of the raw materials that are either imported to, or manufactured in Pakistan, that are then used to produce a leading analgesic (ibuprofen). As part of the assessment, the presence and levels of impurities will be determined. Subsequently, the findings will be used to recommend potential regulatory changes to improve patient care. Methods: The quality of 27 sourced raw materials and the reference product were assessed using a variety of quality assessment methodologies, including assay tests, and infrared spectroscopy and UV-spectrophotometry. The calculated values were then compared to values documented in the Certificate of Analysis (CoA), and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: All but one sample passed the spectroscopy identification tests. However, 81. 5 % of samples failed to comply with pharmacopoeia assay limits. There were also concerns with the use of HPLC methods used to assess the quality of raw materials, and over the fact that assay values obtained were not the same as those listed in the CoA. In addition, where manufacturers had {{concerns over the}} amount of ibuprofen in the raw material, rather than rejecting the product, they typically used higher quantities to make up any shortfall. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that there is an urgent need to improve the registration process for generic products in Pakistan. This should include implementing <b>Common</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Documents</b> (CTDs) based on international standards. In this way, we will see generics being produced that result in improved patient care and that have potential for export from Pakistan...|$|R

The purpose of numbering is to facilitate cross-referencing of distant components and to help the user locate distant components in a long document. Numbering serves these purposes in two ways.

Although document contents are the same for eCTD and RPS, the internal XML structures are very different.RPS will offer two obvious advantages over eCTD. First, RPS will establish two-way communication between the submitter and all FDA-regulated product centers within the agency. Second, RPS will manage the life cycle of submissions by allowing cross-referencing of previously submitted information. This means that for electronic Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, New Drug Applications (NDA), and Biologic License Applications (BLAs), information need only be submitted once and previously submitted electronic documents can be applied to marketing applications. With RPS, archived electronic IND, NDA, and BLA submissions will be retrievable through standardized automated links. eCTD lacks this cross-referencing capability.|$|E
