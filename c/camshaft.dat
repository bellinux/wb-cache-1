5|$|Jaguar {{and engine}} {{designer}} Walter Hassan had previously created a 48-valve variant of their V12 engine specifically for motorsport use. It featured a double overhead <b>camshaft</b> layout with four valves per cylinder, {{compared with the}} single overhead <b>camshaft</b> and two valves per cylinder of the production engine, which {{was used in the}} Jaguar XJ and Jaguar XJS models at the time.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} 1965 victory, he never {{finished}} {{the race in}} Le Mans. In 1966, his Ford GT40 (shared with Innes Ireland) suffered an engine failure. A year later, he drove a Porsche 907 with Gerhard Mitter until their <b>camshaft</b> failed.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013 it was {{announced}} that the SWT units would be fitted with new traction equipment provided by Vossloh Kiepe. As part of the re-powering of the fleet, the air operated <b>camshaft</b> and electrical resistance grids will be removed, as well as the EE507 traction motors. The new equipment consists of DC to AC inverters of the IGBT type. This is needed as the replacement traction motors are AC rather than DC.|$|E
50|$|Train of ten {{cascading}} gears at {{front of}} the engine operate the <b>camshafts,</b> magnetos, oil and water pumps. The crankshaft gear drives the two magneto gears at crank speed. The two to one speed reduction to the <b>camshafts</b> {{takes place at the}} first stage of the gear train; all the remaining gears between the first intermediate gear and the gears at the <b>camshafts</b> are idlers.|$|R
50|$|Crossflow heads use {{overhead}} valves, {{but these}} can be actuated by <b>camshafts</b> that are either in the cylinder block, with actuation by push rods and rockers, or {{by one or more}} overhead <b>camshafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The S85 has dual {{overhead}} <b>camshafts</b> with 4 valves per cylinder {{and variable}} valve timing on the intake and exhaust <b>camshafts</b> (double-VANOS). The engine block and cylinder head are constructed from Aluminum alloy.|$|R
5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead <b>camshaft</b> which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the <b>camshaft</b> and supercharger drives {{to the front of the}} engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front of the engine.|$|E
25|$|While today some engines rely on {{a single}} <b>camshaft</b> per {{cylinder}} bank, which {{is known as a}} single overhead <b>camshaft</b> (SOHC), most modern engines are driven by a two camshafts per cylinder bank arrangement (one <b>camshaft</b> for the intake valves and another for the exhaust valves); such <b>camshaft</b> arrangement is known as a double or dual overhead cam (DOHC), thus, a V engine, which has two separate cylinder banks, may have four camshafts (colloquially known as a quad-cam engine).|$|E
50|$|Two <b>camshafts</b> per engine.|$|R
2500|$|More {{unusual is}} the modern W engine (also {{known as a}} 'VV' engine to {{distinguish}} itself from the pre-war W engines) that has four cylinder banks arranged in a [...] "W" [...] pattern with two pairs narrowly arranged with a 15-degree separation. Even when there are four cylinder banks (that would normally require a total of eight individual <b>camshafts),</b> the narrow-angle design allows the use of just four <b>camshafts</b> in total. For the Bugatti Veyron, which has a 16-cylinder W engine configuration, the four <b>camshafts</b> are driving a total of 64 valves.|$|R
50|$|<b>Camshafts</b> are belt-driven. The 5VZ-FE is a non-interference engine.|$|R
25|$|Billet Steel: When a {{high quality}} <b>camshaft</b> or low volume {{production}} is required, engine builders and <b>camshaft</b> manufacturers choose steel billet. This {{is a much more}} time consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. However, the finished product is far superior. CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, and CNC <b>camshaft</b> grinders will be used during production. Different types of steel bar can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a <b>camshaft</b> from EN40b, the <b>camshaft</b> will also be heat treated via gas nitriding, which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC. These types of camshafts can be used in high-performance engines.|$|E
25|$|In a {{two-stroke}} engine {{that uses a}} <b>camshaft,</b> each valve is opened once for every rotation of the crankshaft; in these engines, the <b>camshaft</b> rotates {{at the same speed}} as the crankshaft. In a four-stroke engine, the valves are opened only half as often; thus, two full rotations of the crankshaft occur for each rotation of the <b>camshaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>camshaft</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in Turkey (DiyarbakÄ±r) by Al-Jazari in 1206. He employed {{it as part}} of his automata, water-raising machines, and water clocks such as the castle clock. The <b>camshaft</b> later appeared in European mechanisms from the 14th century.|$|E
50|$|The DOHC {{cylinder}} head had 16 valves and {{was made of}} lost foam cast aluminium. The <b>camshafts</b> were held in the {{cylinder head}} with bearing caps and driven by a chain off the front crankshaft sprocket. Motion from the <b>camshafts</b> was transmitted to the 16 valves by direct-acting hydraulic lifters.|$|R

25|$|Depending on the {{location}} of the <b>camshaft,</b> the cam operates the valves either directly or through a linkage of pushrods and rockers. Direct operation involves a simpler mechanism and leads to fewer failures, but requires the <b>camshaft</b> to be positioned {{at the top of the}} cylinders. In the past when engines were not as reliable as today this was seen as too much trouble, but in modern gasoline engines the overhead cam system, where the <b>camshaft</b> is on top of the cylinder head, is quite common.|$|E
25|$|Rare options: RPO 449 special <b>camshaft</b> {{with the}} 240hp engine (111), RPO 426 power windows (547).|$|E
25|$|A single {{overhead}} <b>camshaft</b> {{for each}} cylinder bank operated two valves per cylinder, {{in an almost}} identical manner to the inline six-cylinder German Mercedes D.III and BMW III engines. Each <b>camshaft</b> was driven by a vertical driveshaft that was placed {{at the back of}} each cylinder bank, again identical to the Mercedes and BMW straight-six powerplants. Delco Electronics provided the ignition system and Zenith the carburetor. Dry weight was 844lb (383kg).|$|E

5000|$|George Brough {{described}} it a [...] "flat vertical" [...] engine. The four cylinders were 68 x 68 mm equating to 988 cc, with the <b>camshafts</b> gear-driven. Further development {{work was done}} on the engine, reconfiguring it as 71 x 63 mm (998cc), with chain-driven <b>camshafts.</b> [...] The engine was a four stroke engine.|$|R
