50|$|Unlike most chat/instant {{messaging}} applications, which {{follow a}} vertical scrolling paradigm, The TalkShoe Live! Pro client text chat scrolls horizontally, placing chat bubbles {{in a row}} next to the screen {{name of the person}} who typed them. It also uses threading in which responses to a given <b>chat</b> <b>message</b> take on the same color as that <b>chat</b> <b>message.</b> This is intended to allow easy tracking of conversations by users who are not able to give the text conversation their full attention. The Web-based TalkShoe Live! client uses a more traditional vertical scrolling paradigm.|$|E

The key concepts for implementation of the proposed system are that good players are those who received many <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> and that good players are those who received <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> from other good players. The proposed system is tested using computer simulations, in which issues on balance, reliability, and characteristics of different implementation recipes are examined...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chat</b> <b>messages</b> of {{development}} teams play an increasingly {{significant role in}} software development, having replaced emails in some cases. <b>Chat</b> <b>messages</b> contain information about discussed issues, considered alternatives and argumentation leading to the decisions made during software development. These elements, defined as rationale, are invaluable during software evolution for documenting and reusing development knowledge. Rationale is also essential for coping with changes and for effective maintenance of the software system. However, exploiting the rationale hidden in the <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> is challenging due to the high volume of unstructured messages covering {{a wide range of}} topics. This work presents the results of an exploratory study examining the frequency of rationale in <b>chat</b> <b>messages,</b> the completeness of the available rationale and the potential of automatic techniques for rationale extraction. For this purpose, we apply content analysis and machine learning techniques on more than 8, 700 <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> from three software development projects. Our results show that <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> are a rich source of rationale and that machine learning is a promising technique for detecting rationale and identifying different rationale elements.

In response, Cryptocat issued a security advisory, requested that all users ensure that they had upgraded, and informed users that past group conversations may have been compromised.|$|E
50|$|The Hotline {{applications}} {{were distributed}} as shareware and combined <b>chat,</b> <b>message</b> board and file transfer capabilities and operated using a client/server (not peer-to-peer) model. Hotline predates the Napster and Gnutella file sharing products. The Hotline protocol was a binary protocol {{which accounted for}} its high speed efficient transfers {{in the days when}} most internet users still used modems and dialup.

File transfer programs written specifically for the Apple-CAT II's 202 mode, such as Catsend and the later CatFur, periodically paused and reversed transmission direction, so the receiving computer could acknowledge receipt of a stream of data, and, {{in the case of}} CatFur, could add a short <b>chat</b> <b>message</b> to the sender {{in the middle of the}} one-way file transfer. Many bulletin board systems (BBSs) running CatSend and then CatFur were set up to transfer warez. The 202 CatFur protocol could only be used by a user running another APPLE-CAT II.|$|E

50|$|Among other {{features}} such as text chat, group <b>chat,</b> <b>message</b> notifications, status updates, and media (file) sharing, one specific aspect of social messaging platforms that made it popular was the usage of stickers or little rich images to depict mood and convey messages in non-verbal format. While some stickers can be downloaded for free, some are for purchase only, and {{become one of the}} way the developers to generate revenue. Another feature of social messaging are in-app services / utilities, such as sticker camera (where sticker images would be added to the resulting picture), social games, other virtual items, business accounts and its integration with other devices, such as vending machines, though the experiment only last for a month in 2013. Some messaging app such as Telegram, Wickr, and SnapChat also allow messages to be self-destruct (ephemeral messaging).|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The {{focus of this}} paper is to {{investigate}} the possibility of predicting several user and message attributes in text-based, real-time, online messaging services. For this purpose, a large collection of <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> is examined. The applicability of various supervised classification techniques for extracting information from the <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> is evaluated. Two competing models are used for defining the chat mining problem. A term-based approach is used to investigate the user and message attributes in the context of vocabulary use while a style-based approach is used to examine the <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> according to the variations in the authors' writing styles. Among 100 authors, the identity of an author is correctly predicted with 99. 7 % accuracy. Moreover, the reverse problem is exploited, and the effect of author attributes on computer-mediated communications is discussed. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Instant Messaging (IM) is a {{peer-to-peer}} {{service for}} remote users {{to communicate with}} each others. There are many IM systems such as MSN Messenger and Yahoo Messenger which are used by millions of users everyday. However, IM technology serves as a double edged sword and could be misused for illegitimate information exchange or committing crimes for its anonymity and completely uncontrolled chatting environment. To help enforce legitimate contents communicated in chat environments, IM monitoring systems have been developed for monitoring chat messages. Although most of these systems can provide good monitoring functions, they only provide simple message analysis features such as browsing and simple keyword-based searching of the recorded messages. In this paper, we propose a system, called IMAnalysis, that supports intelligent <b>chat</b> <b>message</b> analysis using text mining techniques. The IMAnalysis system provides functions on <b>chat</b> <b>message</b> retrieval, social network analysis and topic analysis. <b>Chat</b> <b>message</b> retrieval provides general browsing and retrieval support. Social network analysis discovers the social interactions of IM users with their contacts. And topic analysis detects automatically the topics that IM users are involved in...|$|E
40|$|Purpose â The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the characteristics of chat messages from analysing a collection of 33, 121 sample messages gathered from 1, 700 sessions of conversations of 72 pairs of MSN Messenger users over a four month duration from June to September of 2005. The primary objective of <b>chat</b> <b>message</b> characterization is to understand the properties of chat messages for effective message analysis, such as message topic detection. Design/methodology/approach â From the study on <b>chat</b> <b>message</b> characteristics, an indicative term-based categorization approach for chat topic detection is proposed. In the proposed approach, different techniques such as sessionalisation of chat messages and extraction of features from icon texts and URLs are incorporated for message pre-processing. NaÄ±Â¨ve Bayes, Associative Classification, and Support Vector Machine are employed as classifiers for categorizing topics from chat sessions. Findings â Indicative term-based approach is superior to the traditional document frequency based approach, for feature selection in chat topic categorization. Originality/value â This paper studies the characteristics of chat messages and proposes an indicative term-based categorization approach for chat topic detection. ...|$|E
40|$|Chat {{has become}} a primary means of {{communication}} for military command and control decision makers. One {{of the most important}} aspects of military chat use is the ability to detect critical events quickly and accurately, a task often complicated by the large number of <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> received during actual operations. The primary goal of this research was to identify factors that enable chat watchstanders to more rapidly identify the critical information embedded in <b>chat</b> <b>messages.</b> These factors, which include message highlighting and chatroom layout, have the potential to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of information processing in fast-paced, information-rich operational environments. In this study, message highlighting techniques enabled users to detect 92 % of highlighted events, in comparison to 83 % of events that were not highlighted. These findings indicate that highlighting <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> confers significant performance advantages, especially in conjunction with associated factors, such as chatroom layout...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the personalized normalization of a multilingual chat system that supports chatting in user defined short-forms or abbreviations. One {{of the major}} challenges for multilingual chat realized through machine translation technology is the normalization of non-standard, self-created short-forms in the <b>chat</b> <b>message</b> to standard words before translation. Due {{to the lack of}} training data and the variations of short-forms used among different social communities, it is hard to normalize and translate chat messages if user uses vocabularies outside the training data and create short-forms freely. We develop a personalized chat normalizer for English and integrate it with a multilingual chat system, allowing user to create and use personalized short-forms in multilingual chat. ...|$|E

In this paper, we examine how brief moments of waiting during a personâs existing social conversations can be leveraged for second language practice, even if the conversation is exchanged in the first language. We present an instant messaging (IM) prototype, WaitChatter, that supports the notion of wait-learning by displaying contextually relevant foreign language vocabulary and micro-quizzes while the user awaits a response from her conversant. The foreign translations are displayed just-in-time {{in the context of}} the conversation to promote incidental learning. In a preliminary study of WaitChatter, we found that participants were able to integrate second language learning into their existing instant messaging activities, and that a particularly opportune time to embed foreign language elements may be immediately after the learner sends a <b>chat</b> <b>message...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Our {{research}} {{focused on}} the analysis of face-to-face (FTF) social interaction of groups working on maths problems using the GCC framework in traditional classroom setting. The GCC framework requires students to analyze maths problems with "solutions " that contained conceptual or oversight errors, critique these solutions with mathematical arguments, and finally fix the "solutions " collaboratively. In this study, the GCC framework is extended to the VMT chat medium which consists of a shared whiteboard, <b>chat</b> <b>message</b> box and tools for students to construct mathematical representations. The analyses of these sessions {{were based on the}} Collaboration Interaction Model (CIM), a model designed to study the knowledge construction process of complex chat transcripts. This paper will discuss how participants mediate shared understanding of mathematical representations and form mathematical arguments to construct new knowledge in the chat medium, using the CIM as the key instrument of analysis...|$|E
40|$|Recognizing {{activities}} in wide aerial/overhead imagery remains a challenging problem {{due in part}} to low-resolution video and cluttered scenes with a large number of moving objects. In the context of this research, we deal with two un-synchronized data sources collected in real-world operating scenarios: full-motion videos (FMV) and analyst call-outs (ACO) in the form of <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> (voice-to-text) made by a human watching the streamed FMV from an aerial plat-form. We present a multi-source multi-modal activity/event recognition system for surveillance applications, consisting of: (1) detecting and tracking multiple dynamic targets from a moving platform, (2) representing FMV target tracks and <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> as graphs of attributes, (3) associating FMV tracks and <b>chat</b> <b>messages</b> using a probabilistic graph-based matching approach, and (4) detecting spatial-temporal ac-tivity boundaries. We also present an activity pattern learn-ing framework which uses the multi-source associated data as training to index a large archive of FMV videos. Finally, we describe a multi-intelligence user interface for querying an index of activities of interest (AOIs) by movement type and geo-location, and for playing-back a summary of as-sociated text (ACO) and activity video segments of targets-of-interest (TOIs) (in both pixel and geo-coordinates). Such tools help the end-user to quickly search, browse, and pre-pare mission reports from multi-source data...|$|R
