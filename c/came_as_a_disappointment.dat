In a special session on 28 and 29 May 1933, a decision was {{to be made on}} the establishment of the Reichsliga as a professional league. Four weeks before that date, the session was cancelled, professionalism and Nazi ideology did not agree with each other. With the disappointing performance of the German team at the 1938 FIFA World Cup, the debate about a Reichsliga was reopened.

50|$|With the Hapsburgs in Spain {{as well as}} the Empire, {{the results}} of a papal {{election}} often depended on the strength -or lack thereof, of anti-Spain groups, and whether these could unite. Conclave protodeacon Cardinal Carlo de' Medici led a prestigious coalition of non-aligned Italian cardinal-princes connected to the Roman aristocracy. Urban's practice of concentrating power and curial appointments in his family and those related to his relatives <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disappointment</b> to those very cardinal-princes instrumental in his election.|$|E
50|$|The 6th Fatah {{conference was}} {{scheduled}} to be held in Bethlehem in August 2009. Holding the conference in the occupied territories <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disappointment</b> to many exiled Fatah leaders who will be unable to attend and who felt betrayed by this decision; Kaddoumi being one of those leaders. A few weeks before the conference, Kaddoumi accused Abbas of conspiring to kill Yasser Arafat and claimed that he has evidence for his involvement in a plot to poison Arafat. Abbas and his aides denied those allegations and accused Kaddoumi of inflaming fitna (divisions, internal strife).|$|E

The image is made up of 16 monitors arranged <b>as</b> <b>a</b> compact rectangular block at a distance of 30 centimetres from the wall - the screens facing the wall. A crackling sound is audible, automatically suggesting fire and a threat. Those who venture a peek behind the tableau will note that the monitors show 16 lighted fireplaces. The banality of this domestic idyll <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disappointment,</b> contrasting sharply with the spectacle of fascination and horror generated by the concealment of the reality.|$|R
5000|$|GameZone's Louis Bedigian, who {{reviewed}} the Xbox version, {{felt that the}} game did {{not take advantage of}} the system's graphical capabilities, and wrote, [...] "The cut scenes are more like storyboards than movie sequences. You don't get to see too many clips from the film, just stills taken from specific scenes. Why would they do this when all other movie-based games use real-time sequences, if not actual clips from the film? … This could <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disappointment</b> to players expecting to re-live the movie's magic through a game. During the gameplay you'll be entertained by amusing dialogue, but the still picture movie sequences are a bore." [...] Bedigian concluded that young children would enjoy the game, except for [...] "the frustration" [...] of its driving levels due to its controls, which he wrote [...] "aren't very accurate, causing a lot of unnecessary screw ups during that part of the game." ...|$|R

Nevertheless, he had been struggling with injuries earlier in the season and this may have cost him his place.|$|R
5000|$|Hartshorne {{played for}} Moxley White Star and Wolverhampton Wanderers, before joining Port Vale in June 1902. He {{was a regular}} {{throughout}} the 1902-03 season, scoring three goals in 28 Second Division appearances. He was sold to local rivals Stoke in April 1903 to ease Vale's financial troubles. At the Victoria Ground, Hartshorne played as a regular in the 1903-04 and 1904-05 campaigns, and was fast becoming a popular player with the supporters due to his 'hard yet controlled' tackling skill. He made 53 First Division appearances for the [...] "Potters". It <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disappointment</b> then when he was sold to Southampton {{in the summer of}} 1905.

5000|$|The {{standard}} conservative {{reading of}} section 28 <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disappointment</b> to feminists. As the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women noted, {{many of the}} feminists who pushed for having section 28 in the Charter hoped {{that it would not}} just be read literally but would also [...] "provide a social and historical context in which women's claims can be better understood"; it existed to remind judges charged with enforcing the Charter that women had been [...] "recognized as 'persons'" [...] and had gained more equality in marriage. This would, in turn, hopefully strengthen women's rights in section 15, which feminists felt was needed after having been disappointed by pre-Charter women's rights case law. In fact, in the British Columbia Court of Appeal case R. v. Red Hot Video (1985), some judges did refer to section 28 to say that laws against allegedly sexist obscenity could be upheld; section 28 could {{have a role to play}} in a section 1 test upholding laws against obscenity. This line of thinking, however, has had little influence since.|$|E
5000|$|One {{reason for}} the film's {{commercial}} failure may have been Tati's insistence that the film be limited to those theaters equipped with 70 mm projectors and stereophonic sound (he refused to provide a 35 mm version for smaller theaters). For another, audiences worldwide had come to love Tati's films for the character of M. Hulot; his reduction to an intermittent, occasionally supporting role in the new Tati film <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disappointment</b> to many (Tati himself lampooned the phenomenon in two scenes in Playtime, where a rain-coated pedestrian whose back is turned to the audience is mistakenly hailed as Hulot, the first being English and the second African-American). Others disliked its nearly plotless story line, while those who only saw a single showing frequently missed the intricate, sometimes simultaneous comic sight gags performed in the various group scenes. A final {{reason for the}} film's poor reception may have been its release date; while the film's satire of modern life may have been cutting-edge when first conceptualized in 1959, {{by the end of}} 1967 such themes were old-hat to film audiences.|$|E

40|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in the 1920 s, the continuing levels of emigration from Ireland <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disappointment</b> to many who believed that British colonialism had caused and perpetuated the emigration problem. Within this context, there was a need to explain emigration in ways that deflected blame away from the new state authorities. In this article, the author contributes to a gendered analysis of these shifting constructions of emigration. Drawing upon Irish newspapers of the period, she suggests that the figure of the 'emigrant girl' was central to post-colonial discourses on emigration. During the 1930 s, the emigration of thousands of young Irish women to English cities such as London sparked widespread comment and criticism. The Irish press and the Catholic hierarchy in particular propagated an image of these vulnerable young women as lost and alone in the big, bad cities of England. The author analyses {{the ways in which the}} 'emigrant girl' embodied specific representations of place, culture and gendered identity; the 'emigrant girl' embodied an Irishness marked by religion, culture and landscape. Through her transgression of physical, cultural and religious spaces, she encountered loneliness, danger and the risk of denationalisation...|$|E

It was with these feelings that officers and men set to work on the first job assigned, the construction of roads through what was to become the great American Aviation Field at Colombey. This lasted the rest of the year.|$|R

Cnut then sent Svein and Ælfgifu to Norway, with Ælfgifu ruling as regent on behalf of her fourteen-year-old son.

The difference is more a function of material than of the new album's relatively clean, calm, reflective mood. The lyrics on Marquee Moon were shot through with visionary surprises that never let up.

40|$|Angie Motshekga, the {{president}} of the Women�s League of the ruling African National Congress (ANC 2014), is reported to have said that �South Africa is not ready to have a female president [...] . � What is perturbing about her statement is the presupposition that South-African society perceives women as presently incapable of leading the country as president. Given the variety of literature on female empowerment in South Africa, Motshekga�s statement <b>comes</b> both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disappointment</b> and <b>a</b> disempowering assertion <b>as</b> it does not exhibit a clear attempt to address patriarchy. This article re-interprets the character of Athaliah in 2 Kings 11 and probes it for the empowering possibility that it offers the women of South Africa. It argues that Athaliah was a politically astute queen and that the scarcity of female rulers in ancient Israel confirms the patriarchal bias against women. Thus, drawing from the reconstructed character of Athaliah and from the leadership demonstrated by selected women politicians against a patriarchal paradigm that is part of African cultures, the article submits that the perception of women as capable of leading South Africa as president is justified. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: The present article partly responds to Angie Motshekga�s statement that �South Africa is not ready to have a female president [...] . � Thus, drawing from the insight in the fields of the Old Testament, social sciences and gender studies, this article submits that the perception that women are capable of leading South Africa as president is warranted. </p...|$|R
40|$|On 18 November 2014, Advocate General Bot {{delivered}} his {{opinion on the}} Spanish action against Regulation No. 1257 / 2012 on Unitary Patent Protection. Among other things, Spain claims that the Regulation is not capable of guaranteeing unitary patent protection as required by Article 118 (1) TFEU since, pursuant to the conflict-of-law rule contained in Article 5 (3), it leaves this question to the national law of the participating Member States. AG Bot rejected this claim by arguing that, under the EU principle of sincere cooperation, the participating Member States are under an obligation to ratify the Unified Patent Court (UPC) Agreement, which contains uniform rules on the scope of such patents. The legislative history shows {{that most of the}} substantive patent law provisions that were included in the Commission Proposal for the UPP Regulation were ultimately transferred to the UPC Agreement <b>as</b> part of <b>a</b> political compromise that attempts to exclude the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) for these rules. Hence, following the reasoning of AG Bot, the conflict-of-law rule of Article 5 (3) is not designed to solve a conflict of laws, but only aims to insulate the UPC Agreement against claims that its uniform substantive patent law provisions are nevertheless part of EU law and, therefore, ought to be interpreted by the CJEU. This, however, gives rise to three constitutional concerns that are not addressed by AG Bot, namely, (1) a conflict with the principle of democracy <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fundamental value of the Union, (2) a circumvention of the fundamental rights of the European Union, which would otherwise guide the interpretation of the substantive patent law provisions, and (3) a curtailment of effective judicial control <b>as</b> <b>an</b> expression of the rule of law. In sum, the opinion of AG Bot <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> clear <b>disappointment</b> and should not be followed by the CJEU...|$|R
50|$|In 1982 {{the company}} was {{approached}} by the Varlen Corporation of Illinois USA {{to discuss the matter}} of a licence agreement enabling Varlen to build the Vanguard locomotives in the United States. Numerous discussions were held over the following months. Varlen became very enthusiastic and were convinced of great potential for these machines in their home markets. An agreement was signed between Varlen and THR at Vickers House, Millbank, London on May 1982. Part of the agreement was for THR to supply one rebuilt Steelman locomotive (ex BSC) and two new locomotives for demonstration purposes. The new locos were to be redesigned to meet all the requirements of U.S. Railroads. In February 1983 the rebuilt and modified Steelman loco was shipped to the USA, followed in July by the first new machine, a much modified loco based on the Ministry of Defence 35 ton 0- 4-0.

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{increased}} use, also in training exercises, the Char D2s were largely worn {{out at this}} moment. The battalion eagerly awaited the replacement of their, at that time 44, old vehicles by the second production series. The decision in March to upgrade the existing tanks <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> severe <b>disappointment.</b> It implied {{that the number of}} operational vehicles would at first decline even further as they gradually were removed from the battalion strength to be rebuilt. On 26 April the situation deteriorated even further when the order came to split off one of the companies. It would on 7 May be turned into an autonomous tank company, the 345e CACC (Compagnie Autonome de Chars de Combat) under command of Captain Jean-Charles Idée, {{to be part of the}} CEFS (Corps Expeditionnaire Français de Scandinavie), the French Expeditionary Corps of Scandinavia, that had been built up during the winter to assist Finland against the USSR in the Winter War. It was now, Finland already having been defeated, redirected to assist Norway against the German invasion during Operation Weserübung. By drawing lots it was decided that the First Company (1/19 BCC) would be sent. The company would be equipped with fourteen tanks of the second production series, leaving its old tanks behind. This seemed to imply that the new vehicles would never be destined for 19e BCC, not even in a later phase. On 29 April the company received its replacement tanks, but these transpired to be, though brandnew, in a very poor mechanical condition and broke down almost immediately. The causes were never investigated; conforming to the pervading Fifth Column atmosphere of the day, the malfunctioning was not attributed to the structurally deficient quality control at Renault combined with a hasty acceptance procedure, but to sabotage. Soon however, the plan to send the company to Norway was cancelled as the reports of the previous winter clearly showed that the Char D2 was unsuited to snow conditions.|$|R
