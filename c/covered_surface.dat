5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light <b>covered</b> <b>surface,</b> and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
25|$|As a {{standard}} method for analysis, mass spectrometers have reached other planets and moons. Two {{were taken to}} Mars by the Viking program. In early 2005 the Cassini–Huygens mission delivered a specialized GC-MS instrument aboard the Huygens probe through the atmosphere of Titan, the largest moon of the planet Saturn. This instrument analyzed atmospheric samples along its descent trajectory {{and was able to}} vaporize and analyze samples of Titan's frozen, hydrocarbon <b>covered</b> <b>surface</b> once the probe had landed. These measurements compare the abundance of isotope(s) of each particle comparatively to earth's natural abundance. Also on board the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft was an ion and neutral mass spectrometer which had been taking measurements of Titan's atmospheric composition as well as the composition of Enceladus' plumes. A Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer mass spectrometer was carried by the Mars Phoenix Lander launched in 2007.|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{distillate}} {{water from a}} solar still depends on different parameters. The evaporative surface area and glass cover temperature are the most effective parameters. Increasing the surface area or decreasing the cover temperature will enhance the distillate output. In this work, a weir concave type solar still with four glass <b>cover</b> <b>surfaces</b> is studied experimentally. The main advantage of using four glass <b>cover</b> <b>surface</b> {{is to increase the}} amount of solar radiation falling on the evaporative surface. Most of the day time, there is a temperature difference between the four still glass sides and the evaporative surface which allow more vapor to condensate on the lower glass <b>cover</b> <b>surface.</b> Results have shown that the average distillate productivity during the day time is approximately 4 L/m 2 with a system efficiency of 0. 38 at solar noon. It is higher than the conventional type solar still...|$|R

60|$|In all {{the many}} {{observed}} cases of soft castings blown to leeward, {{this had been}} effected by strong winds accompanied by rain. As such winds in England generally blow {{from the south and}} south-west, earth must on the whole tend to travel over our fields in a north and north-east direction. This fact is interesting, because it might be thought that none could be removed from a level, grass- <b>covered</b> <b>surface</b> by any means. In thick and level woods, protected from the wind, castings will never be removed as long as the wood lasts; and mould will here tend to accumulate to the depth at which worms can work. I tried to procure evidence as to how much mould is blown, whilst in the state of castings, by our wet southern gales to the north-east, over open and flat land, by looking {{to the level of the}} surface on opposite sides of old trees and hedge-rows; but I failed owing to the unequal growth of the roots of trees and to most pasture-land having been formerly ploughed.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} basic {{model of the}} time {{variation}} of geomagnetic activity and show that the model predicts, with decreasing levels of exactitude, the time variation of the ~ 27 day period components of geomagnetic aa index, cloud <b>cover</b> and <b>surface</b> temperature during several years near solar cycle minima. We interpret this as indicating {{that there is a}} connection between the ~ 27 day variation of geomagnetic activity and the ~ 27 day variations of cloud <b>cover</b> and <b>surface</b> temperature with the decreasing correlations between model variation and aa index, cloud <b>cover</b> and <b>surface</b> temperature variation due to delays and phase shifts between the three variables some of which are obvious, such as the 180 degree seasonal phase shift between cloud <b>cover</b> and <b>surface</b> temperature, and others less certain.
