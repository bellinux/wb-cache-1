50|$|The Brda {{is part of}} the Odra-Vistula waterway, {{connecting}} {{these two}} rivers via the Warta and Noteć Rivers and the Bydgoszcz Canalsince end of the 18th century. The waterway is navigable for modest barges (of <b>CEMT</b> <b>Class</b> II) but with a limited draught.|$|E
50|$|The Oder is navigable over a {{large part}} of its total length, as far {{upstream}} as the town of Koźle, where the river connects to the Gliwice Canal. The upstream part of the river is canalized and permits larger barges (up to <b>CEMT</b> <b>Class</b> IV) to navigate between the industrial sites around the Wrocław area.|$|E
50|$|Both locks have {{a length}} of 125 meters, a width of 12.5 meters and meet the Va {{requirements}} of the <b>CEMT</b> <b>Class</b> (i.e. each is suitable for a large Rhine river-barge). Special waterproof concrete {{was used for the}} locks, as they are designed to operate without the need for maintenance resulting from surface wear. The completed project cost €55 million before tax.|$|E
40|$|The Thua Thien-Hue province, and {{especially}} {{the area around the}} city of Hue, is characterized by a small distance between mountains in the west and a flat coast with a coastal barrier in the east. The largest river in the area, the Huong river, flows through the city of Hue and is used for fishery, tourism, sand mining, sewage system and trashcan. The city of Hue is a touristic city and holds an old Imperial City, a quite old sewage system and a lot of agricultural activity in the surroundings, especially the rice paddies around and the fishery in the Cau Hai lagoon. Due to the short distance between mountains and coast, in combination with a distinct wet and dry season and high average precipitation rates, a lot of challenges concerning water related problems can be identified in the Hue area. For the Water Resources University in Hanoi 22 of those problems (cases) are indicated, to provide future students a topic for their graduation work and presented in the Cases Report by this project group. The selection of cases is performed by talking to different experts in the fields of Disaster Management, Coastal Engineering and Water Management; talking to students of the university and by visiting the actual project area. In this field visit most of the case locations are visited {{to get a better view}} on the current state of the problem. All observations are stated in the Field Work Report of this project group. Although the cases are presented as individual problems, a lot of relations between the problems exist e. g. salt intrusion is influenced by reservoir regulation, while the stability of the inlets is related to the sediment balance of the area. These relations are used to emphasize the need for an integral and multidisciplinary approach towards the individual cases: every proposed solution needs to take into account the impact on other processes in the area. The cases 'Reservoirs and Dams' and 'Stability of the Thuan An inlet' are elaborated to function as a reference for future students, by applying the steps of the Engineering Process. There are four major dams in the area around the city of Hue, each with their own regulation scheme. Another dam, the Ta Trach dam, is currently being constructed. The Binh Dien dam, which is already in operation since 2009, and the Ta Trach dam have a major influence on the upstream discharge of the Huong river and require complex regulation schemes. This is enhanced due to the parallel positon of the dams: they are located in two different branches of the Huong river. The problems are complex due to conflicting interests from several stakeholders: most reservoirs are used for waterpower generation, which conflicts with for example flood control and water supply purposes. In 2009 this conflicting interests led to a severe flooding in Hue, when the Binh Dien reservoir needed emergency discharges to reassure the safety of the dam itself. In this research four main functions have been assigned to the Binh Dien and Ta Trach dams; hydropower generation, flood control, water supply and regulation of salt intrusion in the Huong river mouth. From these functions several requirements regarding the reservoir discharge over time have been obtained from a literature study. The requirements have been applied to both dams in different scenarios, after which some general conclusions could be stated. It appeared that the Binh Dien cannot fulfil the requirements on its own, but that with the future Ta Trach dam in operation enough capacity will be available for the water supply and salt intrusion requirements. With the combined reservoirs even more hydropower could be generated than currently without the Ta Trach dam. However, the flood control requirement appears to have major conflicts with respect to other main function requirements, and will be difficult to properly implement in reality without making concessions in the other functions. In history, the Thuan An inlet has always been a morphologically active inlet, with several openings and closures. The coast surrounding the inlet is a wave dominated coast; and while the inlet is accreting during dry season, it 'flushes' during the wet season. In 2012 several breakwaters and jetties have been built to stabilize the inlet, with limited success due to bad placement of the structures as a whole and failing armour units. For this case the stabilizing criteria are based on the guarantee that a <b>CEMT</b> III <b>class</b> vessel can navigate through the inlet for the coming 30 years. Three solutions are proposed: dredging, extending the current south breakwater and a combination of the previous two. To assess the solutions use is made of the process based model Delft 3 D. The grid of the model is provided by Lam (2007), and by applying wave- and wind conditions, sediment concentrations and discharge characteristics, a prediction towards the future behaviour could be made. To reduce the time to run the model to one overnight computation, input reduction and morphological factors are applied. From the scenarios dredging seems to be the most appropriate solution, in which the maximum dredging interval (before the inlet becomes unnavigable) is 3 years. Beside the fact that dredging does not need new construction works, it is also the most flexible towards extreme accretion due to extreme weather events. This last reason lead to an advised dredging interval of one year, although the total amount of dredged material in 30 years is larger than dredging every 3 years (17. 7 Mm 3 versus 13. 8 Mm 3), it provides the highest flexibility. However, before implementing the solution further research should be performed by improving the quality and accuracy of the model. This is possible by reducing the input reduction, apply a lower morphological factor and by doing longer computations in order to oversee the full effects. Finally, the applied model used a too coarse grid near the shoreline to analyse the precise effects on the coastal area, therefore the grid size near the shore should be reduced.

50|$|The Vistula is navigable {{from the}} Baltic Sea to Bydgoszcz (where the Bydgoszcz Canal joins the river). The Vistula can {{accommodate}} modest river vessels of <b>CEMT</b> <b>class</b> II. Farther upstream the river depth lessens. Although a project was undertaken {{to increase the}} traffic-carrying capacity of the river upstream of Warsaw by building a number of locks in and around Kraków, this project was not extended further, so that navigability of the Vistula remains limited. The potential of the river would increase considerably if a restoration of the East-West connection via the Narew - Bug - Mukhovets - Pripyat - Dnieper waterways were considered. The shifting economic importance of parts of Europe may make this option more likely.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{railroads and}} {{highways}} were developed, the Rhône {{was an important}} inland trade and transportation route, connecting the cities of Arles, Avignon, Valence, Vienne and Lyon to the Mediterranean ports of Fos-sur-Mer, Marseille and Sète. Travelling down the Rhône by barge would take three weeks. By motorized vessel, the trip now takes only three days. The Rhône is classified as a Class V waterway {{from the mouth of}} the Saône to the sea. The Saône, which is also canalized, connects the Rhône ports to the cities of Villefranche-sur-Saône, Mâcon and Chalon-sur-Saône. Smaller vessels (up to <b>CEMT</b> <b>class</b> I) can travel further northwest, north and northeast via the Centre-Loire-Briare and Loing Canals to the Seine, via the Canal de la Marne à la Saône (recently often called the [...] "Canal entre Champagne et Bourgogne") to the Marne, via the Canal des Vosges (formerly called the [...] "Canal de l'Est - Branche Sud") to the Moselle and via the Canal du Rhône au Rhin to the Rhine.|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands a large variety {{exists in}} the used widths of inland port entrances. In addition, {{multiple}} entrance layouts are applied. Currently, guidelines are missing {{for the design of}} inland port entrances along flowing waters with flow velocities larger than 0. 5 m/s. A more generic insight into the minimum required nautical safe entrance width and most efficient entrance layout can reduce the design costs and time. The objective of this research was to find the minimum required nautical safe entrance width for generic situations for inland ports along flowing waters in non-tidal areas. To find this minimum safe entrance width, the most efficient entrance layout was determined. The influence of different design parameters was studied to provide the most efficient situation. Moreover, an insight into the influence of these parameters was needed to determine the effect on the most efficient situation when changing these parameters. A fast-time simulation study was chosen to analyse the influence of different design parameters on the entrance width. A rectangular entrance layout and a mathematical ship model comparable with a loaded <b>CEMT</b> <b>class</b> Va ship were used. Flow velocities between 1. 0 and 2. 5 m/s were taken into account. Moreover, the influence of the waterway width, entrance width, length and angle were analysed with the simulation study. The fast-time simulation program SHIPMA was used to perform the simulation study. As a result of the simulation study, {{it was found that the}} most efficient entrance angle is 120 degrees. Note that this is an entrance orientation in downstream direction. Also from a viewpoint of minimising siltation, this angle is more favourable than an angle of 90 degrees or smaller. The required entrance widths for arrivals sailing upstream and manoeuvring forward into the port are circa 55 and 80 meters, for flow velocities of respectively 1. 0 and 2. 5 m/s. For the determined most efficient layout, the forward manoeuvres into the port when sailing downstream were replaced by backward manoeuvres. For these backward manoeuvres the required entrance widths are circa 70 and 90 meters, for flow velocities of respectively 1. 0 and 2. 0 m/s. A linear relation was observed between the flow velocity and the required entrance width. For the most efficient entrance layout, it was found that the sensitivity of the entrance length, width and angle was small. These results are only valid for an available waterway width larger than 90 meters. For smaller waterway widths additional research is required. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the limitations of the SHIPMA model also apply for the acquired research results. The most important limitation is that human interference was not included in this research. Besides, only a limited amount of design parameters was included in the simulation study. Additional research is required to study the influence of other design parameters on the required entrance width...|$|E
