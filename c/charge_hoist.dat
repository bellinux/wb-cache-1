Tom Hughes and his {{colleague}} had already created a fire break by ejecting some undamaged fuel cartridges from around the blaze, and Tom Tuohy suggested trying to eject some from the heart of the fire by bludgeoning the melted cartridges through the reactor and into the cooling pond behind it with scaffolding poles. This proved impossible and the fuel rods refused to budge, no matter how much force was applied. The poles were withdrawn with their ends red hot; one returned dripping molten metal. Hughes knew this had to be molten irradiated uranium, causing serious radiation problems on the <b>charge</b> <b>hoist</b> itself.|$|E

Mackinnon brought with him his team of five sailors, a Yeoman of Signals, two telegraphists and two young bunting tossers (i.e. sailors in <b>charge</b> of <b>hoisting</b> signal flags). The signals crew was important as the convoys maintained radio silence to avoid detection by the German navy.|$|R

He was released after almost one year.|$|R
50|$|However, the Mark VII {{mounting}} {{appeared in}} the 1930s and in 1939 a simplified version, Mark IX. Both were hydraulically powered and the platform was enclosed in a roofed gun house with three sides (and rear with Mark IX). The hydraulics meant that both projectile and propelling <b>charge</b> could be <b>hoisted</b> in a single load. With Mark VII and IX the maximum elevation was increased to 35 degrees to give a maximum range of 36,700 yards.|$|R

50|$|The Mounting Barbette Mark V (the {{original}} mounting with Mark IX and X guns) gave {{a maximum}} elevation of 15 degrees, and maximum range of 21,000 yards. This and some modified to Mark VI (30 degrees and 29,500 yards) were manually powered, the projectile and propelling <b>charge</b> were manually <b>hoisted</b> to loading level, the projectile manually loaded and rammed, and traverse and elevation were by handwheels. There was an elevated platform around the breech {{area for the}} gun detachment commander (No 1) and some detachment members, and a gun shield to the front. The ordnance and mounting together weighed some 125 tons, they were well balanced and the handwheels needed very little effort to move the gun.|$|R
5|$|During the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915, the aftermost barbette of the German {{flagship}} Seydlitz {{was struck}} by a British 13.5-inch shell from HMS Lion. The shell did not penetrate the barbette, but it dislodged a piece of the barbette armour that allowed the flame from the shell's detonation to enter the barbette. The propellant <b>charges</b> being <b>hoisted</b> upwards were ignited, and the fireball flashed up into the turret and down into the magazine, setting fire to charges removed from their brass cartridge cases. The gun crew tried to escape into the next turret, which allowed the flash to spread into that turret as well, killing the crews of both turrets. Seydlitz was saved from near-certain destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines, which had been effected by Wilhelm Heidkamp. This near-disaster was due to the way that ammunition handling was arranged and was common to both German and British battleships and battlecruisers, but the lighter protection on the latter made them more vulnerable to the turret or barbette being penetrated. The Germans learned from investigating the damaged Seydlitz and instituted measures to ensure that ammunition handling minimised any possible exposure to flash.|$|R

All of this greatly sped up the process of steelmaking, and allowed the production of vastly larger quantities of the product. As the mills expanded, the labor force grew rapidly, especially with less skilled workers. In response, the more-skilled union members reacted with a strike designed to protect their historic position.|$|R

40|$|For an {{efficient}} mining operation, {{it is essential}} to have as much information as possible aboutthe ore to be excavated and the rock masses surrounding the ore. Geological information andthe content and distribution of extractable minerals, are central concerns for long term mineplanning. However, for mine stability and production scheduling, the mechanical conditionsof ore and side rock are also very important. The underground mining process normallyconsists of a number of unit operations, such as drilling, <b>charging,</b> blasting, loading,transportation, <b>hoisting</b> etc., linked in a production chain. The quality of the initial operations(drilling, charging and blasting) normally defines the pre-conditions for the following loadingand transportation processes in the mine. The ability to fully charge holes as planned has beenidentified as one of the major obstacles for smooth fragmentation. Course or unevenfragmentation will, for example, significantly affect the loading and transportation efficiencyin the downstream production chain. Earlier studies in LKAB’s Malmberget mine have shown that the chargeability is on averagearound 90 %. However, individual levels can have an average chargeability of only 70 % andindividual rings, at those levels, can suffer from chargeability as low as 50 %. A significantpart of these problems has its origin in geo-mechanical problems in the rock mass. Therefore,detailed knowledge of the rock mass condition surrounding the boreholes is essential toimprove the planning and execution of the charging works in a mine and to improve overallfragmentation and production efficiency. The focus of this thesis is therefore to define and evaluate geo-mechanical features in thedrilled rock mass effecting chargeability, and to evaluate drill monitoring technique for theassessment of rock mass quality and its effects on borehole’s chargeability using hydraulic In-The-Hole (ITH) percussive drilling. The research is based on literature review, drill-monitoring data, borehole filming, on-lineproduction database and monitoring of charging operation. Statistical methods are used toanalyse drill data. The data have been collected from LKAB’s underground mine inMalmberget, Sweden. Several rock mass conditions including caving, shearing, deformation, fracturing, cavities,solid rock, etc., have been identified during filming of 361 production boreholes. Measurement While Drilling (MWD) technique has been used to assess the quality of thepenetrated rock mass. In order to do so, a detailed analysis of the drilling system and thedrilling control including how monitored parameters relate {{to each other and to}} the penetratedrock mass conditions, has been performed. The results show that the MWD data containpronounced hole length dependent trends, both linear and step-wise linear, for mostparameters. By combining the borehole filming and the analyses of monitored drillparameters, the drilling responds to each geo-mechanical features in the rock mass is furtherdemonstrated. High correlation has been found between the geo-mechanical rock properties(fractures, cavities, solid rocks, etc.,), and the registered drilling system’s response. Theanalyses show that the responses from the drill monitoring system can distinguish between solid rock, fracture zone, cavity and cave-in. Based on the correlation between the registereddrilling system’s responses and the geo-mechanical features, a geo-mechanical model isdeveloped to assess the borehole chargeability. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) isperformed to model this relationship. The developed model can distinguish fans, or parts offans, with solid, non-fractured rocks where no chargeability problems can be expected, fromfans, or part of fans, with fractures, cavities or cave-in risks, where chargeability problemscan be expected. The model shows high potential for identifying charging problems in theborehole, and has been verified and validated by following an actual charging operation in thereal production environment...|$|R
