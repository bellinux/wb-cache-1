50|$|The barracks {{were built}} as a depot for the Foot Guards regiments in 1877. The {{construction}} reflected a more humane style of barrack design {{in the aftermath of}} the Crimean War; the barrack blocks included better sanitation as well as cross-ventilation and <b>cross-lighting</b> of sleeping facilities for the first time. A local public house (the Caterham Arms) which was frequented by soldiers was targeted by the IRA with a bomb injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers in August 1975. The barracks were closed in 1995 and the site was redeveloped for housing using urban village principles after planning consent was given in June 1990.|$|E
5000|$|Hood and Andr√© Fouilhoux's 1924 black American Radiator Building in New York {{was used}} for {{experimentation}} with illumination. Hood wrote in 1930:We tried multi-colored revolving lights and produced at one time {{the effect of the}} building's being on fire. We threw spots of light on jets of steam rising out of the smokestack. Then again, with moving lights, we had the whole top of the building waving like a tree in a strong wind. With <b>cross-lighting</b> [...] [...] [...] the most unusual cubistic patterns were developed. The lighting designer, Bassett Jones, argued for a lighting scheme using rose, scarlet, and amber color screens:My mental picture of this building at night would result from pouring over the structure a vast barrel of spectral hued incandescent material that streams down the perpendicular surfaces, cooling as it falls, and, like glowing molten lava, collects in every recess and behind every parapet. The building was eventually illuminated in amber. Even a critic who found the building [...] "theatrical to a degree that opens it to a charge of vulgarity" [...] said that [...] "at night, when [...] [...] [...] the gilded upper portion seems miraculously suspended one and two hundred feet in the air, the design has a dreamlike beauty." [...] Georgia O'Keeffe made a famous painting of it, American Radiator - Night (1927) in which she simplified the architecture and made the lighting white, and The American Architect called the illumination [...] "one of the sights of the city[...] [...] [...] The vast throngs that crowd this district at night are blocking traffic".|$|E
40|$|Double {{and triple}} acrostics occupy an {{important}} {{niche in the}} history of word puzzles, it is generally recognized that they were the predecessors to the crossword puzzle. For those unfamiliar with the genre, a double acrostic consists of clues for a sequence of words (the <b>cross-lights)</b> to be written in a list, plus two clues to the words spelled out by the first and last letters of the <b>cross-lights</b> (the uprights). In a triple acrostic a third upright is formed out of interior letters in the <b>cross-lights.</b> The <b>cross-lights</b> may consist of words of varying lengths, but the uprights are obviously constrained to have exactly as many letters as there are <b>cross-lights...</b>|$|R
60|$|Pierre turned; {{and in the}} flashing, sinister, evil <b>cross-lights</b> of a druggist's window, his eye {{caught the}} person of a wonderfully beautifully-featured girl; scarlet-cheeked, glaringly-arrayed, and of a figure all natural grace but unnatural vivacity. Her whole form, however, was horribly lit by the green and yellow rays from the druggist's.|$|R
60|$|In me, many worthies recline, and converse. I list to St. Paul who argues {{the doubts}} of Montaigne; Julian the Apostate cross-questions Augustine; and Thomas-a-Kempis unrolls his old black letters {{for all to}} decipher. Zeno murmurs maxims beneath the hoarse shout of Democritus; and though Democritus laugh loud and long, and the sneer of Pyrrho be seen; yet, divine Plato, and Proclus, and, Verulam are of my counsel; and Zoroaster whispered me before I was born. I walk {{a world that is}} mine; and enter many nations, as Mingo Park rested in African cots; I am served like Bajazet: Bacchus my butler, Virgil my minstrel, Philip Sidney my page. My memory is a life beyond birth; my memory, my library of the Vatican, its alcoves all endless perspectives, eve-tinted by <b>cross-lights</b> from Middle-Age oriels.|$|R
60|$|A {{light breeze}} was seeking the heated flat and river, and thrilling the leaves around {{him with the}} strong {{vitality}} of the forest. The vibrating <b>cross-lights</b> and tremulous chequers of shade cast by the stirred foliage seemed to weave a fantastic net around him as he walked. The quaint odors of certain woodland herbs known to his scholars, and religiously kept in their desks, or left like votive offerings {{on the threshold of}} the school-house, recalled all the primitive simplicity and delicious wildness of the little temple he had left. Even in the mischievous glances of evasive squirrels and the moist eyes of the contemplative rabbits there were faint suggestions of some of his own truants. The woods were trembling with gentle memories of the independence he had always known here--of that sweet and grave retreat now so ridiculously invaded.|$|R
5000|$|Adler was {{concerned}} with the overcoming of the superiority/inferiority dynamic {{and was one of}} the first psychotherapists to discard the analytic couch in favor of two chairs. This allows the clinician and patient to sit together more or less as equals. Clinically, Adler's methods are not limited to treatment after-the-fact but extend to the realm of prevention by preempting future problems in the child. Prevention strategies include encouraging and promoting social interest, belonging, and a cultural shift within families and communities that leads to the eradication of pampering and neglect (especially corporal punishment). Adler's popularity was related to the comparative optimism and comprehensibility of his ideas. He often wrote for the lay public. Adler always retained a pragmatic approach that was task-oriented. These [...] "Life tasks" [...] are occupation/work, society/friendship, and love/sexuality. Their success depends on cooperation. The tasks of life are not to be considered in isolation since, as Adler famously commented, [...] "they all throw <b>cross-lights</b> on one another".|$|R
60|$|As for the catafalque, {{the best}} that I can say for {{it is that it}} is really a noble and imposing-looking edifice, with tall pillars {{supporting}} a grand dome, with innumerable escutcheons, standards, and allusions military and funereal. A great eagle of course tops the whole: tripods burning spirits of wine stand round this kind of dead man's throne, and as we saw it (by peering over the heads of our neighbors in the front rank), it looked, {{in the midst of the}} black concave, and under the effect of half a thousand flashing <b>cross-lights,</b> properly grand and tall. The effect of the whole chapel, however (to speak the jargon of the painting-room), was spoiled by being CUT UP: there were too many objects for the eye to rest upon: the ten thousand wax-candles, for instance, in their numberless twinkling chandeliers, the raw tranchant colors of the new banners, wreaths, bees, N's, and other emblems dotting the place all over, and incessantly puzzling, or rather BOTHERING the beholder.|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend, {{you will}} be luckier than I, if, after ten years, not to say, in a sense, twenty years, thirty years, of reading and rummaging in those sad Prussian Books, ancient and new (which often are laudably authentic, too, and exact as to details), you can gather any {{character}} whatever of Friedrich, in any period of his life, or conceive him as a Human Entity at all! It is strange, after such thousand-fold writing, but it is true, his History is considerably unintelligible to mankind at this hour; left chaotic, enigmatic, in a good many points,--the military part of it alone being brought to clearness, and rendered fairly conceivable and credible to those who will study. And as to the Man himself, or what his real Physiognomy can have been--! Well, it must be owned few men were of such RAPIDITY of face and aspect; so difficult to seize the features of. In his action, too, there was such rapidity, such secrecy, suddenness: a man {{that could not be}} read, even by the candid, except as in flashes of lightning. And then the anger of by-standers, uncandid, who got hurt by him; the hasty malevolences, the stupidities, the opacities: enough, in modern times, what is saying much, perhaps no man's motives, intentions, and procedure have been more belied, misunderstood, misrepresented, during his life. Nor, I think, since that, have many men fared worse, by the Limner or Biographic class, the favorable to him and the unfavorable; or been so smeared of and blotched of, and reduced to a mere blur and dazzlement of <b>cross-lights,</b> incoherences, incredibilities, in which nothing, {{not so much as a}} human nose, is clearly discernible by way of feature!"--Courage, reader, nevertheless; on the above terms let us march according to promise.|$|R
60|$|Natural talk, like ploughing, {{should turn}} {{up a large}} surface of life, rather than dig mines into {{geological}} strata. Masses of experience, anecdote, incident, <b>cross-lights,</b> quotation, historical instances, the whole flotsam and jetsam of two minds forced in and in upon the matter in hand from every point of the compass, and from every degree of mental elevation and abasement--these are the material with which talk is fortified, the food on which the talkers thrive. Such argument as is proper to the exercise should still be brief and seizing. Talk should proceed by instances; by the apposite, not the expository. It should keep close {{along the lines of}} humanity, near the bosoms and businesses of men, at the level where history, fiction and experience intersect and illuminate each other. I am I, and You are You, with all my heart; but conceive how these lean propositions change and brighten when, instead of words, the actual you and I sit cheek by jowl, the spirit housed in the live body, and the very clothes uttering voices to corroborate the story in the face. Not less surprising is the change when we leave off to speak of generalities--the bad, the good, the miser, and all the characters of Theophrastus[8]--and call up other men, by anecdote or instance, in their very trick and feature; or trading on a common knowledge, toss each other famous names, still glowing with the hues of life. Communication is no longer by words, but by the instancing of whole biographies, epics, systems of philosophy, and epochs of history, in bulk. That which is understood excels that which is spoken in quantity and quality alike; ideas thus figured and personified, change hands, as we may say, like coin; and the speakers imply without effort the most obscure and intricate thoughts. Strangers who have a large common ground of reading will, for this reason, come the sooner to the grapple of genuine converse. If they know Othello and Napoleon, Consuelo and Clarissa Harlowe, Vautrin and Steenie Steenson,[9] they can leave generalities and begin at once to speak by figures.|$|R
6000|$|Kate had, {{for her new}} friend's eyes, the {{extraordinary}} and attaching property of appearing at a given moment to show as a beautiful stranger, to cut her connections and lose her identity, letting the imagination for the time make what it would of them--make her merely a person striking from afar, more and more pleasing as one watched, but who was above all a subject for curiosity. Nothing could have given her, as a party to a relation, a greater freshness than this sense--which sprang up at its own hours--of being as curious about her as if one hadn't known her. It had sprung up, we have gathered, as soon as Milly had seen her after hearing from Mrs. Stringham of her knowledge of Merton Densher; she had looked then other and, as Milly knew the real critical mind would call it, more objective; and our young woman had foreseen it of her, on the spot, that she would often look so again. It was exactly {{what she was doing}} this afternoon; and Milly, who had amusements of thought that were like the secrecies of a little girl playing with dolls when conventionally [...] "too big," [...] could almost settle to the game of what one would suppose her, how one would place her, if one didn't know her. She became thus, intermittently, a figure conditioned only by the great facts of aspect, a figure to be waited for, named and fitted. This was doubtless but a way of feeling that it was of her essence to be peculiarly what the occasion, whatever it might be, demanded when its demand was highest. There were probably ways enough, on these lines, for such a consciousness; another of them would be, for instance, to say that she was made for great social uses. Milly was not wholly sure that she herself knew what great social uses might be--unless, as a good example, exerting just that sort of glamour in just that sort of frame were one of them: she would have fallen back on knowing sufficiently that they existed at all events for her friend. It imputed a primness, all round, to be reduced but to saying, by way of a translation of one's amusement, that she was always so right--since that, too often, was what the insupportables themselves were; yet it was, in overflow to Aunt Maud, what she had to content herself withal--save for the lame enhancement of saying she was lovely. It served, all the same, the purpose, strengthened the bond that for the time held the two ladies together, distilled in short its drop of rose-colour for Mrs. Lowder's own view. That was really the view Milly had, for {{most of the rest of}} the occasion, to give herself to immediately taking in; but it didn't prevent the continued play of those swift <b>cross-lights,</b> odd beguilements of the mind, at which we have already glanced.|$|R
6000|$|A {{little more}} than an hour after this he stood in the parlour of Doctor Tarrant's {{suburban}} residence, in Monadnoc Place. He had induced a juvenile maid-servant, by an appeal somewhat impassioned, to let the ladies know that he was there; and she had returned, after a long absence, to say that Miss Tarrant would come down to him in a little while. He possessed himself, according to his wont, of the nearest book (it lay on the table, with an old magazine and a little japanned tray containing Tarrant's professional cards--his denomination as a mesmeric healer), and spent ten minutes in turning it over. It was a biography of Mrs. Ada T. P. Foat, the celebrated trance-lecturer, and was embellished by a portrait representing the lady with a surprised expression and innumerable ringlets. Ransom said to himself, after reading a few pages, that much ridicule had been cast upon Southern literature; but if that was a fair specimen of Northern!--and he threw it back upon the table with a gesture almost as contemptuous as if he had not known perfectly, after so long a residence in the North, that it was not, while he wondered whether this was the sort of thing Miss Tarrant had been brought up on. There was no other book to be seen, and he remembered to have read the magazine; so there was finally nothing for him, as the occupants of the house failed still to appear, but to stare before him, into the bright, bare, common little room, which was so hot that he wished to open a window, and of which an ugly, undraped <b>cross-light</b> seemed to have taken upon itself to reveal the poverty. Ransom, as I have mentioned, had not a high standard of comfort and noticed little, usually, how people's houses were furnished--it was only when they were very pretty that he observed; but what he saw while he waited at Doctor Tarrant's made him say to himself that it was no wonder Verena liked better to live with Olive Chancellor. He even began to wonder whether it were for the sake of that superior softness she had cultivated Miss Chancellor's favour, and whether Mrs. Luna had been right about her being mercenary and insincere. So many minutes elapsed before she appeared that he had time to remember he really knew nothing to the contrary, as well as to consider the oddity (so great when one did consider it) of his coming out to Cambridge to see her, when he had only a few hours in Boston to spare, {{a year and a half}} after she had given him her very casual invitation. She had not refused to receive him, at any rate; she was free to, if it didn't please her. And not only this, but she was apparently making herself fine in his honour, inasmuch as he heard a rapid footstep move to and fro above his head, and even, through the slightness which in Monadnoc Place did service for an upper floor, the sound of drawers and presses opened and closed. Some one was [...] "flying round," [...] as they said in Mississippi. At last the stairs creaked under a light tread, and the next moment a brilliant person came into the room.|$|R
