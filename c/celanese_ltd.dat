5000|$|The {{origins of}} the company lie with two {{brothers}}, Henri and Camille Dreyfus. In 1912, they set up [...] "Cellonit Gesellschaft Dreyfus and Co" [...] in Basel, Switzerland. In 1916, the brothers were invited to live in Britain by the British Government, to produce their recently developed cellulose acetate dope for the war effort; the canvas skins of aircraft of the time were sealed and made taut with nitrocellulose dope, which was easily ignited by bullets. They developed the necessary plant and [...] "British Cellulose and Chemical Manufacturing Co" [...] was registered on March 18, 1916. The British Government patented the process developed by Henri Dreyfus, which lowered the costs of acetic anhydride production, an important reagent {{in the production of}} cellulose acetate. At the end of World War I, the British Government cancelled all contracts and the company changed to produce acetate fibres. In 1923 the company name was changed to British <b>Celanese</b> <b>Ltd,</b> a contraction of cellulose and ease. Softer and stronger, as well as being cheaper to produce than other fabrics used at the time such as satin or taffeta, Celanese was used in the production of garments.|$|E
30|$|Commercial PA 66 (Mw = 18, 000 mg/ml) {{in pellet}} forms was {{supplied}} by <b>Celanese</b> Chemicals UK <b>Ltd.</b> (Stallingborough, UK). Gold chloride (HAuCl 4), formic acid (HCOOH) and sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd. (Dorset, England, UK) {{and used as}} received.|$|R
50|$|Derwent {{power station}} was {{originally}} built for Courtaulds Chemicals and was opened on June 1, 1995 by Tim Eggar, the Energy Secretary. It was owned 17.5% by Courtaulds, 33% by Mission Energy Company (UK) Ltd, and 49.5% by Southern Electric Power Generation ({{now owned by}} Scottish and Southern Energy). The nearby works are now owned by Accordis. The 33% stake of Mission Energy was sold to International Power. The other stakes are now owned by Mitsui. Near to the plant is <b>Celanese</b> Acetates <b>Ltd,</b> {{which used to be}} British Celanese, which does not have any ownership of the power station. The textiles site was built in 1916 to provide waterproofing for aircraft wings, known as British Cellulose & Chemical Manufacturing and made cellulose acetate and Acetic anhydride. This came from techniques invented by the Swiss chemist, Henri Dreyfus. British Celanese and Courtaulds merged in 1957. Courtaulds was bought by Sara Lee in 2000 following a hostile takeover. The station currently trades as Derwent Cogeneration Ltd.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant at}} 5275 Bath Road {{was built on}} a 70-acre site near Napanee, in Millhaven, Lennox and Addington County, Ontario, {{on the north shore}} of Lake Ontario. The project was {{initiated}} by Canadian Industries (1954) Limited, a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) Limited, of Great Britain. Since then, the plant changed ownership several times and underwent a handful of expansions. Before Invista bought the 75-hectare site on Lake Ontario in 2004, it was owned by ICI of Canada Ltd., Canadian Industries Limited, Millhaven Fibres <b>Ltd.,</b> <b>Celanese</b> Canada, Hoechst, and KoSa at various points in its 55-year history.|$|R
