Quentin uncovers Krueger's hidden room and the evidence that proves Krueger was in fact abusing all of the children; they realize that Krueger actually wants revenge on them for telling the truth. Nancy decides the only way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger then goes after Nancy, and explains that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would {{no longer be able to}} wake up. While Nancy struggles with Krueger, Quentin uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy who pulls Krueger into reality. With Krueger distracted by Quentin, Nancy uses a broken paper <b>cutter</b> <b>blade</b> to cut Krueger's gloved hand off, and then slice his throat.

5000|$|In the 2010 remake, Nancy's {{last name}} is changed to [...] "Holbrook", portrayed by Rooney Mara. In this film, she {{is portrayed as}} a {{socially}} unavailable outcast who loves art. Quentin Smith (Kyle Gallner), another high school outcast, crushes on her, and tries hard constantly to hit on her, but ends up failing. However, she does take partnership with him {{as they try to}} investigate the deaths of their three friends: Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz), Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy), and Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), all of which died in their sleep, and both claiming to see a man matching the same description: a burnt face. When they discover that both she, Quentin, Kris, Jesse, and Dean all went to preschool together when they were little, they don't understand, seeing how they didn't know each other until high school. When Nancy's mother Gwen (Connie Britton) catches the both of them, she finally admits that as children, they and all the kids in the preschool were molested by a man named Fred Krueger, the school gardener who resided in the preschool's basement. She claims that Freddy fled the area before they could turn him in, and that their dreams of Freddy are just repressed memories. However, when Quentin learns the truth through one of Freddy's dreams when he falls asleep in swim class, they both confront Quentin's father Alan (Clancy Brown) for killing Freddy when the parents had chased him down, and Alan through a fire-lit gasoline gallon into a shed where Freddy hid, despite not there being any evidence that he was molesting them. Alan admits regret for his actions, but also defends them, saying they were only trying to protect them. Quentin storms out in anger, as a guilt-stricken Alan instructs Nancy to never reveal to anyone who Freddy was. Still unable to understand, Nancy and Quentin decide to go to the preschool to find answers, and when they arrive, it is revealed that Freddy was in fact molesting the children when they discover pictures of Nancy as a child (though never shown only implied). With their memories back, they realize that Freddy isn't after them because they lied about him, but because they told the truth about him. When Nancy sees a piece of Freddy's sweater she pulled out from a dream sequence before, she realizes that Freddy needs to be pulled into the real world to be defeated. When she does, she defeats Freddy by slicing off his clawed hand with a broken paper <b>cutter</b> <b>blade,</b> and finishes the job by slicing his throat. They burn down the preschool with Freddy's corpse inside, and she and Quentin escape, with Quentin hospitalized. Nancy returns home, and thanks her mother for trying to protect her, but Freddy appears in a mirror behind Gwen. He kills her, and drags her body into the mirror, with Nancy screaming.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{fabricate}} very large objects of arbitrarily complexity from various high density polymers, a hybrid {{approach has been}} developed in which layers are individually machined and then stacked together. The layers are obtained by moving a heated <b>cutter</b> <b>blade</b> along {{the periphery of the}} layer. The adjustable tool is held by a controllable gripper and manipulated by a sculpturing robot. During motion the shape of the blade is continuously adapted to the target geometry for the layer.

The synchronous control of the shape of the <b>cutter</b> <b>blade</b> is a multilevel optimization problem, involving 1) finding the shape of the blade that suffices to the minimum energy principle, 2) minimizing the deviation between shape curves on the layer and the blades profile curve, 3) finding the best fitting region of the blades profile curve for various curvature characteristics, 4) finding the best tool positions and the optimum tool path.

40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI) {{is characterized}} by an initial primary injury followed by secondary tissue damage. This involves the production of highly reactive species, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) or free radicals, which cause damage to cell components and lead to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress {{plays a key role}} in the pathophysiology of SCI and it can be considered an hallmark for it (1); consequently alleviating oxidative stress could be an effective strategy for the therapeutic intervention of SCI. Melatonin is the major secretory product of the pineal gland and it is recognized as a potent antioxidant and immunomodulator (2). So, the aim of this study was to test the effects of melatonin administration in an organotypic slice culture model of adult Sprague Dawley rat spinal cord. Spinal cord slices were cultured for 7 days in vitro; than they were subjected to mechanical injury by <b>cutter</b> <b>blade</b> for the evaluation of melatonin effects on oxidative stress caused by damage. Four experimental group were used in this study: A) Control Group (CTR) – Organotypic spinal cord slice culture; B) Injury Group (INJURY) – Organotypic spinal cord slice culture mechanically injured by cutter blade; C) Treatment Group (INJURY+MEL) – Organotypic spinal cord slice culture mechanically injured by <b>cutter</b> <b>blade</b> and treated after 24 hours with melatonin for other 24 hours; E) Control Group with melatonin (CTR+MEL) – Organotypic spinal cord slice culture treated with melatonin for 24 hours. After the treatment, adeguated immunohistochemical analysis were performed for superoxide dismutase (SOD). The results obtained show that melatonin administration has a favorable influence on antioxidative processes enhancing SOD immunopositivity in organotypic spinal cord slice cultures.
