40|$|The {{excitatory}} {{amino acids}} (EAA) s, glutamate and aspartate, are considered major endogenous neuroactive substances involved in excitatory neurotransmission. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, {{one of the}} major EAA receptors, has been implicated in the control of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion through facilitation of luteinizing hormone releasing-hormone (LHRH). Interestingly, the ability of NMDA receptors to stimulate LHRH release is significantly compromised in castrated animals as compared to intact animals. The present study had two aims.

Estradiol-implanted <b>castrated</b> <b>male</b> <b>sheep</b> with indwelling intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) cannulae were kept with unrestricted food for 16 weeks in long day photoperiod (LD, 16 h light/day) then 16 weeks in short days (SD, 8 h light/day).

Therefore, central injection of ghrelin to sheep acutely stimulated food intake in LD, suppressed reproductive neuroendocrine output in SD, and stimulated GH secretion irrespective of photoperiod, although more pronounced in LD.

Eight, four-month-old, <b>castrated</b> <b>male</b> Merino <b>sheep,</b> were randomly allocated to experimental and control groups (n = 4 in each group). Forward mandibular displacement was induced with an intraoral appliance. The study period was 15 weeks, during which time fluorochromes were administered to all of the animals. Midsagittal sections of the TMJ were selected for analysis and trabecular anisotropy was estimated using bone histomorphometry. Only the experimental group demonstrated that the trabecular bone in the central condylar region was less anisotropic when compared to the subchondral region. Also, the variation in trabecular anisotropy of the central condylar region was found to be smaller in the experimental group. The collagen fibre orientation was analysed under polarised light as the proportion of the dark or bright fibres observed in regions which existed before, and regions which formed during the experiment, as determined by the fluorochrome labels. In the experimental group, more bright collagen fibres were found in the most superior region of the mandibular condyle when compared with the controls. These results suggested that the experimental functional appliances changed the orientation and pattern of the mechanical forces acting on the mandibular condyle, and possibly increased the magnitude of the lateral functional forces applied to the most superior part of the condyle during such treatments.

Six adult <b>castrated</b> <b>male</b> <b>sheep</b> fistulated in the rumen were assigned to a 6 x 6 Latin square design. The addition of PEE or sodium monensin to the diet did not change the digestibility coefficients of dry matter (79. 4 %), crude protein (77. 0 %), neutral detergent fiber (76. 1 %), acid detergent fiber (69. 7 %), hemicellulose (80. 9 %), and organic matter (79. 4 %). Sheep fed diets with inclusion of sodium monensin showed 11. 3 % reduction in dry matter intake (1. 76 kg day- 1) compared to those which received PEE (2. 00 kg day- 1). The inclusion of additives to the diet influenced ruminal pH: higher values were observed in sheep fed sodium monensin (6. 1).

The study period was 15 weeks, during that time, (1) calcein, (2) tetracycline, and (3) alizarin red S fluorochromes were given to all animals from day 1. Midsagittal sections of the temporomandibular joints were selected for analysis. Dynamic variables of bone formation, static indices of bone-forming and -resorbing activity, and structural indices of trabecular bone were estimated histomorphometrically. The sampling site was divided into two regions for analysis: (a) a ‘subchondral region’ (2 and 3 labels only), {{believed to be the}} bone newly formed during the experimental period; (b) a ‘central region’ (labelled by all three fluorochromes), believed to be the bone that existed before the experiment. Regional differences in adaptive response were found. In the experimental group, the bone-volume fraction (BV/TV) of the subchondral regions had decreased, although the specific bone-surface and bone-formation rates had increased. This low BV/TV was associated with decreased trabecular thickness and increased trabecular separation. In the central condylar region of the experimental group, BV/TV was unchanged, but an increased osteoid surface was apparent when the eroded surface was taken into consideration.

Eight, 4 -month-old, <b>castrated</b> <b>male</b> Merino <b>sheep</b> were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups, with four in each group. Cast functional appliances were fabricated for the animals in the experimental group. The treatment period was 15 weeks. Dental casts, endosseous implant markers and cephalograms were used to analyse the displacement of the mandible. Undemineralised sagittal sections of TMJ were used to evaluate the tissue responses induced by the appliances. The weight of the animals was measured monthly to monitor their growth. The growth of the metacarpus was also measured. During the experimental period, the animals maintained their weight within the normal range and grew normally. The appliance displaced the mandible to a downward and forward position. The adaptive responses in the TMJ induced by the appliances included changed anteroposterior shape of the condylar process, anteriorly thickened condylar cartilage, and a thickened compact bone layer along the anterior surface of the posterior wall of the glenoid fossa. The sheep coped well with the experimental procedures and the appliance used was demonstrably effective in inducing adaptive responses in the TMJ.

We addressed the hypothesis that these hypothalamic responses were correlated and influenced by photoperiod. Oestradiol-implanted, <b>castrated</b> <b>male</b> <b>sheep</b> were kept 16 weeks in SD (8 h light/day) or LD (16 h light/day) and then transferred to the opposite photoperiods for 8 weeks, during which food was restricted to 90 % requirement to maintain body weight (maintenance). For the final 6 days, food was reduced to 75 % maintenance, and sheep in both photoperiods were infused intravenously with G (60 mM/h) or saline (S) (n= 8 /group). G-infused sheep had higher mean plasma concentrations of G, insulin and leptin than S-infused sheep, with no effect of photoperiod.

One hundred and seventy-three <b>castrated</b> <b>male</b> <b>sheep</b> from four breeds (15 Dormer, 46 South African Mutton Merino, 77 Dorper and 35 Blackhead Persian) were used. The animals were grouped according to age categories. The grouping was as follows: Group 1 (6 ≤ 8 months), Group 2 (9 ≤ 12 months) and Group 3 (13 ≤ 16 months). Blood samples for CK determination were collected at exanguination using disposable vacutainer tubes. Representative samples of the Muscularis longissimuss thoracis et. lumborum (LTL) muscle were taken for the determination of ultimate pH (pHu), colour (L*-lightness, b*- redness and a*- yellowness), thawing and cooking losses and meat tenderness. Significant (P< 0. 01) breed effects were observed on CK levels with Dormer having the highest CK values. Significant linear relationships were observed between pre-slaughter condition and CK levels. There were positive correlations between colour coordinates L* and b* (r =+ 0. 22) and between a* and b* (r =+ 0. 63). Cooking loss and Warner Braztler Shear Force (WBSF) values were positively correlated (r =+ 0. 29). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed a significant variance for CK and between physico-chemical characteristics of mutton. There were no relationships between CK levels and physico-chemical characteristics of mutton. Significant breed and age effects on pHu, L, a*, b*, thaw %, CL and WBSF of mutton were observed. iv It was concluded that, pre-slaughter conditions affect CK levels and physico-chemical characteristics of mutton.

40|$|Two {{digestion}} trials, {{one with}} sheep and another with goats, {{were conducted to}} evaluate the long-term bias (LTB) of the indigestible dry matter (iDM), indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF) and indigestible acid detergent fiber (iADF) internal markers. The study used eight Santa Inês <b>castrated</b> <b>male</b> <b>sheep</b> (average body weight of 16. 6 kg) distributed in two 4 × 4 Latin squares and eight Saanen castrated male goats (average body weight of 22. 6 kg) distributed in two 4 × 4 Latin squares. The experiments were conducted simultaneously, and the animals were housed in 1. 2 m 2 individual pens with wood-battened floors equipped with individual feeders and drinkers. The animals received isonitrogenous diets that were offered ad libitum and contained 14 % crude protein and 70 % sugar cane (with 0, 0. 75, 1. 5 or 2. 25 % CaO, in natural matter percentage), corrected with 1 % urea and 30 % concentrate. The experiment consisted of four experimental periods of 14 d each, with the feed, leftovers and feces sampled on the last four days of each period. The marker concentrations in the feed, leftovers and fecal samples were estimated by an in situ ruminal incubation procedure with a duration 240 h. The relationship between the intake and excretion of the markers was obtained by adjusting a simple linear regression model, independently from the treatment (diets) fixed effects and Latin squares. For both the sheep and goats, a complete recovery of the iDM and iNDF markers was observed (p> 0. 05), indicating the absence of LTB for these markers. However, the iADF was not completely recovered, exhibiting an LTB of − 9. 12 % (p< 0. 05) in the sheep evaluation and − 3. 02 % (p< 0. 05) in the goat evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} whereby {{growth hormone}} and dexamethasone modulate the stimulation of fatty acid synthesis by insulin in adipose tissue from lactating and non-lactating sheep have been investigated. Maintenance of adipose tissue from wethers (<b>castrated</b> <b>male</b> <b>sheep)</b> in tissue culture for 24 or 48 h with insulin {{resulted in an}} increased proportion of acetyl-CoA carboxylase being present in the active state; this effect was enhanced by dexamethasone and was antagonized by growth hormone. Lactation results in a decrease in both the total acetyl-CoA carboxylase of sheep adipose tissue {{and the proportion of}} the enzyme in the active state. Maintenance of adipose tissue from lactating sheep in tissue culture for 48 h in the presence of insulin plus dexamethasone increased markedly the proportion of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the active state and increased slightly the total activity of the enzyme. Both of these effects were prevented by actinomycin D, and the change in activation status was prevented by growth hormone. Tissue culture for 6 days showed that growth hormone could also prevent the ability of insulin plus dexamethasone to increase the total activity of the enzyme. Analogous studies showed that insulin, dexamethasone and growth hormone modulated the activities of other lipogenic enzymes, but the effects were proportionately smaller than for acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Insulin also increased total protein synthesis in adipose tissue, but this was not antagonized by growth hormone. The results suggest that the fall in fatty acid synthesis in sheep adipose tissue during lactation is due to a decrease in both the total acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity and the proportion of the enzyme in the active state; these changes are probably induced by known changes in the serum concentrations of insulin and growth hormone. Lactation appears to result in the loss of a protein that is required for activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by insulin; production of this component appears to be prevented by growth hormone...|$|E

40|$|Skatole (3 -methylindole) {{contributes}} to the unique flavour palate known as pastoral flavour (characterised by 'sheepy or 'grassy' odours) that differentiates meat products of pasture-fed ruminants from those finished under grain-based production systems. Pastoral flavour is undesirable to some consumer groups who are sensitive or unaccustomed to meat from temperate pastoral production systems yet is largely appreciated by traditional consumers. The biosynthesis of skatole in the rumen requires bacterial deamination of the amino acid L-tryptophan, hence its rate of production can be manipulated by reducing the rumen formation of free amino acids or decreasing the activity of skatole forming microbes. Ruminants grazing New Zealand improved pasture species, in particular white clover, ingest sufficient rumen degradable protein to allow post-prandial skatole formation at a rate greater than the first-pass detoxification capacity of the liver. Skatole accumulation in body fat occurs when its absorption from the reticulorumen exceeds the pre and post-hepatic detoxification capacity of the body. It was hypothesised that under conditions of minimal rumen skatole production a 72 hour administration of exogenous skatole would result {{in an increase in}} rumen skatole to a plateau concentration and induce differential expression of detoxification genes in the ovine liver. These hypotheses were tested using a continuous intraruminal infusion of skatole (140 mg/h), measurement of skatole concentration in rumen fluid, peripheral plasma and inter-muscular fat and transcriptional analysis of hepatic tissue using DNA microarrays. Twelve, ten month old <b>castrate</b> <b>male</b> <b>sheep</b> (Ovis aries) from a single sire were exposed to a contrasting level of skatole for a 72 hour period. Rumen skatolc production was minimised by feeding a diet with low rumen degradable protein content. Sheep received a constant rumen infusion of propylene glycol carrier with or without skatole (28 mg/mL). Samples of rumen fluid and peripheral blood were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 72 hours for determination of skatole concentration. Sheep were euthanased 72 hours after commencement of infusion and samples of liver and intermuscular fat were collected. Total hepatic RNA was isolated, purified and used for microarray hybridisation. cDNA was synthesised and cyanine dye incorporated in preparation for hybridisation to expressed sequence tag bovine microarrays with greater than 97 % homology to ovine protein coding sequence. The experiment consisted of an 18 array augmented loop design balanced for dye bias. Rapid appearance of rumen-infused skatole in the peripheral blood and inter-muscular fat confirmed the high rate of skatole absorption and deposition in sheep. A two compartment model fitted to the rumen and blood concentration of treated sheep enabled estimation of the rate of transfer from rumen to peripheral plasma (k = 0. 23) and the rate of elimination from peripheral circulation (k = 2. 10). A negative correlation (P < 0. 05) between the rate of elimination and level of skatole deposition in intermuscular fat was also found. Expressed sequence tags with significant (FDR < 0. 01) differential expression in either direction represented about 14 % of those assessed. Genes encoding enzymes with xenobiotic detoxification activity were induced in ovine hepatic tissue in response to skatole exposure. Of these, only five had a fold change greater than 2. 0; three encoded cytosolic phase I oxidoreductasc enzymes involved in detoxification; aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member Al, NAD(P) H dehydrogenase quinone 1 and leukotriene B 4 12 -hydroxydehydrogenase. The metabolic oxidoreductase enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase was also induced along with phase II detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase. Induction of these genes, specifically those with known catalytic activity towards toxic xenobiotics, indicates that the ovine liver is a site of detoxification for skatole or its intermediary metabolites. Further investigation is required to determine the role of these genes in the regulation of skatole detoxification in the ovine liver and the possibility to reduce pastoral flavour in forage grazing ruminants through modulation of the activity of these genes or enzymes...|$|R
