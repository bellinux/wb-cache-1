5|$|A {{chemical}} analysis of Mexican specimens has shown L.indigo to contain moisture at 951mg/g of mushroom, fat at 4.3mg/g, protein at 13.4mg/g, and dietary fiber at 18.7mg/g, much higher in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> the common button mushroom, which contains 6.6mg/g. Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also {{tested in the}} study (Amanita rubescens, Boletus frostii, and Ramaria flava), L.indigo contained the highest saturated fatty acids content, including stearic acid with 32.1mg/g—slightly {{over half of the}} total free fatty acid content.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a report}} from the time of its release, The Iron Giant cost $50 million to produce with an {{additional}} $30 million going towards marketing, though Box Office Mojo later calculated its budget as $70 million.

5|$|Additionally, Congress {{required}} jurisdictions seeking bailout {{to produce}} evidence of minority registration and voting rates, including how these rates have changed over time and in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> the registration and voting rates of the majority. If the court determines that the covered jurisdiction is eligible for bailout, it will enter a declaratory judgment in the jurisdiction's favor. The court will retain jurisdiction for the following 10 years and may order the jurisdiction back into coverage if the jurisdiction subsequently engages in voting discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Amanita exitialis {{is similar}} to A.bisporigera, a species {{originally}} described by George Francis Atkinson from the United States. In <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> A.exitialis, A.bisporigera differs by its lower placement of the ring on the stem, smaller spores (typically 8–9.5 by 7–8.5µm), and different structure of the volva. American specimens of A.bisporigera have more abundant inflated cells than that of A.exitialis. Two other white Asian species, A.oberwinklerana and A.subjunquillea var. alba also resemble A.exitialis, but are four-spored.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, {{the castle}} is unusual for this period.

Its closest equivalents are the blockhouses built by Henry VIII on the River Thames.|$|E

5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of these collaborations, Rock Steady touches on many musical styles, {{focusing}} on electropop, dancehall, and new wave. The band attempted to capture the vibe of Jamaican dancehall music, and experimented with writing songs without its standard instrumentation. Singer Gwen Stefani wrote her lyrics quickly in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> previous records, and dealt with topics ranging from partying to ruminations on her relationship with Gavin Rossdale.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with many castles – {{especially}} of the 12th century – there is no record of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. However, based on <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the keep in 11751177 cost £184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around £100. This was close to the median annual income for a baron in 1200.|$|E
