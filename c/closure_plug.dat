40|$|To {{investigate}} whether percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure guided by automated real-time integration of 2 D-/ 3 D-transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and fluoroscopy imaging results in decreased radiation exposure. In this open-label single-center study LAA <b>closure</b> (AmplatzerTM Cardiac <b>Plug)</b> {{was performed in}} 34 consecutive patients (8 women; 73. 1 ± 8. 5 years) with (n = 17, EN+) or without (n = 17, EN-) integrated echocardiography/fluoroscopy imaging guidance (EchoNavigator® [EN]; Philips Healthcare). There {{were no significant differences}} in baseline characteristics between both groups. Successful LAA closure was documented in all patients. Radiation dose was reduced in the EN+ group about 52 % (EN+: 48. 5 ± 30. 7 vs. EN-: 93. 9 ± 64. 4 Gy/cm 2; p = 0. 01). Corresponding to the radiation dose fluoroscopy time was reduced (EN+: 16. 7 ± 7 vs. EN-: 24. 0 ± 11. 4 min; p = 0. 035). These advantages were not at the cost of increased procedure time (89. 6 ± 28. 8 vs. 90. 1 ± 30. 2 min; p = 0. 96) or periprocedural complications. Contrast media amount was comparable between both groups (172. 3 ± 92. 7 vs. 197. 5 ± 127. 8 ml; p = 0. 53). During short-term follow-up of at least 3 months (mean: 8. 1 ± 5. 9 months) no device-related events occurred. Automated real-time integration of echocardiography and fluoroscopy can be incorporated into procedural work-flow of percutaneous left atrial appendage closure without prolonging procedure time.

40|$|OBJECTIVES Percutaneous {{closure of}} the transapical (TA) access site for large-calibre devices is an unsolved issue. We report the first {{experimental}} data on the TA PLUG device for true-percutaneous closure following large apical access for transcatheter aortic valve implantation. METHODS The TA PLUG, a self-sealing full-core closure device, was implanted in an acute animal study in six pigs (60. 2 ± 0. 7 kg). All the pigs received 100 IU/kg of heparin. The targeted activated clotting time was left to normalize spontaneously. After accessing the left ventricular apex with a 39 French introducer, the <b>closure</b> <b>plug</b> device was delivered with a 33 French over-the-wire system under fluoroscopic guidance into the apex. Time to full haemostasis as well as rate of bleeding was recorded. Self-anchoring properties were assessed by haemodynamic push stress under adrenalin challenge. An additional feasibility {{study was conducted in}} four pigs (58. 4 ± 1. 1 kg) with full surgical exposure of the apex, and assessed device anchoring by pull-force measurements with 0. 5 Newton (N) increments. All the animals were electively sacrified. Post-mortem analysis of the heart was performed and the renal embolic index assessed. RESULTS Of six apical closure devices, five were correctly inserted and fully deployed at the first attempt. One became blocked in the delivery system and was placed successfully at the second attempt. In all the animals, complete haemostasis was immediate and no leak was recorded during the 5 -h observation period. Neither leak nor any device dislodgement was observed under haemodynamic push stress with repeated left ventricular peak pressure of up to 220 mmHg. In the feasibility study assessing pull-stressing, device migration occurred at a force of 3. 3 ± 0. 5 N corresponding to 247. 5 mmHg. Post-mortem analyses confirmed full expansion of all devices at the intended target. No macroscopic damage was identified at the surrounding myocardium. The renal embolic index was zero. CONCLUSIONS True-percutaneous left ventricular apex closure following large access is feasible with the self-sealing TA PLUG. The device allows for immediate haemostasis and a reliable anchoring in the acute animal setting. This is the first report of a true-percutaneous closure for large-calibre transcatheter aortic valve implantation access...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a possible solution for the designing of a device for the decommissioning of the horizontal fuel channels in the CANDU 6 nuclear reactor. The decommissioning activities are dismantling, demolition, controlled removal of equipment, components, conventional or hazardous waste (radioactive, toxic) in compliance with the international basic safety standards on radiation protection. One as the most important operation in the final phase of the nuclear reactor dismantling is the decommissioning of fuel channels. For the fuel channels decommissioning should be taken into account the detailed description of the fuel channel and its components, the installation documents history, adequate radiological criteria for decommissioning guidance, safety and environmental impact assessment, including radiological and non-radiological analysis of the risks that can occur for workers, public and environment, the description of the proposed program for decommissioning the fuel channel and its components, the description of the quality assurance program and of the monitoring program, the equipments and methods used to verify the compliance with the decommissioning criteria, the planning of performing the final radiological assessment at the end of the fuel channel decommissioning. These will include also, a description of the proposed radiation protection procedures to be used during decommissioning. The dismantling of the fuel channel is performed by one device which shall provide radiation protection during the stages of decommissioning, ensuring radiation protection of the workers. The device shall be designed according to the radiation protection procedures. The decommissioning device assembly of the fuel channel components is composed of the device itself and moving platform support for coupling of the selected channel to be dismantled.

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} if connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) {{is necessary for the}} formation of corneal haze after corneal injury. Mice with post-natal, tamoxifen-induced, knockout of CTGF were subjected to excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) and the corneas were allowed to heal. The extent of scaring was observed in non-induced mice, heterozygotes, and full homozygous knockout mice and quantified by macrophotography. The eyes from these mice were collected after euthanization for re-genotyping to control for possible Cre-mosaicism. Primary corneal fibroblasts from CTGF knockout corneas were established in a gel plug assay. The plug was removed, simulating an injury, and the rate of hole closure and the capacity for these cells to form light reflecting cells in response to CTGF and platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) were tested and compared to wild-type cells. We found that independent of genotype, each group of mice was still capable of forming light reflecting haze in the cornea after laser ablation (p = 0. 40). Results from the gel <b>plug</b> <b>closure</b> rate in primary cell cultures of knockout cells were not statistically different from serum starved wild-type cells, independent of treatment. Compared to the serum starved wild-type cells, stimulation with PDGF-BB significantly increased the KO cell culture's light reflection (p = 0. 03). Most interestingly, both reflective cultures were positive for α-SMA, but the cellular morphology and levels of α-SMA were distinct and not in proportion to the light reflection seen. This new work demonstrates that corneas without CTGF can still form sub-epithelial haze, and that the light reflecting phenotype can be reproduced in culture. These data support the possibilities of growth factor redundancy and that multiple pro-haze pathways exist...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the ITER ECRH system {{provides}} 20 &#xa 0;MW millimeter wave power for central plasma heating and MHD stabilization. The system consists of an array of 24 gyrotrons with power supplies coupled {{to a set of}} transmission lines guiding the beams to the four upper and the equatorial launcher. The front steering upper launcher design described herein has passed successfully the preliminary design review, and it is presently in the final design stage. The launcher consists of a millimeter wave system and steering mechanism with neutron shielding integrated into an upper port plug with the plasma facing blanket shield module (in-vessel) and a set of ex-vessel waveguides connecting the launcher to the transmission lines. Part of the transmission lines are the ultra-low loss CVD torus diamond windows and a shutter valve, a miter bend section and the feedthroughs integrated in the <b>plug</b> <b>closure</b> plate. These components are connected by corrugated waveguides and form together the first confinement system (FCS). In-vessel, the millimeter-wave system includes a quasi-optical beam propagation system including four mirror sets and a front steering mirror. The millimeter wave system is integrated into a specifically optimized upper port plug providing structural stability to withstand plasma disruption forces and the high heat load from the plasma side with a dedicated blanket shield module. A recent update in the ITER interface definition has resulted in the recession of the upper port plug first wall panels, which is now integrated into the design. Apart from the millimeter wave system the upper port plug houses also a set of shield blocks which provide neutron shielding.

40|$|PurposeThis study {{retrospectively}} {{evaluated the}} efficacy {{and safety of}} the 6 F Angio-Seal (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minn) as a closure device for transbrachial artery access for endovascular procedures in diabetic patients with critical limb ischemia. MethodsFrom January 2005 and September 2007, 1887 diabetic patients underwent interventional procedures in the lower limbs at a two diabetic foot centers. Patients presented with rest pain (16 %), ulcers (80 %), or gangrene (4 %). Systemic anticoagulation with sodium heparin (70 IU/kg) was obtained for all patients {{at the beginning of}} the endovascular treatment. A total of 249 brachial arteries (238 patients) were evaluated for possible Angio-Seal use after endovascular recanalization of the leg. Color Doppler ultrasound imaging of the artery was obtained before revascularization only in patients with previous Angio-Seal placement in the brachial artery. No further imaging studies were done in the remaining brachial arteries where the Angio-Seal was deployed at the operator’s discretion. Impairment or disappearance of the radial pulse or onsets of hand ischemia or hand pain, or impairment of hand function during or at the end of the endovascular revascularization were all regarded as contraindications to Angio-Seal usage. Evidence of a highly calcified plaque of the brachial artery access site at the time of vessel puncture was regarded as an absolute contraindication to the Angio-Seal use. Patients were seen before discharge, at 1, 3, and 8 weeks after the procedure, and at 3 -month intervals thereafter. Complications included hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm, infection, and vessel occlusion. ResultsA total of 1947 Angio-Seal collagen plugs were deployed in 1709 diabetic patients (90. 5 %). The Angio-Seal was used for brachial artery closure in 159 patients (8. 4 %) in 161 procedures (159 in the left, 2 in the right brachial artery). In 79 patients (4. 2 %) in 88 procedures (87 in the left and 1 in the right brachial artery), the device was deemed contraindicated due to small vessel size in 73 patients (92. 4 %) or presence of calcium at the access site in five patients (6. 3 %). One patient (1. 3 %) refused the collagen <b>plug</b> <b>closure</b> after revascularization. The non-Angio-Seal group was evaluated for comparison. The success rate for achieving hemostasis in the Angio-Seal group was 96. 9 %. Five major complications (3. 1 %) at 30 days consisted of two puncture site hematomas > 4 cm, two brachial artery occlusions, and one brachial artery pseudoaneurysm, with three patients requiring open surgery. Minor complications (7. 50 %) were three puncture site hematomas < 4 cm, three oozing of blood from the access site, and six patients had mild pain in the cubital fossa. No further complications were recorded in the 14 -month follow-up (range 1 - 25 months) of a total of 140 patients. ConclusionsThis retrospective study shows that the 6 F Angio-Seal is a valuable and safe vascular closure device for transbrachial access in diabetic patients undergoing interventional procedures for critical limb ischemia...|$|R
