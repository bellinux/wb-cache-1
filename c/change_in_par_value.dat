40|$|Stock splits are conceptually a {{very simple}} {{corporate}} event that consists in the division of each share into a higher number of shares of smaller <b>par</b> <b>value.</b> These operations have long {{been a part of}} financial markets. Portugal witnessed 26 of these operations from 1999 (the year the euro was introduced) to June 2003 essentially due to a legislative change that took place when the corporate law was adapted for the introduction of the euro. In this paper stock splits are analyzed in terms of liquidity, risk, signaling and ideal price range explanations that could justify the sizeable cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) that we document around both announcement (5 -day CAR of 3. 8 %) and ex-dates (5 -day CAR of 7. 5 %). Our evidence shows no significant increase in trading volume (in EUR) although the number of trades does seem to increase, suggesting that trading by small investors is increased post-split. Our results also uncover an increase in the relative bid-ask spread but only for a sample subset of firms with the lowest pre- or post-split relative spreads. Our results also suggest, however, that liquidity reasons {{do not seem to be}} sufficient to explain the observed abnormal returns around the ex-date. A surprising feature is that the observed significant price increases were mainly concentrated around the ex-date, in contrast to most available evidence. The signaling hypotheses tested were not supported by the evidence presented in this study. These operations also cannot be explained by a placement of share prices levels closer to those of other Eurozone stock markets as Portuguese share prices levels are clearly much lower than the levels observable in those markets. We also conducted a survey directed at splitting firm. This confirmed that liquidity increases were indeed one of the main objectives pretended by the managers of these firms. Most companies, however, considered that this had not been accomplished. Another stated objective deemed important by managers was share capital simplification. This is puzzling since it is difficult to explain the sizeable wealth effects documented with simple <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>par</b> <b>value</b> itself. Our survey did not support signaling as a justification on the part of managers for the decision to split. Market efficiency, Stock splits, abnormal returns, trading volume,liquidity...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. The {{object of}} this study is to {{critically}} appraise the fundamental models, technical methods and statistical techniques that constitute the bulk of exchange rate forecasting methodology. Specifically, can any single approach, or combination of techniques, predict or explain the volatile currency movements characterising exchange rate behaviour in the modern international currency market? International currency markets are indeed complex in nature, and the layperson may be excused for not grasping the distinction between the fundamental, technical and statistical techniques described in the hypothesis. It is vital, however, for the comprehension {{of this study}} that the distinction between these approaches be explained, and the logic underlying their individual methodologies examined. It may prima facie seem that this study is based on a contradiction. Surely if one wants to predict an economic variable of any kind, one should refer to the economic theory upon which it is based as the starting point of an analysis. Consequently, if the objective is to forecast the future value of a currency, surely there are a great many economic texts that deal with this very question in voluminous detail. Why, then, should yet another paper be written when so much literature already exists? The answer lies not so much in the scope as in the purpose of this work. The aim of this study can be paraphrased. as follows: to provide a comprehensive and critical examination of the various methods of exchange rate forecasting and to explain why economic theory is still deficient in this important area. The question of whether or not short-term' exchange rates are able to be forecast at all will also be critically examined. This study will attempt to elucidate that while fundamental currency speculation models do provide a certain degree of guidance to currency-traders in their daily prognostications, these models are, in the context of modern capital markets, inadequate. At best, these models will be shown as trackers of long-term exchange rate trends, and not always accurate ones at that. Further, it will be demonstrated that the modern trading floors are characterised (if not defined) by split-second price changes, where the long-term'' can mean a minute, and he who hesitates is lost. It is in this setting that traders must do battle for profit, and where the fundamental models that seem to serve so well in textbooks are anachronisms. The study then shifts its focus to a subset of technical analysis known as charting, the objective being to fill the void which arises due to the fundamental models' inadequacies in the short-term. The charting techniques utilised in this study deviate from their fundamental counterparts in that they attempt to explain future exchangerate trends in terms of past performance. That is, exogenous changes are factored out of the forecasting equation, to give way to a methodology based on trendextrapolation. The performance of these models, especially as they pertain to the medium- and short-term., will then be determined. Finally, in an attempt to supplement the use of charts as a forecasting tool, statistical analysis will be considered. The model utilised in this section will be a rudimentary auto-regressive process. Its simplicity, however, belies its consequence. That is, considering that no ubiquitous statistical model dominates exchange rate theory, it is reasonable to assume that an auto-regressive process, such as the one contributed by this study, will not be subordinate to other, more complex, quantitative offerings. Thus this study attempts to provide the necessary insights in order to perspicaciously 1 It should be noted here that the terms "short-term" and "short run" are interchangeable. For the purposes of consistency, only the former term shall be employed throughout this study. 2 The terms "long-term" and "long run" are also interchangeable. For the purposes of consistency, only the former term shall be employed throughout this study. ascertain the proficiency of statistical analysis as an accurate forecaster of exchange rate fluctuations. All of the models and methods examined in this study adopt a pragmatic acid-test. That is to say, if the predictions made as a result of adherence to the models do not comply accurately and consistently with real findings, then the models themselves should be revised. This revision can be in terms of the time-frame to which the model pertains, the application of the model, or the model itself. It must, however, be stressed that a model whose very raison d'etre lies in its ability to predict exchange rate movements must be able to do so without qualifications or exceptions. The methodology adopted in analysing the models themselves is therefore positive as opposed to normative. Thus, even in the "organised chaos" of the modern exchange rate markets, the application of the models should yield satisfactory results. In other words, despite the unprecedented volumes, speed and volatility of the currencies that are traded in the modern arena, the models themselves should still be able to achieve their purpose - to forecast the extent and direction of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>par</b> <b>value</b> of a currency. The next logical question is: what is meant by the "organised chaos", and specifically why should this influence the predictive ability of the fundamental, technical and statistical methods of exchange rate forecasting? The answer to this can be introduced as follows. On an almost daily basis, currency traders move an excess of one trillion dollars throughout the world. Adding to the gravity of this somewhat overwhelming statistic is that most of these are intercomputer transactions occurring instantaneously via inter-bank wire-transfers. In fact, the volume of currency traded is so great that if one were to sum the trading of all the Saudi oil, American wheat, European aircraft and Japanese cars, the monetary result would seem pithy in comparison (Millman, 1995 :xxi). It is, however, not only the sheer volumes of currencies traded that characterise the international money markets. It is perhaps more importantly the unanticipated and unparalleled volatility of the markets themselves which provides the greatest quandary for those who conform to 'traditional' methods of exchange rate determination. It is all too common, in fact, for currency prices to change on a minute-to-minute or even second-to-second basis. Exchange rates are thus in a constant state of flux. The significant though infrequent changes of past years have been terminally disposed of. The inception of the microcomputer and the floating exchange rate system currently dominating the greater world economy has irrevocably altered what was considered a flawed order. It is this very metamorphosis which will be examined in detail, specifically how fundamental models have assumed a differing purpose to those used by modern speculators, hedgers and arbitrageurs in their specific fields of application. Thus it will be shown how the changing paradigm of the world economy and consequently the currency trading floors themselves necessitate neoteric predictive powers, that is, the power to forecast currency <b>changes</b> not <b>in</b> terms of years, months or even weeks, but rather in terms of days, minutes and seconds. The object of this thesis will therefore be to show that a definite dichotomy has developed between the exchange rate models espoused in economic textbooks and the techniques upon which the de facto day-to-day buying and selling of currencies depend. The efficacy of this study consequently hinges on one decisive question - is there truly a consistent and precise method of forecasting exchange rates...|$|R

Chlorophyll content and specific leaf area (SLA) were also evaluated. The effects of shade on leaf optical properties and chlorophyll content differed among the studied species, whereas increased SLA was a common response for all species, reflecting the occurrence of thinner leaves under shade. The three studied shade-tolerant species - Esenbeckia leiocarpa, Myroxylon peruiferum and Hymenaea courbaril - presented a greater PAR absorbance under shade. The response of the shade-intolerant species was varied. While Schizolobium parahyba also showed a greater PAR absorbance under shade, Chorisia speciosa did not alter its spectral properties and Cecropia pachystachya presented an opposite pattern, with smaller absorbance under shade. Increases in leaf chlorophyll content were significant in the shade-tolerant species, whereas they were absent or of small magnitude in the shade-intolerant ones. Although the shade-induced decrease of leaf reflectance was the only response that safely discriminated tolerant from intolerant species, the adjustments in leaf chlorophyll content and optical properties were more consistent for the tolerant species...|$|R

Due to the changes to the substantia nigra in the schizophrenic brain, it may eventually be possible to use specific imaging techniques (such as neuromelanin-specific imaging) to detect physiological signs of schizophrenia in the substantia nigra.|$|R

40|$|The pars distalis, pars {{intermedia}} and infundibular process make up, respectively, 61, 5 and 34 % of {{the volume}} of the pituitary gland of normal mature female rhesus monkeys. The pars distalis is relatively smaller in immature animals, and larger during pregnancy. Section of the pituitary stalk is followed by {{a significant increase in the}} volume of the pars intermedia; the infundibular process always decreases in volume, while the pars distalis shrinks to a lesser and more variable extent. Histological <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>pars</b> intermedia suggest that cellular hyper-trophy, infiltration of atypical cells, and cyst formation all contribute to the increase in volume, and that the changes are at any rate partly degenera-tive in nature...|$|R

50|$|Even in jurisdictions {{that permit}} {{the issue of}} stock with no <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> the <b>par</b> <b>value</b> of a stock may affect its tax treatment.

40|$|The primary aim of {{the study}} was to {{quantify}} the effects of photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR) on extension of leaves of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). Plants grown at 250 ?mol m? 2 s? 1 were exposed to a range of fluence rates (0 · 680 ?mol m? s? 1) whilst enclosed in Perspex chambers in which temperature, vapour pressure deficit and photoenvironment were all controlled. Measurements of leaf extension, water relations, and cell wall extensibility (VVEX) were made at the end of a 3 h exposure period. For leaves of birch, reducing the fluence rate resulted in reduced leaf extension and a lowering of WEX. Exposure of sycamore seedlings for 3 h to different <b>values</b> of <b>PAR</b> had little effect on the growth of leaves and WEX remained constant. The characteristics of net photosynthesis also differed for the two species and photosynthesis and wall loosening may be linked. Since natural woodland shadelight, in addition to reduced PAR, also has a reduced R/FR ratio, a second group of seedlings were placed in a photoenvironment which simulated shadelight (low PAR, R/FR) for 28 d. This treatment reduced extension rate and final leaf size for both species. Measurements of extension, water relations and WEX made when seedlings were exposed to shadelight whilst held in the Perspex chambers revealed differences in the control of leaf growth for the two species. It is confirmed that leaves of birch are highly responsive to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>PAR</b> with cell wall loosening the most likely process controlling this response...|$|R
5000|$|Because <b>par</b> <b>value</b> {{was such}} an {{unreliable}} indicator of the actual value of stock, and because high <b>par</b> <b>values</b> could create liability for investors if the corporation went into bankruptcy, corporate lawyers began advising their clients to issue stocks with low <b>par</b> <b>values.</b> The legal capital or [...] "stated capital" [...] of the corporation would still be determined based on <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> but the balance sheet would include the investment over <b>par</b> <b>value</b> as a capital surplus, and everything would still balance.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{examined}} {{the vision and}} practices of a beginning first grade literacy teacher in an urban school district. I used action research methods to collaborate with the teacher in her classroom based on her needs and take action with her in response to themes we generated together. As the teacher used and reflected upon literacy instruction while I worked within her classroom, we both explored how the lessons from her work and our collaboration might inform literacy pedagogy as well as teacher education. My first research question examined how my participant conceptualized and acted upon her conceptualizations of sociocultural models of literacy. My second question explored the action implications of this collaborative inquiry, as it applied to both her classroom and my teacher education work. My research also drew from the tradition of participatory action research (PAR), which involved the teacher's "praxis" (Freire, 1970), reflection and action to affect <b>change.</b> <b>In</b> <b>PAR</b> tradition, together the teacher and I used the data we collected to address issues of relevance to her, through the action components of classroom teaching as well as professional co-presentations for preservice teachers on literacy instruction in urban schools. The overall emerging construct was the concept of literacy teaching as the facilitation of classroom community. The following categories arose beneath this overall construct: community as teacher vision, community as teacher strategy, community as love, and community as challenge. Finally, I used these emerging themes to theorize tentatively on implications for teacher education; I suggested that teacher education should prioritize promoting love and vision as the backbone to support teachers' development strategies and challenges. Overall, my analysis suggested the constructs of literacy pedagogy as "community" and teacher education as "professional accountability. ...|$|R
