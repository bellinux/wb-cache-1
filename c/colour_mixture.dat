5000|$|Joseph Albers' book [...] "Interaction of Color" [...] {{is widely}} {{influential}} but, according to Lee, {{has not received}} close critical attention. Lee undertakes to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to show that Albers' system of perceptual education is fundamentally misleading (Albers 'places practice before theory'). Four topics in Albers' account of colour are examined critically: additive and subtractive <b>colour</b> <b>mixture,</b> the tonal relations of colours, the Weber-Fechner Law and simultaneous contrast. In each case Albers is shown to have made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his general claims about colour and his pedagogical method. It is suggested that Albers' belief {{in the importance of}} colour deception is related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). It is suggested that the scientific colour hypothesis of Edwin H. Land should be considered in lieu of the concepts held by Albers. Finally, there are implications for a reassessment of Albers' artworks that might follow a loss of faith in his colour concepts that seem to have been their foundation.|$|E

5000|$|Matsuki {{describes}} the purposes and techniques {{involved in the}} painting of Triumphal Return:The painting “Triumphal Return” {{was done in the}} epoch where the Vietnam War was nearing its zenith. The most vocal of all sentiments was that of 'anti-war'. The most immediate experience which inspired my theme was the one where I, by chance, attended the yearly ceremony of the local American Legion, Long Island New York, in which the entire procession was conducted seemingly most diffident and eventlessly hastened up way. The National Anthem was sung in hushed voices in disarray. The white rectangular military caps looked as forlorn as the brown of deserted piers.There was something moved me deep enough to plunge into my first major work, which the production of demanded total concentration for four months working every night (I painted during night.) Except for Saturday. I went to the movies during the day, to the bar at night for distraction.Preparation of painting surface was done by mixture of opaque and transparent regular oil color pigments produced by Windsor and Newton and Grumbacher which eventually took the hue of reddish dark brown. I used a commercially prepared cotton small grain canvas. So far acceptable for my rendition of details. On this prepared surface, of approximately 1~2 mm thickness of the pigment after sufficient dryness was achieved, I first transferred the final sketch of the theme using medium strength charcoal of commercial origin.Approximately 3 or 4 coats of a commercial brand fixative were applied before the execution of final underdrawing (cartoon) by oil <b>colour,</b> <b>mixture</b> of burnt umber and Prussian blue in various composition ratio for the purpose of shortening drying period, with pure turpentine, as medium.When the under-drawing was sufficiently dry, therefore accepting overlapping pigment application without causing surface damage, I began first application of painting, molding. Medium: pure turpentine plus linseed oil. Ratio, approximately 2 turp/1 linseed. Pigments used were burnt umber, optional Prussian blue and yellow ochre (in later paintings I changed this colour to Naples yellow, because of its larger covering strength and fast drying speed.)After adequate surface dryness of the so far monochromatic sketched first coat (at this level the entire pictorial plane was equally developed), the second coat was applied to achieve chromatic “mapping” according to the psychological connotation and aesthetic atmosphere desired by the theme.In this case, I began by using opaque-est possible pigments for the purpose of similar strength such as yellow ochre, cobalt blue, burnt sienna etc, and quick drying properties like umbers, prussian blue, naples yellow mixed by turp and linseed with aforementioned concoction ratio. At this stage the entire effect of the painting still presents monochromatic, relief-like quality, although proper hues were ascribed to the major areas of the composition. I call it “the view at dusk” for its similarity in chromatic effects.At this stage the painting surface began to appear “realistic” Since the canvas dimensions of “Triumphal Return” is rather large, 50" [...] by 60", the earlier applications became dry enough to accept further application by the time this coast was finished.Once this stage is achieved, real part of “painting” begins: rendering of the objects with utmost objective fidelity. The method I used for this purpose was glazing (thin application of transparent pigment) techniques employing pigments of high transparency such as alizarin crimson, ultramarine, prussian blue, verdian green, chrome yellow, aureolin, zinc white, ivory black, etc.I found later on that the family of “Thalo” had good property for glazing. Especially thalo violet was intriguing in its chameleon-like adaptation to the underlying hues. With same pigment, thalo violet, one can develop several nuances upon surfaces depending on the hues of previous application(s). Thalo family was considered by authority such as Ralph Meyer as comparatively safe but not time tested to the perfect desirability, which might take 500 years to complete. If the surface of “Triumphal Return” crumbles, then the Thalo family of pigments should be buried with it.When the entire pictorial surface was covered and safely dried, I used larger brushes such as 1inch or 1 inch flat, sable and fanshaped and or pig hair brushes, employing “wash” technique which is similar to second coating, to go over the entire canvas in order to achieve thematic and pictorial unity*. This is the final stage of the painting. When the surface becomes adequately dry, regular application of 3~4 coat of “retouch” varnish (I use this frequently to bring out sunk-in colors) was given to the entire pictorial surface. The final varnish by finish varnish was applied much later. In fact, after the exhibitory entry to the 1st NY International Art Show had been over. Pictorial unity: In this case the term is used to connote all the executional aspects utilized for the purpose of constructing pictorial surface."End of Matsuki's description of the painting of Triumphal Return.

At all ages (even before the onset of a chromatic response) the <b>colour</b> <b>mixture</b> to yield equiluminance was similar to that of adults, suggesting that the relative proportion and efficacy of medium- and long-wave cones is similar for infants as for adults. For both luminance and chromatic stimuli, amplitude increased roughly linearly with log-contrast, so sensitivity thresholds could be predicted by linear extrapolation to the abscissa. Detailed contrast sensitivity curves were measured for four infants at various ages. The results show that luminance and chromatic contrast sensitivity develop independently at different rates, probably reflecting differential development of postreceptoral neural mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{resource}} inventories {{are more}} and more based on quantitative spatial methods. The discrete classes of vegetation, soil, land cover etc. can be quantified by using membership maps rather than only crisp delineations. GIS methods to visually explore fuzziness and uncertainty of the prediction maps are clearly needed. The paper presents two relatively new techniques for visualisation of multiple membership maps and uncertainty of spatial prediction methods: Pixel Mixture (PM) and <b>Colour</b> <b>Mixture</b> (CM). The PM assigns classes to sub-pixels relatively to the membership value, while CM calculates average colour taking the memberships as weights. The PM technique appears to be more simple, "userfriendly " and easier to interpret. The CM technique requires a special fuzzy legend that also reflects taxonomic relations and can be therefore considered a double-continuous approach to mapping. The derived saturation of the map calculated using the CM technique gives us insight into the spatial and taxonomic confusion of our map. Both PM and CM can be both applied to visualize the confusion index or relative error together with the maps of estimates. In this case we used brightness correction and white pixels to include the relative uncertainty and confusion. These techniques will be further on developed to produce operational maps to be used in decision-making...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{interactive}} foreground/background segmentation in still images {{is of great}} practical importance in image editing. The {{state of the art}} in interactive segmentation is probably represented by the graph cut algorithm of Boykov and Jolly (ICCV 2001). Its underlying model uses both colour and contrast information, together with a strong prior for region coherence. Estimation is performed by solving a graph cut problem for which very efficient algorithms have recently been developed. However the model depends on parameters which must be set by hand and the aim of this work is for those constants to be learned from image data. First, a generative, probabilistic formulation of the model is set out in terms of a “Gaussian Mixture Markov Random Field ” (GMMRF). Secondly, a pseudolikelihood algorithm is derived which jointly learns the <b>colour</b> <b>mixture</b> and coherence parameters for foreground and background respectively. Error rates for GMMRF segmentation are calculated throughout using a new image database, available on the web, with ground truth provided by a human segmenter. The graph cut algorithm, using the learned parameters, generates good object-segmentations with little interaction. However, pseudolikelihood learning proves to be frail, which limits the complexity of usable models, and hence also the achievable error rate. ...|$|E
40|$|Blending {{of chewing}} gums of {{different}} colours {{is used in}} the clinical setting, as a simple and reliable means for the assessment of chewing efficiency. However, the available software is difficult to use in an everyday clinical setting, and there is no possibility of automated classification of the patient's chewing ability in a graph, to facilitate visualisation of the results and to evaluate potential chewing difficulties. The aims of this study were to test the validity of ViewGum - a novel image analysis software for the evaluation of boli derived from a two-colour mixing ability test - and to establish a baseline graph for the representation of the masticatory efficiency in a healthy population. Image analysis demonstrated significant hue variation decrease as the number of chewing cycles increased, indicating a higher degree of <b>colour</b> <b>mixture.</b> Standard deviation of hue (SDHue) was significantly different between all chewing cycles. Regression of the log-transformed values of the medians of SDHue on the number of chewing cycles showed a high statistically significant correlation (r² = 0. 94, P < 0. 01). ViewGum eliminates drawbacks of previous two-colour chewing gum test methods by the simplicity of its application. The newly developed ViewGum software provides speed, ease of use and immediate extraction of clinically useful conclusions to the already established method of chewing efficiency evaluation and is a valid adjunct for the evaluation of masticatory efficiency with two-colour chewing gum...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} the figural dynamics of filling-in processes in figures {{with more than}} one possible figure-ground organisation. Using a central disk and two concentric rings as well as similar stimuli consisting of three nested squares or parallel stripes, we tested for filling-in with different equiluminant colour combinations. We observed four modes of filling-in: First, in most of the cases, the inner ring assumed the colour of the central disk and outer ring (M 1). Second, the central disk became filled-in with the colour of the inner ring, without any colour change on the outer ring (M 2). Third, in a first step, the colour of the inner ring spread onto the central disk; then, in a second step, the colour of the outer ring spread over the whole stimulus (M 3). This two step filling-in process has not been reported so far. Fourth, a mode (M 4) was sometimes observed that was characterised by the central disk and outer ring assuming the colour of the inner ring. Thus, colour filling-in or colour spreading proceeded both in a centripetal (periphery to fovea) as well as a centrifugal direction. The colours red and yellow proved to be stronger inducers than blue and green. Conversely, the latter colours became filled-in more easily than the former. The filled-in colour was always that of the inducing stimulus, i. e., there was no <b>colour</b> <b>mixture.</b> This suggests a long-range, neural process underlying filling-in under these conditions...|$|E

The author, a trained and practising visual artist considers this innovative visualisation as an exploration into the newly emerging visual {{language of the}} computer in similar vein {{to some of the}} NPR artists. The comprehension of virtual 3 D objects is achieved primarily through linear surface contouring. The colour of these 3 D surfaces is created by components intrinsic to the contour structure culminating in optical <b>colour</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The custom software, developed by the author, facilitates the application of the surface contouring to imported pre-constructed 3 D object’s surfaces, computing the contouring component configurations and dimensions.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{different}} colours, one {{presented to}} {{one eye and}} the other presented to the other eye, often create {{the impression of a}} third colour. This percept is known as binocular <b>colour</b> <b>mixture.</b> Here we use coloured stereograms to study binocular colour appearance. Vivid pastel colours are induced in monocular, achromatic patches, if these are placed in stereograms whose left and right images differ in colour. The build-up of the colours is slow and takes tens of seconds or even minutes in certain individuals. The induced colours remain visible during monocular viewing of the patch and decay gradually. The same colours are induced irrespective of whether the patches are placed in fusible or rivalrous stereograms. We show that these colour effects cannot be induced by monocular colour mechanisms, either alone or in combination with binocular colour mixing. We suggest that the colours are induced by a binocular feedback mechanism, which reduces colour differences between the colour appearances of two monocular images. Induced colours are not observed if the achromatic patches are binocular. However, induced colours are apparent if one switches to monocular viewing after prolonged binocular viewing of the binocular patches. This aftereffect suggests that binocular colour induction acts on the monocular representations of binocular images. We suggest that during binocular viewing the fast process of binocular colour mixing masks the changes in colour appearance produced by the much slower process of binocular colour induction...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} different assessment methods of a two-colour chewing gum test for masticatory efficiency to determine its validity for research and clinical purposes. Materials and methods: Twenty adult volunteers, eleven women and nine men (mean age of 27. 5 years), participated in this study. All participants perceived their masticatory efficiency as normal. The task was to chew five samples of a two-colour chewing gum for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 cycles respectively. Maximum bite force was measured. All samples were assessed twice by two independent operators both, as 'bolus' and after flattening to 1 mm thick 'wafers'. The latter were scanned and the unmixed pixels counted using Adobe Photoshop Elements((R)) to calculate the ratio of unmixed colour to the total surface. Results: Digital image processing confirmed a significant correlation between colour mixing and chewing duration (P < 0. 001). Subjective assessment proved less accurate with fair to substantial intra-examiner agreement for 'bolus' (0. 20 < kappa < 0. 63) and substantial to almost perfect agreement for 'wafer' (0. 60 < kappa < 0. 88). Inter-examiner agreement was consistently moderate or substantial only for specimen chewed 20 cycles or longer. No significant correlation was found between the <b>colour</b> <b>mixture</b> and the maximum bite force. Conclusion: Digital image processing of the two-colour chewing gum test specimen provides reliable quantitative data for chewing efficiency. Visual assessments were less reliable but might still be useful in screening for chewing deficiencies in a clinical setting. In this context, the test should be performed with a flattened specimen chewed, probably for 20 cycles...|$|E
40|$|Birds {{have five}} types of cone photoreceptor: four single cones and a double cone (Bowmaker et al., 1997). By convention, the single cones are called long (L), medium (M), short (S) and {{ultraviolet}} (UV) wavelength-sensitive (Fig. 1 A) (long-wavelength-sensitive is sometimes abbreviated to ‘LWS’, medium to ‘MWS’, and so forth). Each contains a different photopigment, and the spectral sensitivities of L, M and S cones are narrowed by a coloured oil droplet which filters incoming light (Partridge, 1989; Bowmaker et al., 1997). The fifth type, double cones (D), makes up {{approximately half of}} all cone photoreceptors. These have the same photopigment as the L cones, but a different oil droplet filter gives them a broader spectral tuning (Bowmaker et al., 1997). Chromatic coding Colour identifies lights or objects by their intensity or spectrum, while chromatic cues distinguish stimuli of differing spectral composition, irrespective of relative intensity. This requires a comparison of signals from photoreceptors of differing spectral sensitivity, typically by chromatic opponency. An eye with n cone (spectral receptor) types takes n samples of the spectrum, so lights are represented by a point in an n-dimensional receptor space. To use this retinal information fully, and so have n-chromatic vision, subsequent neural coding must retain n degrees of freedom. Humans have three photoreceptor types and trichromatic colour vision (i. e. a three-dimensional perceptual space). For other animals, {{it is helpful to}} distinguish the number of photoreceptor types from the number of degrees of freedom in behavioural use of colour. This number (i. e. the dimensionality of colour space) can be estimated by <b>colour</b> <b>mixture</b> experiments. If m appropriately chosen primary colours are necessary and sufficient to match any spectrum, colour vision has m degrees of freedom. Mixture experiments establish the dimensionality of colour, but do not show how it is coded neurally. Generally, this is by chromatic and achromatic mechanisms. Chromatic coding involves subtractive (opponent) interactions between receptor signals, while achromatic coding is by additive interactions or by one receptor type. Human colour vision has a single achromatic mechanism, which leaves the remaining two dimensions of colour to be encoded by chromatic mechanisms, called red–green and yellow–blue (Jameson and Hurvich, 1955; Wyszecki an...|$|E

40|$|Complementary colours {{have been}} {{researched}} for 340 years but {{little is known}} of their role in colour vision. Complementary colours are defined {{as a pair of}} colour stimuli which admix a given white (i. e. cancel all hue). This chapter aims to describe recent research of the roles of complementary colours in colour vision. Presently, only one role for complementary colours is accepted in the scientific literature: a colorimetric role in <b>colour</b> <b>mixture.</b> A second role, in chromatic induction, was generally accepted until (erroneously) usurped 50 years ago by the opponent colours theory of chromatic induction. The visual system develops many functions from complementary colours (whose physiological basis is color-opponent cells in retina and cortex.) For a start, two of the cones (S and L, peaks about 445 and 568 nm) are complementary. The third cone (M, peak about 530 nm) complements the nonspectral hues. This chapter shows complementarism structures ten visual functions. First, complementary colours are shown to form hue cycle structure. Second, a relative wavelength scale is derived from dominant and complementary wavelengths, extended into nonspectral hues to form an overarching wavelength-based metric over the;whole hue cycle. Third, complementary wavelengths are shown to structure a colour constancy mechanism where constant hues and complementary constant hues form, remarkably, parallel straight lines (related by invariant wavelength ratios) in the plane of wavelength and reciprocal ilIuminant colour temperature. The relative wavelength scale is used to extend this grid-like mechanism into the nonspectrals. A key paper establishes a further seven roles, six by formulating math models for wavelength discrimination, u. mform hue, spectral sensitivity, saturation, chromatic adaptation, chromatic induction, from tbe ratio of either complementary wavelength intervals or complementary radiant powers. Complementary colours' II varied roles (including the colorimetric role) extend over the visual process from cones to cortex. These discrete roles have an overall structural role, in shaping functions to a trimodal framework (ROB peaks, complementary CMY troughs) which facilitates adapting functions to the illuminant. Thus the general role is evidently chromatic adaptation, for the purpose of colour constancy and improved image recognition in different iIIuminants. Given the role of complementary colours in colour constancy and hue discrimination, they may prove to be central to the visual process. 44 pages(s...|$|E

Complementary colours: the structure of wavelength discrimination, uniform hue, spectral sensitivity, saturation, chromatic adaptation and induction [...] Conclusion. Complementary colours have been studied in science for over 300 years but little is known of their role in colour vision. Complementary colours are defined {{as a pair of}} colour stimuli which, with appropriate complementary wavelengths and ratios of radiant powers, admix a selected white (e. g. that of the illuminant). The thesis aim is to find and describe roles of complementary colours in colour perception. Only one role is generally accepted in the scientific literature: a colorimetric role in <b>colour</b> <b>mixture</b> and matching. A second role, in chromatic induction, was widely accepted until (erroneously) usurped 50 years ago by the opponent colours theory of chromatic induction. This thesis stemmed from signs that the visual system structures various visual functions from complementary colours. [...] Complementarism is shown to structure ten functions. For six of the functions, math models are formulated from complementary colours. The first three, closely related, papers describe three roles in colour constancy (see Appendix: Definitions), hue cycle structure, and hue cycle relative wavelength metric. Paper 1 describes complementary wavelengths' central role in a spectral mechanism of colour constancy, where constant hue and its complementary constant hue form parallel straight lines. Paper 2 establishes the roles of complementary colours in forming hue cycle structure and its wavelength-based metric. Dominant wavelength is extended into the nonspectrals/purples to form a relative wavelength scale over the whole cycle. Paper 3 utilises this scale to extend Paper 1 's spectral mechanism of colour constancy into the nonspectrals to complete the global mechanism. Paper 4 argues that chromatic induction is governed by complementary colours rather than opponent colours. Paper 5 formulates math models for six roles, in chromatic induction, wavelength discrimination, uniform hue, spectral sensitivity, saturation, and chromatic adaptation, from the ratio of either complementary wavelength intervals or of complementary powers; a seventh role, in three-dimensional color discrimination, is described. The total eleven varied roles (including the known colorimetric role) have a wide influence over the visual process from cones to cortex. These discrete roles indicate an overall role of complementary colours is structural, in shaping functions to a trimodal framework (RGB peaks and complementary CMY troughs), whose implicit purpose is to adapt functions to the illuminant. Thus, it is concluded the general role is colour constancy. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 164 leaves ill. (some col. ...|$|E
40|$|Characterization and {{conservation}} of {{materials used in}} contemporary art are a big challenge for scientists and restorers because of the huge variability and the large heterogeneity of their use and compositions. The aim of this work is {{to contribute to the}} knowledge of the composition of new materials extensively applied in contemporary artworks, namely the marker pen inks. Marker pen inks represent a serious problem for restorers as they fade in a few years, changing colour and shade. Moreover, they are often soluble in the commonly used solvents. This research is performed in collaboration with the Fondazione Federico Fellini, owner of more than 500 original drawings of the famous movie director most of them realised by marker pens. In this work, we report, for the first time, Raman spectra of marker pen original and laboratory drawings. Studies of the laboratory samples have been complemented by thin layer chromatography in order to separate the complex <b>colouring</b> <b>mixture</b> into its individual components. Raman spectra of yellow, orange and red standard samples of two consumer and two professional brands have been recorded and identified. A comparison among old and new marker pen inks composition is discussed, and inferences are drawn about the brand likely used in the two originals. Interestingly, we notice that food additives are often used as colour agents in marker pen inks and report here their standard Raman spectra. This study puts into evidence the need for a reliable standard database of pigments and dyes. "...|$|R

Liposome sample (0.5  mL) was homogenised with 2.5  mL of TBARS solution (0.375  % thiobarbituric acid, 15  % TCA and 0.25  M HCl). The mixture was heated in boiling water for 10  min to develop the pink <b>colour.</b> The <b>mixture</b> was then cooled with running water and centrifuged at 5000 xg for 10  min at room temperature using Hettich centrifuge (Hettich Model MIKRO- 20, Tuttlingen, Germany). The supernatant was collected and the absorbance at 532  nm was read using a spectrophotometer. TBARS value was calculated from a standard curve of malondialdehyde (MDA) (0 – 10  mg/L) and expressed as mg MDA/L lecithin liposome.|$|R
40|$|The Modular System {{draws on}} {{traditional}} wood engraving, woodcut and letterpress practices. It comprises two printing surfaces and printing furniture specifically devised to facilitate offset and transfer relief printing. Rigid acetal resin tint blocks, hand or laser engraved, generate tone or colour {{that may be}} applied {{to more than one}} image. Multiple overprinting produces variant <b>colour</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Their function is similar to late nineteenth-century tints devised for colour letterpress printing. Compound printing surfaces of linoleum or vinyl are segmented and joined to make removable and replaceable parts. They print variable configurations in a process that resembles historical solutions to simultaneous colour printing: from the Mentz Psalter (1475), to the compound plates of William Congreve (1820) and the segmented wood engravings of John Holt Ibbetson (1819). These compound surfaces also act as receptors for impressions from the tint blocks. Repositioning and offsetting them is expedited by press furniture especially devised for the project. Registration devices are based on the simple Japanese kent? system and laser-cut circular chases derived from traditional letterpress furniture. Printing the tint blocks directly onto the flexible compound surfaces produce two viable prints that are offsets of each other. They are reversed, but one offset is also tonally inversed. It is this unpredictable tonality that has driven this experimental project. Both the construction and processes developed using the Modular System directed historical research into functional colour relief printing which consequently unearthed examples that would influence the further development of the project. This has generated both devices and processes capable of wider applications. Printing surfaces employed in the Modular System may be laser engraved or cut and adapted to use in both lithography and intaglio printmaking...|$|R
