50|$|Dr. Ahmad Khan Jamil (Urdu/; born 12 May 1939) is a Pakistani {{anaesthetist}} who {{is credited}} for inventing a non-kink <b>catheter</b> <b>mount</b> used in anaesthesia, an improvement of conventional catheters. He has also devised a simple device for teaching controlled ventilation of lungs. The device is helpful for training of young doctors on artificial ventilation during anaesthesia.|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from his}} {{services}} in his medical profession, Dr.A.K Jamil also {{paid attention to}} scientific research and invention. For instance he invented the Non-kink <b>catheter</b> <b>mount</b> used in anaesthesia which {{was better than the}} standard catheters. Catheter mounts made of plane rubber tubing kink when bent, while those made of corrugated rubber tubing kinked when twisted. This causes a great deal of inconvenience during anaesthesia for neurosurgery and other operations performed on the head and neck. To overcome this difficulty, Dr.A.K Jamil (Anaesthetist, Manchester) designed the <b>catheter</b> <b>mount</b> which he named ''''Non-kink catheter mount''''. He also devised a simple device for teaching controlled ventilation of the patient's lungs. The device is helpful for training of young doctors on artificial ventilation during anaesthesia. He also designed Humeral Epicondyle Holder for use in orthopaedic surgery. Orthopedic surgeons experienced difficulty while holding the rather small and slimy distal fragment of the bone. Humeral Epicondyle holder has therefore been designed to overcome this difficulty. Dr. Jamil designed the instrument in 1968 and submitted its details to The Bath Institute of Medical Engineering (BIME). U.K in 1969. The leading manufacturer - Downs Brothers Myre & Phelps Ltd.(Church path, Mitcham, Surrey, England) manufactured it in 1971. He also designed a simple device for blind tracheal intubation and paediatricendotracheal tube. (manufactured by Portex Ltd; Hythe, Kent, England). Besides medicine, his researches involve physics, Engineering, electricity, magnetism and others. He wrote a book titled [...] "Magnetic vacuum and high pressure" [...] in 1971 which has now become part of the British National Bibliography (BNB).|$|E
40|$|A {{control scheme}} based on {{physiological}} parameters for the inflation of an intra-aortic clamping balloon is presented. Automatic volumetric pumps for the inflation of balloon catheter have been largely developed, although the process modelling for <b>catheter</b> <b>mounted</b> balloon’s inflation has never been discussed. Automatic inflation is a key issue for autonomous positioning and navigation of an intra-aortic catheter. This work explores the possibility of modelling the inflation process for a <b>catheter</b> <b>mounted</b> balloon, proposing a first order model. The pole’s position depends by the catheter’s hydraulic resistance and by {{the sum of the}} aorta’s and balloon’s compliance. Main advance of this control scheme is the fact of taking into account a physiological parameter, integrating it in the control algorithm. The estimation of the aorta’s compliance can be done either with in-vitro experiments or at the same time while controlling the pump by means of an adaptive control scheme. The scheme was applied to control a volumetric pump and tested in vitro and in vivo, showing a reasonable settling time, rise time and overshoot. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Compared with {{urethral}} catheterisation, suprapubic catheterisation {{is associated}} with a reduced incidence of urinary infection and urethral stricture and it facilitates a controlled trial of micturition. A prospective comparison of two types of suprapubic catheter was performed in 70 patients, using a specially designed <b>catheter</b> <b>mounted</b> on a trocar for insertion (Suprapubic Ingram Trocar), and a disposable trocar and cannula (Add-a-Cath) and standard Foley catheter. A suprapubic catheter was inserted successfully in 63 patients. Overall there was a low incidence of urinary tract infection (4. 3 %) and the only significant catheter-related problem was suprapubic leakage of urine, which was self-limiting in all but one patient. Although there is little objective difference between the systems tested, we prefer the Add-a-Cath system for its simplicity and economy. This trial provides further support for the more frequent use of suprapubic catheters in general surgical practice...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{introduced}} plastic swivel connectors (both autoclavable and disposable) {{were examined}} under laboratory conditions for gas leakage. The leak from the autoclavable connectors before autoclaving nearly always exceeded 5 %. Although this leak was diminished after autoclaving, the swivelling property was greatly decreased. The position of maximal leakage {{was found to}} vary with {{the position of the}} connector on the tracheal or tracheostomy tube adaptor. The magnitude of the leaks obtained varied, only the disposable connectors complying with our own criteria. Comparison of the plastic connectors was made with one type of metal swivel connector which was also found to be acceptable for clinical use. Lightweight plastic connectors capable of rotating through 360 ° are available for connecting tracheal or tracheostomy tube adaptors to a <b>catheter</b> <b>mount.</b> Their swivelling property allows repositioning of ventilator tubing without disconnecting the patient and reduces torsion forces and drag on the tracheal or tracheostomy tube. This could diminish the occurrence of uneven pressure areas, ulceration of surrounding tissues and possible displacement of the tube. Because such connectors are so mobile there is a danger of gas leakage. The present study was de-signed to investigate this possibility. Two types of plastic swivel connectors were tested; one was suit-able for sterilization in an autoclave and the other was disposable. The results were compared with those from a metal connector possessing similar properties. DESIGN OF CONNECTORS Autoclavable plastic connector. The construction of this swivel connector (Portex Ltd, Hythe, Kent) is shown in figure 1. It is a right-angled tube made from acetyl copolymer; one limb connects to a <b>catheter</b> <b>mount,</b> the other houses an inner female 15 mm internal diameter connection which can be push fitted on to a male 15 mm tracheal tube adaptor. There is a suction port at the elbow which is normally closed with a polypropylene stop...|$|E
30|$|High aerosol {{impaction}} on the {{endotracheal tube}} and the trachea (20 – 27  % of the nominal dose) {{was measured with}} both modes. Larger particles which were generated at the inlet of the endotracheal tube directly impacted the lumen of the endotracheal tube. Higher impaction during pressure support is explained by the higher inspiratory flow rate inherent to this ventilation mode. Previous scintigraphic studies reported a comparable aerosol deposition within the ventilator circuit around 30  % [13, 14, 16]. However, we found a majority of aerosolized particles deposited on the proximal pieces of the ventilator circuit (proximal flow sensor, the <b>catheter</b> <b>mount</b> and the nebulizer T-piece).The expiratory filter captured around 20  % of aerosolized particles. Our nebulizer generated particles proximally during the entire breathing cycle. Particles were captured on proximal pieces of the ventilator circuit or directly lost on the expiratory limb during the long expiratory time measured in this study [7, 38].|$|E
40|$|We present our {{experience}} in retroperitoneal interventions with 2 <b>catheter</b> <b>mounted</b> glove fingers through 2 access points. Methods: Patients {{were placed in}} the lateral decubitus position, and the retroperitoneum was accessed by blunt dissection through a 10 -mm transverse skin incision on the posterior axillary line. Another incision was performed through the anterior axillary line, and the surgeon inserted his finger to dissect the muscle layers in the retroperitoneum to develop an initial space to place the glove finger balloon, which was attached to a 14 -F Nelaton catheter. Results: This technique was performed on 32 patients. The mean operation time was 57. 4 ± 26. 7 minutes. A satisfactory retroperitoneal space for the operation was provided and both balloons inflated to 500 mL. No complications were observed.

30|$|Viabahn stent grafts {{are covered}} self-expanding nitinol stents used in {{peripheral}} vessels, owing to their flexibility, durability and patency rates. These devices are <b>catheter</b> <b>mounted</b> and usually advanced into the desired position within an introducer sheath, and then revealed once in position. Once revealed, the device {{should not be}} re-withdrawn into the sheath. The aim of the introducer sheath is to avoid the device becoming snagged on calcified atheroma as manipulation can result in the device deploying prematurely of causing separation of the <b>mounting</b> <b>catheter.</b> Device delivery is achieved by pulling a drawstring at the device sheath hub. In this case, the RCA already had 2 overlapping stents. As a result the inner lumen was too constrained to allow a parent sheath to pass through; given the emergency nature of this case the Viabahn device was gently advanced into position through the preexisting stents not inside the a parent sheath. This was achieved with slow advancement of the device and magnified high-pulse rate fluoroscopy. Advantage wire provided a sufficiently stable platform to safely perform this maneuver. In the reviewed literature {{there is a single}} other case of a 5 [*]mm Viabahn stent used to treat a coronary pseudoaneurysm. The authors describe the flexible self-expanding nature of the stent provides good apposition within the vessel (Kim et al., 2017). In this case the Viabahn stent flared at either end, sealing the endoleak.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{presence}} of angina pectoris and myocardial scarring {{in patients with}} hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) suggests that myocardial ischemia {{is a factor in}} the pathophysiology of the disease. The clinical evaluation of ischaemia is problematic in HCM as baseline electrocardiographic abnormalities are frequent and thallium- 201 perfusion abnormalities correlate poorly with anginal symptoms. Coronary sinus pH measurement using a <b>catheter</b> <b>mounted</b> pH electrode is a validated sensitive technique for the detection of myocardial ischaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: 11 patients with HCM and chest pain (eight men; mean (SD) (range) age 36 (11) (19 - 53) years) and six controls (two men; mean (SD) (range) age 49 (11) (31 - 62) years) with atypical pain and normal coronary angiograms were studied. Eight patients with HCM had baseline ST segment depression of > or = 1 mm and four had reversible perfusion defects during stress 201 TI scintigraphy. A <b>catheter</b> <b>mounted</b> hydrogen ion sensitive electrode was introduced into the coronary sinus and pH monitored continuously during dipyridamole infusion (0. 56 mg/kg over four min). The maximal change in coronary sinus pH during dipyridamole stress was greater in patients with HCM than in controls (0. 082 (0. 083) (0 to - 0. 275) v 0. 005 (0. 006) (0 to - 0. 012), P = 0. 02). In six patients (four men; mean (SD) (range) age 29 (9) (19 - 40 years) the development of chest pain was associated with a gradual decline in coronary sinus pH (mean 0. 123 (0. 089)), peaking at 442 (106) s. There were no relations among left ventricular dimensions, maximal wall thickness, and maximum pH change. In patients with HCM there was a correlation between maximum pH change and maximum heart rate during dipyridamole infusion (r = 0. 70, P = 0. 02). CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence that chest pain in patients with HCM is caused by myocardial ischaemia. The role of myocardial ischaemia in the pathophysiology of the disease remains to be determined but coronary sinus pH monitoring provides a method for quantifying and prospectively assessing its effects on clinical presentation and prognosis...|$|R

40|$|We studied endotracheal suctioning-induced {{alveolar}} derecruitment and its prevention in nine {{patients with}} acute lung injury. Changes in end-expiratory lung volume measured by inductive plethysmography, positive end-expiratory pressure-induced alveolar recruitment assessed by pressure-volume curves, oxygen saturation, and respiratory mechanics were recorded. Suctioning was performed after disconnection from the ventilator, through the swivel adapter of the <b>catheter</b> <b>mount,</b> with a closed system, {{and with the}} two latter techniques while performing recruitment maneuvers during suctioning (40 cm H 2 O pressure-supported breaths). End-expiratory lung volume after disconnection fell more than with all other techniques (- 1, 466 +/- 586, - 733 +/- 406, - 531 +/- 228, - 168 +/- 176, and - 284 +/- 317 ml after disconnection, through the swivel adapter, with the closed system, and with the two latter techniques with pressure-supported breaths, respectively, p < 0. 001), and was not fully recovered 1 minute after suctioning. Recruitment decreased after disconnection and using the swivel adapter (- 104 +/- 31 and - 63 +/- 25 ml, respectively), was unchanged with the closed system (- 1 +/- 10 ml), and increased when performing recruitment maneuvers during suctioning (71 +/- 37 and 60 +/- 30 ml) (p < 0. 001). Changes in alveolar recruitment correlated with changes in lung volume (rho = 0. 88, p < 0. 001) and compliance (rho = 0. 9, p < 0. 001). Oxygenation paralleled lung volume changes.

30|$|Right {{and left}} lung {{deposition}} was separately measured using a rectangular ROI dimensioned on lung outlines from the 15  % isocount contour of the 81 mKr radioactive gas scan [23]. Whole lung deposition {{was derived from}} the quantification of counts included in these both ROIs. Counts correction for background, decay and attenuation was performed as described in previous studies [23 – 25] (Additional file 1). A right to the left lung deposition ratio was calculated to compare both lung depositions. A penetration index defined the penetration of aerosol particles from an inner to an outer rectangular lung region designed from the 81 mKr ventilation scan and reported on the 99 mTc-DTPA scan. The penetration index was calculated as the outer to inner lung region ratio (O/I) from the 99 mTc-DTPA acquisition normalized to the O/I ratio from the 81 mKr gas acquisition as described previously [23]. Extrapulmonary deposition was determined by the total count measured in the nebulizer reservoir minus whole lung count. Deposition analysis within the endotracheal tube and the trachea was determined by the total extrapulmonary deposition minus the total count in the ventilator circuit and retained in the expiratory filter and the nebulizer reservoir. It was grouped due to the difficult differentiation of the deposition in the distal part of the endotracheal tube and the trachea. Radiolabeled deposition on each component of the ventilator circuit and the expiratory filter was quantified using a ROI fitted to their size. According to the ventilator circuit, the term “proximal” was used when the pieces were close to the patient, i.e., the proximal flow sensor, the <b>catheter</b> <b>mount</b> and the nebulizer T-piece.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Transdiaphragmatic {{pressure}} (sniff PDI) during maximal sniffs is {{a useful}} clinical test of inspiratory muscle function. Although a normal range has been established for sniff PDI using air filled balloons, no comparable data are available for <b>catheter</b> <b>mounted</b> pressure transducers. METHODS [...] Using a single catheter with two pressure transducers 15 cm apart, oesophageal and gastric pressures were recorded in 50 normal volunteers (25 women), five of each sex from each decade between the third and seventh decades of life. Each subject performed 10 maximal sniffs at functional residual capacity. RESULTS [...] Mean (SD) sniff PDI was 149 (32) cm H 2 O in men and 127 (22) cm H 2 O in women. The lower limits of normal for sniff PDI (mean - 1. 96 x SD) after logarithmic transformation of the data were 95 and 78 cm H 2 O in men and women respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The {{pathogenesis}} of dyspnoea {{in patients}} with chronic heart failure is poorly understood. Static lung compliance is reduced in chronic heart failure. The relation between static lung compliance and exercise capacity and dyspnoea in chronic heart failure has been investigated. METHODS [...] Static lung compliance was calculated from expiratory pressure-volume curves in 18 patients with chronic heart failure (three women, mean age 62 years). <b>Catheter</b> <b>mounted</b> pressure transducers were used to measure changes in oesophageal pressure. Changes in lung volume were determined by integrating flow at the mouth, measured by a pneumotachograph. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class for dyspnoea was determined by a single observer. Patients underwent treadmill exercise to symptom limited maximum using staged and fixed rate protocols. Borg ratings for dyspnoea at submaximal exercise were measured. RESULTS [...] Static lung compliance, whether expressed as % total lung capacity (TLC) /cm H 2 O or % predicted TLC/cm H 2 O, was unrelated to NYHA class. Similarly, there was no relation between static lung compliance and exercise capacity with either protocol or with Borg ratings for dyspnoea at submaximal exercise, {{with the exception of}} that measured after 11 minutes of the staged protocol.

Materials and Methods: A 21 F urethral <b>catheter</b> was <b>mounted</b> to a metal spring. Participants were asked to press the tubing spring against a force gauge and stop when they met a level of resistance that would typically make them terminate a catheter placement. Simulated catheter insertion was repeated fives times, and peak compression forces were recorded. Healthcare professionals were divided into six groups according to their title: urology staff, non-urology staff, urology resident/ fellow, non-urology resident/ fellow, medical student, and registered nurse. Results: A total of fifty-seven healthcare professionals participated in the study. Urology staff (n = 6) had the lowest average insertion force for any group at 6. 8 ± 2. 0 Newtons (N). Medical students (n = 10) had the least amount of experience (1 ± 0 years) and the highest average insertion force range of 10. 1 ± 3. 7 N. Health care workers with greater than 25 years experience used significantly less force during catheter insertions (4. 9 ± 1. 8 N) compared to all groups (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: We propose the maximum force that should be utilized during urethral catheter insertion is 5 Newtons. This force deserves validation in a larger population and should be considered when designing urethral catheters or creating catheter simulators.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{reflected}} pressure wave in small children returns earlier than that in adolescent. The reason of early return of the reflected pressure wave in infancy is their height. The short distance between heart and reflection point makes the reflected pressure wave returning to the heart earlier. In adult, the early return (during systole) of the reflected pressure wave means disadvantage to cardiac blood supply-workload balance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to clarify whether the early return of the reflected pressure wave in small children impairs the cardiac blood supply-workload balance. This study enrolled 37 small left-to-right shunt patients with normal aortic circulation below 15 years of age. The aortic pressure waveform was recorded using a pressure sensor <b>mounted</b> <b>catheter,</b> and augmentation index and subendocardial viability ratio were calculated. The age of patients was 6. 1 ± 3. 2 years. The augmentation index was 8. 7 ± 14. 3 % and the index had a negative correlation with patients' age (r = - 0. 6243, p < 0. 0001).

50|$|Outflow {{obstruction}} in cardiac veins by coronary sinus balloon occlusion {{fills the}} venous compartment and increases impedance to coronary artery inflow. This perfusion deficit is repaid by a hyperemic response {{initiated by the}} rapid fall of the elevated pressure after reopening of the balloon occlusion. Automated pressure control is therefore essential not only to optimize effectivity, but also to control these pressure responses in the coronary circulation. The continuous {{rise and fall of}} pressure gradients in the microvasculature is primarily of mechanical nature regaining access to deprived myocardium by excess perfusion and washout, but induces also the expression of vasoactive molecules. A balloon <b>mounted</b> <b>catheter</b> is inserted into the femoral vein along with a guide wire, and the catheter is fed into the coronary sinus. The coronary sinus is the primary vein of the heart and is responsible for collecting deoxygenated blood from a series of veins and delivering it to the right atrium. Once inside the coronary sinus, a console is responsible for orchestrating an inflation and deflation cycle of the balloon on the catheter. The blood pressure that occurs in the coronary sinus when it is blocked controls the cycle. The cycle is controlled by the pressure that occurs in the coronary sinus when it is blocked. The pressure increase redistributes flow into affected heart tissue thererby improving flow in the microcirculation. PICSO is a used therapy accompanying or as part of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} effects of {{ventilator}} circuit changes on the rate of airway infections and to investigate the relationship between the microorganisms responsible for circuit colonization and those responsible for infection. DESIGN: Prospective study, carried out in two different periods, of one year duration each. SETTING: General Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in a University Hospital. PATIENTS: Seventy-eight patients, requiring mechanical ventilation (VAM) for more than 5 days, were enrolled. They were divided into two groups: in the first (group I, n. 36, 1 st period) the ventilator circuit was changed every 5 days; in the second (group II, n. 42, 2 nd period) every 10 days. INTERVENTION: Ventilator circuit change every 5 or 10 days. Daily culvert and filling of cascade humidifiers with sterile irrigation water. Daily replacement of <b>mount</b> <b>catheter.</b> MEASUREMENTS: Qualitative cultures of tracheobronchial aspirate and of fluid from the humidifying cascades and the expiratory tubing traps. RESULTS: The two groups were similar. Pneumonia and tracheobronchitis were found in the 25 % and 11 % of patients of group I and in 26 % and 12 % of those of group II respectively. The VAM duration was 26. 5 +/- 15 days in patients who developed airway infection, and 12. 9 +/- 11. 6 days (p < 0. 001) in patients who did not. The Gram+ organisms were predominant. An identical microorganism was found both in the tracheo-bronchial aspirate and in the circuit in 44 of 78 (56 %) patients; no difference was found between infected (16 of 29) and non infected (28 of 49) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Changing the ventilator circuit every 10 days rather than every 5 days, does not increase the incidence of airway infections and result in considerable savings in the expenses of tubing and personnel time. The infection or colonization rates due to the same microorganisms are quite low and it seems not useful to make routine cultures of fluid from humidifying cascades and the expiratory tubing traps in order to characterize in time the microorganism that could be responsible of airway infections...|$|R
