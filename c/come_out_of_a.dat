5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> turn going faster.|$|E
25|$|In 1963 Hibs, battling to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> slump, paid £7,500 for Neil Martin from Queen of the South. Martin's goals helped add {{impetus to}} the club, and on 1 April 1964, Jock Stein was {{appointed}} manager of Hibernian. Within months of becoming manager he {{led them to}} Summer Cup success. The testimony of his contemporaries {{was that he was}} already “miles” ahead of everyone else in his understanding of the game, and in studying how the investment of energy could be tailored to maximum effect. Stein was immersing himself {{in the structure of the}} game while the rest simply went out and played.|$|E

500|$|According to Michael Newton, {{writing for}} the BFI, Kind Hearts and Coronets has {{retained}} the high regard of film historians. In 1964 The Spectator called it [...] "the most confident comedy ever to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> British studio", and the actor Peter Ustinov considered it the [...] "most perfect achievement" [...] of Ealing Studios, [...] "a film of exquisite construction and literary quality". Kind Hearts and Coronets is listed in Times top 100 and also at number six in the BFI Top 100 British films.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in May with the accompanying single, [...] "Pinball Wizard", a début performance at Ronnie Scott's, and a tour, playing {{most of the new}} album live. Tommy sold 200,000 copies in the US in its first two weeks, and was a critical smash, Life saying, [...] "...for sheer power, invention and brilliance of performance, Tommy outstrips anything which has ever <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recording studio". Melody Maker declared: [...] "Surely the Who are now the band against which all others are to be judged." [...] Daltrey had significantly improved as a singer, and set a template for rock singers in the 1970s by growing his hair long and wearing open shirts on stage. Townshend had taken to wearing a boiler suit and Doctor Martens shoes.|$|E
500|$|He {{began writing}} his first works {{when he was}} seventeen; these {{included}} a poem—heavily influenced by Percy Bysshe Shelley—that describes a magician who set up a throne in central Asia. Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop, a monk, and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds, as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and, according to the critic Charles Johnston, [...] "utterly unIrish", seeming to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "vast murmurous gloom of dreams". Although Yeats's early works drew heavily on Shelley, Edmund Spenser, and on the diction and colouring of pre-Raphaelite verse, he soon turned to Irish mythology and folklore and the writings of William Blake. In later life, Yeats paid tribute to Blake by describing {{him as one of}} the [...] "great artificers of God who uttered great truths to a little clan". In 1891, Yeats published John Sherman and [...] "Dhoya", one a novella, the other a story.|$|E

500|$|Because of his {{motor neurone}} disease, Hawking {{is unable to}} speak, and he {{communicates}} using a custom-made computer. With small movements of his body, Hawking writes a text onto the computer, which is then spoken by a voice syntheziser. Because of this, Hawking had to write all his lines on his computer, while the staff recorded them by placing a microphone {{in front of the}} computer's speaker. [...] "It's easy to do a fake Stephen Hawking in your comedy TV show", Selman said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "Any computer can sound just like his computer, but every line that we wrote for him, he typed in himself and we recorded with our microphones as if it had <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular mouth." [...] Some of Hawking's lines were difficult to record. In particular, the word [...] "Fruitopia" [...] was difficult for Hawking's computer to [...] "put together" [...] correctly, and it [...] "took forever" [...] to make the word sound right from the voice synthesizer.|$|E
500|$|Citizen Kane {{received}} {{good reviews}} from several critics. New York Daily News critic Kate Cameron called it [...] "one {{of the most}} interesting and technically superior films that has ever <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hollywood studio". New York World-Telegram critic William Boehnel said that the film was [...] "staggering and belongs at once among the greatest screen achievements". Time magazine wrote that [...] "it has found important new techniques in picture-making and story-telling." [...] Life magazine's review said that [...] "few movies have ever come from Hollywood with such powerful narrative, such original technique, such exciting photography." [...] John C. Mosher of The New Yorker called the film's style [...] "like fresh air" [...] and raved [...] "Something new has come to the movie world at last." [...] Anthony Bower of The Nation called it [...] "brilliant" [...] and praised the cinematography and performances by Welles, Comingore and Cotten. John O'Hara's Newsweek review called it the best picture he'd ever seen and said Welles was [...] "the best actor in the history of acting." [...] Welles called O'Hara's review [...] "the greatest review that anybody ever had." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have focused}} on the {{parallels}} between E.T.'s life and Elliott, who is [...] "alienated" [...] by the loss of his father. A.O. Scott of [...] The New York Times wrote that while E.T. [...] "is the more obvious and desperate foundling", Elliott [...] "suffers in his own way from the want of a home". E.T. is the first and last letter of Elliott's name. At the film's heart is the theme of growing up. Critic Henry Sheehan described the film as a retelling of Peter Pan {{from the perspective of a}} Lost Boy (Elliott): E.T. cannot survive physically on Earth, as Pan could not survive emotionally in Neverland; government scientists take the place of Neverland's pirates. Vincent Canby of The New York Times similarly observed that the film [...] "freely recycles elements from [...] Peter Pan and The Wizard of Oz". Some critics have suggested that Spielberg's portrayal of suburbia is very dark, contrary to popular belief. According to A.O. Scott, [...] "The suburban milieu, with its unsupervised children and unhappy parents, its broken toys and brand-name junk food, could have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Raymond Carver story." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon.com wrote, [...] "Spielberg's movies, despite the way they're often characterized, are not Hollywood idealizations of families and the suburbs. The homes here bear what the cultural critic Karal Ann Marling called 'the marks of hard use'." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Slow Life" [...] {{was written}} in two stages. According to bassist Guto Pryce the [...] "electronic part" [...] was {{composed}} by keyboard player Cian Ciaran [...] "quite a few years" [...] before its eventual release. The band had tried to fit this early, purely electronic, version on previous albums but had [...] "never got 'round to it". By the time the group came to record Phantom Power they were anxious to release the song, however Ciaran was reluctant to leave it in its original form and encouraged {{the rest of the}} band to jam over his original track. According to singer Gruff Rhys the instrumentation was recorded [...] "pretty much live" [...] after which lyrics were written and the band's 10-minute jam session was [...] "chopped ... up and made into a composed song" [...] with the electronic section intact. Strings were later added by Sean O'Hagan. Rhys has stated that renting their own studio in Cardiff has given the band the ability to work on tracks such as [...] "Slow Life" [...] over a period of years—the group visit the studio almost every day and play: [...] "the best parts on any of our records, I think, <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> couple of us being in our little room in Cardiff at three in the morning, just wigging out and being ecstatic in the music." ...|$|E
500|$|An oboe triplet figure then {{reveals the}} warm theme in G major of the Adagio non troppo section, a {{contrast}} to the prior cold landscape. The texture expands contrapuntally for the first time, culminates {{to a point where}} the tonality brightens to B major and, after a climax, wanes to G major again. The full strings are soon disturbed by an [...] "evil" [...] motif on woodwinds, playing the shivering element in Tempo giusto; tension between wind and strings intensifies as tonality shifts within instrumental groups in their respective directions. With a further clash, the music is menaced by the snare drum at a tempo (quarter note ♩=116) faster than that of the orchestra, and at its climax comes the instruction to the snare drummer by the composer to improvise [...] "as if at all costs he wants to stop the progress of the orchestra". (This instruction is not included in the 1950 edition of the score, being replaced by a written rhythmic line and instruction [...] "cad. ad lib." [...] after a few bars.) The warm theme eventually triumphs in a sustaining grandeur, as is affirmed by the snare drum actually joining the orchestral fanfare. When all subsides, echoes in woodwinds are heard and a solitary clarinet is left to mourn in a tragic atmosphere, recapturing ideas from the whole movements: [...] "Who would have thought that so much could have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gently waving viola line in empty space?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} The Line of Best Fit ranked [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] at number 6 {{on their list}} of the 50 Best Tracks of 2013 and wrote that it was [...] "easily {{one of the most}} vital pop songs of the year". Rolling Stone ranked the {{recording}} at number 23 on their list of the 50 Best songs of 2014 and compared the song's production to that of Lorde's music and the lyrics to those of Kesha's songs. Chris Jordan of Asbury Park Press deemed it {{as one of the best}} singles of that year and stated that [...] "it was refreshing to hear the debauchery depicted" [...] in the song. Echoing this thought, Chris DeVille of Stereogum ranked the track at number 26 on his list of Top 50 Pop Songs of 2014 and confessed that: [...] "For a song that derives much of its appeal from being out-of-control and over-the-top, 'Habits' is a work of extreme poise and precision from a pop songwriter with a blindingly bright future." [...] Entertainment Weekly 's Miles Raymer selected the line [...] "I eat my dinner in my bathtub / Then I go to sex clubs / Watching freaky people gettin' it on" [...] on his list of the best lyrics of 2014 and wrote that it was [...] "one of the most interesting images to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pop singer's mouth this year".|$|E

500|$|During the 2008 primaries, Gore {{remained}} neutral {{toward all}} of the candidates which led to speculation that he would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brokered 2008 Democratic National Convention as a [...] "compromise candidate" [...] if the party decided it could not nominate one. Gore responded by stating that these events would not take place because a candidate would be nominated through the primary process. Senator Ted Kennedy had urged Gore to endorse Senator Barack Obama though Gore declined. When Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president on June 3, 2008, speculation began that Gore might be tapped for the vice presidency. On June 16, 2008, one week after Hillary Clinton had suspended her campaign, Gore endorsed Obama in a speech given in Detroit, Michigan which renewed speculation of an Obama-Gore ticket. Gore stated, however, {{that he was not}} interested in being Vice President again. On the timing and nature of Gore's endorsement, some argued that Gore waited because {{he did not want to}} repeat his calamitous early endorsement of Howard Dean during the 2004 Presidential Election. On the final night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, shortly before Obama delivered his acceptance address, Gore gave a speech offering his full support. Such support led to new speculation after Obama was elected President during the 2008 Presidential election that Gore would be named a member of the Obama administration. This speculation was enhanced by a meeting held between Obama, Gore, and Joe Biden in Chicago on December 9, 2008. However, Democratic officials and Gore's spokeswoman stated that during the meeting the only subject under discussion was the climate crisis, and Gore would not be joining the Obama administration. On December 19, 2008, Gore described Obama's environmental administrative choices of Carol Browner, Steven Chu, and Lisa Jackson as [...] "an exceptional team to lead the fight against the climate crisis." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1930, Birkett was {{involved}} in the so-called Blazing Car murder case. On 6 November 1930, two men returning home in Northampton noticed a bright light in the distance and saw a man <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ditch {{at the side of the}} road, glance back toward the light and say [...] "looks like somebody has had a bonfire". The two young men ran toward the light, saw it was a burning car and fetched a policeman. When the fires died away, a body was found inside the boot of a car with a face so charred it was impossible to determine the identity of the man; the numberplate of the car was intact, however, and traced to an Alfred Arthur Rouse. Rouse was arrested and appeared at Northampton Crown Court on 26 January 1931, charged with the murder of an unknown man. He was defended by Donald Finnemore, and the Crown was represented by Birkett and Richard Elwes. Rouse was damned by a series of events. When arrested, he made statements such as [...] "I'm very glad it's over" [...] and [...] "I'm responsible" [...] and that the car engine had been off at the time of the fire, ruling out the possibility of accidental ignition. When he appeared as a witness, the defendant claimed that after giving an unknown man a lift, he had found that he was running out of petrol and had asked the passenger to take the spare can in the car and fill up the fuel tank. While he was doing this, Rouse testified that he went to the side of the road to urinate, and while there heard a large explosion. He said he saw a large flame and became convinced the petrol tank would explode. As such he ran away as fast as possible, at which point he ran into the two young men on the road.|$|E

He replied “That’s a little like asking a woman who’s just <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 38-hour labor and delivered a 12-pound baby, ‘Well, don’t {{you want to get}} pregnant again?'

2500|$|The poet/critic Randall Jarrell often praised Frost's {{poetry and}} wrote, [...] "Robert Frost, along with Stevens and Eliot, {{seems to me}} the {{greatest}} of the American poets of this century. Frost's virtues are extraordinary. No other living poet has written so well about the actions of ordinary men; his wonderful dramatic monologues or dramatic scenes <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knowledge of people that few poets have had, and they are written in a verse that uses, sometimes with absolute mastery, the rhythms of actual speech." [...] He also praised [...] "Frost's seriousness and honesty," [...] stating that Frost was particularly skilled at representing a wide range of human experience in his poems.|$|E

In the first Test, he took five wickets in an innings for the only time in his international career: his five for 64 dismissed England for 221 in their first innings and he took three more wickets in the second innings, though England won the match comfortably enough. His 66 in the fourth Test at Old Trafford was not just the highest score of his own Test career, it was also New Zealand's highest of the series.
