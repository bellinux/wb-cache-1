50|$|A serial {{interface}} does not exhibit timing skew {{because there is}} only one differential signal in each direction within each lane, and there is no external clock signal since <b>clocking</b> <b>information</b> is embedded within the serial signal itself. As such, typical bandwidth limitations on serial signals are in the multi-gigahertz range. PCI Express is one example of the general trend toward replacing parallel buses with serial interconnects; other examples include Serial ATA (SATA), USB, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), FireWire (IEEE 1394), and RapidIO. In digital video, examples in common use are DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort.|$|E
50|$|At the {{physical}} layer, DSI specifies a high-speed differential signaling point-to-point serial bus. This bus includes one high speed clock lane {{and one or}} more data lanes. Each lane is carried on two wires (due to differential signaling). All lanes travel from the DSI host to the DSI device, except for the first data lane (lane 0), which is capable of a bus turnaround (BTA) operation that allows it to reverse transmission direction. When more than one lane is used, they are used in parallel to transmit data, with each sequential byte in the stream traveling on the next lane. That is, if 4 lanes are being used, 4 bits are transmitted simultaneously, one on each lane. The link operates in either low power (LP) mode or high speed (HS) mode. In low power mode, the high speed clock is disabled and signal <b>clocking</b> <b>information</b> {{is embedded in the}} data. In this mode, the data rate is insufficient to drive a display, but is usable for sending configuration information and commands. High speed mode enables the high speed clock (at frequencies from tens of megahertz to over one gigahertz) that acts as the bit clock for the data lanes. Clock speeds vary by the requirements of the display. High speed mode is still designed to reduce power usage due to its low voltage signaling and parallel transfer ability.|$|E

Binary data storage in magnetic recording systems is accomplished by mapping sequences of 0 's and 1 's into patterns of magnetic flux changes along a track. With two-dimensional modulation codes, data is encoded in a manner such that <b>clocking</b> <b>information</b> can be derived from any number of those tracks while ensuring against intersymbol interference in each track individually. In this thesis, timing extraction for multiple parallel tracks in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise through a square-law device is studied and the design of the synchronizer circuitry is also presented.

40|$|Motivated by the {{importance}} of the clock synchronization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), due to the packet loss, the synchronization error variance is a random variable and may exceed the designed boundary of the synchronization variance. Based on the clock synchronization state space model, this paper establishes the model of synchronization error variance analysis and design issues. In the analysis issue, assuming sensor nodes exchange <b>clock</b> <b>information</b> in the network with packet loss, we find a minimum <b>clock</b> <b>information</b> packet arrival rate in order to guarantee the synchronization precision at synchronization node. In the design issue, assuming sensor node freely schedules whether to send the <b>clock</b> <b>information,</b> we look for an optimal <b>clock</b> <b>information</b> exchange rate between synchronization node and reference node which offers the optimal tradeoff between energy consumption and synchronization precision at synchronization node.

40|$|A {{document}} {{discusses the}} utilization of embedded clocks inside of operating network data links as an auxiliary clock source to satisfy local oscillator monitoring requirements. Modem network interfaces, typically serial network links, often contain embedded <b>clocking</b> <b>information</b> of very tight precision to recover data from the link. This embedded clocking data can be utilized by the receiving device to monitor the local oscillator for tolerance to required specifications, often important in high-integrity fault-tolerant applications. A device can utilize a received embedded clock {{to determine if the}} local or the remote device is out of tolerance by using a single link. The local device can determine if it is failing, assuming a single fault model, with two or more active links. Network fabric components, containing many operational links, can potentially determine faulty remote or local devices in the presence of multiple faults. Two methods of implementation are described. In one method, a recovered clock can be directly used to monitor the local clock as a direct replacement of an external local oscillator. This scheme is consistent with a general clock monitoring function whereby clock sources are clocking two counters and compared over a fixed interval of time. In another method, overflow/underflow conditions can be used to detect clock relationships for monitoring. These network interfaces often provide clock compensation circuitry to allow data to be transferred from the received (network) clock domain to the internal clock domain. This circuit could be modified to detect overflow/underflow conditions of the buffering required and report a fast or slow receive clock, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In {{magnetic}} recording greater area) bit packing densities are achieved through increasing track density by reducing space between and {{width of the}} recording tracks, and/or reducing the wavelength of the recorded information. This leads to the requirement of higher precision tape transport mechanisms and dedicated coding circuitry. A TMS 320 10 digital signal processor is applied to a standard low-cost, low precision, multiple-track, compact cassette tape recording system. Advanced signal processing and coding techniques are employed to maximise recording density and {{to compensate for the}} mechanical deficiencies of this system. Parallel software encoding/decoding algorithms have been developed for several Run-Length Limited modulation codes. The results for a peak detection system show that Bi-Phase L code can be reliably employed up to a data rate of 5 kbits/second/track. Development of a second system employing a TMS 32025 and sampling detection permitted the utilisation of adaptive equalisation to slim the readback pulse. Application of conventional read equalisation techniques, that oppose inter-symbol interference, resulted in a 30 % increase in performance. Further investigation shows that greater linear recording densities can be achieved by employing Partial Response signalling and Maximum Likelihood Detection. Partial response signalling schemes use controlled inter-symbol interference to increase recording density at the expense of a multi-level read back waveform which results in an increased noise penalty. Maximum Likelihood Sequence detection employs soft decisions on the readback waveform to recover this loss. The associated modulation coding techniques required for optimised operation of such a system are discussed. Two-dimensional run-length-limited (d, ky) modulation codes provide a further means of increasing storage capacity in multi-track recording systems. For example the code rate of a single track run length-limited code with constraints (1, 3), such as Miller code, can be increased by over 25 % when using a 4 -track two-dimensional code with the same d constraint and with the k constraint satisfied across a number of parallel channels. The k constraint along an individual track, kx, can be increased without loss of clock synchronisation since the <b>clocking</b> <b>information</b> derived by frequent signal transitions can be sub-divided across a number of, y, parallel tracks in terms of a ky constraint. This permits more code words to be generated for a given (d, k) constraint in two dimensions than is possible in one dimension. This coding technique is furthered by development of a reverse enumeration scheme based on the trellis description of the (d, ky) constraints. The application of a two-dimensional code to a high linear density system employing extended class IV partial response signalling and maximum likelihood detection is proposed. Finally, additional coding constraints to improve spectral response and error performance are discussed. Hewlett Packard, Computer Peripherals Division (Bristol...|$|E
