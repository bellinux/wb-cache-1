Early Han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from Qin law. A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, a {{moderate}} Republican, Daniel Henry Chamberlain, was elected South Carolina's governor, attracting even some Democratic votes.

That election campaign of 1876 was marked by violence, of which the most notorious occurrence was {{what became known as}} the Hamburg massacre. It occurred in Hamburg, South Carolina, a mostly black town across the river from Augusta, in Aiken County, bordering Edgefield County. The incident grew out of a confrontation on July 4 when a black militia marched in Hamburg and two white farmers in a buggy tried to ride through its ranks. Both sides filed <b>criminal</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> the other, and dozens of armed out-of-uniform Red Shirts, led by Butler, traveled to Hamburg on the day of the hearing, July 8.
