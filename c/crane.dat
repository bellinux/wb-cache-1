5|$|<b>Crane</b> {{starts to}} believe that a {{conspiracy}} links all the deaths together, so he looks into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett had made a new will just before he died, leaving all his possessions to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom <b>Crane</b> discovers was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. <b>Crane</b> deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), who would have inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that <b>Crane</b> suspects her father, burns all the evidence that <b>Crane</b> has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the removal}} of the Beardmore <b>Crane</b> in the 1970s and the Fairfield Titan in 2007, there are now four giant {{cantilever}} cranes on the River Clyde. The others are at Stobcross (Finnieston <b>Crane),</b> Scotstoun (Barclay Curle <b>Crane)</b> and Greenock (James Watt Dock <b>Crane).</b> Fewer than sixty giant cantilever cranes were built worldwide, six of them on the Clyde, and as of May 2011, it is believed only eleven remained, four of those on the Clyde.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, it was {{suggested}} that the brolga, sarus <b>crane</b> (Antigone antigone) and white-naped <b>crane</b> (Antigone vipio) formed a natural group on the basis of similarities in their calls. This was further confirmed by molecular studies of their DNA. These also showed that the brolga is more closely related to the white-naped <b>crane</b> than it is to the morphologically more similar sarus <b>crane.</b>|$|E

40|$|Wild Florida sandhill <b>cranes</b> (Grus canadensis pratensis) were {{captured}} in Florida during 3 years and translocated to Grand Bay Wildlife Management Area (GBWMA), Georgia, {{in an attempt}} to establish a resident population of Florida sandhill <b>cranes</b> in a location with suitable habitat but no known population of resident sandhill <b>cranes.</b> Translocated second-year subadult <b>cranes</b> commingled with migratory greater sandhill <b>cranes</b> (G. c. tabida) yet remained on GBWMA each year after the migratory birds left the area. Twenty-one of 35 released <b>cranes</b> were visually identified at least 5 months after release, 3 <b>cranes</b> more than 15 months following release, and 2 <b>cranes</b> 28 months after release. Six radio-fitted <b>cranes</b> were monitored more than 28 months following release. Successful reproduction of translocated <b>cranes</b> was also observed on the area (as many as 4 pairs of <b>cranes</b> were observed with chicks) which likely indicated the beginning of a residential population of <b>cranes.</b> The methods developed for this project may be useful for translocation of wild sandhill <b>cranes</b> into formerly occupied suitable habitats...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cranes</b> {{are often}} the most {{conspicuous}} machines on a construction site. This is due to their large size, {{in addition to the}} important role they have in transporting heavy payloads vertically and horizontally. There are two major families of construction cranes: tower <b>cranes</b> and mobile <b>cranes.</b> Mobile <b>cranes</b> that are mounted on tracks are a subgroup referred to as ``crawler cranes''. Crawler <b>cranes</b> are widely used on construction sites, and are a backbone of the United States construction industry, thus a detailed study of these cranes' behavior is essential. This research studies the tip-over stability of crawler <b>cranes</b> in heavy-lifting applications. Two major applications are discussed: crawler <b>cranes</b> using movable counterweights and crawler <b>cranes</b> in tandem lifting. M. S...|$|R

5000|$|Ship-to-shore gantry <b>cranes</b> {{are often}} used in pairs or teams of <b>cranes</b> in order to {{minimize}} the time required to load and unload vessels.

One example are systems where specialized berths built that accommodate one vessel at a time with ship-to-shore gantry <b>cranes</b> {{on both sides of the}} vessel. This allows for more <b>cranes</b> and double the workspace under the <b>cranes</b> to be used for transporting cargo off dock.|$|R
