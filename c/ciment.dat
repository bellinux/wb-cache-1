25|$|Concrete is a {{composite}} material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as <b>ciment</b> fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick scholar Michel <b>Ciment,</b> {{discussing}} Kubrick's {{attitude toward}} human aggression and instinct, observes: [...] "The bone cast {{into the air}} by the ape (now become a man) is transformed {{at the other extreme}} of civilization, by one of those abrupt ellipses characteristic of the director, into a spacecraft {{on its way to the}} moon." [...] In contrast to Ciment's reading of a cut to a serene [...] "other extreme of civilization", science fiction novelist Robert Sawyer, speaking in the Canadian documentary 2001 and Beyond, saw it as a cut from a bone to a nuclear weapons platform, explaining that [...] "what we see is not how far we've leaped ahead, what we see is that today, '2001', and four million years ago on the African veldt, it's exactly the same—the power of mankind is the power of its weapons. It's a continuation, not a discontinuity in that jump." ...|$|E
500|$|Part of the New Hollywood film-making wave, Kubrick's {{films are}} {{considered}} by film historian Michel <b>Ciment</b> to be [...] "among {{the most important}} contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century", and he is frequently cited {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential directors in the history of cinema. [...] Leading directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Wes Anderson, George Lucas, James Cameron, Woody Allen, Terry Gilliam, the Coen brothers, Ridley Scott, and George A. Romero, [...] have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and in the case of Spielberg, collaboration. On the DVD of Eyes Wide Shut, Steven Spielberg comments that the way Kubrick [...] "tells a story is antithetical to the way we are accustomed to receiving stories" [...] and that [...] "nobody could shoot a picture better in history". Writing in the introduction to a recent edition of Michel Ciment's Kubrick, film director Martin Scorsese notes that most of Kubrick's films were misunderstood when first released, and came to be regarded as masterpieces only in the years after their releases. Orson Welles, one of Kubrick's greatest personal influences and all-time favorite directors, said that: [...] "Among those whom I would call 'younger generation', Kubrick appears to me to be a giant." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{none of his}} {{features}} display graphic sex scenes, sexuality in Kubrick's films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the [...] "furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape" [...] in his films. He further points out that films like A Clockwork Orange are [...] "powerfully homoerotic", from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being [...] "made up with doll-like false eyelashes", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid (Aubrey Morris). British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be [...] "preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil", and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as [...] "black as coal", questioning his outlook on humanity. Although {{a few of his}} pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as Lolita and Dr. Strangelove, many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining [...] "the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us". <b>Ciment</b> notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost [...] "obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one".|$|E

500|$|The {{influence}} of 2001 on subsequent filmmakers is considerable. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and others, including many special effects technicians, discuss the impact {{the film has}} had on them in a featurette titled Standing on the Shoulders of Kubrick: The Legacy of 2001, included in the 2007 DVD release of the film. Spielberg calls it his film generation's [...] "big bang", while Lucas says it was [...] "hugely inspirational", labeling Kubrick as [...] "the filmmaker's filmmaker". Sydney Pollack refers to it as [...] "groundbreaking", and William Friedkin states 2001 is [...] "the grandfather of all such films". At the 2007 Venice film festival, director Ridley Scott stated he believed 2001 was the unbeatable film that in a sense killed the science fiction genre. Similarly, film critic Michel <b>Ciment</b> in his essay [...] "Odyssey of Stanley Kubrick" [...] stated, [...] "Kubrick has conceived a film which in one stroke has made the whole science fiction cinema obsolete." [...] However, others credit 2001 with opening up a market for films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, Blade Runner and Contact; proving that big-budget [...] "serious" [...] science-fiction films can be commercially successful, and establishing the [...] "sci-fi blockbuster" [...] as a Hollywood staple. Science magazine Discovers blogger Stephen Cass, discussing the considerable impact of the film on subsequent science-fiction, writes that [...] "the balletic spacecraft scenes set to sweeping classical music, the tarantula-soft tones of HAL 9000, and the ultimate alien artifact, the Monolith, have all become enduring cultural icons in their own right." ...|$|E
500|$|Kubrick met author Michael Herr through {{mutual friend}} David Cornwell (novelist John le Carré) in 1980, and became {{interested}} in his book Dispatches, about the Vietnam War. Herr had recently written Martin Sheen's narration for Apocalypse Now (1979). Kubrick was also intrigued by Gustav Hasford's Vietnam War novel The Short-Timers. With the vision in mind to shoot what would become Full Metal Jacket (1987), Kubrick began working with both Herr and Hasford separately on a script. He eventually found Hasford's novel to be [...] "brutally honest" [...] and decided to shoot a film which closely follows the novel. All of the film was shot {{at a cost of}} $17 million within a 30-mile radius of his house between August 1985 and September 1986, later than scheduled as Kubrick shut down production for five months following a near-fatal accident with a jeep involving Lee Ermey. A derelict gasworks in Beckton in the London Docklands area posed as the ruined city of Huế, which makes the film visually very different from other Vietnam War films. Around 200 palm trees were imported via 40-foot trailers by road from North Africa, at a cost of £1000 a tree, and thousands of plastic plants were ordered from Hong Kong to provide foliage for the film. Kubrick explained he made the film look realistic by using natural light, and achieved a [...] "newsreel effect" [...] by making the Steadicam shots less steady, [...] which reviewers and commentators thought contributed to the bleakness and seriousness of the film. According to critic Michel <b>Ciment,</b> the film contained some of Kubrick's trademark characteristics, such as his selection of ironic music, portrayals of men being dehumanized, and attention to extreme detail to achieve realism. In a later scene where United States Marines patrol the ruins of an abandoned and totally destroyed city, the theme song to the Mickey Mouse Club is heard as a sardonic counterpoint. The film opened strongly in June 1987, taking over $30 million in the first 50 days alone, but critically it was [...] overshadowed by the success of Oliver Stone's Platoon, released a year earlier. According to one review, notes co-star Matthew Modine, [...] "The first half of FMJ is brilliant. Then the film degenerates into a masterpiece." [...] Roger Ebert was not particularly impressed with it, awarding it a mediocre 2.5 out of 4. He concluded: [...] "Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is more like a book of short stories than a novel", a [...] "strangely shapeless film from the man whose work usually imposes a ferociously consistent vision on his material".|$|E
