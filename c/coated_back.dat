Her eye had swept the whole array of vehicles and had found them all empty, save one, {{in which she}} detected the blamelessly <b>coated</b> <b>back</b> of Mr. Arbuton. But I ought perhaps to explain Mrs. Ellison's motives better than they {{can be made to}} appear in her conduct. She cared nothing for Mr. Arbuton; and she had no logical wish to see Kitty in love with him. But here were two young people thrown somewhat romantically together; Mrs. Ellison was a born match-maker, and to have refrained from promoting their better acquaintance in the interest of abstract matrimony was what never could have entered into her thought or desire. Her whole being closed for the time about this purpose; her heart, always warm towards Kitty,--whom she admired with a sort of generous frenzy,--expanded with all kinds of lovely designs; in a word, every dress she had she would instantly have bestowed upon that worshipful creature who was capable of adding another marriage to the world. I hope the reader finds nothing vulgar or unbecoming in this, for I do not; it was an enthusiasm, pure and simple, a beautiful and unselfish abandon; and I am sure men ought to be sorry that they are not worthier to be favored by it. Ladies have often to lament in the midst of their finesse that, really, no man is deserving the fate they devote themselves to prepare for him, or, in other words, that women cannot marry women.|$|E
50|$|Carbonless {{copy paper}} {{consists}} of {{sheets of paper}} that are coated with micro-encapsulated dye or ink or a reactive clay. The back of the first sheet is coated with micro-encapsulated dye (referred to as a <b>Coated</b> <b>Back</b> or CB sheet). The lowermost sheet is coated on the top surface with a clay that quickly reacts with the dye to form a permanent mark (Coated Front, CF). Any intermediate sheets are coated with clay on top and dye on the bottom (Coated Front and Back, CFB).|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of the clay in different thicknesses to the blade allows the steel to cool more quickly along the thinner coated edge when plunged into the tank of water and thereby develop into the harder form of steel called martensite, which can be ground to razor-like sharpness. The thickly <b>coated</b> <b>back</b> cools more slowly retaining the pearlite steel characteristics of relative softness and flexibility. The precise {{way in which the}} clay is applied, and partially scraped off at the edge, is a determining factor {{in the formation of the}} shape and features of the crystalline structure known as the hamon. This distinctive tempering line found near the edge is one of the main characteristics to be assessed when examining a blade.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} #rst astronomical results with a cross-dispersed optical echelle {{spectrograph}} fed by a near single-mode #ber. We also presentonanovel {{design of a}} new adaptive optics #AO# optimized #ber-fed cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph. The spectrograph is designed to match with AO corrected images in the optical bands provided by such as the Mt. Wilson 100 inch, Star#re Optical Range 3. 5 m AO telescopes. Ultimately, it will be installed at the 6. 5 m MMT, when this has high resolution AO correcting the optical spectrum. The spectrograph, fed bya 10 micron fused silica #ber, is unique in that the entire spectrum from 0. 4 micron to 1. 0 micron will be almost completely covered at resolution 200, 000 in one exposure. The detector is a 2 kx 4 k AR <b>coated</b> <b>back</b> illuminated CCD with 15 micron pixel size. The close order spacing allowed by the sharp AO image makes the full cover possible.

40|$|Abstract—A {{heterogeneous}} high-performance quantum-cas-cade laser gain chip comprising two bound-to-continuum {{active region}} designs emitting at 8. 2 and 9. 3 m is presented. Its extrap-olated gain spectrum has a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 350 cm. Though a broad gain bandwidth invariably {{results in a}} reduced gain cross section, devices with a high-reflection <b>coated</b> <b>back</b> facet still lase continuous-wave (CW) up to a temperature of 50 C and demonstrates output powers in excess of 100 mW at 30 C. Such high performance was achieved by designing the wave-guide in a buried heterostructure fashion and epi-down mounting on a diamond submount, resulting in a thermal resistance of only 4. 8 K/W. In pulsed mode, we reached a peak output power of 1 W at room temperature. Finally, {{in order to prove}} the usability for broad-band tuning, this chip was antireflection coated on the front facet with a residual reflectivity of 2. 5 10 and used in our external cavity (EC) setup operated at room temperature. In pulsed mode, we were able to tune the gain chip over 292 cm, which is 25 % of center frequency. In CW, we reached a coarse tuning range of 201 cm (18 %) and an output power in excess of 135 mW at the gain maximum at 15 C. This gain chip enabled CW room temperature EC tuning with output powers in excess of 20 mW over 172 cm.
