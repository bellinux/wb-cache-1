25|$|Malbec is very {{susceptible}} to various grape diseases and viticultural hazards—most notably frost, <b>coulure,</b> downey mildew and rot but {{the development of}} new clones and vineyard management techniques have helped control some of these potential problems. When it is not afflicted with these various ailments, particularly <b>coulure,</b> it does have the potential to produce high yields. Too high a yield, as was the circumstance in Argentina until recently with their heavy use of flood irrigation, the wines become more simplistic and lacking in flavor. Malbec seems to be able to produce well in a variety of soil types but in the limestone based soils of Cahors it seems to produce its most dark and tannic manifestation. There are distinct ampelographical differences in the clones of Malbec found in France and in Argentina, with Argentine Malbec tending to have smaller berries.|$|E
25|$|As a varietal, Malbec {{creates a}} rather inky red (or violet), intense wine, {{so it is}} also {{commonly}} used in blends, such as with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to create the red French Bordeaux claret blend. The grape is blended with Cabernet Franc and Gamay in some regions such as the Loire Valley. Other wine regions use the grape to produce Bordeaux-style blends. The varietal is sensitive to frost and has a proclivity to shatter or <b>coulure.</b>|$|E
25|$|Merlot {{thrives in}} cold soil, {{particularly}} ferrous clay. The vine tends to bud early which gives it some risk to cold frost and its thinner skin increases its susceptibility to the viticultural hazard of Botrytis bunch rot. If bad weather occurs during flowering, the Merlot vine {{is prone to}} develop <b>coulure.</b> The vine can also be susceptible to downy mildew (though it has better resistance to powdery mildew than other Bordeaux varieties) and to infection by leafhopper insect varieties.|$|E
25|$|The grapevine was {{introduced}} to Australia in the 19th century and was mostly a bulk wine producing grape. The particular clones planted in Australia were of poor quality and highly susceptible to <b>coulure,</b> frost and downy mildew. By {{the mid to late}} 20th century, many acres of Malbec were uprooted and planted with different varieties. By 2000, there were slightly over 1,235 acres (500 hectares), with the Clare Valley having the most significant amount. As newer clones become available, plantings of Malbec in Australia have increased slightly.|$|E
25|$|The grape was {{historically}} a major planting in Bordeaux, providing {{color and}} fruit to the blend, {{but in the}} 20th century started to lose ground to Merlot and Cabernet Franc due, in part, to its sensitivities to so many different vine ailments (<b>coulure,</b> downy mildew, frost). The severe 1956 frost wiped out {{a significant portion of}} Malbec vines in Bordeaux, allowing many growers a chance to start anew with different varieties. By 1968 plantings in the Libournais was down to 12,100 acres (4,900 hectares) and fell further to 3,460 acres (1,400 hectares) by 2000. While Malbec has since become a popular component of New World meritages or Bordeaux blends, and it is still a permitted variety in all major wine regions of Bordeaux, its presence in Bordeaux is as a distinctly minor variety. Only the regions of the Côtes-de-Bourg, Blaye and Entre-Deux-Mers have any significant plantings in Bordeaux.|$|E
25|$|Pinot Meunier {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely planted grapes in France but it is rather obscure to most wine {{drinkers}} and will rarely be seen on a wine label. The grape has been favored by vine growers in northern France due to its ability to bud and ripen more reliably than Pinot noir. The vine's tendency to bud later in the growing season and ripen earlier makes it less susceptible to developing <b>coulure</b> which can greatly reduce a prospective crop. For the last couple of centuries, Pinot Meunier has been the most widely planted Champagne grape, accounting for more than 40% of the region's entire plantings. It is most prevalent in the cooler, north facing vineyards of the Vallee de la Marne and in the Aisne department. It is also widely grown in the Aube region in vineyards where Pinot noir and Chardonnay would not fully ripen.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, as Pomerol's {{transition}} to a red wine producing district was completed, Cabernet Franc was the dominant grape variety. However, an early spring frost in 1956 killed {{a large portion of}} the Cabernet Franc plantings and many estates took this event as an opportunity to replant with the higher yielding and earlier ripening Merlot. Despite Merlot's tendency to suffer from <b>coulure</b> if the weather is cold and rainy during flowering, the grape quickly rose to prominence in Pomerol and has become the grape most closely associated with the region. Nevertheless, very few Pomerols are pure Merlot and Cabernet Franc is still valued for the tannic structure and acidity it gives, which can add longevity and aging potential to the wines. In fact, as the trend of the late 20th and early 21st century towards harvesting Merlot later and at increasingly higher sugar levels has continued, the role of Cabernet Franc in balancing the opulent but potentially flabby nature of over ripe Merlot has become even more appreciated by Pomerol winemakers.|$|E
25|$|The Grenache vine is {{characterized}} by its strong wood canopy and upright growth. It has good wind tolerance (which is useful with the northerly Cierzo and Mistral winds that influence the regions of Aragon and the Rhone) and has shown itself to be very suited for the dry, warm windy climate around the Mediterranean. The vine buds early and requires a long growing season in order to fully ripen. Grenache is often {{one of the last}} grapes to be harvested, often ripening weeks after Cabernet Sauvignon. The long ripening process allows the sugars in the grape to reach high levels, making Grenache based wines capable of substantial alcohol levels, often at least 15% ABV. While the vine is generally vigorous, it is susceptible to various grape diseases that can affect the yield and quality of the grape production such as <b>coulure,</b> bunch rot and downy mildew due to the vine's tight grape clusters. Marginal and wet climates can increase Grenache's propensity to develop these viticultural dangers. The vine's drought resistance is dependent on the type of rootstock it is planted on but on all types of rootstocks, Grenache seems to respond favorably to some degree of water stress.|$|E
25|$|Just {{as having}} too little water is {{detrimental}} to the grapevine, so too is having too much. When vines become water-logged they become a target for various microbial agents such as bacteria and fungi that compete with the vine for nutrients in the soil. Additionally excessively moist soil is poor conductor of valuable heat radiating from the ground. In general wet soils are cold soils which can be especially problematic during the flowering causing poor berry set {{that could lead to}} <b>coulure.</b> It also becomes an issue during the ripening stage when vines in cool-climate regions may need additional heat radiated from the ground in order to sufficiently ripen its fruit (an example of this is the slate-based vineyards of the Mosel in Germany). Therefore, well draining soils are considered very conducive to producing quality wine. In general light-textured (such as sand and gravel) and stony soils tend to drain well. Soils heavy soils and those with high proportions of organic matter also have the potential to drain well if they having a crumbling texture and structure. This texture relates to the friability of the soil which can come from earthworms and other organisms that have burrowed tunnels throughout the soil. Much like rocks, these tunnels give water a freer passageway through soil and contributes to its drainage.|$|E
500|$|The Carménère grape {{has known}} {{origins in the}} Médoc region of Bordeaux, France and was also widely planted in the Graves until the vines were struck with oidium. It is almost {{impossible}} to find Carménère wines in France today, as a Phylloxera plague in 1867 nearly destroyed all the vineyards of Europe, afflicting the Carménère grapevines in particular such that for many years the grape was presumed extinct. When the vineyards were replanted, growers could not replant Carménère as it was extremely hard to find and more difficult to grow than other grape varieties common to Bordeaux. The region's damp, chilly spring weather gave rise to <b>coulure,</b> [...] "a condition endemic to certain vines in climates which have marginal, sometimes cool, wet springs", which prevented the vine's buds from flowering. Yields were lower than other varieties and the crops were rarely healthy; consequently wine growers chose more versatile and less coulure-susceptible grapes when replanting the vines and Carménère planting was progressively abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|In general, Cabernet Franc is {{very similar}} to Cabernet Sauvignon, but buds and ripens at least a week earlier. This trait allows the vine to thrive in {{slightly}} cooler climates than Cabernet Sauvignon, such as the Loire Valley. In Bordeaux, plantings of Cabernet Franc are treated as an [...] "insurance policy" [...] against inclement weather close to harvest that may damage plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon. Its early budding does pose the viticultural hazard of <b>coulure</b> early in the growing season. The vine is vigorous and upright, with dark-green, 5-lobed leaves. The winged bunches are elongated and small-medium in size. The berries are quite small and blue-black in color, with fairly thin skins. The Cabernet Franc grapevine is more prone to mutation than Cabernet Sauvignon, less so than Pinot noir.|$|E
2500|$|Harvesting time {{is crucial}} to winemaking, with the grape rapidly losing acidity {{as soon as it}} ripens. Some viticultural hazards include the risk of damage from springtime frost, as Chardonnay is an early-budding vine – usually a week after Pinot noir. To combat the threat of frost, a method {{developed}} in Burgundy involves aggressive pruning just prior to budburst. This [...] "shocks" [...] the vine and delays budburst up to two weeks, which is often long enough for warmer weather to arrive. Millerandage and <b>coulure</b> can also pose problems, along with powdery mildew attacking the thin skin of the grapes. Because of Chardonnay's early ripening, it can thrive in wine regions with short growing seasons, and in regions such as Burgundy, can be harvested before autumn rain sets in and brings the threat of rot.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{the annual}} growth cycle of other Piedmontese grape {{varieties}}, Nebbiolo {{is one of the}} first varieties to bud and last variety to ripen with harvest taking place in mid to late October. In some vintages, producers are able to pick and complete fermentation of their Barbera and Dolcetto plantings before Nebbiolo is even harvested. To aid in ripening, producers will often plant Nebbiolo in the most favored sites on south and southwestern facing slopes, which give the grape more access to direct sunlight. The most ideal location is at an elevation between [...] and must provide some natural shelter from wind. The vine is very susceptible to <b>coulure,</b> especially if there is wet weather during budbreak or flowering. While rains during this period can affect yield and quantity, rains that occur after the period of veraison can have a detrimental effect on quality. The most highly rated bottles of Piedmont Nebbiolo tend to come from vintages that had dry weather during September & October. Nebbiolo needs sufficient warmth to develop the sugars and fruit flavors needed to balance the grape's naturally high acidity and tannins. In cooler climate areas, such as the subalpine regions of Carema, Valtellina and Donnaz, the grape will produce medium bodied wines with bracing acidity and tannins that need the benefit of a warm vintage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stage of}} fruit set follows {{flowering}} almost immediately, when the fertilized flower begins {{to develop a}} seed and grape berry to protect the seed. In the Northern Hemisphere, this normally takes place in May and in the Southern Hemisphere in November. This stage is very critical for wine production since it determines the potential crop yield. Not every flower on the vine gets fertilized, with the unfertilized flowers eventually falling off the vine. The percentage of fertilized flowers averages around 30 but can get as high as 60 or be much lower. Climate {{and the health of}} the vine play an important role with low humidity, high temperatures and water stress having the potential of severely reducing the amount flowers that get fertilized. <b>Coulure</b> occurs when there is an imbalance of carbohydrate levels in the vine tissues and some berries fail to set or simply fall off the bunch. Varieties like Grenache and Malbec are prone to this abnormal fruit set. Millerandage occurs when some fertilized flowers do not form seeds but only small berry clusters. Grape berry size depends on the number of seeds so berries with no seeds will be significantly smaller than berries containing seeds. On one cluster there may be berries of various sizes which can create problems during winemaking due to the varying [...] "skin to pulp" [...] ratio among the grapes. This can be caused by vine disease, such as fanleaf, or by a boron deficiency in the vine. Gewürztraminer and the Chardonnay clones IA and Mendoza are both prone to millerandage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coulure</b> (pronounced coo-LYUR) is a viticultural hazard that is {{the result}} of {{metabolic}} reactions to weather conditions that causes a failure of grapes to develop after flowering. In English the word shatter is sometimes used. <b>Coulure</b> is triggered by periods of cold, cloudy, rainy weather or very high out-of-season temperatures. The condition is most often manifested in the spring. It also occurs in vines that have little sugar content in their tissue. Flowers stay closed and are not fertilized. Thus the vines are not pollinated as the grape fails to develop and falls off. <b>Coulure</b> can also cause irregular bunches of grapes which are less compact than normal. These bunches are more sensitive to developing various grape diseases. The yield of a vine with <b>coulure</b> will decrease substantially. Grape varieties with high proclivity to <b>coulure</b> are Grenache, Malbec, Merlot, and Muscat Ottonel. Other causes of <b>coulure</b> may be vineyard conditions and practices, pruning too early or too severely, excessively fertile soils or overuse of fertilizers, and improper selection of rootstocks or clones.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coulure</b> is a {{distinct}} phenomena unrelated to another viticultural hazard, millerandage, where the flowers are pollinated but the resulting berries develop with seeds and remain small. Like <b>coulure,</b> millerandage is often caused by inclement weather during the flowering and fruit set period and cause reduced yields.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coulure</b> is not 100% {{preventable}} but a vineyard manager {{can take}} several precautions {{to lessen the}} severity and impact of <b>coulure.</b> Some grape varieties {{are more prone to}} develop <b>coulure</b> than others, such as Grenache, Malbec, Merlot and Muscat Ottonel. A grower can choose to grow clones of those varieties, now commonly available for Merlot and Malbec, that have less susceptibility to developing <b>coulure.</b> In the vineyard, care can be taken to not prune so severely and insure that there is adequate leaf coverage for photosynthesis. Trimming the tips of developing shoots {{near the end of the}} flowering period can lessen the competition for sugar resources between berries and new shoot development. For non-organic viticulture, chemical growth inhibitors can be applied to the vine to limit shoot growth as well.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Malbec can {{be highly}} {{susceptible}} to <b>coulure</b> but newer clones are being produced with less sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coulure</b> {{is caused}} by a {{carbohydrate}} deficiency in the plant tissues that causes the vine to conserve resources that would otherwise be funneled into the developing grape berries. As carbohydrate levels drop, soon after flowering the stems connected to the berries shrivel as the small grapes (0.2 inches/5 millimeters in diameter) eventually fall off. To some extent <b>coulure</b> and the dropping of fruit is a natural and healthy reaction of a vine that is self-regulating its resource and the amount of fruit that it produces. But when the situation is exacerbated by certain weather conditions and disruption to photosynthesis, <b>coulure</b> can have a more severe impact on yields that may negatively affect a region's grape supply and thus influence pricing.|$|E
50|$|When {{the weather}} is the primary {{instigator}} of <b>coulure,</b> the French term this phenomenon <b>coulure</b> climatique. This describes the cloudy and wet conditions that {{limit the amount of}} photosynthetic activity that takes place during the flowering cycle of a grapevine. Limited sunshine means lower sugar levels that can be converted into resources to develop grape berries. Warm temperatures can also exacerbate <b>coulure</b> in some grape varieties by promoting cellular respiration and excessive shoot growth that further competes with the berries for the resources derived from carbohydrates. Other contributing factors include excessively fertile vineyard soils, either naturally or enhanced by the use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers, overly vigorous rootstock and severe pruning that too drastically limits the amount of leaf surface needed to sustain photosynthesis.|$|E

50|$|Bouteillan noir is a late budding and {{ripening}} {{variety that}} is highly susceptible to <b>coulure</b> which leads to very variable yields each vintage. Other viticultural hazards that the vine is susceptible to include botrytis bunch rot and powdery mildew.|$|E
50|$|While {{the vine}} has some {{resistance}} to downy mildew, {{it can be}} very susceptible to powdery mildew and <b>coulure</b> as well as anthracnose. The long grape bunches of small berries can also be prone to developing botrytis bunch rot.|$|E
5000|$|Ampelographers {{believe that}} the name Cascarolo {{is derived from the}} Italian cascolare, meaning [...] "to fall", which could be a {{reference}} to the susceptibility of the variety to the viticultural hazard of <b>coulure</b> which causes unfertilized grape flowers to develop into poorly formed berries that fall off the vine.|$|E
50|$|While {{the grape}} vines of Gros Manseng and Petit Manseng look {{very similar to}} each other, there are {{distinct}} differences. Gros Manseng's berries are larger and less susceptible to <b>coulure.</b> The vine also produces much higher yields but the resulting wine is less elegant and rich than wine made from Petit Manseng.|$|E

50|$|Grisa nera is a {{mid to late}} {{ripening}} {{variety that}} is used for both wine and table grape production. The vine can be very vigorous, producing large foliage but often has low fertility and is generally low yielding. While Grisa nera has good resistance to most fungal diseases, such as downy and powdery mildew, it is susceptible to the viticultural hazard of <b>coulure.</b>|$|E
50|$|During the {{flowering}} {{part of the}} growing season (May-June in the Northern Hemisphere, November-December in the Southern Hemisphere), grapevines often need dry conditions with sufficient sunlight and ambient air temperature around 15 C for pollination to go smoothly. Less ideal conditions, particularly wet, rainy weather, increases the odds that a higher than normal numbers of flowers go unpollinated and <b>coulure</b> to occur.|$|E
50|$|Tibouren {{can be a}} {{difficult}} grape to cultivate due to the irregularly of the harvest yields it produces, often brought on by its sensitivity to <b>coulure.</b> This {{is one reason why}} Tibouren is often used as a blending grape rather than as a varietal wine. In blends, particularly the rosés of Provence, Tibouren contributes earthy aroma notes that are often described as garrigue.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the unique}} aroma and {{character}} of the wines produced by Tibouren are valued by producers, {{it is not a}} widely planted variety. This is due, in part, to the viticultural issues of the grape's sensitivity to <b>coulure</b> and tendency to produce highly irregular yields from vintage to vintage. The wines produced from Rossese are a local specialty found around Dolceacqua.|$|E
5000|$|Muscat bleu is {{an early}} {{ripening}} variety that buds midway through the budding period of the growing season. The vine produces large, loose clusters of large size berries that give off a sweet [...] "grapey", muscat-like aroma that can attract wasps to the vineyard.
