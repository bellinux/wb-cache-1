40|$|INTRODUCTION A <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> is a {{specified}} process for {{caring for a}} particular illness; it outlines specific procedures and protocols {{to be carried out}} at specific points of an illness or recuperation. <b>Care</b> <b>plans</b> exist most commonly in manual forms, where health care providers are expected to adhere to the textual lists of recommended practices through "check off" compliance. Studies have shown that adherence to the manual plans reduces lengths of hospital stays by 30 % and cost of care by 20 - 25 % 3. It is widely believed that computer-automated <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> will result in more substantial savings in healthcare costs. <b>Care</b> <b>plan</b> automation is similar to workflow automation because a <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> is a special form of workflow [...] it describes the steps of delivering care to patients.

40|$|Background: <b>Care</b> <b>plans</b> {{have been}} part of the primary care {{landscape}} in Australia for almost two decades. With an increasing number of patients presenting with multiple chronic conditions, it is timely to consider whether <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> meet the needs of patients and clinicians. Objectives: To review and benchmark existing <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> templates that include recommendations for comorbid conditions, against four key criteria: (i) patient preferences, (ii) setting priorities, (iii) identifying conflicts and synergies between conditions, and (iv) setting dates for reviewing the <b>care</b> <b>plan.</b> Design: Document analysis of Australian <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> templates published from 2006 to 2014 that incorporated recommendations for managing comorbid conditions in primary care. Results: Sixteen templates were reviewed. All of the <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> templates addressed patient preference, but this was not done comprehensively. Only three templates included setting priorities. None assisted in identifying conflicts and synergies between conditions. Fifteen templates included setting a date for reviewing the <b>care</b> <b>plan.</b> Conclusions: <b>Care</b> <b>plans</b> are a well-used tool in primary care practice, but their current format perpetuates a single-disease approach to care, which works contrary to their intended purpose. Restructuring <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> to incorporate shared decision-making and attention to patient preferences may assist in shifting the focus back to the patient and their care needs.

An instrument which gives a weighted score for each one of the essential components of the nursing <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> was developed.

The data showed a high correlation in scores between the three judges. The data also showed that most of the hospitals wrote satisfactory nursing <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> following the participation of their representatives at the workshop.

The approach utilises a <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> domain model from which guideline implementers formulate <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> templates aligning to specific clinical guidelines.

40|$|PURPOSE: Cancer {{survivorship}} presents {{many challenges}} for affected {{individuals and their}} health care providers. Reports from The Institute of Medicine document these challenges and recommend the use of survivorship treatment summaries and <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> to improve communication and coordination of care for cancer survivors. The purpose of our study was to assess current use of treatment summaries and <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> in Massachusetts and identify obstacles to greater use. METHODS: A survey was mailed to cancer specialist physicians (CSPs) and primary care physicians (PCPs) in Massachusetts. The survey asked CSPs about their preparation of treatment summaries and <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> for their cancer survivor patients and perceived barriers to the provision of these documents. PCPs were asked about receipt and utility of treatment summaries and <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> and information {{they would like to}} see in these reports. RESULTS: One hundred eight CSPs and 400 PCPs answered the survey. Fifty-six percent of CSPs reported that they, or their staff, prepared treatment summaries for their cancer survivor patients; however, only 14 % reported preparing <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> Fifty-four percent of PCPs reported ever receiving a treatment summary, but only 16 % ever received a <b>care</b> <b>plan.</b> CSPs cited lack of training, reimbursement, and templates as barriers to preparing <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Interventions are needed to make treatment summaries and <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> a part of standard care for all cancer survivors. Increasing the use of treatment summaries and <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> will require specific training and reimbursement and may be facilitated by templates that capture automated data...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{number of}} people {{suffering}} from one or more chronic conditions is rising, resulting {{in an increase in}} patients with complex health care demands. Interprofessional collaboration and the use of shared <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> support the management of complex health care demands of patients with chronic illnesses. This study aims to get an overview of the scientific literature on developing interprofessional shared <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the scientific literature regarding the development of interprofessional shared <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> A systematic database search resulted in 45 articles being included, 5 of which were empirical studies concentrating purely on the <b>care</b> <b>plan.</b> Findings were synthesised using directed content analysis. Results: This review revealed three themes. The first theme was the format of the shared <b>care</b> <b>plan,</b> with the following elements: patient’s current state; goals and concerns; actions and interventions; and evaluation. The second theme concerned the development of shared <b>care</b> <b>plans,</b> and can be categorised as interpersonal, organisational and patient-related factors. The third theme covered tools, whose main function is to support professionals in sharing patient information without personal contact. Such tools relate to documentation of and communication about patient information. Conclusion: <b>Care</b> <b>plan</b> development is not a free-standing concept, but should be seen as the result of an underlying process of interprofessional collaboration between team members, including the patient. To integrate the patients’ perspectives into the <b>care</b> <b>plans,</b> their needs and values need careful consideration. This review indicates a need for new empirical studies examining the development and use of shared <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> and evaluating their effects...|$|R
