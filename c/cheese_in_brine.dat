40|$|In {{parallel}} with the industrialization and standardization of contemporary production, cheese production based on traditional principles represents an important attribute of a nation, state or region. Awareness of the specificities of these production characteristics {{is supported by the}} growing demand for organic and high quality food with geographic labels of origin, whose competitiveness and price daily increase in comparison with conventional products. In the mountainous territory of the Republic of Serbia, in the region of Nova Varos, on the foothills and slopes of Mount Zlatar, rural households produce <b>cheeses</b> <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> <b>in</b> keeping with autochthonous traditional technology. These cheeses are recognized for their constant quality, remarkable flavour, and unique manner of production. This paper introduces a part of the planned research within Project III 46 009 (subproject 7), which aim to provide answers about the biodiversity of indigenous microflora originating from Zlatar cheese, to determine their most important technological and protective properties, and to provide answers about the possibilities of implementing some of the isolated Lstrains in a new production cycle. Most of the above research is ongoing. This paper summarizes the traditional production of Zlatar cheese based on the monitoring of the production process and interviewes with individual producers in the area around Nova Varos, in the villages Akmačići, Božetići, Jasenovo, Bukovik, Komarani. Also, there is a review of the most important chemical parameters of quality. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 46009...|$|R

40|$|Asino <b>cheese,</b> {{traditionally}} made <b>in</b> some {{mountain areas}} of NE Italy, acquires its typical flavour by long salting (2 - 4 months, depending on <b>cheese</b> wt.) <b>in</b> a special salting <b>brine</b> (called "salmuerie") <b>in</b> which a dilute brine (approx. 4 % w/w NaCl) {{is mixed with}} cheese whey and cream from natural creaming.

40|$|Ovine brined cheese was {{high-pressure}} (HP) {{treated at}} 200 or 500 MPa for 15 min at 20 degrees C on the 15 th day of ripening. Compared to control cheese, HP treatment {{did not affect}} significantly (P> 0. 05) the pH values, moisture, fat in dry matter, protein in dry matter and salt in moisture contents of cheeses at 90 days. The counts of total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, thermophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli and non starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) were not affected by HP treatment of cheese at 200 MPa throughout ripening. After 90 days of ripening, the same microbial groups in cheese treated at 500 MPa were about 1. 2, 3. 6, 2. 1 and 4 log units lower than in control cheese respectively. Coliforms were reduced faster at non detectable levels in HP treated cheeses than in control cheese. Regarding the bacterial enzymatic activities in cheese, aminopeptidase activity (Apep) was marginally favoured by both HP treatments. However, its activity was decreased at 90 days due probably to loss in brine. In contrast, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, following the bacteria cell lysis, was negatively affected by HP treatment at 500 MPa throughout ripening. Industrial relevance: The data obtained from this work suggest that application of HP treatment under optimized conditions on ovine <b>cheese</b> <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> {{can be used to}} reduce effectively the undesirable microbial load in it and to cause moderate enhancement of aminopeptidase activity, without modifying its composition.

40|$|In our {{experiments}} the fermentation of lactose at Camembert type cheese by {{classic and}} stabilised technology was monitored. In {{each of the}} two technologies two experiments were made. The difference between these two technologies is in pH level, which drops below 5 by classic technology and remains above 5 by stabilised technology at all times. To achieve the criteria of stabilised technology the fermentation was stopped at a desired level of pH, by dropping the <b>cheese</b> <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> at 14 °C. After salting and moulding cheesewas transferred from the first three experiments into a ripening chamber at 11 °C. With the last experiment (stabilised technology) the cheese ripened for 3 days at 5 °C. During ripening process pH dropped below 5 in all experiments. The process of fermentation was performed by the following lactic acid bacteria: Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. As these lactic acid bacteria ferment differently D-galactose during manufacture and ripening process, the contentof lactose and D-galactose was measured. Based on the results of our research the following conclusion can be made: the action of lactic acid bacteria can not be stropped even at 5 °C. The native microflora, which remains in the milk after thermisation, might be responsible for the fermentation of Dgalactose. It could be possible that the Streptococcus thermophilus enzymes were not inactivated, causing continuation of lactose fermentation even at low temperature. Mesophilic lactococci were inhibited and for that reason Dgalactose accumulated in cheese. Only after cheese were transferred into a ripening chamber at 11 °C and with low lactose concentration in medium left, mesophilic lactococci started to ferment D-galactose...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{practical}} and hygienic uses in storage and marketing, cheese maker {{preference for the}} use of vacuum packaging instead of the brining method has increased significantly in recent years. The objective of the paper was to study and compare the chemistry, biochemistry, and microstructure of Mihalic <b>cheeses</b> ripened <b>in</b> vacuum packaging or under brine over 360 days. Proteolysis <b>in</b> Mihalic <b>cheese</b> was quite low (e. g., pH 4. 6 soluble nitrogen was lower than 15 %, {{as a percentage of the}} total nitrogen, and as 1 -casein was slower in comparison to other brined cheeses) due to its high salt-in-moisture and low moisture contents. Urea-PAGE patterns of the pH 4. 6 insoluble fractions of the cheeses showed different degradation patterns of as 1 -casein <b>in</b> <b>cheeses</b> of different ages. However, β-casein was relatively resistant to hydrolysis. Packaging the <b>cheese</b> <b>in</b> polyethylene bags significantly increased the levels of pH 4. 6 soluble nitrogen, 12 % trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen, and free amino acids compared to the <b>cheeses</b> ripened <b>in</b> <b>brine.</b> The total concentrations of free amino acids (FAA) <b>in</b> <b>cheeses</b> increased after 120 days of ripening, and Glu, Val, Leu, Lys, and Phe were the most abundant FAA <b>in</b> the <b>cheeses.</b> Higher levels of these AAs were found <b>in</b> the <b>cheeses</b> ripened <b>in</b> polyethylene bags. The peptide profiles by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of 70 % (v/v) ethanolsoluble and ethanol-insoluble fractions of the pH 4. 6 soluble fraction of the cheeses revealed that slight differences were found in the levels of some peptides between cheeses.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} proteolysis and lipolysis activities of probiotic Lighvan cheese at 5, 25, 45 and 60 days of ripeness. Levels of proteolysis were assessed <b>in</b> the <b>cheese</b> from measurements of the following: WSN(%), NPN(%), RI(%) and NPN/TN(%) and levels of lipolysis were assessed from measurements of: ADV (%) and FFA(%). The effect of time on proteolysis and lipolysis activities of probiotic Lighvan cheese was determined significant (p< 0. 05). Values of the following increased continuously until the end of the ripening period; WSN(%), NPN(%), RI(%), NPN/TN(%), ADV (%) and FFA(%) but total nitrogen decreased throughout the duration of the 60 -day storage time. The addition of B. lactis had a significant (p< 0. 05) effect on the proteolysis and lipolysis characteristics of Lighvan cheese and despite an increase in RI, the depth of ripening was low and a low value was determined for NPN/TN %, an indication that peptidase activity was very low. From the results of this study in can be concluded that <b>in</b> <b>cheeses</b> ripened <b>in</b> <b>brine,</b> a significant part of the ripening bi products are transferred into the brine so their effect on the sensory properties of the final product is therefore limited.

40|$|Excessive sodium intake {{increases}} the risk of hypertension, osteoporosis, and kidney stones. Sodium chloride (NaCl; common salt) is the major source of sodium <b>in</b> our food; <b>cheese,</b> for instance, may contain high levels of salt. Owing to the increasing awareness about healthy food, there has been increasing interest to produce low-salt cheeses. Although there have been several attempts to reduce sodium <b>in</b> <b>cheeses,</b> there is limited information on effects of NaCl reduction and substitution with other salts, such as potassium chloride (KCl) on dairy bacteria, which is critical to understand their activity in dairy products. This study thus aimed to investigate salt induced changes in structure and function of dairy bacteria. The effects of NaCl (0 - 10 %) and pH (4. 0 - 6. 0) on membrane surface of Lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Since salt had greater impact than pH, further studies focused on effects of NaCl reduction, and substitution with KCl on Lb. acidophilus, Lb. casei, and Bifidobacterium longum. Changes in functional groups on bacterial membrane surface were evaluated using FT-IR. Critical NaCl concentration and an optimum KCl substitution level that inhibited the pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli) without affecting the potential probiotic bacteria were determined. The changes occurring in membrane integrity and dye-extrusion ability were evaluated using flow cytometry, in bacterial structure using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and in membrane composition using gas-chromatography (fatty acids, FA) and thin-layer chromatography (phospholipids). Adhesion ability of bacteria to Caco- 2 cells was also evaluated. Lastly, the effects of NaCl/KCl on Akawi cheese were investigated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibitory and antioxidant activities, and amino acids (AA) released, during storage <b>in</b> different <b>brine</b> solutions (5 - 10 % NaCl, with 50 % KCl substitution) were studied. Viability of normal and cancerous human colon cells as affected by the cheese extract showing improved peptide profiles and highest AA (i. e. <b>cheese</b> <b>brined</b> <b>in</b> 7. 5 % NaCl+KCl) was evaluated. Whole-genome sequencing was also performed for the bacterium which was most robust to salt stress (Lb. casei). Salt-induced changes occurred mainly in amide regions of FT-IR spectra in most bacteria. The critical NaCl concentration was 2. 5 % (wt. /vol.) and 50 % substitution with KCl was found to be optimal. Escherichia coli and B. longum were more sensitive to substitution compared with other bacteria. Flow cytometric analysis showed that salt stress reduced dye-extrusion activity, and salt tolerance of Lb. casei was highest among the bacteria studied. Bacteria appeared elongated, intracellular content appeared contracted when subjected to salt stress, and unsaturated to saturated FA ratio increased. Among phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol was reduced, whereas phosphatidylinositol and cardioplipin were increased due to salt stress. Adhesion of bacteria to Caco- 2 cells was reduced on exposure to NaCl; however, it improved on substitution with KCl. Essential AA (leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and valine) content increased <b>in</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>brined</b> <b>in</b> 7. 5 % salt. Cheese extracts improved the growth of normal colon cells, and reduced the growth of cancerous cells. Overall, the study provided insights into damages to bacterial cells caused due to high salt, and reducing/replacing salt with KCl may be beneficial from food safety and health aspects. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

30|$|Fresh cheese {{made at the}} {{communities}} when purchased by middlemen may be conserved <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> for periods varying from three days to three months; it is then dried by exposure to the air, altering its salt content, texture, maturation and humidity. This drier product is known as Saltierra cheese. The fresh and Saltierra cheese types {{were found to be}} significantly different in pH 6.84 and 5.94, and acidity 0.016 and 0.143, respectively, indicating that Saltierra is a more aged cheese. Mesophilic aerobic bacterial and total coliform counts were also significantly lower for Saltierra cheese; {{this may be due to}} the extra salt added during preservation <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> for Saltierra <b>cheese</b> ([Hutton 2002]). Microbial counts <b>in</b> both <b>cheeses,</b> however, were far above the Mexican norm, and fresh cheese was also far above the limits of the Mexican norm for fecal coliforms. Fresh and Saltierra goat <b>cheese</b> <b>in</b> the region are products of doubtful food safety, variable consistency, odour and flavour, and occasionally, they are sour and have holes.|$|R
50|$|Pretza {{is a type}} {{of cream}} salt cheese spread or dip made in Zakynthos and Cephalonia and is often eaten for breakfast. It is made by mixing the remains of feta <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> barrels with mizithra (resembling ricotta), oil and thyme. Other common Greek <b>cheeses</b> are made <b>in</b> Zakynthos.|$|R
40|$|International audienceBeyaz cheese (Turkish white-brined <b>cheese)</b> was ripened <b>in</b> four {{different}} <b>brines</b> with 12, 14, 16 or 18 g NaCl* 100 g- 1 water (w/w) at 7 ± 1 °C for 9 weeks. The effect of NaCl concentration on gross composition, proteolysis, sensory characteristics and hardness of the cheeses were investigated during ripening. The <b>cheeses</b> ripened <b>in</b> varying concentrations of NaCl differed in pH values, dry matter, total protein, hardness (mm/ 5 s), 12 % (w/v) trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen fraction and hydrolysis of b-casein, {{but they did}} not differ in water-soluble nitrogen or hydrolysis of as 1 -casein. The <b>cheeses</b> ripened <b>in</b> a 12 g NaCl* 100 g- 1 brine had the best flavour score and overall acceptability by the panellists. The results obtained from this study indicated that increase in NaCl concentration <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> (more than 14 g* 100 g- 1) is correlated with lower levels of proteolysis and overall acceptability <b>in</b> Beyaz <b>cheese...</b>|$|R
40|$|The fate of 3 {{different}} Listeria monocytogenes strains (Scott A, 2 F and 6 E) was studied independently <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> and on factory-scale Gouda cheeses {{that had}} been submerged <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> that was artificially contaminated with these individual strains. Viable numbers of L. monocytogenes <b>in</b> the <b>brine</b> decreased during brining (0, 1, 2. 9 and 8. 9 d). L. monocytogenes was enumerated {{on the surface of}} Gouda cheese directly after brining and over 26 weeks of ripening at 12. 5 degrees C. Transfer of L. monocytogenes from brine to cheese during brining was limited. L. monocytogenes was detected in the outer layer of Gouda <b>cheese</b> but not <b>in</b> the centre directly after brining or during ripening. Throughout the ripening period, the viable numbers of L. monocytogenes declined significantly. This study adds {{to the understanding of the}} fate of L. monocytogenes <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> and on Gouda cheese, and demonstrates that growth of L. monocytogenes on Gouda cheese is not supported following contamination during brining...|$|R
