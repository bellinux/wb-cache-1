25|$|There was a rumor of {{one final}} act to survive {{conducted}} by the USBA. The idea to turn Merl Mennenga, {{the founder of the}} ABA to somehow force Mr. Anderson and Mr. Vargas to sell back the ABA and then to sell the ABA to the USBA which would then close down the ABA under the Chapter VII bankruptcy law with the USBA inheriting the tracks ABA's then current leadership. If true, perhaps they were thinking about the precedent of Walt Ehnart, the former President of the ABA and by then the Vice President of the USBA that they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> Mennenga.

500|$|The {{assault on}} the wall briefly exposed General Wolf Frederick von Retzow's {{infantry}} line. More than two hours elapsed since the Prince had ordered his cavalry back to Leuthen, but they arrived opportunely. Commanded by Joseph Count Lucchesi d’ Averna [...] the cavalry hurried to take them in the flank: a successful cavalry charge at this critical point <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> the tide of battle. Unfortunately for the Austrians, 40 squadrons of Zieten's cavalry awaited them at Radaxdorf and charged their flank; another 30 squadrons commanded by Georg Wilhelm von Driesen charged their front; the Bayreuth Dragoons hit their other flank; and the Puttkammer Hussars charged the rear. Lucchessi was killeddecapitated by a cannonballand his troopers were scattered. The cavalry mêlée soon swirled into the Austrian infantry line behind Leuthen, causing more confusion. Overrun by the Prussian horse, the Austrian infantry broke. First the infantry, then the cavalry retreated toward Breslau, where they crossed the Schweidnitz river, then called the [...] "Black Water".|$|E

500|$|He spent £300,000 on midfielder Chris Birchall for {{the start}} of the 2006–07 season. His team started well, however midway through the campaign, {{following}} a run of five games without defeat, Coventry suddenly and unexpectedly hit a bad run of form. A 5–0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion began a sequence of eight games without a win, including six defeats. This culminated in a 2–0 home defeat to Bristol City in the FA Cup, a game which also saw a record low attendance at the Ricoh Arena. On 17 January 2007, the day after the cup exit, the club parted company with Adams, with Coventry lying 16th in the Championship. Adams stated that he intended to return to management as soon as possible. He admitted that the sale of Gary McSheffrey to Birmingham City had been a turning point in the club's season, but also said that [...] "I genuinely believe that I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> it around" [...] and [...] "I tried my best and that's all I can do." ...|$|E

[...] He felt that the cancellation was for the best and that a [...] "cold, gritty first-person shooter" [...] was not the ideal direction for the series. He compared it to Metroid Primes design by noting that the art style did not change much while X's redesign was [...] "virtually unrecognizable." [...] He later commented that an early concept design by Adi Granov was [...] "not that bad" [...] if it had no relation to the Mega Man X series. Chris Carter felt that while he didn't think the series needed a [...] "gritty reboot", he would have enjoyed it if it was good. Clint Mize wrote an article for MTV.com's gaming section detailing why Maverick Hunter was a terrible idea. He felt that it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> off [...] "core fans" [...] of the Mega Man X series and that X required a [...] "solid core title to reintroduce the character" [...] rather than a [...] "dark reimagining". He added that the decision to make it a first-person shooter made it feel like it was the product of an [...] "out of touch executive". He also criticized it due to the risk involved in competing with big FPS games such as Call of Duty, Halo, and Battlefield. He noted that the perspective introduces other problems, such as reduced emphasis on platform segments. Its art design and gameplay have been compared to the video game Vanquish.|$|E

2500|$|After the action, Allied reports {{agreed that}} the most {{effective}} aspect of the bombardment was the fire that {{was provided by the}} small ships.

In contrast, while the force's heavy guns disabled 22 of 24 assigned navy targets, they were unable to destroy any of them and, consequently, infantry assaults were required to ensure that the guns could not be reactivated.

[...] Instead, he got accepted into the famed Cass Technical High School as a business major, and played the drums and trombone in the band. At 15, he began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. He credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music as they worked together in the shop. Muldoon goaded his young apprentice into forming a band: [...] "He played drums", Gillis thought. [...] "Well I guess I'll play guitar then." [...] The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as the Upholsterers.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the popular}} legend, often told with an {{emphasis}} on hauntings by her ghost, Katherine came into highway robbery in her husband's absence in order to redress her fast-dwindling fortune. During this time many highwaymen were Royalist supporters bereft of home, estates or income, who were left to make a living as best they could, so any courteous highway robber was perceived to be one of these well-mannered gentlemen. [...] Not all highwaymen were well-born like French aristocrat Claude Duval or James MacLaine, who was the second son of a minister, but this romanticised portrayal extended to such working-class robbers as MacLaine's partner William Plunkett, as well as Richard Ferguson, George Lyons, Tom King, John Nevison, and John Rann. [...] However, while it is possible that Katherine Ferrers <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> to highway robbery, {{there seems to be no}} historical proof that her accomplice [...] "Ralph Chaplin", ever existed. He was supposedly caught and executed on Finchley Common either on the night of her death, or soon after, which conveniently serves the legend.|$|E

2500|$|Plutarch {{wrote that}} when Caesar was {{allocated}} the governorship of the Roman province of Hispania Ulterior for 60 BC {{he was in}} debt and his creditors prevented him from going to his province. Crassus paid off the most intransigent creditors and gave a surety of 830 talents. Caesar was then allowed to leave. Suetonius noted this episode as well, but did not mention who made the payments and gave the surety [...] Plutarch thought that Crassus did this because he needed Caesar for his political campaign against Pompey. However, this cannot be taken for granted. In a speech Cicero made against an agrarian bill proposed by the plebeian tribune Publius Servilius Rullus in 63 BC, he claimed that Rullus was an insignificant figure and a front for unsavoury 'machinators' whom he described as the real architects of the bill and as {{the men who had}} the real power and who were to be feared. He did name these men, but he dropped hints that made them identifiable by saying, [...] "Some of them to whom nothing appears sufficient to possess, some to whom nothing seems sufficient to squander." [...] Sumner points out that these were references to the popular images of Crassus and Caesar. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that Crassus, Pompey and Caesar might have been willing to co-operate on a specific policy issue they agreed with as they had done in 70 BC. Moreover, Caesar had supported the Manilian law of 66 BC, which gave Pompey the command of the final phase of the Third Mithridatic War and in 63 BC and, as noted above, he proposed a motion to recall Pompey to Rome to restore order in Rome {{in the wake of the}} Catalinarian Conspiracy. Therefore, Caesar was willing to support Pompey because, although he was not a popularis, he was not an optimate and, therefore, a potential ally. Moreover, at the time of the creation of the first triumvirate Pompey was at odds with Caesar's enemies, the optimates. The suspension for his praetorship in 62 BC by the senate when he advocated the recall of Pompey had probably shown Caesar that his political enemies, the optimates, had the means to marginalise him politically. To attain the consulship Caesar needed the support of Pompey and Crassus who, besides being the two most influential men in Rome, did not belong to the optimates and were liable to politically marginalised by the optimates as well. Plutarch maintained that Caesar sought an alliance with both men because allying with only one of them <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> the other against him and that he thought that he could play them off against each other. However, the picture might have been more nuanced than this.|$|E
