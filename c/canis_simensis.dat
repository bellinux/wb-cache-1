60|$|If {{the several}} breeds have descended from several wild stocks, their {{difference}} can obviously in part {{be explained by}} that of their parent species.

Ruppel 'Neue Wirbelthiere von Abyssinien' 1835-40 'Mammif.' s. 39 pl. 14. There is a specimen of this fine animal in the British Museum.), with its elongated muzzle; that of the larger dogs from the larger wolves, and the smaller and slighter dogs from the jackals: and thus perhaps we may account for certain constitutional and climatal differences. But {{it would be a great}} error to suppose that there has not been in addition (1/53. Even Pallas admits this; see 'Act. Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1780 page 93.) a large amount of variation. The intercrossing of the several aboriginal wild stocks, and of the subsequently formed races, has probably increased the total number of breeds, and, as we shall presently see, has greatly modified some of them. But we cannot explain by crossing the origin of such extreme forms as thoroughbred greyhounds, bloodhounds, bulldogs, Blenheim spaniels, terriers, pugs, etc., unless we believe that forms equally or more strongly characterised in these different respects once existed in nature. But hardly any one has been bold enough to suppose that such unnatural forms ever did or could exist in a wild state. When compared with all known members of the family of Canidae they betray a distinct and abnormal origin. No instance is on record of such dogs as bloodhounds, spaniels, true greyhounds having been kept by savages: they are the product of long-continued civilisation.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the most}} universally {{accepted}} cynological classification (FCI Spitz and Primitive Types Group), the breed belongs to the Primitive Group of dogs. The Alopekis has erect ears, a wedge-shaped head, normal (scissors) bite and dentition and a mesomorphic, normal-symmetrical structure, body type & morphology. Typical specimens do not display elements of dwarfism. Their bodies are strong and their legs are neither bowed nor notably or disproportionately shortened. Acquired leg deformities are also undesirable characteristics. The breed's proportions suggest a gradual reduction in size over time (genetic sweep) due to evolution, selection and local adaptation http://www.sciencemag.org/content/316/5821/112.abstract. It {{is also possible that}} the breed shares some ancestry, together with the Cretan Hound, from the smaller and more slender Ethiopian Wolf (<b>Canis</b> <b>Simensis)</b> and perhaps even the Southern sub-species <b>Canis</b> <b>Simensis</b> Citernii, rather than the larger and heavier Grey wolf (Canis Lupus) ancestral species. Alopekis morphology suggests a natural - archaic dog type, ancestral / archetypical to the subsequent central European small Spitz/ Nordic and Terrier breeds. The Pomeranian dog, said to be a descendant of ancient Dalmatian / Illyrian dogs and especially those from the island of Melite / Melita (Mljet) in the Adriatic Sea http://www.pomeranianproject.com/earlyspitz.html, which used to be a Greek territory until the 12th century, is probably a descendant of the Alopekis & the Meliteo Kynidio / Small Greek Domestic Dog. Additionally, the hunting ability of the Alopekis, is a further indication that suggests a relation to other breeds of this group V of the F.C.I. Classification http://fci.be/nomenclature.aspx?lang=en that were developed in other Mediterranean regions after the Greek colonization in Southern Italy, Sicily, Malta, Cyrene, Corsica, Southern France, the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic islands, probably with the influence of larger hounds such as the Cretan Hound https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011725/http://www.koe.gr/ellinikesfiles_krlagonikos.htm, as suggested by the existence in Crete of a small type similar to the Alopekis, in morphology and use, as a hunting and utility dog, which in modern times is called Venetaki from the Latin venaticus; in ancient times this dog was possibly identical to the type called Κυναμολγός (Gr.

50|$|Although it is {{the most}} {{specialized}} predator of rock hyrax in the world, it does not have monopoly on this prey. Many wild predators are also attracted to rock hyraxes, which thus puts them in potential competition with the Verreaux's eagles. Amongst the other very large eagles which are widely found in sub-Saharan Africa, both the crowned eagle and the martial eagle may also locally favor rock hyraxes in their diets. However, these species have highly different habitat preferences and hunting techniques. The crowned eagle, a forest-dwelling species, is primarily a perch-hunter and can spend hours watching for prey activity from a prominent tree perch. The martial eagle is a dweller mainly of lightly wooded savanna and often hunts on the wing. soaring high and watching for prey activity with its superb vision, quite unlike the contour-hunting technique used by Verreaux's eagles. While the habitats of crowned and Verreaux's eagle keep them segregated enough to likely eliminate competition, confrontations between Verreaux's and martial eagles have been recorded. Although somewhat larger and more powerful, the martial eagle is relatively less nimble in the air and there is a case where a martial eagle was robbed of rock hyrax prey by a Verreaux's eagle. Another case of kleptoparasitism by a Verreaux's eagle involved one stealing some carrion from a lammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus). A unique opportunity to study Verreaux's eagle living with its closest extant cousin, the golden eagle, has been afforded in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. The two species, with similar habitat preferences, were observed to defend their territories from one another exclusively, with many cases of goldens chasing Verreaux's eagles out of their respective territories in flight and only one of Verreaux's chasing the goldens. However, since the golden eagles prefer hares and Verreaux prefers rock hyraxes, they actually seem to have no deleterious effect on each other’s breeding activities. African hawk-eagles (Aquila spilogaster) may also take a few hyraxes, but are likely to avoid direct conflicts with their much larger cousins, so will tawny eagles (Aquila rapax). Other predators of rock hyrax may include felids like African wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica), servals (Leptailurus serval), caracals (Caracal caracal) and leopards (Panthera pardus) as well as jackals (Canis ssp.), African rock pythons (Python sebae) and owls (mainly the large Verreaux's eagle-owl (Bubo lacteus) or possibly the Cape eagle-owl (B. capensis)). Neonate rock hyraxes may fall prey to mongooses and venomous snakes like Egyptian cobras (Naja haje) and puff adders (Bitis arietans). Due to the formidable range of competitors it pays for Verreaux's eagle to be cautious from the moment it bears down on its prey. Cases where pirating has been attempted has involved diverse carnivores like caracals and jackals. In at least one case, a Verreaux's eagle was observed to be displaced off a rodent-kill (likely a cane-rat) by an Ethiopian wolf (<b>Canis</b> <b>simensis).</b> As is often the case with reintroduced eagles (i.e. seen even in the huge harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja)), reintroduced Verreaux's eagle may lose their fear of other predators to their own detriment and one such bird fell victim to a caracal. Cases where Verreaux's eagles have swooped at leopards are not likely competitive but are more likely to try to displace from their territory and such attacks have occasionally had fatal results for the birds. This species is not normally aggressive to humans but may swoop uncomfortably close when the nest is being investigated.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} glacial age, Afro-alpine {{habitats}} were widespread across the highlands of Ethiopia. A wolf-like canid ancestor {{is thought to}} have colonized this expanding habitat and given rise to a new species that was remarkably well adapted to the high altitude environment: the Ethiopian wolf <b>Canis</b> <b>simensis.</b> Here, we address the timing of genetic divergence and examine population genetic history and structure by investigating the distribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation. The pattern of mtDNA variation and geographical distribution indicate an initial population expansion, probably immediately after divergence from the wolf-like ancestor, around 100, 000 years ago. The partition of mtDNA haplotypes that followed was most likely the result of habitat reduction and fragmentation at the onset of deglaciation approximately 15, 000 years ago. Phylogenetic and geographical associations suggest that the most likely genetic partitioning corresponds to three mountain areas, Arsi/Bale, Wollo/Shoa and Simien/Mt. Guna. Although there is a degree of clustering of haplotypes {{from both sides of the}} Rift Valley, the lack of reciprocal monophyly does not support the taxonomic classification of two subspecies.

40|$|Ecological {{reasons for}} philopatry and {{cooperation}} are frequently invoked when kin selection is an insufficient explanation. The Ethiopian wolf (<b>Canis</b> <b>simensis)</b> is a specialised rodent hunter that forms family groups with cooperative breeding but also lives as monogamous pairs in suboptimal areas. Given the apparent absence of fitness gains to helpers from cooperative breeding, {{we set out}} to explore the benefits accrued by communal territorial defence measured as the acquisition and retention of habitats with more and most preferred rodent prey. Pairs defended relatively large territories to encompass critical amounts of key habitats within a matrix poor in rodents. Groups in optimal areas had relatively small territories and were expansionist, such that wolves in larger packs benefited per capita from increased good-quality foraging habitat. The fitness benefits of philopatry became evident after a rabies epizootic, when philopatry and expansionism prevailed in under-saturated conditions, until large groups split or provided dispersers that established locally. This study shows that high concentrations of prey can shift the balance of costs and benefits towards group living and cooperation in long-lived territorial carnivores, in so far as this dictates immediate rewards accrued from a given increment in territory size, namely greater foraging area per animal, leading to group enlargement and eventual inheritance of breeding space. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

We used a 21 - year time series to explore long-term trends in the numbers of cattle, caprines and free-roaming domestic dogs in two core Ethiopian wolf areas (the Web valley and the Sanetti plateau) and to test whether seasonal variations in primary productivity underlies the current livestock production system. No trends in livestock numbers were detected in the Web valley, where livestock are most abundant and graze seasonally. Livestock numbers have increased significantly on most of the Sanetti plateau, grazing all year-round albeit at a lower intensity. Livestock use of the Web valley was positively correlated with vegetation productivity as derived from remotely sensed data, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). On the Sanetti plateau, neither primary productivity nor livestock numbers showed signs of strong seasonality. The current livestock production system has the potential to degrade the vegetation that sustains the wolves' rodent prey while an increase in free-roaming domestic dogs in parts of their range may heighten the risk of disease transmission...|$|E

Eggs of Capillaria sp. were found most commonly, followed by Trichuris sp., ancylostomatid species and Toxocara species. Three samples contained Hymenolepis sp. eggs, which were likely artefacts from ingested prey species. Four samples contained taeniid eggs, one of whichwas copro-polymerase chain reaction (copro-PCR) and sequence positive for Echinococcus granulosus, suggesting a spillover from a domestic parasite cycle into this wildlife species.

40|$|Fifteen {{years of}} {{monitoring}} in the Bale Mountains provide a valuable time series {{to better understand}} the dynamics of populations of the endangered Ethiopian wolf <b>Canis</b> <b>simensis</b> in the face of epizootics and increasing human pressure. Linetransect counts in four study areas were used to identify trends in the local abundances of wolves, people, livestock and domestic dogs (a putative rabies reservoir). Estimates of wolf abundance were validated against total counts in prime wolf habitats, where two local populations decimated by rabies in the early 1990 s had recovered fully by 2000. Growth appeared to be regulated by negative density dependence, but the rate of growth was unexpectedly low at reduced densities. Limitations to rapid growth, including an initial gap for which data were sparse, are discussed. In a poorer habitat, wolf abundance estimates were less reliable but indicated slight fluctuations without an overall trend. A local extinction was recorded in an area of marginal habitat. With this exception, trends in wolf abundances were unrelated to trends in the abundance of people, livestock or dogs. Rabies emerged as the main cause of decline for high-density populations.

40|$|Understanding of {{the biology}} of rarity {{is central to the}} {{conservation}} of some endangered species. Rare taxa are often reported to be specialized, but they are usually poorly studied. The Ethiopian wolf (<b>Canis</b> <b>simensis)</b> is endemic to the Ethiopian highlands and in two major populations, Bale and Arsi in the southern range of the species, it preys almost exclusively upon diurnal rodents all year round, mainly molerats Tachyoryctes macrocephalus and common molerats T. splendens, respectively. Where these large rodents are absent or rare, wolves are expected to rely more heavily on nocturnal rats or livestock. Prey remains in 161 scats from five newly studied populations confirmed that wolves are indeed specialist rodent hunters elsewhere, and that their narrow diets are dominated by diurnal Murinae rats (60 - 83 % of prey occurrences). Swamp rats Otomys typus were the main prey, followed by grass rats Arvicanthis abyssinicus. Common molerats, Lophuromys rats and nocturnal Stenocephalemys spp. constituted the variable portion of the diets, and their proportional contributions varied across populations in relation to elevation and latitude. Towards the north, where the climate is drier and human populations more dense, wolves predate more frequently on rat-sized prey, including nocturnal species, with implications for the survival of small populations in the Northern Highlands. © 2009 The Authors.
