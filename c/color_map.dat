Two regions are called adjacent if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.|$|E

Although Tracy Hickman was {{credited}} in RavenloftII, he had left TSR before the module was completed. The writing was done by David [...] "Zeb" [...] Cook, Jeff Grubb, Harold Johnson, and Douglas Niles, following the Hickmans' outline. Each writer pursued a different section of the module {{in order to meet}} the deadline. Clyde Caldwell, who had done all of the art for the original Ravenloft module, provided the cover, but interior art was done by Jeff Easley. The adventure is designed for first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons characters of levels 8–10. The adventure was 48 pages, and included a large <b>color</b> <b>map</b> and an outer folder. It shared structural elements with the original, including variable NPC goals and variable locations for key objects, so that Gryphon Hill plays differently each time. The module's plot features an artifact known as The Apparatus that switches a monster's personality with that of an ordinary townsperson; player characters, therefore, are uncertain about the true identity of the people they meet. The module also introduces Azalin the lich, who later became a major character in the Ravenloft campaign setting. This module is playable alone, or as a sequel to the original Ravenloft. It includes descriptions of the town of Mordentshire, as well as some haunted moors, and a manor house, all mapped in perspective like the original module.|$|E

40|$|International audienceColor {{difference}} between {{views of a}} stereo pair is a challenging problem. Applications such as compression of stereo image demands the compensation of color differences which is typically done by methods called <b>color</b> <b>mapping.</b> <b>Color</b> <b>mapping</b> is based on feature correspondences. From these feature correspondences, color correspondences are generated which is ultimately used for the <b>color</b> <b>mapping</b> model. This paper focuses on detection of outliers in the feature correspondences. We propose novel iterative outlier removal method which exploits the neighborhood color information of the feature correspondences. From the analysis of our experimental results and comparing with existing methods we conclude by arguing that spatial color neighborhood information around the feature correspondences along with an iterative <b>color</b> <b>mapping</b> can detect outliers in general and can bring a robust color correctio...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} <b>color</b> <b>mapping</b> method that {{compensates}} color differences between images having a common semantic content such as multiple {{views of a}} scene taken from different viewpoints. A so-called <b>color</b> <b>mapping</b> model is usually estimated from color correspondences selected from those images. In this work, we introduce a <b>color</b> <b>mapping</b> that model <b>color</b> change in two steps: first, nonlinear, channel-wise mapping; second, linear, cross-channel mapping. Additionally, unlike many {{state of the art}} methods, we estimate the model from sparse matches and do not require dense geometric correspondences. We show that well known cross-channel color change can be estimated from sparse color correspondence. Quantitative and visual benchmark tests show good performance compared to recent methods in literatur...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the additional diagnostic value of <b>color</b> <b>mapping</b> of the hepatic arterial enhancement fraction (AEF) for detecting recurrent or residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Materials and Methods: Seventy-six patients with 126 HCCs, {{all of whom}} had undergone previous TACE, and subsequently, underwent follow-up multiphasic liver CT scans, were included in this study. Quantitative <b>color</b> <b>maps</b> of the AEF of the whole liver were created, by using prototype software with non-rigid registration. The AEF was defined as the ratio of the attenuation increment during the arterial phase to the attenuation increment during the portal phase. Two radiologists independently analyzed the two image sets at a two-week interval, i. e., the multiphasic CT image set and the second image set of the AEF <b>color</b> <b>maps</b> and the CT images. The additional diagnostic value of the AEF <b>color</b> <b>mapping</b> was determined, by the use of the jackknife-alternative free-response receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. The sensitivity and positive predictive values for detecting HCCs of each image set were also evaluated and compared. Results: The reader-averaged figures of merit were 0. 699 on the initial interpretation of the MDCT image set, and 0. 831 on the second interpretation of the combined image set; {{the difference between the two}} interpretations was significant (p value < 0. 001). The mean sensitivity for residual or recurrent HCC detection increased from 62. 7 % on the initial analysis to 82. 1 % on the second analysis using the AEF <b>color</b> <b>maps</b> (p value < 0. 001).
