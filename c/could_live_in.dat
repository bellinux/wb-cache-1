Gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called the Settlers who used to live in England. They possessed unusual abilities, such as extremely good vision and hearing, leading them to be called 'eye adepts' and 'ear adepts', respectively. These powers were seen as sorcery, prompting Grace, the leader of the Settlers, to bring the Settlers under the ice in Greenland where they <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> peace.|$|E
5|$|Among those {{held and}} {{executed}} at the Tower was Anne Boleyn. Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17thcenturies their main duty had become {{to look after}} the prisoners. The Tower was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the Fleet, where disease was rife. High-status prisoners <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605. Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself, and 112people were executed on the hill over 400years. Before the 20thcentury, there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green; {{as was the case with}} Lady Jane Grey, this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous. After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554, Queen MaryI imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen ElizabethI, in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about {{pterosaur}} reproduction, and pterosaur eggs are very rare. The first known pterosaur egg was found in the quarries of Liaoning, the same place that yielded feathered dinosaurs. The egg was squashed flat with no signs of cracking, so evidently the eggs had leathery shells, as in modern lizards. This was supported by the description of an additional pterosaur egg belonging to the genus Darwinopterus, described in 2011, which also had a leathery shell and, also like modern reptiles but unlike birds, was fairly small compared {{to the size of the}} mother. In 2014 five unflattened eggs from the species Hamipterus tianshanensis were found in an Early Cretaceous deposit in northwest China. Examination of the shells by scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of a thin calcareous eggshell layer with a membrane underneath. A study of pterosaur eggshell structure and chemistry published in 2007 indicated that it is likely pterosaurs buried their eggs, like modern crocodiles and turtles. Egg-burying would have been beneficial to the early evolution of pterosaurs, as it allows for more weight-reducing adaptations, but this method of reproduction would also have put limits on the variety of environments pterosaurs <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>in,</b> and may have disadvantaged them when they began to face ecological competition from birds.|$|E

The aircraft had twin-rudders, and might have been Dorniers or Jaguars [...] The dives were fast but shallow, and they pulled out of them at about 2,000 feet. It was not a dive-bombing attack proper.

Higginbotham and the other 11 black students were placed in a building called International House, which was the only building that blacks <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> West Lafayette. The students slept in the attic, which was unheated. Higginbotham sought a meeting with the University President, Edward C. Elliott, to ask permission for the students to sleep in a section of one of the heated dormitories. Elliott's response was purportedly [...] "he law doesn't require us to put you in those dormitories. The law doesn't even require us to let you in. You take it or leave it."

500|$|In 1954, Cushing {{residents}} were [...] "perturbed" [...] {{by the possibility}} of a new language hall being built within the dormitory's sightlines, citing the concern that any artificial construction would ruin their views. Another controversy arose in April 1970 after students from Cushing objected to a plan put forth by a contingent of black students and approved by the Board of Trustees that would designate one wing of Cushing as a co-ed housing space for black students of all grades. Prior to the plan's formulation, upperclassmen black students could opt to live in a student community in Kendrick House while underclassmen <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> an analogous community in Main Building. Cushing {{residents were}} not notified of the plan until after its approval and a public meeting was held at which objections were raised by both Cushing residents and black students that one wing of the dorm might not be enough space to foster a black community and that Kendrick House should instead be repurposed as elective all-black housing. After the college's administration expressed the possibility that this plan might be in violation of U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare standards on segregation, all but four black students walked out of the meeting and the assembly decided that the Board of Trustees needed to be better informed of the racial climate on campus. In 1974, Vassar's Master Planning Committee voted to convert one of Cushing's common areas, then a dining room, to eight single dorms. An emergency meeting was held and students organized a Save Cushing Dining Room movement which collected 800 signatures against the plan in 24 hours. Other instances have seen one of Cushing's parlors converted to a quad dorm used to house students temporarily when no other housing could be found for them, first in 1989 then again during the first semester of the 199899 school year.|$|E
