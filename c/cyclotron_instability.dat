40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{treatment of}} the theory of electrostatic ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instability</b> in the collisional bottomside ionosphere is given. The linear dispersion relations for the ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instability</b> (electron and ion collisions) are derived. Analytical solutions to the dispersion relation are obtained in three limits: collisionless; weakly collisional; and collisional. In addition, the linear dispersion relation is solved numerically, using parameters typical of the high-latitude bottomside ionosphere. It is pointed out that the linear growth rates in the bottomside collisional regime can be of the same order as the corresponding topside collisionless growth rates.

The current driven ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instability</b> is a very important microinstability in this respect. A nonlocal formalism is given for studying the ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instability</b> in a more realistic magnetospheric environment than is available in the widely used local theory.

Each of these instabilities are dominant in different ranges of the wavelength along the magnetic field. The linearized dispersion equation is solved within the limits of long and short waves along the magnetic field where effects of electrons and ions, respectively, are dominant in the development of these instabilities. The general criterion of instability excitation, which couples the flow velocity shear and wave number across the magnetic field, is obtained...|$|E

Using the maximum growth rate as a fitting pararamter, linear Vlasov instability theory for the proton cyclotron and helium <b>cyclotron</b> anisotropy <b>instabilities</b> reproduces both observed correlations.

One-dimensional hybrid computer simulations are used here to examine the nonlinear properties of these two growing modes at relatively weak fluctuation energies and for wave vectors parallel to the background magnetic field. Second-order theory predicts fluctuating magnetic field energies at saturation of the proton <b>cyclotron</b> anisotropy <b>instability</b> in semiquantitative agreement with the simulation results. Introduction of the helium component enhances the wave-particle exchange rate for proton anisotropy reduction by that instability, thereby reducing the saturation energy of that mode.

Analysis is performed {{on the base of}} the nonlinear dispersion equation, which accounts for a new combined effect of plasma turbulence and shear flow. It consists in turbulent scattering of ions across the shear flow with their convection by shear flow and results in enhanced nonlinear broadening of ion cyclotron resonances.

We examined the ion distributions to determine the correlation between the observed warm ion distributions and various magnetospheric parameters, and their location relative to the plasma trough, plasmasphere, plasma sheet, and local time. We find that the warm pancake-shaped ion distributions occur more frequently near noon, and during low magnetospheric activity.

40|$|Proton mirror modes {{are large}} {{amplitude}} nonpropagating structures frequently {{observed in the}} magnetosheath. It {{has been suggested that}} electron temperature anisotropy can enhance the proton mirror instability growth rate while leaving the proton <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instability</b> largely unaffected, therefore causing the proton mirror instability to dominate the proton <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instability</b> in Earth's magnetosheath. Here, we use particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the electron temperature anisotropy effects on proton mirror instability evolution. Contrary to the hypothesis, electron temperature anisotropy leads to excitement of the electron whistler instability. Our results show that the electron whistler instability grows much faster than the proton mirror instability and quickly consumes the electron free energy, so that there is no electron temperature anisotropy left to significantly impact the evolution of the proton mirror instability.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} slow expansion on a magnetosheath plasma and low-frequency waves using a twodimensional hybrid expanding box simulation. We start our simulation with a homogeneous high beta plasma, which is marginally stable to the mirror and proton <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instabilities.</b> The expansion is imposed as an external force: the physical size of the simulation box increases in two dimensions: one parallel and one perpendicular {{with respect to the}} ambient magnetic field. This expansion leads to a continuous decrease of proton beta and drives an increase of the proton temperature anisotropy. In {{the early stages of the}} simulation, both mirror and proton cyclotron waves appear. The system establishes a marginally stable state with respect to both mirror and proton <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Initially, the mirror waves dominate the proton cyclotron waves, even when the system is below the linear mirror threshold, but as time increases the proton cyclotron waves become dominant in the low beta region.

40|$|Hybrid {{expanding}} box (HEB) is used {{to study}} a slow compression of the magnetosheath plasma. The HEB simulations confirm the previous results of Hellinger et al.

For a faster compression the marginal stability path shifts further inside the unstable region in order to balance the faster anisotropization rate due to the faster compression.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the loss cone-driven instabilities in the low solar corona is undertaken. The instabilities considered are the electron cyclotron maser, the whistler, and the electrostatic upper hybrid. It is shown that the first-harmonic extraordinary mode of the electron <b>cyclotron</b> maser <b>instability</b> is the fastest growing mode for strong magnetized plasma (the ratio of plasma frequency to cyclotron frequency being less than 0. 35). For values of the ratio between 0. 35 and 1. 0, the first-harmonic ordinary mode of the electron <b>cyclotron</b> maser <b>instability</b> dominates the emission. For ratio values greater than 1. 0, no direct electromagnetic radiation is expected since other instabilities, which do not escape directly, saturate the electron cyclotron maser (the whistler or the electrostatic upper hybrid waves). It is also shown that the second-harmonic electron cyclotron maser emission never grows to an appreciable level.

40|$|Twelve proton {{velocity}} distribution {{functions as}} measured for different solar wind speeds by the plasma analyzer at the Helios spacecraft are modeled analytically by a superposition of two bi-Maxwellians. The stability of these distributions is investigated by solving the linear dispersion equation for parallel propagation of both left- and right-hand polarized modes. Due {{to the temperature}} anisotropy of the main proton component {{the presence of the}} resonant left-hand ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instability</b> is found to be typical for high-speed streams and is independent of an ion beam.
