40|$|This study {{utilizes}} {{the dynamic}} factor model of Giannone et al. (2008) {{in order to}} make now-/forecasts of GDP quarter-on-quarter growth rates in Switzerland. It also assesses the informational content of macroeconomic data releases for forecasting of the Swiss GDP. We find that the factor model offers a substantial improvement in forecast accuracy of GDP growth rates compared to a benchmark naive <b>constant-growth</b> <b>model</b> at all forecast horizons and at all data vintages. The largest forecast accuracy is achieved when GDP nowcasts for an actual quarter are made about three months ahead of the official data release. We also document that both business tendency surveys as well as stock market indices possess the largest informational content for GDP forecasting although their ranking depends on the underlying transformation of monthly indicators from which the common factors are extracted.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of inflation, the standard <b>Constant-Growth</b> valuation <b>model</b> found throughout the finance literature is not valid in cases where a company either (1) makes no net new investments or (2) invests only in zero Net Present Value projects. If expected inflation is positive, the generally accepted and widely used expression {{for the value of}} the firm under either of these two conditions seriously understates the true value of the firm, even with modest levels of inflation.

40|$|The {{earnings}} yield, {{determined by}} the ratio of reported earnings to price, is frequently used to predict real return. Complications characterize the predictions, however, because reported earnings are not real. This research identifies an adjusted earnings yield that ensures that real return can be determined as a ratio of current-period prices. From freely accessible and publicly disseminated data, an adjusted-earnings-yield series is created for the U. S. equity market. Statistical tests indicate that this measure {{is a much better}} predictor of future real returns than are other popular valuation measures. wo correct methods are used for computing expected return. The first is to determine a nominal (inflation-affected) discount rate that equates the present value of the asset’s nominal expected cash flows to its price. The sec-ond is to remove the effect of inflationary expecta-tions on nominal cash flows and then determine a real discount rate that equates the present value of the asset’s real expected cash flows to price. Econ-omists frequently prefer the second method because real cash flows tend to be more stable and, therefore, easier to predict than their nominal coun-terparts. Investors should also focus on real expected returns because their typical concern is to improve purchasing power. Consistent with this line of reasoning, the earn-ings yield (the reciprocal of the P/E) is commonly labeled a reasonable approximation of the real expected return to equity (see Siegel 2005 for a recent example). To see why, assume that the market value of equity, S, can be estimated by using the <b>constant-growth</b> dividend discount <b>model</b> (DDM) of Gordon (1962) presented in Equation 1, where Div repre-sents dividends and where expected return, r, and dividend growth, g, are both assumed real: (1) Rearranging the terms in Equation 1 results i...|$|R
