25|$|The {{passenger}} train was the 16:45 from Cleethorpes to Manchester {{consisting of a}} brake van, three passenger carriages and a rear guard's van. The goods train which had left Grimsby {{earlier in the day}} for Doncaster consisted of 44 waggons loaded with larch tree trunks, three trunks to a load secured with chains. The length of the trunks (up to 42ft) necessitated the <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> of the waggons. The goods train was being shunted on a curve at low speed adjacent to the main line when 5 trucks derailed just as the {{passenger train}} approached. One truck toppled over; its load of timber projecting over the main line. The brake van 'was carried away {{with the exception of the}} offside and roof'. The next two carriages were 'clean swept away' above the floor level; the first compartment of the third passenger carriage was also destroyed.|$|E

50|$|Through the 1960s Saab AB {{developed}} a close-coupled canard delta configuration, with a delta foreplane {{just in front}} of and above the main delta wing. Patented in 1963, it first flew on the Viggen fighter in 1967. The <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> modifies the airflow over the wing, most notably when flying at high angles of attack. In contrast to the classic tail-mounted elevators, the canards add to the total lift, enabling the execution of extreme maneuvers, improving low-speed handling and lowering the landing speed. This configuration has since become common on supersonic fighter aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|In 1938 Kavanagh went to London. He {{remained}} {{there for about}} five months. The Green Fool, a loosely autobiographical novel, was published in 1938 and Kavanagh was accused of libel. Oliver St. John Gogarty sued Kavanagh for his description of {{his first visit to}} Gogarty's home: [...] "I mistook Gogarty's white-robed maid for his wife or his mistress; I expected every poet to have a spare wife." [...] Gogarty, who had taken offence at the <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> of the words [...] "wife" [...] and [...] "mistress", was awarded £100 in damages. The book, which recounted Kavanagh's rural childhood and his attempts to become a writer, received international recognition and good reviews.|$|E
5000|$|The {{alternating}} current {{in the primary}} produces an alternating magnetic field in the core, which then induces an {{alternating current}} in the secondary. The primary circuit is largely unaffected by the insertion of the CT. Accurate current transformers need <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> between the primary and secondary {{to ensure that the}} secondary current is proportional to the primary current over a wide current range. The current in the secondary is the current in the primary (assuming a single turn primary) divided by the number of turns of the secondary. In the illustration on the right, 'I' is the current in the primary, 'B' is the magnetic field, 'N' is the number of turns on the secondary, and 'A' is an AC ammeter.|$|E
50|$|The hypermethylation of the H19 {{promoter}} on the paternal allele plays a {{vital role}} in allowing the expression of the paternal allele of IGF2. In DNMT-null mice, the paternal allele of IGF2 is also silenced as the paternal H19 promoter is no longer methylated and repressed.A reason for the <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> of H19 and IGF2 expression may be that they share the same 3’ gene enhancer. When this 3’ enhancer was deleted, researchers Leighton et al. found decreased H19 and IGF2 RNA expressions in the gut, liver and kidney; however, the methylation status of these genes were not affected by the deleted enhancer. Suggestions for why H19 is preferentially activated by the 3’ enhancer instead of IGF2 are that H19 has a stronger promoter than IGF2 and that the H19 gene is physically closer to the 3’ enhancers than the IGF2 gene.|$|E

50|$|FPD-Link became {{successful}} at transmitting 18-bit RGB raw video because it reduced the cable size and improved the electromagnetic compatibility by using LVDS. It uses LVDS to transmit the video data on three twisted pair, and another pair to transmit the LVDS clock signal. These four differential pairs are carrying {{the same information}} previously transferred over 22 wires, which is almost a 65% wire reduction. In addition, the <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> of the twisted pair wires improves the EMC because the equal and opposite LVDS currents in the wires create equal and opposite electromagnetic fields that tend to cancel each other's effects. This reduces the radiated emissions. The reduced vulnerability to electrical noise interference {{comes from the fact}} the noise affects both signals commonly. Since the LVDS receiver senses {{the difference between the two}} commonly affected signals, it senses no impact from the common mode noise.|$|E

5000|$|In {{spite of}} the Sackville Street imbroglio, Gogarty's output {{over the next two}} years was prolific. In 1938 he {{published}} I Follow St. Patrick, a historical and geographic portrait of Ireland as told through Gogarty's rambling visits to various sites traditionally associated with St. Patrick; in 1939 he published Tumbling in the Hay, a semi-autobiographical comic novel about medical students in turn-of-the-century Dublin, and Elbow Room, another collection of poetry. In 1938 he relocated to London for a second time and brought forth his own libel suit against the young poet Patrick Kavanagh, whose autobiography The Green Fool said of Kavanagh's first visit to Gogarty's home: [...] "I mistook Gogarty's white-robed maid for his wife or his mistress; I expected every poet to have a spare wife."
