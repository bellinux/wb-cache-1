6000|$|We {{have not}} so far {{considered}} {{what is the nature}} of the initial stimulus to a behaviour-cycle. Yet it is here that the usual view of desire seems on the strongest ground. The hungry animal goes on making movements until it gets food; it seems natural, therefore, to suppose that the idea of food is present throughout the process, and that the thought of the end to be achieved sets the whole process in motion. Such a view, however, is obviously untenable in many cases, especially where instinct is concerned. Take, for example, reproduction and the rearing of the young. Birds mate, build a nest, lay eggs in it, sit on the eggs, feed the young birds, and care for them until they are fully grown. It is totally impossible to suppose that this series of actions, which constitutes one behaviour-cycle, is inspired by any prevision of the end, at any rate the first time it is performed.* We must suppose that the stimulus to the performance of each act is an impulsion from behind, not an attraction from the future. The bird does what it does, at each stage, because it has an impulse to that particular action, not because it perceives that the whole <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> will contribute to the preservation of the species. The same considerations apply to other instincts. A hungry animal feels restless, and is led by instinctive impulses to perform the movements which give it nourishment; but the act of seeking food is not sufficient evidence from which to conclude that the animal has the thought of food in its [...] "mind." ...|$|E

In addition, we argue that the deficit approach which characterises action research is unhelpful to some teachers. ...|$|R

This paper presents a computational strategy for detecting conflicts regarding proposed beliefs and for engaging in collaborative negotiation to resolve the conflicts that warrant resolution. Our model is capable of selecting the most effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution in cases where multiple conflicts arise, and of selecting appropriate evidence to justify the need for such modification.

The model considered cooperation as a continuous <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> and reactions between cooperating partners. The building blocks of the model include cooperative equilibrium, disruptive events, action types and action patterns. Three action pattern variables were proposed to describe the interactions. It was hypothesized that action patterns are contingent on partner relationships and the transaction cost characteristics of a partnership. The hypotheses were tested on a sample of 263 partnerships {{in the construction industry}} in Hong Kong. The quantitative study was supplemented by four in-depth case studies. The results show that: (1) trust was an important antecedent of action patterns; and (2) transaction cost variables moderate the relationships between partner relationships and action patterns. These findings suggest that future research should give more attention to the interaction of partners during cooperation. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005. ...|$|E

This action research study concerns {{learning and teaching}} with participants in a government labour market program which was established to address these two issues. The study was based on three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> research with six groups of participants. The main objective of the research evolved to consider whether critical thinking and action learning can enhance self-concept and environmental education for unemployed young people. The research provides a positive response to this problem, although certain limitations are noted. Conclusions are drawn in five areas. Three of these are from the first <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> research. These relate to environmental attitudes, knowledge and action; approaches to environmental education and learning; {{and the impact of}} unemployment, peer pressure and mass culture.

40|$|Industrial cache {{coherence}} protocol models often {{have too many}} reachable states, preventing full reachability analysis even for small model instances (number of processors, addresses, etc.). Several partial search debugging methods are, therefore, employed, including lossy state compression using hash compaction, and bounded model checking (BMC, or equivalently, depth-bounded search). We show that instead of a BMC approach, a bounded transaction approach is much more effective for debugging. This {{is because of the}} fact that the basic unit of activity in a {{cache coherence}} protocol is that of a transaction- e. g., a complete causal <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> beginning with a node making a request for a line and obtaining the line. The reduced effectiveness of BMC mainly stems from the fact that by limiting only the search depth, it cannot be guaranteed that complete transactions get selected, or that the right kind maximal number of interacting transactions. Thus, instead of bounded model-checking, which explores all possible interleavings in BFS, we propose a bounded transaction model-checking approach for debugging cache coherence protocols, where the criterion is to allow a certain number of transactions chose...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The use of {{informatics}} {{in education}} has provided many {{contributions to the}} understanding of teaching and learning processes. First, it made possible the distinction between instructionism, seen as transmission of information, and constructionism, as the process of knowledge construction that takes place when a learner produces a meaningful product through the use of computers. Second, programming activity, especially with the Logo language, has helped to understand how knowledge is constructed in the learner-computer interaction. The article shows that this understanding has evolved {{over the course of the}} years. Initially the knowledge representation aspect was emphasized. Later the program development process began to be seen as a <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions,</b> description-execution-reflection-debugging-description. Finally, a spiral is shown to be the best model to represent the relation of these actions in the knowledge construction process. The article explores the cycle and the spiral models to discuss the role of each of the actions and to explain how knowledge is constructed based upon several concepts used by Piaget and Papert, particularly reflection and debugging...|$|E

This is in opposition with the reduction {{of time spent in}} culinary preparation. While health discourses advocate consumer responsibility and invite them to consume a more balanced diet, we question the place of cooking in everyday life in France.

40|$|Abstract: Aims: Modeling of ionic {{distribution}} fluctuations of excitable tissues {{based on}} data elicited using focused microwave radiometry. Methodology: Focused Microwave Radiometry implemented to carry out measurements of in depth body temperature distributions, may provide the capability of sensing local electrical conductivity fluctuations during the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> potentials {{in the case of}} brain excitable cell clusters. An analog beamformer consisting of a conductive inner-surface ellipsoidal cavity is used to focus the chaotic-black body radiation emerging from human tissues by providing convergence of the electromagnetic energy from one focus area where the phantom or subject is placed, to the other where the antennas of sensitive radiometric receivers are positioned. During the past 10 years numerous phantom, animal and human volunteer experiments have been performed with the focused radiometry imaging system. The results show that the detected changes of the output radiometric voltage are attributed to temperature and/or conductivity changes that occur locally concentrated at the areas of interest under measurement. Theoretical and experimental studies are continuously carried out at various frequency bands in conjunction with the use of matching materials placed around the human head or phantom to improve focusing and detection depth. It seems that the manipulation of the focusing area in the tissue in terms of detection depth and spatial resolution is feasible depending on the suitable combination of operation frequencies and matching material.

40|$|In today's economy {{the task}} of {{improving}} business planning is considered a necessary component of any enterprise management process and is precisely the solution drawn from that task which determines the financial policy and economic structure. The development of technologies based on the optimization of business planning is a very urgent scientific challenge. In this paper we propose to use the methods of network planning and management {{as a tool for}} economic and mathematical modeling to optimize the management of business processes planning for economic entities. An economic-mathematical model is a network model relevant to the business planning process, that allows to determine the optimal choice of available technologies. The article provides a formalized description of the general methods of process optimization business planning for business entities in the presence of several technologies. As a result, we obtain the optimal network model works business planning. The example shows the use of the proposed economic-mathe-matical model to optimize the development of the business project to introduce a new product in the company, in particular, for the adoption of pricing solutions to the new product. For this example, the constructed network model, calculated the parameters of network modeling, the optimization of time and indicators of realization of the project cost, as well as an analysis of indicators in several technology business planning. Thus, we carried out a full <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> needed to use this toolkit.

40|$|Rural Europe faces new {{challenges}} {{in an increasingly}} globalized economy. There are problems of cost competition, outmigration, an ageing population, dispersed settlements, lack of proximity services and employment opportunities. On the other hand opportunities emerge from new demands of the information society, like a healthy environment and typical products of high quality, or space for creative leisure and learning activities, or like a new look to cultural traditions in agriculture and craftsmanship. At {{the same time the}} notion of distance has considerably changed due to new telecommunication technologies. The LEADER community initiative is supporting around 800 local action groups (LAG), especially in Objective 1 or 5 b rural areas all around Europe; LAG are public-private, public or more rarely private partnerships carrying ou their specific development programme for a smaller region (between 5000 and 100000 inhabitants). The work group on innovation studied and analysed a large number of innovative actions within, but also outside these LEADER areas. The features of the processes revealed that innovation takes place to an astounding extent, and that their specific character even contributes to a better understanding and further development of the concept of innovation. It can be shown that ? Innovation is not a single action, but does have a global character. The whole cycle of action which it comprises over time, sometimes contain quite ?banal" things, carried out step by step, following the logic of trial and error. The innovation lies in the interlinkages and connections which are created between resources, actors, activities and between the local and the external world. ? A <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> is innovative, if it emerges out of a given context and makes this context irreversibly more complex, more dynamic; it creates more alternatives of action and responses than had been disposable before. ? Innovation has a deeply social character. It is fuelled by ?energetic differentials", resulting from different ?speeds" of the local and the global (in terms of productivity, quality requirements, migration flows, nature degradation, [...] .); it really starts, when local actors start to perceive this differential in a new way. During the process new ways of collective learning and of conflict negotiation arise. Finally new common references, values, visions, attitudes or forms of organisation take shape. ? According to the stage of the process, three types of innovation can be distinguished. The first type relates to the mobilisation of people?s energies in the place. It is not directly creating new jobs and wealth, but prepares the soil for their later emergence. They can be characterized as innovations in facilitation and animation. The second type of innovation channels the energies in order to prepare the field for new, coherent and value adding activities. They deal with village renewal, the establishment of quality charts and organisational restructuring of formerly individually squandering actors. The third type of innovation deals with the creation of filieres in the value adding chain of local resources, moreover with the diversifcaton of the local economy and with creating synergies between formerly separate strands of activities. These innovations consolidate new links to the global and consolidate a new position in the economic competition between regions. These and more facts will be delivered by representatives of the work group on the base of selected case studies.
