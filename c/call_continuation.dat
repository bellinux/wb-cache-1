40|$|Abstract. Newer Prolog {{implementations}} commonly offer {{support for}} multi-threading, and have {{also begun to}} offer support for tabling. However, most implementations do not yet integrate tabling with multithreading, and in particular {{do not support the}} sharing of a tabled computation among threads. In this paper we present algorithms to share completed tables among threads based on Concurrent Local SLG evaluation (SLGCL). SLGCL is based on the Local scheduling strategy, and is designed to support applications in which threads concurrently share tabled evaluations Version 3. 1 of XSB implements SLGCL in the SLGCLWAM, which fully supports well-founded tabled negation, construction of residual programs, tabled constraints and answer subsumption. The implementation of SLGCL requires additions to a single tabling operation only. As a result, SLGCL should be implementable by any tabling system that uses Local evaluation, whether based on the Chat engine, linear tabling, or <b>call</b> <b>continuation.</b> ...|$|E

Homotopy algorithm {{can be considered as}} a developing of the classical methods in numerical computing such as Newton-Raphson and fixed point methods.

Two maintenance modalities are used. The first, <b>called</b> <b>continuation</b> maintenance, consists of continuing the same agent used in the initial treatment. The second, called switch-maintenance, introduces an early second line drug immediately after induction. Proving the superiority of a maintenance strategy implies a better outcome with the maintenance compared to the same therapeutic agent used upon disease progression. This benefit may be observed in terms of overall survival and/or quality of life...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} for interprocedural register allocation for the WAM is presented {{which is based}} on source-to-source transformations of an intermediary language <b>called</b> <b>Continuation</b> Prolog. Continuation Prolog fills the conceptual gap between Prolog source code and the underlying abstract machine. Our approach does not require an analysis of the whole program. Only the definition of a predicate must be analyzed, but not its use. For certain kinds of predicates like DCGs no analysis is required at all. An implementation of our approach has been integrated into the WAM code generation of SICStusProlog. Our approach yields speedups up to 30 % for existing benchmarks...|$|R

Such a caught state is the very thing <b>called</b> <b>continuation,</b> and it can be considered as the state of a (relatively complicated) automaton. The step of the automaton is deducing the next continuation from the previous one, and the execution process is the cycle of such steps.|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{analyses}} reason about a program’s concrete heap {{and control}} flow and hence can report on actual program behavior with high or even perfect accuracy. But many dy-namic analyses require extensive program instrumentation, often {{slowing down the}} analyzed program considerably. In the past, researchers have hence developed specialized static optimizations that can prove instrumentation for a special analysis unnecessary at many program locations: the analysis can safely omit monitoring these locations, as their monitoring would not change the analysis results. Arguing about the correctness of such optimizations is hard, however, and ad-hoc approaches have lead to mistakes in the past. In this paper we present a correctness criterion <b>called</b> <b>Continuation</b> Equivalence, which allows researchers to prove static optimizations of dynamic analyses correct more eas-ily. The criterion demands that an optimization may alter instrumentation at a program site only if the altered instru-mentation produces a dynamic analysis configuration equiv-alent to {{the configuration of the}} un-altered program with respect to all possible continuations of the control flow. In previous work, we have used a notion of continuation-equivalent states to prove the correctness of static optimiza-tion for finite-state runtime monitors. With this work, we propose to generalize the idea to general dynamic analyses...|$|R
