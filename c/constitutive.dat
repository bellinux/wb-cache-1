5|$|Plant {{defenses}} can {{be classified}} generally as <b>constitutive</b> or induced. <b>Constitutive</b> defenses are always present in the plant, while induced defenses are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of <b>constitutive</b> defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are <b>constitutive,</b> as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize. A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are {{used to determine the}} mechanism of <b>constitutive</b> and induced plant defenses responses against herbivory.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of externalism {{maintain}} that the surrounding world is in some sense <b>constitutive</b> of the mind.|$|E
5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological {{and physiological}} changes. An advantage of inducible, as opposed to <b>constitutive</b> defenses, {{is that they are}} only produced when needed, and are therefore potentially less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E
5|$|An inverse agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of <b>constitutive</b> active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E
25|$|Article 4(h) of the <b>Constitutive</b> Act, {{repeated}} in article 4 of the Protocol to the <b>Constitutive</b> Act on the PSC, also recognises {{the right of}} the Union to intervene in member state in circumstances of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Any decision to intervene in a member state under article 4 of the <b>Constitutive</b> Act will be made by the Assembly on the recommendation of the PSC.|$|E
25|$|Proteins whose levels remain stable from {{prophase}} {{until late}} anaphase include <b>constitutive</b> {{components of the}} inner plate and the stable components of the outer kinetocore, such as the Ndc80 complex, KNL/KBP proteins (kinetochore-null/KNL-binding protein), MIS proteins and CENP-F. Together with the <b>constitutive</b> components, these proteins seem to organize the nuclear core of {{the inner and outer}} structures in the kinetochore.|$|E
25|$|<b>Constitutive</b> heterochromatin, {{which is}} never expressed. It is located around the {{centromere}} and usually contains repetitive sequences.|$|E
25|$|A facultative gene is a gene only {{transcribed}} {{when needed}} {{as opposed to}} a <b>constitutive</b> gene.|$|E
25|$|A <b>constitutive</b> gene is a {{gene that}} is {{transcribed}} continually {{as opposed to a}} facultative gene, which is only transcribed when needed.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of Slobodan Milošević's {{interviews}} have been collected online by his supporters. Milošević argued that the Yugoslav Constitution gave self-determination to <b>constitutive</b> nations, not to republics and Serbs were <b>constitutive</b> nation in both the Socialistic Republic of Croatia and the Socialistic Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. On this basis, he stated that the Croatian Serbs and later the Bosnian Serbs {{should not have been}} subject to the declarations of independence by the Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|C-banding: Giemsa binds to <b>constitutive</b> heterochromatin, so it stains centromeres.The name {{is derived}} from centromeric or <b>constitutive</b> heterochromatin. The {{preparations}} undergo alkaline denaturation prior to staining leading to an almost complete depurination of the DNA. After washing the probe the remaining DNA is renatured again and stained with Giemsa solution consisting of methylene azure, methylene violet, methylene blue, and eosin. Heterochromatin binds {{a lot of the}} dye, {{while the rest of the}} chromosomes absorb only little of it. The C-bonding proved to be especially well-suited for the characterization of plant chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Transcription {{starts from}} the <b>constitutive</b> PL, PR and PR {{promoters}} producing the 'immediate early' transcripts. At first, these express the N and cro genes, producing N, Cro {{and a short}} inactive protein.|$|E
25|$|The CMV {{promoter}} {{is commonly}} included in vectors used in genetic engineering work conducted in mammalian cells, {{as it is}} a strong promoter and drives <b>constitutive</b> expression of genes under its control.|$|E
25|$|Human renin is {{secreted}} by {{at least}} 2 cellular pathways: a <b>constitutive</b> pathway for the secretion of the precursor prorenin and a regulated pathway for the secretion of mature renin.|$|E
25|$|The eponymous style n° 30 of {{the book}} on the 188 styles of tie knots is a three layered bow-tie worn by a woman, the <b>constitutive</b> ribbons being {{stitched}} together behind the neck.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 the U.N. Security Council adopted {{resolution}} 1820, which {{noted that}} “rape {{and other forms}} of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a <b>constitutive</b> act with respect to genocide”.|$|E
25|$|This is {{data from}} two Yugoslav censuses (1971 and 1981). Ethnic {{groups that were}} {{considered}} to be <b>constitutive</b> (explicitly mentioned in the constitution, and not considered minority or immigrant) appear in bold text.|$|E
25|$|Newton's law of {{viscosity}} is a <b>constitutive</b> equation (like Hooke's law, Fick's law, Ohm's law): {{it is not}} {{a fundamental}} law of nature but an approximation that holds in some materials and fails in others.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of approach, the {{formulation}} {{is based on}} the same three fundamental relations: equilibrium, <b>constitutive,</b> and compatibility. The solutions are approximate when any of these relations are only approximately satisfied, or only an approximation of reality.|$|E
25|$|The first mayor {{after the}} merger, Anton Scherbinek (ÖVP), {{was elected by}} the {{municipal}} council on 20 April 2015 during the <b>constitutive</b> session. Until then, the Commissioner of the Government, Günter Scherübl had {{been in charge of}} official business since 1 January 2015.|$|E
25|$|Darcy's {{law is a}} <b>constitutive</b> equation, empirically {{derived by}} Henry Darcy in 1856, which states {{that the amount of}} {{groundwater}} discharging through a given portion of aquifer is proportional to the cross-sectional area of flow, the hydraulic gradient, and the hydraulic conductivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{more complex}} {{generalized}} forms of Ohm's law {{are important to}} condensed matter physics, which studies the properties of matter and, in particular, its electronic structure. In broad terms, they fall under the topic of <b>constitutive</b> equations and the theory of transport coefficients.|$|E
25|$|Further {{heterogeneity}} of ion channels arises when channels with different <b>constitutive</b> subunits {{give rise to}} a specific kind of current. Absence or mutation of {{one or more of the}} contributing types of channel subunits can result in loss of function and, potentially, underlie neurologic diseases.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 study {{investigated}} the interaction between bisphenolA's and estrogen-related receptor γ (ERR-γ). This orphan receptor (endogenous ligand unknown) behaves as a <b>constitutive</b> activator of transcription. BPA seems to bind strongly to ERR-γ (dissociation constant = 5.5 nM), but only weakly to the ER. BPA binding to ERR-γ preserves its basal <b>constitutive</b> activity. It can also protect it from deactivation from the SERM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (afimoxifene). This may be the mechanism by which BPA acts as a xenoestrogen. Different expression of ERR-γ {{in different parts of}} the body may account for variations in bisphenolA effects. For instance, ERR-γ has been found in high concentration in the placenta, explaining reports of high bisphenol accumulation in this tissue. BPA has also been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30).|$|E
25|$|The {{expression}} of Class III β-tubulin is regulated {{at both the}} transcriptional and translational levels. In neural tissue, <b>constitutive</b> expression is driven by Sox4 and Sox11. In non-neural tissues, regulation is dependent on an E-box site in the 3' flanking region at +168 nucleotides. This site binds basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) hypoxia induced transcription factors Hif-1α and Hif-2α and is epigenetically modified in cancer cells with <b>constitutive</b> TUBB3 expression. Translational regulation of TUBB3 occurs in the 3`flanking region with {{the interaction of the}} miR-200c family of micro-RNA. MiR-200c is in turn modulated by the protein HuR (encoded by ELAVL1). When HuR is predominantly in the nucleus, a phenomenon typically occurring in low stage carcinomas, miR-200c suppresses class III β-tubulin translation. By contrast, cytoplasmic HuR and miR-200c enhance class III β-tubulin translation by facilitating the entry of the mRNA into the ribosome.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{evacuated}} enterprises {{remained at}} their new sites after the war. They increased industrial production in Siberia {{to a great}} extent, and became <b>constitutive</b> for many cities, like Rubtsovsk. The most Eastern city to receive them was Ulan-Ude, since Chita was considered dangerously close to China and Japan.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} of the neural correlates of reciprocal imitation is extremely important because it provides an ecological paradigm (a situation close to everyday life) {{to address the issue}} of the sense of agency. There is evidence that reciprocal imitation plays a <b>constitutive</b> role in the early development of an implicit sense of self as a social agent.|$|E
25|$|All non-relativistic balance equations, {{such as the}} Navier–Stokes equations, can {{be derived}} by {{beginning}} with the Cauchy equations and specifying the stress tensor through a <b>constitutive</b> relation. By expressing the shear tensor in terms of viscosity and fluid velocity, and assuming constant density and viscosity, the Cauchy equations {{will lead to the}} Navier–Stokes equations.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} aspects as well which they share: the {{similarities}} of their rules of life, a missionary commitment, an insistence on certain human virtues (openness, simplicity, warmth), {{a balance of}} the three <b>constitutive</b> elements of religious life (prayer, community, and apostolate), emphasis on co-responsibility in governance, collaboration with the laity, {{and the importance of}} belonging to an international family.|$|E
25|$|Within digital humanitarianism, {{big data}} has {{featured}} strongly {{in efforts to}} improve digital humanitarian work and produces a limited understanding of how a crisis is unfolding. It {{has been argued that}} Big Data is <b>constitutive</b> of a social relation in which both the formal humanitarian sector and victims of crises are in need of the services and labor that can be provided by digital humanitarians.|$|E
25|$|Much {{contemporary}} Catholic {{missionary work}} has undergone profound change since the Second Vatican Council of 1962-1965, {{and has become}} explicitly conscious of social justice issues and the dangers of cultural imperialism or economic exploitation disguised as religious conversion. Contemporary Christian missionaries argue that working for justice forms a <b>constitutive</b> part of preaching the Gospel, and observe the principles of inculturation in their missionary work.|$|E
25|$|The {{karyotype}} of the Muscovy duck is 2n=80, {{consisting of}} {{three pairs of}} macrochromosomes, 36 pairs of microchromosomes, {{and a pair of}} sex chromosomes. The two largest macrochromosome pairs are submetacentric, while all other chromosomes are acrocentric or (for the smallest microchromosomes) probably telocentric. The submetacentric chromosomes and the Z (female) chromosome show rather little <b>constitutive</b> heterochromatin (C bands), while the W chromosomes are at least two-thirds heterochromatin.|$|E
25|$|The African Union, {{not to be}} {{confused}} with the AU Commission, is formed by the <b>Constitutive</b> Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the <b>Constitutive</b> Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.|$|E
25|$|Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica (ENEE) {{was created}} in 1957 by Decree 48, the Ley Constitutiva de la Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica—the <b>Constitutive</b> Law. Its mandate was to promote the country’s {{electrification}} through the study, construction and operation of electrification works, government representation in any company in which the Government was a shareholder, and to provide assistance to any private generator or distributor that would require it.|$|E
25|$|In {{physics and}} thermodynamics, an {{equation}} of state is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describes the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions. It is a <b>constitutive</b> equation which provides a mathematical relationship between two or more state functions associated with the matter, such as its pressure, volume, temperature (PVT), or internal energy. Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, solids, and the interior of stars.|$|E
25|$|These {{ideas have}} largely framed or {{influenced}} all subsequent philosophical discussion and analysis. The specifics of Kant's account generated immediate and lasting controversy. Nevertheless, his thesesthat the mind itself necessarily makes a <b>constitutive</b> contribution to its knowledge, that this contribution is transcendental rather than psychological, that philosophy involves self-critical activity, that morality {{is rooted in}} human freedom, and that to act autonomously is to act according to rational moral principleshave all had a lasting effect on subsequent philosophy.|$|E
