5000|$|Another {{important}} {{facet of}} his translation works are his so-called [...] "funny translations", which are parodies of awkward translations {{presented at the}} Russian movie market, where characters apparently speak quite differently from how they spoke in the original films. The discrepancy between [...] "funny-translated" [...] and original film creates a strong comic effect. Moreover, changing the names of characters, music, and adding new video and sound effects can turn a serious movie into a true slapstick comedy. [...] "Funny-translated" [...] films often skewer prominent world and Russian events (including social and political life) and contain references to well-known American, Soviet and current Russian films. Puchkov's [...] "funny-translations" [...] come with the logo of another of Puchkov's studios, Bozhya Iskra (God's Spark). All funny translations are made {{with the help of}} Puchkov's site visitors and their names appear {{at the end of the}} movie in a <b>cast</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
50|$|The turret was {{the most}} modern looking part; {{it was also an}} obvious {{makeshift}} solution, somewhat crudely welded together from plates taken from the wreck of the battleship Dunkerque scuttled in 1942, made necessary by the simple fact that Schneider as yet could not produce complete cast turrets large enough to hold a 90 mm gun. The turret front, however, was a <b>cast</b> <b>section.</b> As the turret was positioned near the middle of the tank, even when pointing to the back the gun would have a large overhang; to facilitate transport it was therefore made retractable into the turret, its breech even exiting through an rectangular opening {{in the rear of the}} bustle, covered by a bolted-on plate. This could also be used to load ammunition. The turret was rotated by a Simca 5 engine. Three men out of a crew of five were seated in the turret. It also held a SCR 508 radio set. This differed from the configuration in the Char B1 bis where the radio had been placed at the inner left hull side. With the ARL 44, the space gained was used for a door which was the normal way for the crew to enter the tank. Additionally there were a rectangular hatch at the left turret top, and a circular hatch at the right with between them a very low cupola for the commander.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{aluminide}} coating, Codep B- 1, and of section thickness were investigated on two cast nickel base superalloys, Rene 80 and Rene 120. <b>Cast</b> <b>section</b> thicknesses ranged from 0. 038 cm to 0. 15 cm. Simulated engine exposures for 1000 hours at 899 C or 982 C in a jet fuel burner rig with cyclic air cooling were studied, as were the effects of surface machining before coating and re-machining and re-coating after exposures. The properties evaluated included tensile at room temperature., 871 C and 982 C, stress rupture at 760 C, 871 C, 982 C and 1093 C, high cycle mechanical fatigue at room temperature., and thermal fatigue with a 1093 C peak temperature. Thin sections had tensile strengths similar to standard size bars up to 871 C and lower strengths at 982 C and above, with equivalent elongation, and stress rupture life was lower for thin sections at all test conditions. The aluminide coating lowered tensile and rupture strengths up to 871 C, with greater effects on thinner specimens. Elevated temperature exposure lowered tensile and rupture strengths of thinner specimens at the lower test temperatures. Surface machining {{had little effect on}} properties, but re-machining after exposure reduced thickness and increased metallurgical changes enough to lower properties at most test conditions...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{temperature}} measurement of molten steel in new {{as well as}} existing steelmaking processes is not always feasible with current technology. However, it is a well known fact that molten steel temperature, especially during the continuous casting operation, can {{have a profound effect}} on the quality of the product. A knowledge of the instantaneous steel temperature in the tundish can serve as a valuable tool in the quest for better quality. With the implementation of statistical process control techniques such occurrences as breakouts, tundish freeze up or the nucleation of an extensive area of columnar grains in the <b>cast</b> <b>section</b> can be reduced. However, conventional thermocouples cannot withstand the severe corrosion around the slag line for a sustained period of time. Even though the sensing wires that comprise the hot junction can, if well protected, be used for long periods of time without serious deterioration, a suitable refractory cover or sleeve must be applied to the thermocouple prior to using it. For the present work, two methods for continuously measuring melt temperature were developed. One of these relies on deducing melt temperature while the other is based on providing a cooled sleeve for the thermocouple to minimize slag line corrosion. The first technique involves the use of multiple thermocouples embedded in a refractory section at various displacements. When the refractory is contacted by the melt, transient heat transfer is initiated through the section. By analyzing this transient behaviour with a suitable heat transfer model, it is possible to infer the temperature of the melt. A mathematical model that adequately describes this process has been developed and tested. An alternative approach that was developed uses heat pipe technology to prevent the corrosion of the thermocouple probe through solidification of slag onto the heat pipe which can serve as a protector of the probe. Heat pipes are devices capable of transferring large quantities of heat with very small temperature differences. Advantages of the heat pipe when used as a heat transmission device are constructional simplicity, flexibility, high heat transport capability, and no need for external pumping device. The heat pipe consists of a closed evacuated tube, porous wicking material, and working fluid. Heating one part of the external surface leads to evaporation of the working fluid and the establishment of a pressure gradient within the heat pipe. The resulting pressure difference drives the vapor from the evaporator to the condenser where the pressure and temperature are slightly lower. The effective conductance of the heat pipe can be several orders of magnitude higher than that of an equivalent solid copper bar. In the second part of this thesis, the feasibility of incorporating heat pipe technology to solidify and maintain a thin layer of slag on the heat pipe while it is in operation is presented...|$|E
