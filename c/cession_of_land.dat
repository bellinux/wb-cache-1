5|$|The large Mexican <b>Cession</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> had {{divided the}} United States politically, with {{many in the}} North insisting that slavery not be allowed there (and {{offering}} the Wilmot Proviso to ensure it), while others wanted slavery barred north of the Missouri Compromise line of 36°30′ N. Both proposals were anathema to many Southerners, and the controversy divided the Democrats. At the 1848 Democratic National Convention, the majority nominated former Michigan senator Lewis Cass for president, while a minority broke off to become the Free Soil Party, backing former president Van Buren. The Whigs chose General Zachary Taylor, a Louisianan, whose views on most political issues were unknown. Despite his past support for Van Buren, Pierce supported Cass, turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil ticket, and was so effective that Taylor, who was elected president, was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1873, a United States {{military}} commission recommended attempting to obtain Ford Island {{in exchange for}} the tax-free importation of sugar to the U.S. At that time Major General John Schofield, U.S. commander of the military division of the Pacific, and Brevet Brigadier General Burton S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii to ascertain its defensive capabilities. U.S. control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of the west coast of the United States, and they were especially interested in Pu'uloa, Pearl Harbor. The sale of one of Hawaii's harbors was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop, a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family, had risen in the government to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and owned a country home near Pu'uloa. He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, William Charles Lunalilo, was content to let Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any <b>cession</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking, against his doctor's advice; his health declined swiftly, and he died on February 3, 1874.|$|E
25|$|The loss {{of support}} from the Spanish, who had their own {{problems}} with Napoleon I of France in Europe, convinced Watts to end the fighting. Two months later, on November 7, 1794, he made the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse. It was notable for not requiring any more land cessions by the Cherokee, other than finally ended the series of conflicts, which was notable for not requiring any further <b>cession</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> other than requiring the Lower (or Chickamauga) Cherokee to recognize the cessions of the Holston treaty.

25|$|In 1819, the Council sent Ross to Washington, D.C.. He {{assumed a}} larger {{leadership}} role. The delegation proposed {{to clarify the}} provisions of the Treaty of 1817--both to limit the ceded lands and clarify Cherokee right to the remaining lands. Secretary of War John C. Calhoun pressed Ross to cede large tracts of land in Tennessee and Georgia. Although he refused, the US government pressure continued and intensified. In October 1822, Calhoun requested that the Cherokee relinquish their land claimed by Georgia, in fulfillment of the United States' obligation under the Compact of 1802. Before responding to Calhoun's proposition, Ross first ascertained the sentiment of the Cherokee people. They were unanimously opposed to further <b>cession</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
500|$|As American {{troops were}} sent to China to relieve the nation's legation, Hay {{sent a letter to}} foreign powers (often called the Second Open Door note), stating while the United States wanted to see lives {{preserved}} and the guilty punished, it intended that China not be dismembered. [...] Hay issued this on July 3, 1900, suspecting that the powers were quietly making private arrangements to divide up China. Communication between the foreign legations and the outside world had been cut off, and the personnel there were falsely presumed slaughtered, but Hay realized that Minister Wu could get a message in, and Hay was able to establish communication. [...] Hay suggested to the Chinese government that it now cooperate for its own good. [...] When the foreign relief force, principally Japanese but including 2,000 Americans, relieved the legations and sacked Peking, China was made to pay a huge indemnity but there was no <b>cession</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In British North America, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 {{following}} the Seven Years' War governed the <b>cession</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by treaty or purchase [...] Subsequently, France ceded {{most of the}} land in Upper Canada to Great Britain.

5000|$|A {{series of}} {{treaties}} established a small reservation in 1864 in northeast Utah, and a reservation in 1868, {{which included the}} western third of modern Colorado.

50|$|As colonial {{settlement}} surrounded Indian Woods, the Tuscarora suffered {{discrimination and}} other acts: they were overcharged or denied use of ferries, restricted in hunting, and cheated in trade; their timber was illegally logged, and their lands were continuously encroached upon by herders and squatters.

50|$|The {{meridian}} was {{surveyed by}} Benjamin Hough in April 1815.

50|$|Ninigret's {{daughter}} succeeded him as sachem.

This <b>cession</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> later created difficulties for the Niantics. The younger Ninigret died about 1722, leaving sons Charles Augustus and George. Charles Augustus died shortly afterward and left an infant son. Some of the tribe acknowledged the boy as their sachem, while another portion adhered to his uncle George, who assumed the entire government in 1735.|$|E

Historians have disputed {{the significance of}} Williams' leadership to this migration {{compared to that of}} the Oneida people themselves, including Oneida leader Daniel Bread.

50|$|KwaMatiwane (execution hill) is {{the ridge}} {{northeast}} of uMgungundlovu. It {{is named after}} the chief Matiwane. In 1829 Dingane had him and all his followers executed, as they had gone against his rule. Years later, this was the place where Dingane directed the killing on 6 February 1838 of the Voortrekker Piet Retief and his party. The British missionary and his staff had warned Retief {{that he was in}} danger from Dingane, but the chief had won the trekkers' trust and they did not listen. Dingane had them killed after agreeing to a large <b>cession</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> (which he may not have fully understood, as the document was in English).|$|E
50|$|Negotiations {{begun in}} September 1816 between the United States {{government}} and the Chickasaw nation, concluded with {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Pontotoc in October 1832. During these 16 years, federal officials pressed the Chickasaw for <b>cessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> to enable white settlement. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830, authorizing forcible removal if necessary to extinguish Native American claims in the Southeast. From 1832 to 1836, government surveyors mapped the 6442000 acre of the Chickasaw domain, dividing it into townships, ranges and sections. The Mississippi Legislature formed 10 new counties, including DeSoto, Tunica, Marshall and Tate, from this territory.|$|R
50|$|The Peoria {{migrated}} southwest into Missouri Territory after 1763.
