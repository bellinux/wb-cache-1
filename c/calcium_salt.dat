25|$|Benzoic {{acid and}} its salts {{are used as}} a food preservatives, {{represented}} by the E-numbers E210, E211, E212, and E213. Benzoic acid inhibits the growth of mold, yeast and some bacteria. It is either added directly or created from reactions with its sodium, potassium, or <b>calcium</b> <b>salt.</b> The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH changes to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of benzoic acid and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food. Acidic food and beverage like fruit juice (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbon dioxide), soft drinks (phosphoric acid), pickles (vinegar) or other acidified food are preserved with benzoic acid and benzoates.|$|E
25|$|When a {{bacterium}} detects environmental conditions are becoming unfavourable it may {{start the process}} of endosporulation, which takes about eight hours. The DNA is replicated and a membrane wall known as a spore septum begins to form {{between it and the}} rest of the cell. The plasma membrane of the cell surrounds this wall and pinches off to leave a double membrane around the DNA, and the developing structure is now known as a forespore. Calcium dipicolinate, the <b>calcium</b> <b>salt</b> of dipicolinic acid, is incorporated into the forespore during this time. The dipicolinic acid helps stabilize the proteins and DNA in the endospore. Next the peptidoglycan cortex forms between the two layers and the bacterium adds a spore coat to the outside of the forespore. In the final stages of endospore formation the newly forming endospore is dehydrated and allowed to mature before being released from the mother cell. The cortex is what makes the endospore so resistant to temperature. The cortex contains an inner membrane known as the core. The inner membrane that surrounds this core leads to the endospore's resistance against UV light and harsh chemicals that would normally destroy microbes. Sporulation is now complete, and the mature endospore will be released when the surrounding vegetative cell is degraded.|$|E

40|$|Microencapsulation is a {{technique}} used to form micro beads by granulation and coating with film-forming materials. The cross-linking and hydrogel interaction of alginate and <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> {{play an important role}} in the preparation of calcium-alginate beads. In this study, we studied the formability and quality index of calciumalginate beads made by sodium alginate (3 %) and different <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> (<b>calcium</b> chloride, calcium lactate and calcium acetate with 0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 25 M) with different curing time (5, 30 and 60 min). The result showed that the sodium alginate concentration, <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> concentration and curing time were important factors of hydrogel bead formability. Increasing the concentration of <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> and curing time enhanced the cross-linkage between alginate and calcium. It resulted in enhancing the egg-box structure. It also led to decreasing particle size, raising hardness, and decreasing swelling capacity and moiture content. The appearances of wet hydrogel beads made by different <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> were all spherical. However, dry hydrogel beads were easily deformed when the concentration of <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> was less than 0. 1 M and curing time less than 30 min. The thermo-analysis showed that the onset temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp) and enthalpy (ΔH) were the highest when treated by 0. 25 M of <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> at 60 min curing time. In the SEM micrographs, there was more shrinking on the surface of samples formed by 0. 25 M of <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> at 60 min curing time. Finally, the calcium-alginate hydrogel beads which were treated by curing agents, calcium chloride or calcium acetate, have better formability, stronger structure and higher hardness. 微膠囊（microencapsulation）是一種利用成膜材料，進行包覆、造粒成小粒之技術。海藻酸及鈣鹽之交鏈鍵結、凝膠作用是重要製備材料及關鍵技術之一。本研究探討海藻酸鈉（ 3 %）與不同鈣鹽（氯化鈣、乳酸鈣、醋酸鈣； 0. 01 、 0. 05 、 0. 1 、 0. 25 M）、固化時間（ 5 、 30 、 60 min）之微膠囊成型性及評估粒子之各項品質。實驗結果如下：海藻酸鈉、鈣離子濃度及固化時間是影響海藻酸鈣微膠囊化－晶球成型性之重要因子；隨鈣離子濃度提高及固化時間延長，海藻酸與鈣之結合、交鏈作用較多，使其蛋盒立體“egg-box”構造愈完整、緻密，其凝膠晶球粒徑較小、硬度較高、膨潤力及含水率下降，在外觀上三種鈣鹽晶球濕晶球均呈圓球粒，乾晶球在鈣離子 0. 1 M、固化時間 30 分鐘以下均容易變形；其熱性質起始溫度（To）、尖峰溫度（Tp）及熱焓值（ΔH）以 0. 25 M鈣離子、固化 60 分鐘者均呈較高值；在晶球粒子表面微細構造觀察，會有較多收縮紋路出現。實驗結果以氯化鈣及醋酸鈣可得到成型性較佳、構造較緻密、硬度較高之海藻酸－鈣晶球粒子...|$|R

40|$|Carole NadinCore Medical Publishing, Knutsford, UKIntroduction: Patients on {{hemodialysis}} require phosphate binders {{to reduce}} dietary phosphate absorption and control serum phosphate. The standard therapy, <b>calcium</b> <b>salts,</b> can {{be associated with}} elevated serum calcium (hypercalcemia). Concern has been raised that hypercalcemia, especially combined with elevated serum phosphate, may be associated with arterial calcification, and this may contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Sevelamer is a nonmetal, nonabsorbed phosphate binder. Aims: This review assesses the evidence for the therapeutic value of sevelamer as a phosphate binder in adult hemodialysis patients. Evidence review: Strong evidence shows that sevelamer is as effective as <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> in controlling serum phosphate and calcium&ndash;phosphate product, has less risk of inducing hypercalcemia and is more effective at lowering lipid levels. Some evidence indicates that sevelamer reduces arterial calcification progression and loss of bone mineral density, but it {{may be more likely to}} induce metabolic acidosis, compared with <b>calcium</b> <b>salts.</b> Sevelamer-containing regimens may improve calcific uremic arteriolopathy, although the evidence is weak. Evidence is divided on whether the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events with sevelamer is similar to or higher than that with <b>calcium</b> <b>salts.</b> Retrospective and modeling studies suggest lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with sevelamer than with <b>calcium</b> <b>salts,</b> with incremental cost-effectiveness of $US 1100 &ndash; 2200 per life-year gained. Further direct evidence is needed on mortality, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Place in therapy: Sevelamer is effective in controlling serum phosphate and lowering lipid levels in hemodialysis patients without inducing hypercalcemia, and may have beneficial effects on arterial calcification.

40|$|Calcium acetate, an {{effective}} phosphorus binder {{in patients with}} renal failure. <b>Calcium</b> <b>salts</b> are increasingly used as phosphorus binders in patients with chronic renal failure. Calcium carbonate is the principal salt presently utilized, however, other <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> {{may be more effective}} and safer phosphorus binders. Theoretical calculations, in vitro experiments, and in vivo studies in normal subjects have shown calcium acetate to be a more effective phosphorus binder than other <b>calcium</b> <b>salts.</b> This salt has not previously been studied in patients with chronic renal failure. We used a one-meal gastrointestinal balance technique to measure phosphorus absorption, calcium absorption and phosphorus binding in six patients with chronic renal failure. Calcium acetate was compared with calcium carbonate and placebo. Equivalent doses (50 mEq Ca++) of calcium acetate bound {{more than twice as much}} phosphorus (106 ± 23 mg) as calcium carbonate (43 ± 39 mg) P < 0. 05. When phosphorus binding was factored for calcium absorption, calcium acetate bound 0. 44 mEq HPO 4 =/mEq absorbed Ca++ compared with 0. 16 mEq HP) 4 =bound/mEq Ca++absorbed with calcium carbonate. More efficient phosphorus binding permits serum phosphorus concentration to be controlled with lower doses of <b>calcium</b> <b>salts.</b> The higher phosphorus binding/calcium absorption ratio coupled with a lower dose indicates that less calcium will be absorbed when calcium acetate is used for phosphorus control. Markedly positive calcium balance, hypercalcemia and ectopic calcification should be less likely to occur with this drug than other <b>calcium</b> <b>salts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Several calcium {{supplements}} {{are currently}} available {{and many of}} them are marketed without proper comparison of the bioavailability of the actual preparations. The aim of the present trial was to evaluate and compare the acute changes in serum calcium (Ca) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels following the oral administration of a vehicle and of five <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> currently prescribed in Western Europe. No significant changes in serum Ca or PTH levels were observed after administration of the vehicle. All <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> induced significant increases in serum Ca and decreases in serum PTH compared to baseline values. Comparison of the six response curves revealed a significantly greater increase in serum Ca and a greater decrease in serum PTH after each of the <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> than observed after the vehicle. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the different <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> for serum Ca increments. The decrease in serum PTH observed after administration of an ossein-hydroxyapatite complex was significantly less important than after the four other <b>calcium</b> <b>salts,</b> even if statistically different than after vehicle. When assessing the area under the curve (AUC) of PTH values, we observed that calcium carbonate and citrate induce a significantly greater decrease in serum PTH than the other <b>calcium</b> <b>salts</b> which are, however, statistically more active than the vehicle. Serum PTH is decreased under the lower limit of the normal range (10 pg/ml), between t 60 and t 120 for calcium carbonate and citrate and between t 60 and t 90 for calcium gluconolactate while the mean PTH values remain within the normal range throughout the study with calcium pidolate, the ossein-hydroxyapatite complex and the vehicle. In conclusion, all calcium preparations significantly increase serum calcium and decrease serum parathormone, compared to what is observed after oral intake of a vehicle. However, significant differences in suppression of parathormone are observed between the different calcium preparations and might be of importance for their clinical use. Peer reviewe...|$|R
