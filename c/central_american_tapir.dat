50|$|Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), {{also known}} as the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>tapir,</b> is a species of tapir native to Mexico, Central America and northwestern South America. It is one of four Latin American species of tapir.|$|E
40|$|This note {{reports a}} {{historic}} {{record of the}} <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>Tapir,</b> Tapirus bairdii, for the Coastal Plain of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca, Mexico. The record was dated to the decade of 1950, and was found 40 km from the closest historic locality. The presence of this species suggests two hypotheses: that the observed specimens belong to a previously existing population in this region, or that these specimens come from the Los Chimalapas region...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus bairdii), is {{the largest}} {{mammalian}} species of neotropical affinity known today. It plays {{a very important role}} in tropical forest ecology in terms of herbivory, predation and seed dispersal. However, due to habitat loss and hunting pressure, the species is endangered. Using camera-traps and with the informed participation of the people from the locality, we documented the presence of several individuals of this species in Totontepec, Villa de Morelos, Sierra Mixe, Oaxaca. Evidence suggests the existence of a breeding population and confirms earlier work that suggested its presence in the area...|$|E

50|$|Like {{the other}} Latin <b>American</b> <b>tapirs</b> (the {{mountain}} <b>tapir,</b> the South <b>American</b> <b>tapir,</b> {{and the little}} black tapir), the Baird's tapir is commonly called danta by people in all areas. In the regions around Oaxaca and Veracruz, it {{is referred to as}} the anteburro. Panamanians, and Colombians call it macho de monte, and in Belize, where the Baird's tapir is the national animal, it is known as the mountain cow.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{reptiles}} like the Dipsas indica the highly venomous Bothrops jararaca and many mammal species including; jaguar, South <b>American</b> <b>tapir,</b> Three-toed sloth, ocelot and Crab-eating fox.|$|R
40|$|Tapirs {{are known}} as {{effective}} dispersers of large-seeded tree species, but their role in dispersing small-seeded plant species {{has yet to be}} established. Tapir feces have been reported to contain large numbers of small seeds, but whether these are viable has rarely been evaluated. We determined the abundance and viability of small seeds in feces of <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus bairdii) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. A total of 72 fecal samples were collected opportunistically from 4 tapir latrine sites. Seeds were manually extracted from feces and classified by size. Seed viability was estimated by opening each seed and examining for the presence of at least 1 intact firm white endosperm. In total, we obtained 8166 seeds of at least 16 plant species. Small-seeded species dominated, with 96 % of all seeds found measurin...|$|E
