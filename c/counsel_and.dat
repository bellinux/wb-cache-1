5|$|The Assistance of Counsel Clause includes, as {{relevant}} here, {{at least six}} distinct rights: the right to counsel of choice, the right to appointed counsel, the right not to be constructively denied counsel, the right to conflict-free counsel, the effective assistance of <b>counsel,</b> <b>and</b> the right to represent oneself pro se.|$|E
5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} <b>counsel</b> <b>and</b> certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with <b>counsel</b> <b>and</b> that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant. Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E
5|$|Procedural due process, {{arising from}} the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, is {{minimally}} the right to notice and a hearing, but has been held to include in some circumstances rights to <b>counsel</b> <b>and</b> rights to confrontation. Procedural due process is required any time a person faces the deprivation of life, liberty, or property. As substantive due process arises from the liberty clause, a deprivation of a substantive due process right is a deprivation of liberty and thus requires procedural due process.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{voluntary}} <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing lay counsellors are not {{employees of}} the City of Johannesburg at Region F, but rather receive stipend money as an incentive from the non-governmental organisations. The voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing lay counsellors seem to be unhappy and dissatisfied about their functions as demonstrated by their irregular attendance at the voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing sites. It became difficult for the voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing clients to access the voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing service {{in the absence of}} the voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing lay counsellors as they had to wait in the long queues in order to be attended to by the professional nurses. In most instances, the voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing clients decided rather to leave the clinics without being attended to. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the lived experiences of the voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing lay counsellors and professional nurses with regard to voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing services offered in the City of Johannesburg at Region F. To address the problem a contextual, qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive phenomenological, research design was used in this study. A purposive sampling method was used. Individual, in-depth, phenomenological, semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data. The interviews were directed by two open-ended research questions. A model of trustworthiness with four components namely, credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability was followed. An open coding, qualitative data analysis method was used. The ethical considerations were taken into account. The results from the analysis of the transcriptions were described. Three main themes (1) lack of appropriate counselling rooms, (2) increased workload and staff shortages (3) lack of motivation and support and their related sub-themes in table 3. 1 were identified and conceptualised within the existing literature and concluding statements were made. The supporting guidelines to improve the performance of the voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing lay counsellors in conducting <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing along with the limitations, recommendations, and conclusions of the study were described.

40|$|Abstract Background The human {{resource}} shortage in Zambia is placing {{a heavy burden}} on the few health care workers available at health facilities. The Zambia Prevention, Care and Treatment Partnership began training and placing community volunteers as lay counsellors in order to complement {{the efforts of the}} health care workers in providing HIV <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing services. These volunteers are trained using the standard national <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing curriculum. This study was conducted to review the effectiveness of lay counsellors in addressing staff shortages and the provision of HIV <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing services. Methods Quantitative and qualitative data were collected by means of semistructured interviews from all active lay counsellors in each of the facilities and a facility manager or counselling supervisor overseeing counseling and testing services and clients. At each of the 10 selected facilities, all <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing record books for the month of May 2007 were examined and any recordkeeping errors were tallied by cadre. Qualitative data were collected through focus group discussions with health care workers at each facility. Results Lay counsellors provide <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing services of quality and relieve the workload of overstretched health care workers. Facility managers recognize and appreciate the services provided by lay counsellors. Lay counsellors provide up to 70 % of <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing services at health facilities. The data review revealed lower error rates for lay counsellors, compared to health care workers, in completing the <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing registers. Conclusion Community volunteers, with approved training and ongoing supervision, can play a major role at health facilities to provide <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing services of quality, and relieve the burden on already overstretched health care workers. </p...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{attempted}} {{to influence the}} outcomes of the elections in the Holy Roman Empire, which would appoint a new King of the Romans.

His election faced a mixed response in England; Richard was believed to provide moderate, sensible <b>counsel</b> <b>and</b> his presence was missed by the English barons, but he also faced criticism, probably incorrectly, for funding his German campaign at England's expense. Although Henry now had increased support in the Empire for a potential alliance against Louis of France, the two kings were now moving towards potentially settling their disputes peacefully; for Henry, a peace treaty could allow him to focus on Sicily and his crusade.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of November 12, 1964, Armando Schmerber and a {{passenger}} were driving home after drinking at a tavern and bowling alley in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California when their car skidded {{off the road and}} struck a tree. Schmerber and his companion were injured in the crash and taken to a hospital for treatment. When investigating police officers arrived at the hospital, they asked Schmerber to submit a sample of his blood, but Schmerber refused. Although they did not possess a search warrant, officers instructed attending physicians to take a blood sample from Schmerber. The blood sample indicated that Schmerber was intoxicated, and he was placed under arrest. The blood sample was ultimately admitted into evidence at trial, and Schmerber was convicted for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquors. Schmerber objected to the admissibility of the blood sample, claiming that the police violated his rights to due process, his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to <b>counsel,</b> <b>and</b> his right not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures. The Appellate Department of the California Superior Court rejected Schmerber's arguments, and the California District Court of Appeal declined to review his case.|$|E
5|$|Once {{news of the}} Ottoman {{approach}} arrived, Venice sent reinforcements to its cities along Albania; Durazzo (Durrës) {{had already}} garrisoned 3,000 men. The Scutari Fortress was also reinforced after Skanderbeg's <b>counsel</b> <b>and</b> the walls were rebuilt. On 19 April 1466, news spread that the sultan was going to march into Avlonya (Vlorë) with an army of 100,000 men although the Ragusans reported that the number was 30,000. Ottoman forces were ready to enter the Kingdom of Naples and pressured Ferdinand to form an alliance with Mehmed. The situation was not clear in the Balkans, however, as {{it was thought that}} the Ottomans could march against Bosnia, Serbia, Dalmatia, Negroponte, or Albania. By the beginning of May, however, {{it was clear that the}} Ottomans would attack Albania because of the approach of Mehmed's troops towards Albania after the end of his campaigns in Wallachia, Karaman, and the Morea. None of the promised reinforcements from Naples and Venice arrived and Skanderbeg was thus left to fight Ottoman forces only with the league's troops.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. Voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing, the {{cornerstone}} of HIV/AIDS prevention efforts worldwide, is at the centre of a policy debate rega rding its effectiveness. Informed by social constructionism and drawing on various tools from ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, a sample of twenty-seven vid eotaped simulated counselling interactions in South Africa was analysed. The aim was to assess how the interactional tasks of the voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing sess ion were worked through by clients and counsellors, and how this was done against the publ ic health <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> frameworks that inform voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing pract ice. The goal of the analysis was not to examine practitioners’ competencies, but to exam ine their unfolding actions in the situation and to consider the interactional functio ns these actions might serve. The results show that of the three interactional ta sks of voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing, information-giving lays the foundation upon which the advice and support goals are realised. It is constructed as critical to client a nd counsellor identities and is a powerful tool through which hope is dispensed. Both the info rmation-giving and support tasks of voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing combine to manage client distress into more concrete and manageable terms that encourage client coping. Counsellors draw {{on a range of}} advice-giving strategies – those that place the onu s of responsibility on the client to those that view the counsellor as the moral guide able to direct client change – in order to encourage clients to reflect on their risk behaviou r. In general, voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing is framed as a moral activity, and this is most evident in the advice-giving segments. The public health <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> framewo rks that inform voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing create a dilemma for counse llors. In practice, counsellors orient towards a directive and health-advising role rather than a non-directive, client-centred counselling role. The implication of this research is that voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing needs to be defined and framed more clearly – i. e. as a public health intervention with preferred outcomes that draws on a set of client-centred skills. Reconceptualisations of voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing need to acknowledge the mor al framework under which it operates. Clear implementation guidelines (and training) on what voluntary <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> testing is and that define its goals more clearly will be useful in assisting counsellors to implement the policies that govern their practice...|$|R
