25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous <b>cover</b> <b>policy</b> (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E

50|$|Under the editorship of Chris Hunt, the {{magazine}} published its first issue in July 1988, {{six months before}} The Source began in newsletter form. Prior to the first issue, {{the magazine}}'s parent company had also run a premium rate 0898 telephone information line using the same name, presented by voice of now Radio 1 DJ Dave Pearce that invited MCs to call up and record their own rhyme after listening to the best rhyme of the previous week. The early issues were its biggest selling and saw Hunt bringing together a talented group of writers and photographers, including Ekow Eshun, Malu Halasa, Vie Marshall and Normski the future television presenter and celebrity, who was given his own section in the magazine to showcase his rap photography. Chris Hunt had two stints as Editor of the magazine before leaving the title for the final time in 1993. His longtime Deputy Editor Andy Cowan took over the title in November 1993 and although it has changed owners several times (Popular Publications, Future Publishing, Ministry Of Sound), HHC and Popular Publications were owned by Music Maker Publications throughout the early 1990s until Music Maker was acquired by Future Publishing. Future Publishing sold the title to Ministry Of Sound in 2000. The first Ministry issue featured Mariah Carey on the front cover. Ministry tried to continue with its 'female artists only' <b>cover</b> <b>policy</b> which had proved successful for their dance magazine but after Kelis and Lauryn Hill {{it became apparent that}} they were rapidly running out of suitable candidates. Ministry sold the title after one year and Andy Cowan continued to run and publish the magazine. In April 2006, Hip Hop Connection published its 200th consecutive edition, rerunning many of the classic rap interviews from its 18-year history. It is now owned by Cambridge based Infamous Ink.|$|E

40|$|The {{percentage}} of Australians taking up Private Health Insurance (PHI) was in decline following {{the introduction of}} Medicare in 1984 (PHIAC). To arrest this decline the Australian Government introduced a suite of policies, between 1997 and 2000, to create incentives for Australians to purchase private health insurance. These policies include an increased Medicare levy for those without PHI on high incomes, introduced in 1997, a 30 % rebate for private hospital cover (introduced 1998), and the Lifetime Health Cover (LHC) policy where PHI premiums are set at age of entry, increasing for each year older than 30 years (introduced 2000). In 2004 the longitudinal study on Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA), included {{a series of questions}} on private health insurance and hospital use. We used the HILDA data to investigate the demographic, health and income factors related to the PHI decisions, especially around the introduction of the Lifetime Health <b>Cover</b> <b>policy.</b> Specifically we investigate who was most influenced to purchase PHI (specifically hospital cover) in 2000 {{as a response to the}} Lifetime Health <b>Cover</b> <b>policy</b> deadline. Are those who have joined PHI since the introduction of LHC different from those who joined prior to LHC? What are the characteristics of those who have dropped PHI since the introduction of LHC? We model the PHI outcomes allowing for heterogeneity of choice and correlation across alternatives. After controlling for other factors, we find that LHC prompted moderately well-off working age adults (30 - 49 yrs) to purchase before the 2000 deadline. Young singles or couples with no children, and the overseas born were more likely to purchase since 2000, while the relatively less well-off continue to drop PHI in spite of current policy incentives. private health insurance, Australia...|$|E

30|$|Besides entry policies, DEMIG POLICY also tracks border control, {{integration}} and exit policies. The decision to include integration policies {{was based on}} the consideration that post-entry rights may play a role (as deterring, attracting or retaining factor) in the migration decision of potential future migrants as well as migrants already in the country. For example, many governments create attractive conditions for family reunification and improve access to long-term residence or citizenship to attract high-skilled migrants, while restrictive access to social benefits is often used to deter future asylum and other ‘undesired’ migrants. The decision to include exit policies was partly motivated by our interest to test the effect of emigration policies on migration flows. These policies – which <b>cover</b> <b>policy</b> measures from expulsion to voluntary return programmes to ‘diaspora’ policies – are often ignored, but potentially important determinants of international migration. 3 Together, this also enables to study immigration and emigration processes in relation to each other, that is, to investigate overall processes of migration and circulation and how these may be simultaneously influenced by entry, stay and exit policies.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{continued}} drive for improvement in learning and achievement in schools, the development of teachers and of school leaders remains {{a major focus of}} policy. As part of this project, alternative approaches to professional development have been introduced to Scottish education including coaching and mentoring and more recently learning communities. The use of mentoring and coaching is evident at every level of teacher development from student teacher to expert teacher and from early leadership development to the sustaining of long serving headteachers. The idea of learning communities where teachers work together has been a recent addition to continuing teacher development There are a range of texts which provide guidance in how to coach or mentor and extol the virtues of these process. However there are few publications that examine the use of strategies such coaching, mentoring and learning communities in Scotland and less than take a critical stance in relation to policy and practice. Accordingly this critical appraisal of policy and practice in relation to continuing teacher development will be the focus of this proposed book. The book will be an edited collection of six chapters which will <b>cover</b> <b>policy,</b> conceptual analysis and case studies.

40|$|VOEvent {{defines the}} content and meaning of a {{standard}} information packet for representing, transmitting, publishing and archiving information about a transient celestial event, with the implication that timely follow-up is of interest. The objective is to motivate the observation of targets-of-opportunity, to drive robotic telescopes, to trigger archive searches, and to alert the community. VOEvent {{is focused on the}} reporting of photon events, but events mediated by disparate phenomena such as neutrinos, gravitational waves, and solar or atmospheric particle bursts may also be reported. Structured data is used, rather than natural language, so that automated systems can effectively interpret VOEvent packets. Each packet may contain zero or more of the "who, what, where, when & how" of a detected event, but in addition, may contain a hypothesis (a "why") regarding the nature of the underlying physical cause of the event. Citations to previous VOEvents may be used to place each event in its correct context. Proper curation is encouraged throughout each event's life cycle from discovery through successive follow-ups. VOEvent packets gain persistent identifiers and are typically stored in databases reached via registries. VOEvent packets may therefore reference other packets in various ways. Packets are encouraged to be small and to be processed quickly. This standard does not define a transport layer or the design of clients, repositories, publishers or brokers; it does not <b>cover</b> <b>policy</b> issues such as who can publish, who can build a registry of events, who can subscribe to a particular registry, nor the intellectual property issues...|$|E
40|$|The {{material}} in this Working Paper was generated as input to DETR's Guidance on the Methodology for Multi Modal Studies (GOMMMS). DETR subsequently decided only to provide summary information on transport policy measures, {{and to leave}} the consultants involved in individual multi modal studies {{to make their own}} assessment of individual policy measures in the context of specific study areas. It has been decided to make this fuller document available as a reference source. The purpose of the review of policy measures was to provide summary information on the range of policy measures available, experience of their use and, based on past studies, their potential contribution to the range of policy objectives specified for GOMMMS. The review was based on an earlier one included in the Institution of Highways and Transportation's Guidelines on Developing Urban Transport Strategies (1996). This material was updated using references published since 1996 and expanded to <b>cover</b> <b>policy</b> measures relevant in inter-urban areas.

It should be borne in mind that this document has not, therefore, undergone the peer assessment which had been intended. To avoid unnecessary further work, the material is presented as it had been drafted for the GOMMMS Guidance document.
