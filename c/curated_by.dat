5|$|After {{his death}} from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were <b>curated</b> <b>by</b> his {{linguist}} friends who also worked {{to spread the}} influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he {{became the subject of}} harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.|$|E

5|$|The Ashford Ring Road was {{completed}} in November 1974 around the town centre {{in an attempt to}} relieve congestion, though part of it involved demolition of existing properties and part of the old market. It initially opened as one way, but was converted back into a two-way operation in 2007, at a total cost of £14m, so the town centre could expand and accommodate more people. The two-way route incorporates the first shared space scheme in the country. An art installation, Lost O, <b>curated</b> <b>by</b> the artist Michael Pinsky, was created as part of this redevelopment but confused drivers.|$|E

5|$|Development of Dota 2 {{began in}} 2009 when IceFrog, the pseudonymous lead {{designer}} of the original Defense of the Ancients mod, was hired by Valve to create a modernized sequel. Dota 2 was officially released on Steam for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux-based personal computers in July 2013, following a Windows-only public beta phase that began two years prior. Despite some criticism going towards its steep learning curve and complexity, the game was praised for its rewarding gameplay, production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor. The game initially used the original Source game engine until it was ported to Source 2 in 2015, making it the first game to use it. Since its release, Dota 2 {{has been one of}} the most played games on Steam, with over a million concurrent players at its peak. The popularity of the game has led to official merchandise being produced for it, including apparel, accessories, and toys, as well as promotional tie-ins to other games and media. The game also allows for the community to create custom game modes, maps, and hero cosmetics, which are uploaded to the Steam Workshop and <b>curated</b> <b>by</b> Valve.|$|E
5|$|During the Restoration (1814–30), LouisXVIII and CharlesX {{between them}} added 135pieces {{at a cost}} of 720,000francs and created the {{department}} of Egyptian antiquities <b>curated</b> <b>by</b> Champollion, increased by more than 7,000works with the acquisition of antiquities in the Edme-Antoine Durand, the Egyptian collection of Henry Salt or the second collection former by Bernardino Drovetti. This was less than the amount given for rehabilitation of Versailles, and the Louvre suffered relative to the rest of Paris. After the creation of the French Second Republic in 1848, the new government allocated twomillion francs for repair work and ordered the completion of the Galerie d'Apollon, the Salon Carré, and the Grande Galérie. In 1861, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte bought 11,835artworks including 641 paintings, Greek gold and other antiquities of the Campana collection. During the Second French Empire, between 1852 and 1870, the French economy grew; by 1870 the museum had added 20,000new pieces to its collections, and the Pavillon de Flore and the Grande Galérie were remodelled under architects Louis Visconti and Hector Lefuel.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2014, a ribbon-cutting {{ceremony}} for the High Line was held, {{followed by the}} opening of the third section of the High Line Park on September 21, and a procession down the High Line. The third phase, costing US$76 million, is divided into two parts. The first part, costing US$75 million, which opened on September 21, is {{from the end of the}} existing Phase 2 of the High Line to the line's terminus at 34th Street west of 11th Avenue. The second part, the spur, was going to contain such amenities as a bowl-shaped theater but has changed and will provide more room to install ambitious artworks <b>curated</b> <b>by</b> the public art program.

5|$|Throughout the 1990s, Daisy Jugadai was {{a regular}} {{exhibitor}} at the Araluen Art Centre in Alice Springs, and well as other major exhibitions such as the Australian Heritage Art Awards in Canberra in 1994.
