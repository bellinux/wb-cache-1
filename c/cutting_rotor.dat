Laboratorial {{studies were}} carried out to characterise the {{influence}} of different cutting systems (grab shredder and cutting mill) on the physical processing efficiency of spent Zn-MnO 2 batteries. The grab shredder operate based on an indented <b>cutting</b> <b>rotor</b> which applies shear and abrasion stresses with a moderate rotation speed, while the cutting mill operation is based on shear and impact stresses at higher rotation speed. After shredding with the grab shredder, two fractions of material were obtained (above and below the 6 mm discharge grid), which allows a previous separation of the scrap. With the cutting mill, all the grinded material passed the bottom grid (with the same 6 mm opening). Results obtained showed that alkaline batteries were more efficiently shredded than saline batteries, mainly with the grab shredder. Average diameters (d 50) for saline and alkaline batteries fragmented with the grab shredder were 2. 29 and 1. 47 mm respectively, while with the cutting mill were 3. 09 and 1. 54 mm respectively. Chemical analyses {{were carried out}} for different size fractions allowing identifying metals distribution through size categories. In general chemical composition was not substantially different using both shredding systems. Zinc distribution was almost constant with the grain size while manganese distribution decreased with particle size. More than 94 % of the iron scrap from the battery cases presents a particle size highe...|$|E
50|$|These {{issues are}} due to the exposed tail <b>rotor</b> <b>cutting</b> through open air around rear of the vehicle. This issue disappears when the tail is instead ducted, using an {{internal}} impeller enclosed in the tail and a jet of high pressure air sideways out of the tail, as the main rotor vortices can not impact the operation of an internal impeller.|$|R
50|$|A gust of {{wind from}} the rear of the {{aircraft}} induced some movement across the tarmac. The undercarriage responded badly to this, the bogies shimmying uncontrollably. Vibration in the framework then coupled with a helicopter phenomenon known as ground resonance. The vibration was sufficient to cause a structural failure as the starboard rear helicopter broke off its mounting, its <b>rotors</b> <b>cutting</b> into the gasbag. The unbalanced lift then made the vibrations worse and the remaining three helicopters broke free.|$|R
40|$|The two-dimensional, compressible, unsteady, thin-layer Navier-Stokes {{equations}} {{have been}} used to study the turbulent flow field of a turbine rotor/stator configuration in the high pressure oxidizer turbopump of the Space Shuttle main engine. The calculations were performed on a system of patched and overlaid grids. The grid system consists of 'O-' and 'H-' grids, with the inner 'O-'grid enclosing the blade surface for an accurate resolution of the leading and trailing edges, while the outer 'H-'grid makes the treatment of boundary conditions easier. The integration scheme used is an iterative, factored, implicit method with numerical fluxes evaluated by the third-order accurate upwind-biased Osher scheme. Computed results in the form of pressure contours, Mach number contours, time-averaged surface pressure, unsteady pressure amplitude and unsteady velocity vectors are presented. Many flow phenomena, such as wake <b>cutting</b> by <b>rotor</b> airfoils and evolution of unsteady passage vortices, are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{the field}} has been applied radially—in {{and away from the}} {{rotation}} axis of the motor. However some designs have the field flowing along the axis of the motor, with the <b>rotor</b> <b>cutting</b> the field lines as it rotates. This allows for much stronger magnetic fields, particularly if halbach arrays are employed. This, in turn, gives power to the motor at lower speeds. However, the focused flux density cannot rise about the limited residual flux density of the permanent magnet despite high coercivity and like all electric machines, the flux density of magnetic core saturation is the design constraint.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1973 {{interview}} Vonnegut {{discussed his}} inspiration {{to write the}} book: I was working for General Electric at the time, right after World War II, and I saw a milling machine for <b>cutting</b> the <b>rotors</b> on jet engines, gas turbines. This was a very expensive thing for a machinist to do, to cut what is essentially one of those Brâncuși forms. So they had a computer-operated milling machine built to cut the blades, and I was fascinated by that. This was in 1949 and the guys who were working on it were foreseeing all sorts of machines being run by little boxes and punched cards. Player Piano was my response to the implications of having everything run by little boxes. The idea of doing that, you know, made sense, perfect sense. To have a little clicking box make all the decisions wasn't a vicious thing to do. But it was too bad for the human beings who got their dignity from their jobs. [...] In the same interview he acknowledges that he [...] "cheerfully ripped off the plot of Brave New World, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin's We." ...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{presents}} possible {{methods for}} increasing the lifespan of cutting tools made of steel 19 436 designed for <b>cutting</b> stator and <b>rotor</b> plates made of silicon steel. These sheets are characterized by high hardness, which adversely affects {{the edges of the}} scissors. Experimental hardness measurement on delivered samples has verified the actual heat treatment on the surface and inside the scraper. The measured value 62 HRC corresponds to the input requirements. Based on the literature study, a combination of chemical – heat treatment and coating was chosen as the most appropriate method. In order to preserve the microstructure of the punch produced after the heat treatment, it was necessary to apply the coating by physical vapor deposition, which is characterized by low deposition temperatures. The FeinAl coating will be applied by cathodic arc deposition and is primarily designed to protect tools and cutting tools...|$|R
