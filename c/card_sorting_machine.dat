50|$|Batch data {{processing}} {{took advantage of}} the economies of scale in sorting and processing sequential data storage media, such as punch cards and, later, magnetic tape. Typically transactions for a recording period, such as a day or a week, would be entered onto cards from paper forms using a keypunch machine. At the close of the period, the data would be sorted using a <b>card</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>machine,</b> or, later a computer. The sorted data would then be used to update a master file, such as an accounting ledger or inventory file, that was kept sorted by the same key. Only one pass through the sequential files would be needed for the updates. Reports and other outputs, such as bills and payment checks, would then be generated from the master file.|$|E
5000|$|Computer dating {{systems of}} the later 20th century, {{especially}} popular in the 1960s and 1970s, before the rise of sophisticated phone and computer systems, gave customers forms that they filled out with important tolerances and preferences, which were [...] "matched by computer" [...] to determine [...] "compatibility" [...] of the two customers. The history of dating systems is {{closely tied to the}} history of technologies that support them, although a statistics-based dating service that used data from forms filled out by customers opened in Newark, New Jersey in 1941. The first large-scale computer dating system, The Scientific Marriage Foundation, was established in 1957 by Dr. George W. Crane. In this system, forms that applicants filled out were processed by an IBM <b>card</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>machine.</b> The earliest commercially successfully computerized dating service in either the US or UK was Com-Pat, started by Joan Ball in 1964. Operation Match, started by Harvard University students a year later is often erroneously claimed to be the [...] "first computerized dating service." [...] In actuality, both Com-Pat and Operation Match were preceded by other computerized dating services in Europe--the founders of Operation Match and Joan Ball of Com-Pat both stated they had heard about these European computer dating services and that those served as the inspiration for their respective ideas to create computer dating businesses. The longest running and most successful early computer dating business, both in terms of numbers of users and in terms of profits, was Dateline, which was started in the UK in 1965 by John Patterson. Patterson's business model was not fully legal, however. He was charged with fraud on several occasions for selling lists of the women who signed up for his service to men who were looking for prostitutes. Dateline existed until Patterson's death from alcoholism in 1997, and during the early 1990s it was reported to be the most profitable computer dating company in the world. In the early 1980s in New York City, software developer Gary Robinson developed a now-defunct dating service called 212-Romance which used computer algorithms to match singles romantically, using a voice-mail based interface backed by community-based automated recommendations enhanced by collaborative filtering technologies. Compatibility algorithms and matching software are becoming increasingly sophisticated.|$|E

40|$|The {{illustration}} on {{the cover}} and the header of each chapter depicts a relatively early attempt at classifying ‘documents ’ in different classes based on their content: the IBM Type 82 punched card sorter (mid-Sixties). “The Type 82 Electric Punched <b>Card</b> <b>Sorting</b> <b>Machine</b> groups all cards of similar classification {{and at the same}} time arranges such classifications in numerical sequence. “The operator places the cards in the feed hopper, sets the sorting brush on the column to be sorted, and presses the starting key. The sorting operation is accomplished at a speed of 650 cards per minute, per column sorted. The card feeding mechanism allows refilling of the card hopper while the sorter is in operation, eliminating stopping of the machine. “The pockets into which the cards are sorted have a capacity of 800 cards and the machine stops when the limit is reached in any pocket. By means of a selecting feature, all cards punched with any hole or holes in a single column may be sorted out while the remaining cards are passed into the reject pocket without disturbing their sequence. “After the card hopper is empty, the sorter continues to run long enough to allow all cards to be sorted into the correct pockets without the necessity for pressing the start key. “Alphabetical sequence sorting can be accomplished with this model by an extra sort, in which case the machine is equipped with alphabetical switch and pocket designations. “The Type 82 Electric Punched <b>Card</b> <b>Sorting</b> <b>Machine</b> can be specified for operation either from alternating or direct current. ...|$|E

Compared to lay helpers and advanced students, senior professional therapists used significantly more time to sort therapist intentions and sorted intentions into a greater number of categories. Relative to metacognitive process, advanced students and senior professional therapists reported significantly greater knowledge of cognition than lay helpers. Also, advanced students also reported greater self-reflection than both lay helpers and senior professional therapists. Discriminant analysis assessed the potential for a linear combination of structural knowledge indicators and metacognitive processes to differentiate participants by level of therapist development.
