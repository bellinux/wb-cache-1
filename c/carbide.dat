The microstructure of casting and morphology of <b>carbides</b> of are studied using the method of metallographic examination, SEM and EDS. The results show that the <b>carbides</b> of high carbon and high speed steel are mainly the MC, M 2 C and M 6 C <b>carbides.</b> MC <b>carbides</b> distributed mainly by granular, M 2 C <b>carbides</b> distributed by strip and massive, and most of the network <b>carbides</b> are M 6 C type <b>carbides.</b> With electromagnetic stirring, <b>carbides</b> distributed mainly on the boundary become to distribute dispersively in the grain and along the boundary.

The fabricated WC-Ni cemented <b>carbides</b> presented the highest hardness when 0. 75 wt % SiC whisker was added. However, the addition of SiC whisker was detrimental to the flexural strength of the cemented <b>carbides</b> because of the formation of inhomogeneous microstructure in the WC-Ni cemented <b>carbides...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} high carbon Fe-Cr-C {{hardfacing}} alloys were produced by {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW). Chromium and graphite alloy fillers {{were used to}} deposit hardfacing alloys on ASTM A 36 steel substrates. Depending on the four different graphite additions in these alloy fillers, this research produced hypereutectic microstructures of Fe-Cr phase and (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) <b>carbides</b> on hard-facing alloys. The microstructural results indicated that primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) <b>carbides</b> and eutectic colonies of [Cr-Fe+(Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) ] existed in hardfacing alloys. With increasing the C contents of the hardfacing alloys, the fraction of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) <b>carbides</b> increased and their size decreased. The hardness of hardfacing alloys increased with fraction of primary (Cr. Fe) (7) C(3) <b>carbides.</b> Regarding the abrasive characteristics, the wear resistance of hardfacing alloys were related to the fraction of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) <b>carbides.</b> The wear mechanism was also dominated by the fraction of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) <b>carbides.</b> Fewer primary <b>carbides</b> resulted in continuous scratches worn on the surface of hardfacing alloy. In addition, the formation of craters resulted from the fracture of <b>carbides.</b> However, the scratches became discontinuous with increasing fraction of the <b>carbides.</b> More primary <b>carbides</b> can effectively prevent the eutectic colonies from the damage of abrasive particles.

With regard to wear performance, the relationship between wear resistance and hardness (H) is non-linear. However, the mean free path (lambda) of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) <b>carbides</b> must be considered. Wear resistance is proportional to H/lambda. The primary <b>carbides</b> can prevent the eutectic colonies from selective abrasion The rod-like (Cr,Fe) 7 C 3 <b>carbides</b> also provide much better wear resistance because rod-like <b>carbides</b> have a greater hardness After an abrasive wear process, abrasive particles cause plastic plows when the cladding has lower surface fractions of <b>carbides.</b> The fracture of primary <b>carbides</b> leads into the craters where it occurs in the worn cladding surface with higher surface fractions of <b>carbides.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier B.
