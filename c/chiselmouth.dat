50|$|The basin {{was formed}} {{approximately}} 32,000 {{years ago when}} lava flows formed the Malheur Gap, separating the watershed of the basin from the Malheur River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake River.

Evidence of prehistoric fishing techniques is found at several sites. Evidence suggests that there existed in the basin several species—in particular the <b>chiselmouth,</b> coarse-scale suckers, and northern squawfish—that are currently found only in the Columbia River basin, indicating that at some point the Harney Basin may have been connected to the Columbia. During wetter years, the lake level of Malheur Lake was raised to a depth of 25 ft, allowing the lakes to drain over the Malheur Gap.

5000|$|It {{was said}} that in the early 19th century, Latah Creek was a clear and {{pristine}} stream that provided suitable habitat for anadromous fish. However, the creek was shallow and slow-moving naturally, and was not an important habitat for these fish. The primary fishes of Latah Creek were sucker and whitefish. Because of the aridity of its basin and the increasing pollution in Latah Creek and many of its tributaries, it is no longer a productive watershed for fishes and other aquatic species. Even as early as 1892, Latah Creek was described as This is an unimportant stream tributary to the Spokane. It was examined in the vicinity of Tekoa, Washington, where it was found to be a small filthy stream not suitable for trout but well supplied with minnows and suckers of several species. At the time of the 1892-93 sampling, there were two fishes that have apparently become extinct between then and 1974. The Bridgelip sucker and <b>Chiselmouth</b> have disappeared in that time period. In the inventory taken by Gilbert and Evermann (1892) there were many species of suckers, some of which are still present in the creek today. The Native American variant name Snt'ut'u'lmkhwkwe is known to mean [...] "Suckers in the Water", which implies that the sucker are likely the primary fish of Latah Creek.|$|E

40|$|During May-September 1995, we {{replicated}} {{an earlier}} (1984 - 85) study of fishes in shoreline habitats of the John Day Reservoir, Columbia River, to investigate fish assemblage structure at several {{spatial and temporal}} scales. A total of 37, 400 resident fishes representing 24 taxa was collected in 359 beach seine hauls. Fish catch composition during 1984 and 1985 was very similar, but was greatly different from catch in 1995. During 1984 - 1985, four native taxa (<b>chiselmouth,</b> northern pikeminnow, suckers, and sand rollers) constituted more than 90 % of the combined main-channel catch, with introduced taxa comprising only 1. 3 % of the main-channel catch. In contrast, during 1995 only 37. 7 % of the main-channel catch comprised <b>chiselmouth,</b> northern pikeminnow, suckers, and sand rollers, while 33. 9 % were introduced taxa, primarily sunfishes and yellow perch. This shift in catch composition was greatest in the lower reservoir where the 1995 catch was 61 % introduced taxa. Although changes in species composition of near-shore reservoir fish assemblages over the 10 -yr period appeared to be substantial, we are unsure of annual variability since we have only one season of sampling for comparison with the earlier study. The differences we observed could be a long-term response to reservoir aging, a short-term reaction to annual differences in hydrologic and thermal regimes, or simply the naturally varying reproductive success of some speciesBarfoot et al "Resident fish assemblages in shallow shorelines of a Columbia River impoundment.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the success of}} passage of some non-salmonid fishes through Denil-type steeppass fishways of varying length and slope. Length ranged from 7. 9 m (26 feet) to 20. 1 m (66 feet), and slope ranged between 23. 3 and 28. 7 percent. American shad, Alosa sapidissima; common carp, Cyprinus carpio; <b>chiselmouth,</b> Acrocheilus alutaceus; northern squawfish, Ptychocheilus oregonensis; Pacific lamprey, Lampetra tridentata; and suckers, Catostomus sp., were observed at Bonneville and McNary dams on the Columbia River and Little Goose Dam on the Snake River from 1971 to 1979. These fish were successful in ascending the 7. 9 m (26 foot) fishway, and all but the common carp ascended the 15. 2 m (50 foot) fishway. When the length was extended to 20. 1 m (66 feet), no American shad or resident freshwater fish were observed ascending and passing through the Denil. Salmonids and Pacific lamprey, however, were able to successfully pass through all lengths of Denil fishways tested. These observations indicate that Denil ladders of selected length could be used, if desired, to pass salmonid fishes over small barriers while denying upstream access to certain unwanted nonsalmonids...|$|E

Stream surveys completed in 1966 indicated the 16 1 / 2 -mile section of the lower river lying between the Owyhee Reservoir dam and the old Owyhee diversion dam in Malheur County, Oregon, would lend itself to periodic rehabilitation and restocking annually with rainbow fingerling. Chemical treatment of this section of river was completed on March 18, 1967. A large population of bridgelip and coarsescale suckers, squawfish, <b>chiselmouth,</b> redside shiner, and carp were reduced. A kill estimated to be in excess of 63, 000 fish resulted from the aerial application of 225 gallons of liquid pronox-fish by helicopter. Test fish confined in live boxes along with net sampling indicated an incomplete kill. Failure of the chemical to penetrate the deeper water and rapid detoxification were the primary causes for the incomplete kill. Detoxification at the old diversion dam was necessary to prevent destruction of warm-water game fish below.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Fisheries Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] high prevalence of vertebral deformities has been observed in various fishes, especially cyprinids, from certain regions of the Willamette River for many years. One proposed source of these deformities is exposure to toxicants. Histological evaluation of affected <b>chiselmouth</b> Acrocheilus alutaceus revealed that all lesions associated with vertebrae were associated with metacercariae of digenean trematodes. Approximately half of the northern pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis had infections in which metacercariae were associated with these lesions. Metacercariae were also associated with vertebral lesions in three of four affected peamouth Mylocheilus caurinus. Many metacercariae that were present within the vertebral bodies were associated with bony dysplasia and bony proliferation in all three species. We also evaluated the association of the metacercariae with the vertebral deformities, using intact fish that had been cleared with trypsin. Fish from the affected regions had a much higher prevalence of metacercariae and deformities and a greater abundance of metacercariae than those in the reference site. Chiselmouths had more deformities and metacercariae than northern pikeminnow. In all fish species, 77 % of deformities were directly associated with metacercariae; in chiselmouths, about 95 % of the deformities exhibited this relationship. Two types of metacercariae were identified in affected fish: Apophallus sp. (Heterophyidae) and a neascus type (Strigeidida). The Apophallus sp. appeared to be more closely associated with the skeleton deformities. A Myxobolus sp. morphologically similar to M. cyprini was also associated with the vertebral lesions in about 50 % of the northern pikeminnow and 5 % of the chiselmouths. Intact plasmodia were found in somatic muscle, and lesions containing free spores were often located at bone surfaces. This survey demonstrates that metacercariae (probably Apophallus sp.) and a Myxobolus sp. are major causes of the vertebral deformities seen in cyprinid fishes from certain regions of the Willamette River...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1952 Presentation date: 1952 - 05 - 10 An {{investigation}} of the fishes of the Willamette River and three of its larger tributaries was made during July, August, September, and November of 1951, to ascertain {{the possibility of using}} them as bio-indices of pollution. Thirteen stations were established on the Willamette River and tributaries. These stations were selected in respect to the major tributaries, cities, and sources of pollution. Two stations were located on the McKenzie river; two on the North Fork of the Santiam River; eight on the main stem of the Willamette River from above Eugene to Oregon City; and one on the Clackamas River. Fishes were collected at each station by means of a seine. The fishes were preserved in a 10 percent formalin solution and returned to Corvallis where they were classified as to species and the numbers of each recorded. Stomach analysis were performed on a portion of the fishes collected from each of the stations. In an attempt to determine the affect of pollution on the fishes of an area, the samples from a clean-water station were compared with those taken from a polluted station. From this survey a tentative list of fishes which were sensitive, intermediate and tolerant to pollution was formed. In general, the trout, salmon, whitefishes and sculpins were found to be sensitive; falcate dace, white crappie, smallmouth black bass, mountain suckers, and longnosed dace were intermediate; and redsided shiner, blacksided dace, coarse-scaled sucker, three-spined stickle back, squawfish, bullhead catfish, <b>chiselmouth,</b> largemouth black bass, Columbia River chub, and larvae of the Pacific lamprey were tolerant. It was found that even the most tolerant fishes disappeared when pollution was excessive. In addition to the biological data collected at each station, certain chemical and physical tests were also determined. Air and water temperatures were taken, along with hydrogen-ion concentration (pH), and dissolved oxygen content of the water. Bio-chemical oxygen demand (B. O. D.) readings were taken at some of the stations by the Oregon State Sanitary Authority. River flow measurements were obtained from U. S. G. S. records for the gage at Salem, Oregon. The physical and chemical tests were used in conjunction with the biological findings to determine the condition of each station. Water flow data was used to determine low water periods. Chemical, physical and water flow data are shown in table form as well as graphically. The numbers of each species of fish and the food organisms found by stomach analysis are listed for each monthly sample and these data are also shown in table form. According to observations from this survey there was a definite indication that pollution can be detected by using the species, numbers and stomach contents of fishes from a waterway...|$|E
