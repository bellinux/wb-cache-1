25|$|The V8 Security Feature Pack (a mid-release product update {{designated}} 8.5) added {{important new}} security features designed to lock down Pervasive.SQL data files. Prior to 8.5, access to Btrieve data {{was controlled by}} the operating system's security mechanism. This meant that any user who needed read/write access to the database, also needed read/write access to the underlying data files. 8.5 introduced new security models, which allow administrators to control access to the Btrieve data using database security. Once activated, database security no longer requires that the user {{has access to the}} underlying files. In addition, client/server configurations no longer require the use of network shares or mapped drives. Applications can reference secure Btrieve data using a URI <b>connection</b> <b>string.</b>|$|E
25|$|When writing {{code for}} SQL CLR, data stored in SQL Server {{databases}} {{can be accessed}} using the ADO.NET APIs like any other managed application that accesses SQL Server data. However, doing that creates a new database session, {{different from the one}} in which the code is executing. To avoid this, SQL Server provides some enhancements to the ADO.NET provider that allows the connection to be redirected to the same session which already hosts the running code. Such connections are called context connections and are set by setting context connection parameter to true in the <b>connection</b> <b>string.</b> SQL Server also provides several other enhancements to the ADO.NET API, including classes to work with tabular data or a single row of data as well as classes to work with internal metadata about the data stored in the database. It also provides access to the XML features in SQL Server, including XQuery support. These enhancements are also available in T-SQL Procedures in consequence of the introduction of the new XML Datatype (query,value,nodes functions).|$|E

2500|$|Connection: The {{connection}} {{object is}} ADO's {{connection to a}} data store via OLE DB. The connection object stores information about the session and provides methods of connecting to the data store. As some data stores have different methods of establishing a connection, some methods may not be supported in the connection object for particular OLE DB providers. A connection object connects to the data store using its 'Open' method with a <b>connection</b> <b>string</b> which specifies the connection as a list of key value pairs (for example: [...] "Provider='SQLOLEDB';Data Source='TheSqlServer'; Initial Catalog='Northwind';Integrated Security='SSPI';").
