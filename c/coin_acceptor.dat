2500|$|The MetroCard {{system is}} {{susceptible}} to various types of unauthorized resale. At times, this may involve individuals charging to swipe another commuter into the subway system. Usually these frauds involve the person preventing or dissuading the commuter from using {{his or her own}} MetroCard, and then charging the commuter for entry to the system (entry is gained by a method that costs the individual nothing). The individual can use an array of unlimited cards, selling rides for a discounted price. Multiple cards are needed because of the 18-minute delay between each swipe at the same station. Using unlimited cards, one is able to sell rides for a discounted price. In addition, MetroCard Vending Machines are programmed to disable the bill or <b>coin</b> <b>acceptor</b> after a series of rejected bills or coins, which can result in a row of MVMs all saying [...] "No Bills" [...] or [...] "No Coins".|$|E

50|$|Normal {{circulation}} coins eventually collect microscopic {{deposits of}} dirt, dust, {{oil and grease}} from people's fingers. When a <b>coin</b> <b>acceptor</b> is used long enough, thousands of coins rolling along a track will leave enough dirt, dust, oil and grease to be visible. For this reason, the <b>coin</b> <b>acceptor</b> has to be cleaned {{on a regular basis}} to prevent malfunction or damage. Coin acceptors are modular, so a dirty acceptor can be replaced with a clean unit, preventing downtime. The old unit is then cleaned and refurbished.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{principle}} for coin detection is {{to test the}} physical properties of the coin against known characteristics of acceptable coins. The <b>coin</b> <b>acceptor</b> analyses the coin according to its weight, mass, size, diameter, metal composition and/or magnetism, and then sends an appropriate electrical signal via its output connection. The next step is generally performed by the banknote-to-coins exchanger.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{production}} {{started in}} 1936 and expanded until the mid-1980s. The first models {{were based on}} a <b>coin</b> <b>acceptor,</b> a dial to engage the mechanism and a visible pointer and flag to indicate expiration of paid period. This configuration lasted for more than 40 years, with only a few changes in the exterior design, such as a double-headed design (to cover two adjacent parking spaces), and the incorporation of new materials and production techniques.|$|E
50|$|In 1910 {{the company}} {{introduced}} a slight {{variation of the}} Liberty Bell, called the Operator Bell. Changes such as a gooseneck <b>coin</b> <b>acceptor</b> and fruit symbols to replace the traditional images became a standard for slot machines for decades to come, and over 30,000 of these machines were produced. In 1915 the company then began manufacturing a less expensive version of the Operator Bell, replacing the heavy cast iron machines with ones made out of lighter wooden cabinets.|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{sophisticated}} electronic <b>coin</b> <b>acceptors</b> {{are being}} used in some places that, in addition to validating weight and size, also scan the deposited coin using optics and match the image to a pre-defined list, or test the coin's [...] "metallic signature" [...] based on its alloy composition.|$|R
5|$|After {{deciding}} {{to begin work}} on a coin-operated version of Spacewar, the pair, with assistance from Tuck's family, bought a PDP-11 and started working on a prototype. They spent a total of 20,000 to build a single arcade machine for two players, like the original Spacewar, {{deciding to}} price the game at ten cents per play or 25 cents for three games, with the winner of a match given a free game. They used a PDP-11/20 version of the PDP-11 (US$14,000), a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display (3,000), and spent the remainder on the <b>coin</b> <b>acceptors,</b> joysticks, wiring, and casing. Pitts build the computer hardware and handled the programming, while Tuck, a mechanical engineer, designed the enclosing cabinet. The display adapter for the monitor was built by Ted Panofski, the <b>coin</b> <b>acceptors</b> were sourced from jukebox manufacturer Rowe International, and the joysticks found at a military surplus store as remainders from B-52 bomber controls. The code for the game {{was based on a}} version of Spacewar running on a PDP-10 in the Stanford artificial intelligence lab, but modified with additional features.|$|R
50|$|MEI Conlux (formerly {{known as}} Mars Electronics International) is a {{manufacturers}} of electronic banknote validators, <b>coin</b> <b>acceptors</b> and changers. MEI was founded as {{a division of}} Mars Incorporated, and was spun off to private investment interests in July 2006. In 2013, it was sold to Crane Co., which also manufactures vending machines. A new division was created inside the company by merging former CPS (Crane Payment Systems) and MEI into CPI (Crane Payment Innovations).|$|R
5000|$|The Super Famicom Box is a {{video game}} system created by Nintendo that {{incorporated}} a [...] "pay to play" [...] mechanism {{in a manner similar}} to arcade machines. It was sold only in Japan in the early 1990s and was only available for installation in hotel rooms. The device consisted of Super Famicom console hardware enclosed in a box along with a <b>coin</b> <b>acceptor</b> for time-limited playing of video games. The device included original Super Famicom controllers.|$|E
50|$|Coin slots, coin {{returns and}} the coin box, which {{allow for the}} {{exchange}} of money or tokens. They are usually below the control panel. Very often, translucent red plastic buttons are placed in between the coin return and the coin slot. When they are pressed, a coin or token that has become jammed in the coin mechanism is returned to the player. See <b>coin</b> <b>acceptor.</b> Early coin slots could be defeated using a piezo-electric gas fire or gas oven igniter held against the steel bodywork of the cabinet, thus enabling free credits to be obtained. In some arcades, the coin slot is replaced with a card reader that reads data from a game card bought from the arcade operator.|$|E

5000|$|Modern slot {{machines}} {{are controlled by}} EPROM computer chips and, in large casinos, <b>coin</b> <b>acceptors</b> have become obsolete in favor of bill acceptors. These machines and their bill acceptors are designed with advanced anti-cheating and anti-counterfeiting measures and are difficult to defraud. Early computerized {{slot machines}} were sometimes defrauded {{through the use of}} cheating devices, such as the [...] "slider" [...] or [...] "monkey paw". Computerized slot machines are fully deterministic and thus outcomes can be sometimes successfully predicted.|$|R
50|$|In the Soviet period {{different}} types of payphones were produced. There were also long-distance call payphones costing 15 kopeiks, and also provided services of a paid media such as listening to an anecdote, obtain legal advice, find {{the address of the}} subscriber by phone number. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the monetary reform of 1991 this form of payment has become irrelevant. Some payphones have undergone modifications: <b>coin</b> <b>acceptors</b> were altered to accept coins or replace the card reader. For example, in St Petersburg payment for pay phone can be made with metro tokens. In some regions, calls from public phones are free of charge.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical slot {{machines}} and their <b>coin</b> <b>acceptors</b> were sometimes susceptible to cheating devices and other scams. One historical example involved spinning a coin {{with a short}} length of plastic wire. The weight {{and size of the}} coin would be accepted by the machine and credits would be granted. However, the spin created by the plastic wire would cause the coin to exit through the reject chute into the payout tray. This particular scam has become obsolete due to improvements in newer {{slot machines}}. Another obsolete method of defeating slot machines was to use a light source to confuse the optical sensor used to count coins during payout.|$|R
50|$|The Super Famicom Box {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as the Neo-Geo Deck and combines Super Famicom console hardware with a <b>coin</b> <b>acceptor.</b> The system connects to a TV and has two conventional Super Famicom controllers for gameplay. A user can obtain five minutes of gameplay by inserting a 100-yen coin. One peculiarity of the Super Famicom Box (compared to its console counterpart) is its use of system-specific multicarts that contain two or three games per cartridge, unlike the use of conventional cartridges such as with the Nintendo M82 system. These cartridges are much larger than conventional Super Famicom cartridges. The system can accept up to two of these cartridges at the same time. A hinged cover {{on the front of}} the Super Famicom Box allows the installation and removal of cartridges. The front cover is secured when closed by a keyed lock at each end. Another keyed lock allows the system to be turned on and off. A special onscreen menu allows the user to select and launch a game. The system incorporates additional hardware not found in the home console to manage the game selection screen and the onscreen messages that direct the user to insert money. The Super Famicom Box cartridge that contains Super Mario Kart, Star Fox and the Super Mario Collection is required to operate the system as it also contains the system BIOS. The games from the Super Famicom Box multicarts are identical to traditional Super Famicom games.|$|E
40|$|In {{this modern}} year, {{we can see}} that many {{automatic}} devices like drinking machine, washing machine, arcade game machine, massage chair and other coin operated machine using the automatic coin device to act as the coin counter and sorter. But, most of the coin counting machine in Malaysia is incapable to differentiate between the old and new Malaysian Coins accurately. The systems of the machine that are available in the market are not good enough because sometimes it makes mistake when detect the value of coin and cause the error calculation in the result. In this project, a coin operated machine which can differentiate old and new Malaysia coin accurately and automatically. is implemented. An automatic coin counting and sorting machine prototype is developed by using ARDUINO as the main controller. This work included design the simple display panel to show total quantity of each coin and total amount of coin value as the Crystal Display (LCD) has been implemented to display the result. The <b>coin</b> <b>acceptor</b> has been used as it acts as coin selector to determines the denomination of coin and forbid any invalid or unwanted coins. The coin sorting system is designed by using servo motor and the stepper motor to hold and distributes coin to the corresponding slot. Through the project, this integrated design has high performance for coin counting and sorting in terms of user-friendly, accuracy, and attractiveness...|$|E
50|$|Integration of {{technology}} allows kiosks {{to perform a}} wide range of functions, evolving into self-service kiosks. For example, kiosks may enable users to order from a shop's catalogue when items are not in stock, check out a library book, look up information about products, issue a hotel key card, enter a public utility bill account number in order to perform an online transaction, or collect cash in exchange for merchandise. Customised components such as <b>coin</b> hoppers, bill <b>acceptors,</b> card readers and thermal printers enable kiosks to meet the owner's specialised needs.|$|R
25|$|However, due {{to their}} limited use, two-dollar bills are not {{frequently}} reissued in a new series like other denominations which are printed according to demand. Though some cash registers accommodate it, its slot is often used for things like checks and rolls of <b>coins.</b> Some bill <b>acceptors</b> found in vending machines, self checkout lanes, and other automated kiosks are configured to accommodate two-dollar bills, even if the fact is not stated on the label. Although they usually are not handed out arbitrarily, two-dollar bills are usually available at banks. Many banks stocking $2 bills will not use them except upon specific request by the customer, and even then, may cause a delay with {{a trip to the}} vault.|$|R
