40|$|There is {{significant}} co-morbidity between {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). However, FMS is diagnosed by physical examination, which limits the conduct of <b>co-morbidity</b> <b>studies</b> in a large population-based study. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the diagnostic validity of a new symptom-based criteria in patients with FMS and/or IBS using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria as a gold standard. Methods The study participants consisted of women with FMS (n = 30), IBS (n = 27) and controls (n = 28). A new symptom-based diagnostic criteria for FMS comprised a regional pain scale and a visual analogue scale for fatigue. All subjects underwent a physical examination for FMS (ACR criteria) and structured questionnaires of regional pain scale and visual analogue scale for fatigue. A fibromyalgia intensity score was calculated and thresholds of tenderness were determined by a dolorimeter. Results The number of participants diagnosed with FMS in the entire study population (n = 85) was 31 by the new criteria. Compared to the ACR, the sensitivity of the new criteria was 82. 9 %, specificity 96. 0 %, positive predictive value 93. 5 % and negative predictive value 88. 9 %.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} methods to tackle obesity and its related comorbidities is bariatric surgery. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometrial hyperplasia (EH), which are associated with increased risk of endometrial carcinoma, have been identified as potentially new indications for bariatric surgery. PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in women in the reproductive age and is associated with several components of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension. EH is a pre-cancerous condition which arises in the presence of chronic exposure to estrogen unopposed by progesterone such as both in PCOS and obesity. The main bariatric procedures are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. These procedures are well established and when correctly selected and performed by experienced bariatric surgeons, they can achieve significant weight loss and remission of obesity related <b>co-morbidities.</b> <b>Studies</b> have shown that bariatric surgery can {{play an important role in}} the management of patients with PCOS and improve fertility. Similarly, bariatric surgery has a positive effect on endometrial hyperplasia, making surgically induced weight loss a potentially attractive option for endometrial cancer prevention and treatment. Obesity has an adverse impact on spontaneous pregnancy, assisted reproduction methods and feto-maternal outcomes. After bariatric surgery obese women with subfertility can achieve spontaneous pregnancy. However, while bariatric surgery reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, there is an increased risk of small for gestational age and possible increased risk of stillborn or neonatal death. In this article we will review the evidence regarding the use of bariatric surgery as a treatment modality in patients with PCOS and EH.

Intervention patients received home telehealth units that used standard phone lines to communicate with the hospital. FDA-approved peripheral devices monitored vital signs and valid questionnaires were used to evaluate quality-of-life outcomes. Out-of-range data triggered electronic alerts to nurse case managers. (No live video or audio was incorporated in either direction.) Templated progress notes facilitated seamless data entry into the patient’s electronic medical record. Participants (n 104) with complex heart failure, chronic lung dis-ease, and/or diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group for 6 – 12 months. Parametric and nonparametric analyses were performed to compare outcomes for (1) subjective and objective quality-of-life measures, (2) health resource use, and (3) costs. In contrast to the control group, scores for home telehealth subjects showed a statistically sig-nificant decrease at 6 months for bed-days-of-care (p 0. 0001), urgent clinic/emergency room visits (p 0. 023), and A 1 C levels (p 0. 0001); at 12 months for cognitive status (p 0. 028); and at 3 months for patient satisfaction (p 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction: Vascular {{dementia}} {{consists of}} cognitive and functional impairment due to cerebrovascular brain injury. With reference to small vessel disease (SVD), {{even though the}} radiological evidence of SVD is present in {{a large number of}} persons above the age of 80 years, less than one-third of the people progress to dementia. Hence, if those factors are identified, {{we may be able to}} formulate strategies to protect that percentage of patients who progress to dementia. In this study, we have analyzed some genetic and nongenetic factors in patients with and without a cognitive impairment in the presence of radiological SVD. Patients and Methods: Two hundred and ten patients who satisfied the criteria for the study were included. All medical comorbidities, demographic factors, substance abuse, etc., were documented and neuropsychological evaluation done. In addition, the genetic testing was done for the polymorphisms of TT, TC, and CC alleles of CYP 11 B 2 based on the literature evidence of the association of CYP 11 B 2 polymorphism and hypertension. Results: This prospective hospital-based study revealed a significant relationship among hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia, and severity of white matter changes but other comorbidities did not correlate. No significant correlation was seen between cognitive dysfunction and severity of white matter changes or genotypes TT, TC, and CC. However, TC genotype was more common in male hypertensives. Even though hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia were associated with leukoaraiosis, none of the factors studied trigger conversion of these radiological changes to clinical cognitive impairment. Discussion and Conclusion: Severity of cerebral white matter changes seems to correlate with hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia, however, none of the <b>co-morbidities</b> <b>studied</b> including the three polymorphisms of CYP 11 B 2, that is, TT, TC, and CC seem to determine the conversion of leukoaraiosis to dementia...|$|R

Background: Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome, characterized {{by a variety of}} symptoms. Patients with HF are often old and have several co-morbidities. HF is a common disease with high mortality and morbidity, and with a large impact on quality of life. Therefore, diagnostic accuracy is important. Aim: To validate the HF diagnosis in patients hospitalized in Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg under 2000 - 2012, and also to examine whether co-morbidities may affect the validity of the diagnosis. Method: All patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of HF in Sahlgrenska University Hospital in 2000 - 2012 were identified (27 517 patients). 1 100 patients were randomly selected and studied. Their diagnosis was validated according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) diagnostic guidelines. The <b>co-morbidities</b> <b>studied</b> were ischemic heart disease (IHD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hyper- and hypothyreosis, asthmatic or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), kidney failure, cardiomyopathy, atrial flutter-/ defibrillation, systemic inflammatory disease and drug-/ alcohol abuse. Results: Finally, 136 patients were excluded, mainly due to incomplete information or missing records. The validation of the HF diagnosis in the population studied (964 patients) were definite in 62. 1 %, probable in 32. 3 % and miscoded in 5. 6 % of cases. No significant difference was found in the validity of the diagnosis when comparing the subgroups of co-morbidities to the whole study population.

Criteria for MDD are met in 16 % of males and 28 % of females. Adjusted for age and sex, MDD and CUD co-occur significantly (OR = 2. 76; CI: 2. 23 – 3. 40). Of the 13 different co-morbidity models, two fit equally well: ‘‘CUD causes MDD’’ (v 2 (11) = 15. 50, p =. 161, AIC = - 6. 50) and ‘‘Random Multiformity of CUD’’ (v 2 (11) = 15. 46, p =. 162, AIC = - 6. 54).

Methods A naturalistic population of 99 schizophrenia inpatients using conventional antipsychotics and clozapine was evaluated. Subjects with NIMDs were categorized using the criteria for NIMD found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders – Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Two blinded raters evaluated the actometric-controlled rest activity data for activity periods, rhythmical activity, frequencies, and highest acceleration peaks. A simple subjective question was formulated to test patient-based evaluation of NIMD. Results The patterns of neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA) and pseudoakathisia (PsA) were identifiable in actometry with excellent inter-rater reliability. The answers to the subjective question about troubles with movements distinguished NIA patients from other patients rather well. Also actometry had rather good screening performances in distinguishing akathisia from other NIMD.

During follow-up, participants with higher levels of LVH had a steeper decline in cognitive function including in selective attention (p =  0. 009), processing speed (p =  0. 010), immediate memory (p &# 60; 0. 001), and delayed memory (p =  0. 002). These associations were independent of cardiovascular risk factors, co-morbidities, and medications. LVH assessed by electrocardiogram associates with steeper decline in cognitive function of older subjects independent of cardiovascular risk factors and <b>co-morbidities.</b> This <b>study</b> provides further evidence on the link between subclinical cardiac structural changes and cognitive decline in older subjects...|$|R
40|$|Background: Incisional hernia is {{a common}} {{iatrogenic}} complication of abdominal surgery and is a cause of unwanted morbidity. The study was reported {{for the first time}} from Republic of Mauritius. Aims & Objectives: The objective {{of the study was to}} analyze the clinical pattern and effect of co-morbidities on the clinical course of incisional hernias and repair. Methods: The study is a cross sectional study conducted at a tertiary care hospital for over 22 months. 38 patients with incisional hernia were studied with special emphasis laid on the predisposing factors and co-morbidities at the time of hernia repair. Results: In this study the incidence of incisional hernia was prevalent in females and occurrence was 3 times more than males. All hernias in females were the result of a gynaecological operation. 68 % (26 out of 38 patients studied) of hernias were reported within 2 years of gynaecological operation. Majority of patients presented with swelling and pain related to scar. Twenty two out of thirty eight were operated and hernia repaired. Obesity was found to be the most important factor when the effects of <b>co-morbidities</b> were <b>studied.</b> Fifteen out of thirty eight (39. 47 %) patients came under the category of morbidly obese. Conclusion: In patients with recurrent hernia control of obesity and other co-morbidities before the attempt to repair hernia can be decisive...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of chronic and recurrent depression {{is a priority}} {{for the development of}} new interventions. The maintenance of residual symptoms following acute treatment for depression is a risk factor for both chronic depression and further relapse/recurrence. This open case series provides the first data on a cognitive-behavioural treatment for residual depression that explicitly targets depressive rumination. Rumination has been identified as a key factor in the onset and maintenance of depression, which is found to remain elevated following remission from depression. Fourteen consecutively recruited participants meeting criteria for medication-refractory residual depression [Paykel, E. S., Scott, J., Teasdale, J. D., Johnson, A. L., Garland, A., Moore, R. et al., 1999. Prevention of relapse in residual depression by cognitive therapy-a controlled trial. Archives of General Psychiatry 56, 829 - 835] were treated individually for up to 12 weekly 60 -min sessions. Treatment specifically focused on switching patients from less helpful to more helpful styles of thinking through the use of functional analysis, experiential/imagery exercises and behavioural experiments. Treatment produced significant improvements in depressive symptoms, rumination and co-morbid disorders: 71 % responded (50 % reduction on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and 50 % achieved full remission. Treating depressive rumination appears to yield generalised improvement in depression and <b>co-morbidity.</b> This <b>study</b> provides preliminary evidence that rumination-focused CBT may be an efficacious treatment for medication-refractory residual depressio...|$|R
30|$|Although {{our numbers}} are small, the data {{seem to be}} {{consistent}} in the regard that if progression occurs radiologically, it corresponds to pathological results. The corresponding aggressiveness of the lesions needs further evaluation in prospective studies, however. Our cases were analysed in consensus, so interobserver variability could not be evaluated. Like M.A. Bosniak, we believe that, if the complexity of a category II lesion is in question, the lesion should be placed in category IIF. In cases of disagreement among the radiologists, the lesion should always {{be placed in the}} highest category [5, 13, 47, 50]. Furthermore, decisions on the intervention may be easily influenced by clinical parameters, as in our series, in which surgical resection was omitted because of <b>co-morbidity.</b> Other comparable <b>studies</b> have the same limitation with regard to accordance between radiological and pathological progression, since not all category IIF lesions that progressed were resected [6, 9, 10].|$|R
40|$|Background We {{aimed to}} assess the point {{prevalence}} of microalbuminuria (MAU) {{in a sample of}} unselected consecutive primary-care attendees, with particular focus on patients with diabetes mellitus (with and without additional concomitant diseases) and those with hypertension. Design Cross-sectional observational study in a nationwide representative sample of 1912 primary-care practices and a patient population consisting of 39 125 primary-care attendees. Diagnoses for diabetes, hypertension and co-morbidities were provided by the treating physician and complemented by blood pressure (BP) measurements and selected lab tests. Screening for microalbuminuria (> 20 and 140 / 90 mmHg). Of note, patients with MAU had a higher burden of co-morbidity compared to those without MAU. Conclusions We found a high prevalence of MAU in primary care, particularly in diabetic patients. The frequency of MAU was closely related to the BP level and the degree of <b>co-morbidity.</b> The present <b>study</b> underlines the magnitude of th...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic {{heart failure}} (CHF) is {{increasing}} in prevalence. Patients with CHF usually have co-morbid conditions, but {{these have been}} subjected to little research and consequently there is a paucity of guidance on how to manage them. Obesity and diabetes mellitus are common antecedents of CHF and often complicate management and influence outcome. Cachexia is an ominous and often missed sign in patients with CHF. Methods: This manuscript describes the rationale and the design of <b>Studies</b> Investigating <b>Co-morbidities</b> Aggravating Heart Failure (SICA-HF), a prospective, multicentre, multinational, longitudinal, pathophysiological evaluation study, which is being conducted in 11 centres across six countries in the European Union and in Russia. We aim to recruit > 1, 600 patients with CHF due to various common aetiologies, irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction, and with or without <b>co-morbidities</b> at <b>study</b> entry. In addition, > 300 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without CHF and > 150 healthy subjects will serve as control groups. Participants will be systematically investigated at annual intervals for up to 48 months. Additional investigations focusing on cellular and subcellular mechanisms, adipose and skeletal muscle tissue, and in endothelial progenitor cells will be performed in selected subgroups. Conclusions: SICA-HF will provide insights into common co-morbidities in CHF with a specific emphasis on diabetes mellitus and body mass. This will provide a more thorough pathophysiological understanding of the complexity of CHF that will help develop therapies tailored to manage specific co-morbidities. © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryEpilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders of late adulthood, yet little research has examined the impact of epilepsy on the quality of life of older people. Current measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have been developed and used almost exclusively in adults under the age of 65. The issues, which affect HRQOL in younger adults, may differ from those which affect older adults who may have age-related physical limitations and multiple <b>co-morbidities.</b> This <b>study</b> sought to explore the HRQOL and psychosocial function of a community dwelling sample of 64 older adults with epilepsy compared with a similar, age-matched control group. An additional objective of the study was to examine the impact of perceived stigma and seizure frequency on HRQOL and psychosocial well-being. Results indicated that HRQOL and psychosocial functioning in the epilepsy group was significantly impaired relative to normal controls. A greater perception of stigma and more frequent seizures was also strongly related to poor quality of life and reduced psychosocial function. Although more than two thirds of the sample had seizure frequency of less than one per year, it was apparent that even infrequent seizures had the facility to impair HRQOL, suggesting that in older adults, the apprehension induced by even the possibility of a seizure may be sufficient to reduce HRQOL. The results have implications for the clinical management of epilepsy and suggest the need for further research in older populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. 5 ‑Azacytidine (5 ‑AZA) was {{the first}} drug to be {{approved}} {{for the treatment of}} high‑risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The adverse event profile of this drug appears favorable compared with the conventional inten-sive chemotherapy that is used for MDS or acute myeloid leukemia. However, uncommon adverse events may have remained undetected in the limited number of patients that have been treated to date. The present study describes three cases/ 66. 8 person‑years (4, 491 cases/ 100, 000 person‑years) of severe ischemic colitis in a single center cohort of 95 patients who were consecutively treated using subcutaneous 5 ‑AZA. The results demonstrated a much higher incidence of colitis compared with the rates in the general population or in patients of greater ages and <b>co‑morbidities.</b> The present <b>study</b> investigated whether the combination of anemia and constipa-tion due to the co‑medication of 5 ‑HT 3 receptor antagonists may explain the three cases of ischemic colitis...|$|R
25|$|Clinically, {{the most}} serious and {{immediate}} complication is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which usually occurs within 24 h. Those with significant lower airway involvement may develop bacterial infection. Importantly, victims suffering body surface burn and smoke inhalation are the most susceptible. Thermal injury combined with inhalation injury compromises pulmonary function, producing microvascular hyperpermeability {{that leads to a}} significant increase in lung lymph flow and pulmonary edema. The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 left many people with impaired lung function. A study of firefighters and EMS workers enrolled in the FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, whose lung function was tested prior to 9/11, documented a steep decline in lung function in the first year after 9/11. A new study that includes a thousand additional workers shows that the declines have persisted over time. Prior to 9/11, 3% of firefighters had below-normal lung function, one year after 9/11 nearly 19% did, and six years later it stabilized at 13%. Ten to 14 days after acute exposure to some agents (e.g. ammonia, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury), some patients develop bronchiolitis obliterans progressing to ARDS. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organized pneumonia can ensue when granulation tissue accumulates in the terminal airways and alveolar ducts during the body's reparative process. A minority of these patients develop late pulmonary fibrosis. Also at enhanced risk are persons with <b>co-morbidities.</b> Several <b>studies</b> report that both aged persons and smokers are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of inhalation injury.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is frequently}} associated with HIV infection but there's only limited evidence regarding {{the control and}} impact of this <b>co-morbidity.</b> This <b>study</b> aimed to estimate the prevalence of diabetes, compliance with treatment, perception {{and quality of life}} of HIV patients with diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among patients treated for diabetes and registered in the DMI 2 databasis in a French university hospital in January 2010. Clinical assessment and follow-up data were collected using chart review and self-administered questionnaires. Quality of life (MOS SF- 12) and compliance with treatment (simplified medication adherence questionnaire) were assessed using validated scales. RESULTS: The prevalence of treated diabetes mellitus was 3. 9 % (29 / 748, 95 % confidence interval, 2. 6 % to 5. 5 %). Among these 29 HIV diabetic patients, 93 % had a virologic control of HIV infection while only 22 % had well-controlled diabetes. Ninety-six percent of patients were scared to die from HIV-which was rated as the main pathology-compared with 71 % of patients for diabetes. The mean score for physical quality of life was 43. 1 (13. 2), which was lower than estimates for overall population. Non-compliance with treatment was reported for 35 % of patients. DISCUSSION: Although anti-retroviral treatments turned HIV infection into a chronic disease, patient perception was not altered. This study shows a better control of HIV infection than diabetes. We have to find out ways (e. g. patient education programs, annual multidisciplinary consultation [...] .) to give the patient a global feel for his health thereby improving prognosis and quality of life...|$|R
