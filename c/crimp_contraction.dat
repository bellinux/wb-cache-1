40|$|The {{properties}} of false-twist textured yarns in {{the aspects of}} crimp characteristic and tensile behavior depend mainly on the draw ratio and the D/Y ratio. This study comprises investigations {{of the effect of}} D/Y ratio and draw ratio on the crimp and tensile properties and percent crystallinity. While there was no noticeable change on the percent crystallinity by altering these parameters, tenacity increased and <b>crimp</b> <b>contraction</b> decreased with increasing draw ratio, and crimp stability decreased when the D/Y ratio increased. K/S value also decreased with increasing draw ratio...|$|E
40|$|The <b>crimp</b> <b>contraction</b> {{force has}} been {{measured}} on single textured yarns {{surrounded by a}} heating chamber on an Instron 3111 tensile tester. The heat transfer into the filament during texturing, the deformation energy of the single filaments, and rate of energy absorption have been studied in relation to rate of false-twisting, overfeed, heating chamber temperature, and {{the temperature of the}} second heating zone. The yarn in the experiments was polyester set yarn. In the conclusions certain parameters are identified as having important influence on filament deformation during false-twist texturing...|$|E

To over-come this deficiency, other researchers have tried to lower the degree of crys-tallinity of this fibre by either tension annealing or blending it with polyethyleneterephtha-late and polystyrene. These physical or chemical modifications have not yet achieved a satisfactory level of enhancement of the textureability of polypropylene. Considering the importance of BCF polypropylene yarns, in this research, the effect of blending polypropylene with 12. 5 and 25 % of polyamide 6 on {{the bulk of the}} final bulked continu-ous filament (BCF) yarn has been investigated. The results show that although both <b>crimp</b> <b>contraction</b> and crimp modulus increase with the temperature and pressure of hot air during texturing, but blending polypropylene with even 25 % of polyamide 6 does not enhance the textureability of BCF yarns. Also, the reduction in the crystallinity of the yarns does not lead to any improvement in the textureability of the polypropylene BCF yarns. polymer blending; polypropylene; polyamide 6; continuous filament...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of false-twist {{texturing}} parameters (texturing speed, heater temperature, draw ratio and disc-to-yarn speed ratio (D/Y ratio)) on the structure and crimp properties of polyester yarn has been studied using a high temperature heater and high texturing speeds. Textured yarn was analyzed and characterized {{in terms of the}} degree of crystallinity, degree of orientation and crimp properties (<b>crimp</b> <b>contraction,</b> crimp module and crimp stability). The most important parameters, significantly affecting yarn temperature and its uniformity and thus textured yarn structure and crimp properties, are texturing speed and heater temperature. Depending on these texturing parameters, the degree of crystallinity and orientation varied in the range of 24. 48 to 36. 66 % and 0. 371 to 0. 595, respectively. The crimp characteristics increase with the increase in heater temperature, and decrease with the increase in texturing speed. The effect of draw ratio and D/Y ratio on the textured yarn structure and properties is less pronounced. Obtained results show that partially oriented polyester yarn used in this study can be textured at significantly higher texturing speed (up to 1100 m/min) than the standard texturing speed (up to 700 m/min) used for the yarn count examined.
