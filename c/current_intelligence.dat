25|$|The {{implementation}} of the Dulles–Jackson–Correa Report recommendations {{began in the late}} 1950s after President Truman forced DCI Hillenkoetter to resign due to the latter's failure to foresee the North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950. On October 7, 1950, President Truman appointed Lt. General Walter Bedell Smith ("Beetle Smith") as the new DCI who in turn hired William Harding Jackson as his Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI). Using recommendations from the Dulles Report, DCI Smith quickly reorganized the CIA's Office of Reports and Estimates (ORE) into three units. The first unit was to focus on national intelligence and became known as the Office of National Estimates. The second unit, the Office of <b>Current</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> had a <b>current</b> <b>intelligence</b> role, and produced the daily bulletin for the President. The Last unit, the Office of Research and Reports, was to conduct a basic intelligence function and focus on intelligence analysis that was more strategic in nature and beyond the scope of any of the established intelligence agencies. The reorganization greatly reduced confusion that had previously occurred regarding the analytic mission of the CIA.|$|E

2500|$|Vandenberg quickly {{moved to}} the {{position}} as Commander of the newly formed Air Force {{that he had been}} waiting for. [...] He was replaced by Roscoe Hillenkoetter. [...] Under Hillenkoetter the ORE split into Global Survey, <b>Current</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> and Estimates. [...] The sharp focus on the grind of <b>Current</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> with its popular, widely distributed products continued to dominate the ORE leaving little room for the other sections to grow, but it did lead to slow improvements, and the ORE increased the number of products it offered, adding [...] "Situation Reports" [...] that would be used as handbooks for individual countries, and the monthly [...] "Review of the World Situation". [...] Like other organs of the CIA, the ORE received a regular stream of requests {{from the rest of the}} Government, including the NSC, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Department of State, and branches of the military. [...] Problems with the early ORE recognized within the CIA itself were that, of its eleven regular publications, only one of them addressed strategic, or national intelligence questions, and that most of the sources of information relied on to produce ORE products were [...] "open source", the CIA itself had little capability to produce intelligence on which to base its own reports and estimates. [...] "The CIA had only a few officers in Korea before the June 1950 invasion, and none reported to Agency analytical branches." [...] Shortly after the invasion of South Korea Truman, on 21 August 1950, announced Walter Bedell Smith as the new Director of the CIA to correct what was seen as a grave failure of Intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1993 UNAMIR Force Commander General Roméo Dallaire was [...] {{with little}} {{information}} on {{the background of the}} conflict in Rwanda. When he requested <b>current</b> <b>intelligence,</b> he was denied and given little access to the information. Roméo was forced to proceed on his mission blindly and {{due to the lack of}} information Canada was given, the mission was planned poorly as they were provided with inexperienced experts in economic, political and human rights operational planning. This came as a result of military operations that had ignored requirements for long-term addresses to the cause of the Rwandan conflict. Their mandate allowed them only to monitor the implementation of the Arusha Accords and to support the transitional Government. The mission was also restricted with little funding or time, and force was prohibited except in self-defence.|$|E
60|$|And {{this process}} is not {{restricted}} to dialects merely. The native of a small country who knows no other language than the tongue of his country becomes increasingly at a disadvantage {{in comparison with the}} user of any of the three great languages of the Europeanized world. For his literature he depends on the scanty writers who are in his own case and write, or have written, in his own tongue. Necessarily they are few, because necessarily with a small public there can be only subsistence for a few. For his science he is in a worse case. His country can produce neither teachers nor discoverers to compare with the numbers of such workers in the larger areas, and it will neither pay them to write original matter for his instruction nor to translate what has been written in other tongues. The larger the number of people reading a tongue, the larger--other things being equal--will be not only the output of more or less original literature in that tongue, but also the more profitable and numerous will be translations of whatever has value in other tongues. Moreover, the larger the reading public in any language the cheaper will it be to supply copies of the desired work. In the matter of <b>current</b> <b>intelligence</b> the case of the speaker of the small language is still worse. His newspaper will need to be cheaply served, his home intelligence will be cut and restricted, his foreign news belated and second hand. Moreover, to travel even a little distance or to conduct anything but the smallest business enterprise will be exceptionally inconvenient to him. The Englishman who knows no language but his own may travel well-nigh {{all over the world and}} everywhere meet some one who can speak his tongue. But what of the Welsh-speaking Welshman? What of the Basque and the Lithuanian who can speak only his mother tongue? Everywhere such a man is a foreigner and with all the foreigner's disadvantages. In most places he is for all practical purposes deaf and dumb.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is absurd}} {{to suppose that}} {{anywhere}} to-day the nationalisms, the suspicions and hatreds, the cants and policies, and dead phrases that sway men represent the <b>current</b> <b>intelligence</b> of mankind. They are merely the evidences of its disorganization. Even now we know we could do far better. Give mankind but a generation or so of peace and right education and this world could mock at the poor imaginations that conceived a millennium. But {{we have to get}} intelligences together, we have to canalize thought before it can work and produce its due effects. To that end, I suppose, there has been a vast amount of mental activity among us political [...] "negligibles." [...] For my own part I have thought of the idea of God as the banner of human unity and justice, and I have made some tentatives in that direction, but men, I perceive, have argued themselves mean and petty about religion. At the word [...] "God" [...] passions bristle. The word [...] "God" [...] does not unite men, it angers them. But I doubt if God cares greatly whether we call Him God or no. His service is the service of man. This double idea of the League of Free Nations, linked with the idea of democracy as universal justice, is free from the jealousy of the theologians and great enough for men to unite upon everywhere. I know how warily one must reckon with the spite of the priest, but surely these ideas may call upon the teachers of all the great world religions for their support. The world is full now of confused propaganda, propaganda of national ideas, of traditions of hate, of sentimental and degrading loyalties, of every sort of error that divides and tortures and slays mankind. All human institutions are made of propaganda, are sustained by propaganda and perish when it ceases; they must be continually explained and re-explained to the young and the negligent. And for this new world of democracy and the League of Free Nations to which all reasonable men are looking, there must needs be the greatest of all propagandas. For that cause every one must become a teacher and a missionary. [...] "Persuade to it and make the idea of it and the necessity for it plain," [...] that is the duty of every school teacher, every tutor, every religious teacher, every writer, every lecturer, every parent, every trusted friend throughout the world. For it, too, every one must become a student, must go on with the task of making vague intentions into definite intentions, of analyzing and destroying obstacles, of mastering the ten thousand difficulties of detail....|$|E
