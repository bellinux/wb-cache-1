40|$|Despite the {{relatively}} well-established concrete {{practice in the}} East African region, there are frequent incidents of <b>construction</b> <b>failures,</b> resulting into heavy loss of lives and property. The main objective {{of this paper was}} to examine structures that have failed during the construction phase, in East Africa, {{since the start of the}} 21 st century; identify and discuss the primary causes and sources of failures. A classic failure case of building collapse, herein referred to as BBJ building, has been used to examine the most important issues related to <b>construction</b> <b>failures.</b> Following the analysis of reports of technical investigations undertaken on the collapsed structure, it was found that failures in reinforced concrete (RC) structures during construction, result from five primary causes of: (1) poor materials and workmanship, (2) design and construction errors, (3) absence of professional supervision of site- works, (4) wrong implementation of construction methods, (5) neglect of design approval procedures. Secondary issues that are complicit to <b>construction</b> <b>failures</b> are:- attempts to severely minimize construction cost, neglect of inspection and monitoring by local authorities, influence peddling by proprietors. It is evident that <b>construction</b> <b>failures</b> can be minimized if the right procedures are followed in the design, construction and operation of the structures; a matter that is of interest to stakeholders of the Built Environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{concrete}} {{in developing countries}} is rapidly growing. There is however, a strong possibility that its increasing application as a construction material {{is likely to be}} accompanied by increase in incidents of <b>construction</b> <b>failures.</b> Such are problems that have been experienced by many countries during infancy of the concrete industry. Concrete construction is resource intensive and <b>construction</b> <b>failures</b> come with signifi-cant economic costs, loss of resources and sometimes, fatalities. For sustainable devel-opment in Africa, countries cannot afford to incur waste of resources and enormous expenses from failures that occur especially in avoidable circumstances. Although re-search in concrete technology is growing rapidly and faces many challenges associated with skills and technological expertise, an important contributor to failure is that there is much existing knowledge that is not adequately applied. The reason for this redundant knowledge base is inadequate technology transfer to all levels of the work force – from design engineers to the concrete work team at the construction site. This paper explores some of the barriers to effective technology transfer and considers ways of dealing with this problem in developing countries. Also presented is a case study of a recent fatal col-lapse of a new reinforced concrete building under construction in Uganda...|$|R

Therefore, the contract is the main reference to overcome issues regarding to failure claims. When <b>construction</b> <b>failure</b> occurred after the contractual period, the contract provisions are not applicable. Moreover, the contractual relationships couldn’t be referred anymore. Thus, all parties seek to the justice to define their role and duty on failure loss and remedial cost based on the contract. The level of inadequacy of failure management consideration in the current contract documents was measured. Moreover, the limitations in current contractual provisions were evaluated to suggest the new scope for contractual provisions in managing <b>construction</b> <b>failure.</b> The evaluations were performed by interview with a panel of experts in the construction industry and legal sector.

40|$|A major {{difference}} between construction and manufacturing is that most con-structed facilities are unique, while manufactured goods usually are mass-produced. Therefore, to attain learning effects comparable to those achieved in mass-production, learning from failures in construction needs to take place at an industry-wide level. Further, methods of Quality Management adapted to the spe-cial circumstances of construction need to be developed. In this report, we discuss three systematic approaches to prevent construction failures. First, we discuss the statistical analysis of large samples of construction failures (macroscopic analy-sis) to identify primary failure modes and derive preventive measures. Next, we propose to select typical cases from the most frequently occurring <b>construction</b> <b>failure</b> modes. A detailed analysis (microscopic analysis) of the selected cases can then also lead to preventive measures.

40|$|Purpose This study {{investigates the}} factors that cause {{government}} <b>construction</b> projects <b>failure</b> in a developing. Methodology The study used sequential data collection approach through an in-depth semi-structured interview (16 participants) and questionnaire survey (230 participants) to solicit their perceptions from project management practitioners, contractors and client (government officials) about {{the factors that}} lead to Ghanaian government construction projects. The Relative Importance Index (RII) {{was used to determine}} the relative importance of the factors identified. This was followed by Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Kendall’s coefficient of concordance to measure the degree of agreement among the participants on their perceptions. Findings Thirty-four (34) factors were identified as the main factors that lead into Ghanaian government <b>construction</b> projects <b>failure.</b> The top ten (10) most important factors that cause Ghanaian government <b>construction</b> projects <b>failure</b> are: political interferences, delays in payment, partisan politics, bureaucracy, corruption, poor supervision, lack of commitment by project leaders, poor planning, starting more projects than the government can fund, and change in government. The failure factors were grouped into four main themes and found that the most important failure factors are leadership. This is followed by management and administrative practices, resources, and external forces respectively. Research limitations/implications This study is limited to only the public sector and therefore finding may not be applicable in the private sector. Practical implications Policy makers and construction project management practitioners would be able to use findings as a guide during the implementation of government projects in order to reduce and/or avoid government <b>construction</b> projects <b>failure.</b> Originality/value <b>Construction</b> projects <b>failure</b> in developing countries is high. Accordingly, extant literature has been devoted to identifying the factors that lead to failure; however, they have mainly been discussed from generic point of view or individual case studies. Researches that focus exclusively on government construction projects in developing countries are rare despite the dynamics in which these projects are implemented. This research extends the construction project management literature by focusing on government construction projects in a developing economy; where there are weak public institutional systems coupled with partisanship politics and bad cultural orientation towards government sector work inherited from colonial rule...|$|R
40|$|Failure of {{concrete}} structures during construction constitutes {{a significant percentage}} of <b>construction</b> <b>failures.</b> Formwork failure is among the major causes {{of concrete}} <b>construction</b> <b>failures.</b> One of the causes of slab formwork failures is overloading. The major slab formwork loads include dead, live, equipment impact and wind loads. In this study slab formwork live loads are investigated. In recent years, a trend has been developing toward placing design codes on a probabilistic bases. Developing probability-based design criteria for construction requires an extensive data bank of actual construction loads. In this study to collect sufficient data for developing probability-based live load models for multistory concrete building construction, thirty-two concrete building projects in twelve cities were visited and surveyed. In this survey, weight of objects considered as live loads were determined by the inventory method or direct weighing. In order to build a representative construction live load data-base, the survey included buildings {{with a wide range of}} characteristics. These characteristics included size, construction cycle time, number of floors, availability of storage space around the construction site, formwork system used, future intended use and slab design. The collected construction live load data were divided into two groups: Live loads on formwork before pouring the slab and live loads on newly poured slabs. Each live load group was studied and analyzed separately because of differences in the nature of these loads. The statistical moments of the collected loads for several averaging areas were calculated and appropriate probability models were fitted to the load data. A stochastic process was developed to represent the construction live loads. The parameters of the process were determined from the collected data. The developed probability model was used to determine the statistical moments and the distribution function for an equivalent uniformly distributed load that produces (statistically) the same forces in formwork members as the actual observed formwork loads...|$|R
