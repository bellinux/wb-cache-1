40|$|The {{ability to}} {{differentiate}} <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> (CBM) <b>strategies</b> is an important skill for novice teachers in increasingly diverse classrooms. Worldwide, {{little is known about}} the curriculum content offered to pre-service teachers in the area of CBM. This article reports the findings from the first nationwide survey of Australian primary pre-service teacher educators coordinating units and programmes with CBM content. Twenty-five Australian tertiary institutions with primary programmes participated, providing information on 102 of the 118 units with CBM content. Stand-alone units were offered in 68 % of programmes and embedded in 96 % of programmes. Unit coordinators included a mean of 8. 3 approaches/models per unit. They commonly included applied behaviour analysis, decisive discipline, positive behaviour intervention and support, and choice theory/reality therapy, among the 36 approaches/models listed. More than half (57. 9 %) of the stand-alone units and only 20 % of embedded units were coordinated by an academic with a stated CBM research interests. Units coordinated by an academic with CBM research interests contained more hours/model and included research-based models more often than those without CBM research interests, although they still included non-research-based models. 22 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Indigenous {{people in}} Australia {{experience}} multiple forms of disadvantage. Some of these result in poor educational outcomes, which, in turn, create further disadvantage. While {{a number of}} factors have been thought to contribute to the difficulties that Indigenous children encounter at school, the implications of conductive hearing loss have been largely a neglected issue. Conductive hearing loss results from middle ear disease (otitis media). Indigenous children experience otitis media in more severe forms, earlier and for longer periods during childhood than do other groups of children in Australia. However, there has been a long‐standing tendency to regard middle ear disease and the related conductive hearing loss as largely a health issue, despite past research which has demonstrated that conductive hearing loss is associated with school behaviour problems, and with poor learning outcomes for many Indigenous students. This research project used an embedded case study, mixed methods design to consider issues that are fundamental to the improvement in the educational support available for urban Indigenous students with conductive hearing loss. The project evaluated an informal speech reception game that could be used by teachers and parents to identify the children who may have a current conductive hearing loss. It also examined children’s classroom responses, responses that were often viewed by teachers as behaviour problems, and found that these could be related to students’ current conductive hearing loss. ii The research outcomes provide {{a better understanding of how}} conductive hearing loss, in conjunction with background noise levels in classrooms, can shape responses by students that teachers identify as behaviour problems. The resulting framework of knowledge can be drawn on to help teachers working with children with current conductive hearing loss. It provides a base for the development of more effective <b>classroom</b> intervention and <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> that cater for the communicative and educational needs of the many Indigenous children with conductive hearing loss...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> is an {{essential}} skill required by all teacher graduates to facilitate instruction in curriculum content. This article describes the <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> (CBM) content on offer in Australian undergraduate primary education programs. To date, no nationwide studies exist that report the CBM instruction on offer in pre-service teacher education programs. Thirty-five primary teacher preparation programs were reviewed. Thirty programs (85. 7 %) contained mandatory course-work in CBM, 108 units contained relevant content, 33 of those were stand-alone CBM units (30. 6 %). More units were found with CBM content embedded within methods or inclusion units than stand-alone CBM units. The mean hours of CBM instruction per mandatory stand-alone unit was 31. 46 hours, 25. 5 for stand-alone electives, and 2. 3 hours within embedded units. The content of CBM units is reported {{as well as the}} research interests of the unit convenors and instructors. Implications of the major findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Although Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is {{a common}} {{disorder}} amongst school going children, it is often misdiagnosed, misunderstood and mismanaged. This state of affairs does {{not bode well for}} the development of the ADHD learner and often leads to long-term impairments in terms of the learner's social and emotional development, academic performance and future vocational success. Therefore, it is essential that teachers fully understand the disorder and know how to optimally accommodate ADHD learners in their classrooms. The aims of the research were as follows: to determine whether a significant difference exists between teachers' ratings of the importance of certain didactic approaches, <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> and parental involvement in accommodating ADHD learners in "regular” classrooms on the one hand, and the frequency of teachers' implementation thereof on the other; and to determine how variables such as gender, age, teaching experience and qualifications affect (1) teachers' ratings of the importance of certain didactic approaches, <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> and parental involvement for accommodating ADHD learners in "regular" classrooms and (2) the frequency of teachers' implementation thereof. A dual research approach was followed to achieve the aims of the research. First, a literature study was done on ADHD with reference to its aetiology, prevalence, symptoms, co-morbid features and treatment options. The implications of accommodating ADHD learners in "regular” classrooms were discussed against the background of the inclusive educational approach. Second, an empirical investigation was undertaken to determine how important teachers rate various inclusive didactic approaches and strategies and how frequently they implement them. The effect that variables such as gender, age, qualifications and teaching experience could have on teachers' ratings of the importance and frequency of implementation of these inclusive didactic approaches and strategies were also investigated. A structured questionnaire was distributed amongst 115 intermediate phase teachers who are teaching in ex-Model C primary schools in the Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom school districts. The data was statistically analysed and the following conclusions were drawn: Although teachers are aware of the importance of certain didactic approaches, <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> and parental involvement for the optimal inclusion of ADHD learners in "regular" classrooms, in practice they do not implement these aspects so frequently. Female teachers rate the implementation of certain didactic approaches, strategies related to teacher behaviour and parental involvement more important for accommodating ADHD learners in their classrooms than their male counterparts, and implement them more frequently than male teachers. In general, variables such as gender, age, teaching experience and qualifications do not significantly affect (1) teachers' ratings of the importance of certain didactic approaches, <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> and parental involvement for accommodating ADHD learners in regular classrooms, or (2) the frequency of teachers' implementation thereof. Resulting from the findings of the research, practical guidelines were recommended to enhance the teaching and inclusion of ADHD learners in "regular" classrooms. Master...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of a self-directed parent training programme for preschoolers externalising behaviour problems on child and parenting behaviours. The programme used was the Triple P self-help book and DVD. A non-concurrent multiple baseline design across five participants was used to examine changes in preschoolers externalising and prosocial behaviours over time and parents use of <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> was also monitored at baseline and throughout using the self-help programme. A pre-post design was used to further test changes in preschoolers externalising behaviours and parents use of ineffective discipline, and to examine changes in parenting knowledge, competence, and depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Significant and large effect sizes were found for increased prosocial behaviour, decreased externalising behaviour as shown by the multiple baseline data and parents' decreased ineffective discipline and increased parental competence as shown by the test battery. The pre- and post-measures showed non-significant improvements for parenting knowledge and depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. These findings are comparable to previous research. Parents were satisfied with the intervention, although some participants did not trial all of the strategies taught. This study supports the effectiveness of the self-directed Triple P intervention, without therapist assistance, and suggests that the preschool period may be a particularly important point in preventing the otherwise adverse developmental pathway of externalising behaviour problems. These results require further replication due to the small sample size in the study and the lack of a control group for the pre- post-comparisons. Future parent training research should examine changes in children's prosocial behaviours and parenting knowledge and monitor parents' use of and satisfaction with <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies.</b> This would be beneficial in clarifying the nature of these changes and relationship among these variables and to improve parent training programmes to maximise treatment gains...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of systems}} of rewards and {{sanctions}} within behaviour policies {{has now been}} adopted formally in UK schools. Such systems potentially represent competing theoretical ideas when considered alongside current approaches to teaching and learning. There is also opportunity for inconsistent use of rewards and sanctions resulting from {{the absence of a}} distinction between incentives and punishments and again between pupils’ task-based work and their social behaviour. This case study comprises one of three questionnaire surveys completed by UK secondary school pupils in Year 7 and Year 11. The findings show a complex range of pupil responses to different <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies,</b> as well as highlighting changes in pupil responses across the age groups. Some sanctions for <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> are also found to lead pupils to stay quiet, potentially affecting their ability to engage in all learning activities. Sanctions such as asking pupils to miss break, or giving detentions, are seen to be counter-productive in encouraging pupils to work hard in class.
