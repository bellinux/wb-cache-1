25|$|A Gomco clamp, {{otherwise}} known as a Yellen clamp, is a specialized clamp for performing circumcisions on a human male's penis. y using a Gomco <b>clampe,</b> the time required is less than that by any other method, sutures are never used, no bleeding is encountered, and it leaves a clean-cut incision which heals perfectly in 36 hours with practically no chance of infection because the mucous membrane and skin are securely clamped together. The Gomco clamp was inented in 1935 by Hiram S. Yellen and Aaron Goldstein. The Gomco clamp was then market by Goldstein through his private company, the Goldstein Manufacturing Company and later patented in 1940.|$|E
50|$|During the English Civil War {{there was}} a siege of Newark-on-Trent which took place from 6 March 1645 - 8 May 1646. A {{detailed}} map of the Cavaliers defences of Newark and the lines of circumvallation and contravallation along with the besiegers redoubts and fortified camps was drawn up by R <b>Clampe,</b> the besieging Roundheads' chief engineer. It includes a zig-zag sap emerging from a bastion of the circumvallation. The zig-zags are at such angles and positions that the defenders were unable to bring enfilade fire to bear. Once the sap was completed four cannons were placed much closer to a gateway than those in bastions of the circumvallation.|$|E

A simple sampling procedure was usedj water from the surface was dipped up in a bucket and a 60 ml 0 polyethylene bottle was filled while {{the water in the}} bucket was constantly stirred. Two percent formalin or Lugols Iodine was used in fixation. After the sam ples were brought back to the lab they were processed using molecular filter techniques. This technique, described below, is time consum ing,, but is very accurate. Equipment includes a vacuum flask, a centered glass filter, a funnel and clamp, and millipore filters. In this instance the filters used were H. A., white, gridded, hi milli meter diameter, with a pore size of about 0. 5 microns. For each sample a millipore filter is placed, grid side up, on the centered glass filter (which fits tightly into the vacuum flask) and the funnel is placed over it.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop a}} {{reliable}} surgical model of acute hepatic failure and hyperammonemia in rats that avoids porto-systemic shunt and bile duct ligation, applicable to hepatic encephalopathy research. METHODS: The pedicles of right lateral and caudate lobes were exposed and clamped. One hour later, {{the animal was}} reopened, clamps were released and anterior subtotal hepatectomy (resection of median and left lateral lobes) was performed, comprising 75 % of liver removal. Four hours after hepatectomy, blood samples and liver tissues were collected from ALF and control groups. RESULTS: Differences between ALF and control groups were significant for ALT, AST, total and direct bilirubin, sodium, potassium, alkaline phosphatasis, gamma-glutamyltransferase and most important, ammonia. Histologically, significant differences were noticed between groups. CONCLUSION: The model is useful {{for the study of}} specific aspects of ALF and the development of new therapeutic approaches. OBJETIVO: Desenvolver um modelo cirúrgico de IHA e hiperamonemia em ratos, que evita o shunt porto-sistêmico e a ligadura do ducto biliar, que seja aplicável à pesquisa de encefalopatia hepática. MÉTODOS: Após anestesia geral e laparotomia mediana, os pedículos dos lobos laterais direito e caudado foram isolados e clampeados. Após 1 hora, o animal foi reaberto, os <b>clampes</b> retirados e foi realizada hepatectomia anterior subtotal (ressecção dos lobos médio e lateral esquerdo), compreendendo a remoção de 75 % do parênquima. Quatro horas após a hepatectomia, amostras de sangue e tecido hepático foram coletadas nos grupos IHA e controle. RESULTADOS: Diferenças entre os grupos IHA e controle foram significativas para ALT, AST, bilirrubina total e direta, sódio, potássio, fosfatase alcalina, gama glutamiltransferase e principalmente amônia. Histologicamente, diferenças significativas foram observadas entre os grupos. CONCLUSÃO: O modelo é útil para o estudo de aspectos específicos da IHA e o desenvolvimento de novas abordagens terapêuticas...|$|R
40|$|Many women {{consider}} mammography painful. Existing {{studies on}} pain-preventing strategies only mention pain scores reported {{before and after}} breast compression. Studying the pain dynamics during the entire compression cycle may provide new insights for effective pain-preventing strategies. This observational study included 117 women who consented to use a custom turning knob to indicate their pain experience during standard mammographic breast compressions in the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The breast thickness, compression force, contact area, contact pressure and pain experience were recorded continuously. Breast volume was calculated retrospectively from the mammograms. We visualized the progression of pain in relation to breast mechanics for five groups of breast volumes and we performed multivariable regressions to identify factors that significantly predict pain experience. Breast compressions consisted of a deformation phase for flattening, and a clamping phase for immobilization. The clamping phase lasted 12. 8 [*]±[*] 3. 6 seconds (average[*]±[*]standard deviation), 1. 7 times longer than the 7. 5 [*]±[*] 2. 6 seconds deformation phase. During the clamping phase, the average pain score increased from 4. 75 to 5. 88 (+ 24 %) on a 0 - 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), {{and the proportion of}} women who reached severe pain (NRS[*]≥[*] 7) increased from 23 % to 50 % (more than doubled). Moderate pain (NRS[*]≥[*] 4) was reported up to four days after the mammogram. Multivariable analysis showed that pain recollection of the previous mammogram and breast pain before the compression, are significant predictors for pain. Women with smallest breasts experienced most pain: They received highest contact pressures (force divided by contact area) and the pressure increased at the highest rate. We suggest further research on two pain-preventing strategies: 1) using a personalized compression protocol by applying to all breasts the same target pressure at the same, slow rate, and 2) shortening the phase during which the breast is <b>clampe...</b>|$|E
40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: A recidiva local no câncer colorretal tem como {{principal}} causa o implante de células tumorais nas anastomoses. 11 - 15 Dessa maneira, lavagem química do lúmen intestinal é preconizada para evitar tanto o implante quanto à recidiva local. 11 - 28 Em estudos prévios constatamos que a solução bicarbonatada de ácido acetilsalicílico tem efeitos citolíticos e anti-tumorais in-vitro. 31 OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a toxicidade da solução de aspirina na mucosa colônica de coelhos com o objetivo de usá-la no preparo intestinal de portadores de câncer colorretal. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Foram utilizados 20 coelhos. Um <b>clampe</b> vascular foi colocado acima do cólon sigmóide. Os animais foram submetidos a um enema com 50 ml da solução de aspirina ou soro fisiológico de acordo com o grupo. Os animais foram sacrificados ao término do procedimento ou tardiamente de acordo com o grupo. RESULTADOS: A solução de aspirina não altera a mucosa colônica de coelhos. CONCLUSÃO: O uso da solução bicarbonatada de ácido acetilsalicílico no preparo intestinal de portadores de câncer colorretal é clinicamente possível. BACKGROUND: The implantation of viable exfoliated intraluminal tumour {{cells is}} the major cause of local recurrence in colorectal cancer. 11 - 28 Therefore, the bowel lumen wash with a tumoricidal agent has been recommended. 11 - 28 In previous study we observe that acetylsalicylic acid solution cause neoplastic cell death in vitro. 31 PURPOSE: Assess the local effect of acetylsalicylic acid solution on the colonic mucosa of rabbits, {{in order to use}} this agent in the bowel lumen wash. METHODS: 20 rabbits were used. A vascular clamp was placed on the distal colon, followed by the instillation per rectum of 50 ml of acetylsalicylic acid solution or saline solution, according to the group. The euthanasia was performed immediately or later according to the group. RESULTS: The acetylsalicylic acid solution doesn't cause any injury on the colonic mucosa of rabbits. Conclusion: The use of acetylsalicylic acid solution in the bowel lumen wash seems clinically feasible...|$|E
40|$|As alterações morfológicas renais na síndrome de isquemia e reperfusão em membros posteriores foram estudadas em ratos Wistar (N= 60) machos, pesando entre 200 e 250 gramas, distribuídos em 3 grupos: I (sham); II (isquemia); III (isquemia + reperfusão); e cada grupo redistribuído em 2 subgrupos: A (30 min); B (60 min). Foi realizada a isquemia utilizando <b>clampe</b> {{vascular}} (8 mm) na aorta abdominal infra-renal de acordo com o grupo estudado. Ao final de cada experimento realizou-se o sacrifício sob anestesia. A análise histológica renal cortical e medular (descritiva e morfométrica) foi realizada através de metodologia convencional (parafina-hematoxilina-eosina) e técnica de imuno-histoquímica para a detecção de proteínas reguladoras da apoptose: Bcl-x, Bax e Bcl- 2. A análise semiquantitativa de lesão tubular e intersticial foi realizada de acordo com o grau de lesão tubular e grau de lesão intersticial. Para a análise estatística foram aplicados os seguintes testes: Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis e Teste de Wilcoxon. Foram observadas no grupo IIIB alterações histológicas tubulares e intersticiais significativas com relação aos outros grupos, além de uma maior expressão das proteínas Bcl-x e Bcl- 2 na região medular, também no grupo IIIB. Sendo assim, conclui-se que a síndrome de isquemia e reperfusão em membros posteriores de ratos está associada a lesões estruturais renais tubulares, principalmente na fase de reperfusãoMorphologic {{changes in}} the ischemia and reperfusion syndrome in posterior limbs were studied in Wistar rats (N= 60), male, weighing between 200 and 250 grams, and distributed in 3 groups: I (sham); II (ischemia); III (ischemia + reperfusion); being each group further distributed into 2 subgroups: A (30 min); B (60 min). Ischemia was caused using a vascular clamp (8 mm) in the infrarenal aorta, according to the group studied. At {{the end of each}} experiment, the rats were euthanized under anesthesia. Cortical and medullar histological analyses (descriptive and morphometric) were carried out using conventional methodology (paraffin-hematoxiline-eosine) and immunohistochemistry technique was used for detection of the apoptosis-regulating proteins: Bcl-x, Bax, and Bcl- 2. Semi-quantitative analysis of the tubular and interstitial lesion was carried out according to the degree of tubular lesion and the degree of interstitial lesion. The following tests were used for the statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Wilcoxon Test. Relevant tubular and interstitial histological alterations were observed in group IIIB compared to the other groups, besides a greater expression of proteins Bcl-x and Bcl- 2, also in group IIIB. We may therefore conclude that the ischemia and reperfusion syndrome in rat’s posterior limbs is associated to tubular structural renal lesions, especially during the reperfusion phase...|$|E
