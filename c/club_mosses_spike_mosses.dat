30|$|We {{were able}} to {{demonstrate}} that ferns apparently conserved {{at least two of}} the major enzymes in the anthocyanin pathways in DFR and F 3 GT (Figures  2, 3), while <b>spike</b> <b>mosses</b> retained all the major enzymes (Figures  2, 3, 4, 5). We do not believe that ferns are lacking in the ANS and F 3 ′H loci, since more ancient plant species have these genes, however more comprehensive genome databases are required to probe into which loci are actually present in the fern genome.|$|R

It grows in wet habitat, such as bogs, ponds, moist spots on the tundra, and longstanding borrow pits. It is a small plant forming patches on the ground, its leafy sterile stems branching and lying horizontal along the ground and fertile conebearing stems erect a few centimeters high. The leaves are curving, green, narrow, and sharply pointed, measuring a few millimeters long.|$|R
