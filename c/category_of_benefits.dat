In this work we analyze some key indica- tors of social protection services {{from the perspective of the}} beneficiaries, the Italian households. We used the EU-SILC 2013 data together with data coming from ad- ministrative archives to produce small area estimates of social protection indicators at provincial level in Italy (LAU 1), such as the households’ Head Count Ratio be- fore and after the social transfers, and the proportion and the mean of a specific <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits,</b> family/children allowances...|$|E
40|$|Decision {{tools for}} species conservation, such as benefit cost {{analysis}} (BCA) and project prioritization protocol (PPP) use monetary values to measure benefits or to assign priorities across species. Non-use (or passive) values are an important, yet difficult to quantify, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> When not estimated {{they may be}} assigned a zero value by decision makers. This results in the under-provision of conservation dollars to substantial non-use values generating projects and actions. To overcome the problem, we provide a guide to environmental value transfer (EVT) that allows decision makers to derive indirect estimates of non-use values. Environmental value transfer, together with consideration of estimated benefits uncertainty, promise better decision making and improved species conservation outcomes. environmental value transfer, species conservation, non-use values, Environmental Economics and Policy, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|E
40|$|Although {{water quality}} {{is a valid}} purpose for {{watershed}} projects under the PL 83 - 566 Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, historically very few water quality projects have ever been implemented in Arizona. This {{is largely due to}} the difficulty in measuring "non-controversial" monetary benefits associated with positive water quality impacts and to policy biased in favor of those projects with a higher monetary benefit-cost ratio. These reasons, among others, has prompted NRCS field economists to seek alternate methods to measure project benefits and costs. While the direct measurement of water quality benefits would be the preferable method to use, IMPLAN, through regional economic impact analysis, provides a way of measuring another <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> {{that can be used in}} the economic analysis of watershed projects.

40|$|This {{study is}} an initial effort to {{estimate}} one important <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> of environmental improvements in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), {{those related to}} the effects of air pollution on human health. Our estimates are derived from data on ambient air quality in selected CEE locations, together with a model that links these ambient conditions to physical impacts on health and attaches economic values (in dollar terms) to these impacts. Given data limitations, our focus here is on three pollutants: particulates (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and lead (Pb). Our data set includes ambient concentrations for these pollutants in four CEE countries: Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine. Given the ambient data, dose-response functions taken from the clinical and epidemiological literature in the U. S., Canada, and Western Europe are used to generate estimates of the change in physical effects. These effects then are given an economic value by applying two approaches for scaling unit valuation figures applicable to the U. S. A Monte Carlo model is constructed to propagate the uncertainties of the dose-response functions and unit values to obtain confidence intervals on the total benefits from pollutant reductions in each country. We examine scenarios where the CEE countries improve ambient conditions for the pollutants in question to meet European Community (EC) standards and then compare these scenarios to ones involving uniform percentage ambient reductions across locations in each country.

40|$|A {{hallmark}} of religion clause scholarship is the complaint that the doctrine is a hopeless muddle. However, the Rehnquist Court brought {{a considerable amount}} of consistency-well, apparent consistency- to the doctrine. I say 2 ̆ 2 apparent consistency 2 ̆ 2 because, just as a paradox is only a seeming contradiction, so was the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s religion clause jurisprudence only seemingly consistent. The doctrine focuses on whether the government singles out religion for special benefit (generally problematic under the Establishment Clause) or for special burden (generally problematic under the Free Exercise Clause). If, on the other hand, the government benefits religion as part of a more general <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits,</b> or burdens religion as part of a more general category of burdens, neither clause is violated. Thus, religion clause doctrine seemingly fits together nicely, tracking a more general development in equality jurisprudence. However, there are some outlier cases in which the Rehnquist Court upheld special benefits for or special burdens on religion. These outlier cases are a window into a deeper inconsistency in religion clause doctrine. The outlier cases-and a proper understanding of why and when the Court views religion as foregrounded, rather than backgrounded, in Establishment Clause cases-remind us {{of the ways in which}} religion is distinctive. That distinctiveness is not properly valued by a formal doctrine that matches general benefits (valid) against general burdens (valid), and special benefits (invalid) against special burdens (invalid). What we take away from religion by the cases that invalidate religion-favoring governmental action is not offset by those that invalidate religion- disfavoring governmental action. We need a broader conception of free exercise to compensate for the ways in which the doctrine (properly, in my judgment) treats religion as distinctive under the Establishment Clause...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was the {{relative}} value and importance of perceived benefits of active foundations of public community colleges. The purposes were to identify a list of benefits; determine the importance of these benefits as perceived by presidents and foundation executive directors; assess {{the degree to which the}} level of importance of the benefits was affected by college or foundation demographics or foundation executive director characteristics; and to determine if presidents and foundation executive directors differ in their perceptions of the importance of the benefits. Survey instruments were mailed to presidents and foundation executive directors of colleges determined to have active foundations. Both instruments contained seven categories listing potential benefits to the community colleges of an active foundation. The foundation executive directors' instruments also requested college and foundation demographic data. Respondents were asked to rate the benefits according to their level of importance. Analysis of variance tests were performed to determine whether the categories of benefits were affected by any of the demographic data, when a level of significance emerged, a Scheffe' test was performed to determine the source of significance. Major findings were that the most important single benefit to the community colleges of active foundations is the provision of student scholarships. The "Public Relations/Political Influence" role of the active foundation is the most important <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> The more fund-raising activities held and the greater the amount of contributions, the more positively community college administrators felt about the role of their active foundations in terms of external relations.

40|$|This Essay makes three {{principal}} claims. First, {{it shows}} that breakeven analysis is a useful technique for adding structure to costbenefit analysis when a regulatory benefit has not been quantified. In particular, breakeven analysis can sometimes address the judicial hostility to using nonquantified benefits as trumps. But it is a secondbest approach because actually quantifying the benefit can provide far more useful information to the regulatory process. Second, the Essay argues that the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> 2 ̆ 2 quantifiable 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 nonquantifiable 2 ̆ 2 benefits are not immutable. 2 ̆ 2 Unquantifiable 2 ̆ 2 benefits are simply benefits {{that have not yet}} been quantified. Over the last few decades, important <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> that were once considered unquantifiable were subsequently quantified: the two most significant for current regulatory purposes are the 2 ̆ 2 value of a statistical life 2 ̆ 2 (VSL) and the social cost of carbon (SCC). Third, the Essay shows {{that the federal government has}} played a significant role in providing resources for the quantification <b>of</b> important <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and should be regarded as a catalyst for future efforts of this sort. Recent congressional threats to cut the funding for research in the social sciences are a worrisome development in this regard. As a result, the push for breakeven analysis is a salutary development unless it diverts attention and resources from the actual quantification <b>of</b> regulatory <b>benefits...</b>|$|R

30|$|Based on a {{structured}} {{overview of the}} literature on tie heterogeneity in interlocking directorates, our classification framework derived from resource dependence theory highlights the key differences between the three types of ties. Sent interlocks offer particularly knowledge-based and social influence benefits that firms cannot realize via received and undirected interlocks, but are in general costlier and more difficult to establish. By contrast, creating ties by appointing outside directors is potentially doubly beneficial for a firm; it permits access to the resources of another firm and the individual creating the tie provides human and social capital. However, the creation of received interlocks requires high levels of trust and can in this sense be costly for the focal firm. Likewise, the overall <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> undirected interlocks are fuzzier and thus less predictable. In sum, our cost–benefit approach highlights that the three types of ties cannot be considered as equal alternatives—especially when comparing their function across the three <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and costs. Instead, the focal firm’s needs have {{to be taken into account}} to fully understand tie choice.|$|R

Universities {{have been interested}} in student retention for many reasons other than marketing. However, now faced with increased domestic competition and the adoption of a student customer focus, the need to stem student attrition has become more pronounced. RM represents a possible strategy for regional, new universities, as the key outcome of RM is the retention of current customers. An important aspect of RM is that relationships are mutually beneficial to both the customer and the organisation.
