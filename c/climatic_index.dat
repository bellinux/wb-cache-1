40|$|The {{climatic data}} for 17 years from 1988 to 2004 of the rainfed hill {{plateaus}} of Kandhamal district of Orissa (India) were analyzed {{to find out}} the monthly <b>climatic</b> <b>index</b> from the calculated values of effective rainfall and evapotranspiration. The 80 % dependable monthly <b>climatic</b> <b>index</b> was correlated with crop coefficient and suitable cropping period and sequences for the study area were suggested based on it. The extent of investment, net return and soil loss from agriculture were estimated as per the present condition and for the suggested cropping patterns. A mathematical model was formulated for optimal allocation of area to different crop sequences with different objectives viz. minimization of soil loss, minimization of investment and maximization of net return from agriculture and was solved using linear goal programming technique. The model suggested to take up food crops in area of 1, 30, 777 ha and perennial grass cover in 3223 ha with a cropping intensity of 1. 61 resulting in a net return of Rs 1064. 775 millions sustaining soil loss to a tune of 9489. 67 thousandtons per year. The model was found to be favourable in respect of higher net return of Rs 8862. 34 and lesser soil loss of 23. 41 tons/ha than the corresponding present values.

The monthly volume of the GSL is presumed to depend on recent volumes of the lake, and on three atmospheric circulation indices. The indices considered are the Southern oscillation index (SOI), the pacific/North America (PNA) <b>climatic</b> <b>index,</b> and the central North Pacific (CNP) <b>climatic</b> <b>index.</b> Locally weighted polynomials with automatically and locally chosen parameters are used for developing a non-linear forecasting model. Estimated average mutual information (M. I) is used to select appropriate lags across each time series. Iterated and direct multi-step predictions of lake volumes for up to 2 years in the future with and without the atmospheric indices are compared. The atmospheric circulation information can lead to significant improvements in the predictability of the lake.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} a relationship between 11 correlated <b>climatic</b> <b>indices</b> and rainfall and runoff in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). The <b>climatic</b> <b>indices</b> are functions of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) differentials. There are six Pacific Ocean indices, three Atlantic Ocean indices, one Indian Ocean index and one from the Southern Ocean. Trends in the <b>climatic</b> <b>indices</b> are investigated by fitting seasonal trend models using generalized least squares. Relationships between the indices are described by correlation analysis and factor analysis. Correlation analysis of the pre-whitened series is first presented and this is used to guide the choice of <b>climatic</b> <b>indices</b> for the regression models. Regression analyses are then used to investigate the effects of <b>climatic</b> <b>indices</b> on rainfall and runoff at the monthly level during the period 1957 – 2009. This is undertaken using data from three stations in the southeast region of the MDB, namely Tooma River Basin, Jingellic Catchment and Ovens Catchment. Regression models are fitted using all or a sub-set of the <b>climatic</b> <b>indices</b> and their interactions, and these are compared with regression models based on estimates of latent factors and their interactions. Typical R 2 values of 20 % were obtained. The Akaike Information Criterion indicated that statistically significant improvement could be obtained from a benchmark model using seasonality, trends and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).

This paper presents the tourism <b>climatic</b> <b>index</b> as a bioclimatic indicator for determining the conditions suitable for recreational tourism throughout the year. Research results according to the case study indicate the comparative advantages and also the lack of climate as the resource in tourism of Montenegro.

40|$|AbstractKnowledge of {{temporal}} and spatial variability of climate and rainfall can improve agriculture production and can help to manage risks caused by climate variability. Available high-quality monthly rainfall data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology for 1907 – 2011 was used to investigate the leading seasonal mode of the long-term rainfall variability over south-eastern and eastern Australia. Spatio-temporal variations of seasonal rainfall and their connection to oceanic-atmospheric predictors were analysed. The links between the first two Principal Components of rainfall of each season with lagged Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) were season-dependent. The relationship between these <b>climatic</b> <b>indices</b> changed within both inter-seasonal and decadal time scales. Spring and winter rainfalls were continuously positively correlated with lagged (SOI). However, summer rainfall variations indicated negative correlations with lagged SOI which increase from 1970. The correlations between lagged SOI and autumn variations were weak and change to a stronger relationship from 1990. Correlations between lagged (IOD) which varied across all seasons have recently been increasing. Variations in rainfall across all seasons were highly correlated with Southern Annular Mode (SAM) with different signs. Overall, the relationship between predictors and seasonal rainfall has changed after 1970. The results of running correlations between leading modes of seasonal rainfall and lagged SOI, SAM, and IOD indices indicates non-stationary in these links. The relationships of <b>climatic</b> <b>indices</b> and leading modes of seasonal rainfall changed since 1970, with stronger evidence in case of IOD.

40|$|Abstract. In the wheatbelt {{of eastern}} Australia, {{rainfall}} shifts from winter dominated {{in the south}} (South Australia, Victoria) to summer dominated in the north (northern New SouthWales, southern Queensland). The seasonality of rainfall, together with frost risk, drives the choice of cultivar and sowing date, resulting in a flowering time between October {{in the south and}} August in the north. In eastern Australia, crops are therefore exposed to contrasting climatic conditions during the critical period around flowering, which may affect yield potential, and the efficiency in the use of water (WUE) and radiation (RUE). In this work we analysed empirical and simulated data, to identify key climatic drivers of potential water- and radiation-use efficiency, derive a simple <b>climatic</b> <b>index</b> of environmental potentiality, and provide an example of how a simple <b>climatic</b> <b>index</b> could be used to quantify the spatial and temporal variability in resource-use efficiency and potential yield in eastern Australia. Around anthesis, from Horsham to Emerald, median vapour pressure deficit (VPD) increased from 0. 92 to 1. 28 kPa, average temperature increased from 12. 9 to 15. 2 ◦C, and the fraction of diffuse radiation (FDR) decreased from 0. 61 to 0. 41. These spatial gradients in climatic drivers accounted for significant gradients inmodelled efficiencies: median transpiration WUE (WUEB/T) increased southwards at a rate of 2. 6 % per degree latitude and median RUE increased southwards at a rate of 1. 1 % per degree latitude. Modelled and empirical data confirmed previously established relationships between WUEB/T and VPD, and between RUE and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and FDR.

This study took the saline Maharloo Lake, which {{is located in the}} north of Persian Gulf, southern Iran, and is continuously suffering from drought disaster, as a case to investigate the relationships between <b>climatic</b> <b>indices</b> and precipitation. Cross-correlation in combination with stepwise regression technique was used to determine the best variables among 40 indices and identify the proper time lag between dependent and independent variables for each month. The monthly precipitation was predicted using an artificial neural network (ANN) and multi-regression stepwise methods, and results were compared with observed rainfall data. Initial findings indicated that climate indices such as NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation), PNA (Pacific North America) and El Niño are the main indices to forecast drought in the study area. According to R 2, root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, the ANN model performed better than the multi-regression model, which was also confirmed by classification results. Moreover, the model accuracy to forecast the rare rainfall events in dry months (June to October) was higher than the other months. From the findings it can be concluded that there is a relationship between monthly precipitation anomalies and <b>climatic</b> <b>indices</b> in the previous 10 months in Maharloo Basin. The highest and lowest accuracy of the ANN model were in September and March, respectively. However, these results are subject to some uncertainty due to a coarse data set and high system complexity.

Most measures of local climate used by ecologists fail to capture such complex associations between weather and ecological process, and this may help to explain why large-scale, seasonal indices of climate spanning several months can outperform local climatic factors. Furthermore, we show why an understanding of the mechanism by which climate influences population ecology is important.
