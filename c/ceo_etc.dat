40|$|Transparency is {{a complex}} issue, which can be {{approached}} from many angles and with various conceptual tools. This contribution provides a brief survey of the economic literature on transparency. The conceptual tool that economists use is the principal-agent model, a game-theoretic setting where a principal (the citizens, shareholders, etc) wants an agent (the government, the <b>CEO,</b> <b>etc.)</b> to perform a certain task. In this setting, transparency corresponds {{to the ability of}} the principal to observe what the agent does. We can then ask what happens when transparency improves. The survey begins with the key theoretical result in this area. Holmstrom (1982) provides a powerful and general rationale for full transparency. More information about the agent’s behavior makes the agent more accountable and more likely to work for the common good. The rest of the contribution discusses a long list of objections to this result, from both a conceptual and a practical viewpoint. Given that Holmstrom asserts that transparency improves accountability, possible criticism belongs to two broad classes. First, one can argue that the increase in accountability is not sufficient to offset other drawbacks such as the violation of privacy, the direct cost o...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the roles of}} corporate governance in bank defaults during the recent financial crisis of 2007 - 2010. Using a data sample of 249 default and 4, 021 no default US commercial banks, we investigate the impact of bank ownership and management structures on the probability of default. The results show that defaults are strongly influenced by a bank’s ownership structure: high shareholdings of outside directors and chief officers (managers with a “chief officer” position, such as the <b>CEO,</b> CFO, <b>etc.)</b> imply a substantially lower probability of failure. In contrast, high shareholdings of lower-level management, such as vice presidents, increase default risk significantly. These findings suggest that high stakes in the bank induce outside directors and upper-level management to control and reduce risk, while greater stakes for lower-level management seem to induce it to take high risks which may eventually result in bank default. Some accounting variables, such as capital, earnings, and non-performing loans, also help predict bank default. However, other potential stability indicators, such as the management structure of the bank, indicators of market competition, subprime mortgage risks, state economic conditions, and regulatory influences, {{do not appear to}} be decisive factors in predicting bank default. ...|$|R

Methodology – The chosen research method was the case study. The data collection involved the participant observation of a company manager (2010 - 2015); the conduction of non-structured interviews to the company’s managers, directors and CFO (2013 - 2015); documental research to the company’s internal and public sources (2010 - 2015); and bibliographical research to scientific papers, business press, market analysts and specialized media (2010 - 2015). Results – The narratives of success found in the company’s reports portray the restructuring myth as a continuous strategy, through which the company reinforces its efforts in delivering good results to shareholders. And, despite the outcomes of the case study not supporting these narratives, its performative nature legitimize the company’s commitment to the SHV management ideology towards stakeholders of the capital market, even in face of the adoption of antishareholders’ postures, such as anti-takeovers measures, the merging of the CEO and Chairman positions, its <b>CEO</b> perks, <b>etc.</b> Contributions – Paradoxically, although the researched company operates under the cold logic of finances, and under pressure to create shareholder value, it revealed to be subject to the dynamics in which the search for symbolic legitimacy plays a decisive role in maintaining its position within the hierarchy of the socially constructed field of the Management in face of other stakeholders present in the field, reinvigorating the precepts of Bourdieu’s Field Theory and the Neo- Institutional Theory...|$|R

Our results show that for both the purchase and sale samples, the information content of the filings has improved significantly between the pre- and post- SOX periods. We also find that progressive regulatory changes and the increased uncertainty in the market {{in recent years as}} a result of the credit crunch in 2008 have made insider transactions more informative. Our results also show that the rank of the insider (<b>CEO,</b> CFO, <b>etc.)</b> has the most influence in explaining the abnormal returns. Finally, in cross-sectional tests, we find that the information content of the filings is stronger for firms with more information asymmetry. Overall, we report that the more timely filing requirement introduced by SOX has been beneficial for investors, particularly for firms with higher levels of information asymmetry. 	In the second essay, we examine the effects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002 on the short and long-run performance of corporate acquisitions. Using a large sample of tender offers between 1996 and 2009, we find that the proportion of value maximizing acquisitions increased after the passage of SOX. The price run-up and the intensity of insider trading prior to the announcement in the target firms have substantially decreased after the Act. Using industry and matched firm portfolios, we also find that both the operating performance and buy-and-hold abnormal returns over the three and five year post-acquisition period improved significantly after SOX. 	In the final essay, we examine the effects of Ontario Bill- 198 (CSOX- 2003), the strictest corporate law in Canada. Despite some drawbacks, we find the Act has added significant value contrary to many practitioners’ beliefs. Using a large sample of Canadian tender offers between 1996 and 2009, we find that both target and acquirer shareholders experience higher abnormal returns closer to announcement dates in the post CSOX period. Using industry adjusted portfolio, we also find that the long term post-acquisition operating performances for the acquiring firms have significantly improved in the post-Act period. Overall, our results suggest that CSOX has an incremental positive impact on Canadian acquisition activity. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{image of}} authoritarian figures and leaders {{inspired}} many of Francis Bacon’s paintings. Among these, {{his interpretation of}} the Portrait of Pope Innocent X (1650) by Velázquez represents an exemplary way of revealing the complex dilemmas incorporated within a leader. However, whereas in Velázquez’s portrait the Pope appeared regal, serene and inquisitive, Bacon’s Study after Velázquez’s Portrait of Pope Innocent X (1953) seems to explore the isolation conferred by his authority. The obsession of Bacon with this painting may suggest a wider challenge to contemporary organizational mythology — top managers, businessmen, politicians, <b>CEOs,</b> bankers, <b>etc.</b> — experiencing a sort of leadership crisis, in a moment when their public image is being questioned and their social status threatened. Is it, then, possible to visualize how our contemporary images of power may become transfigured, challenged and contorted? The dialogue between these two representations of Innocent X inspires questions about the representation and re-interpretation of authority and leadership and it aims at responding the question of What do images of leaders as depicted by portraiture contribute {{to our understanding of}} leading and leadership? This paper follows the analytical framework proposed by Guthey and Jackson concerning a ‘visual genealogy’ of images of leaders. The notion of establishing a ‘genealogy’ of representations of leadership draws upon the work of Michel Foucault, concerning the ways through which Western culture creates subjects and, most specifically, how images of leadership are created through portraiture and art. The interest in the Pope acknowledges the significance of his figure as leader of the Catholic Church, {{one of the most important}} institutions in European history; here, however, the intention is to establish a dialogue between Bacon’s view on leadership in the figure of Innocent X, on the one hand, and on the other the original portrait by Velázquez, both seen in the context of contemporary discussions about leadership and charisma. Here, portraiture is approached as an aesthetic expression that can be used as a means of enquiring into certain aspects of leadership. Both perceptions coincided in their interpretation of leadership as focused on the charismatic individual; yet each of these two representations evidences a rupture, a questioning of this view. Velázquez, in a troppo vero (too real) depiction of the Pope, shows an efficient and cruel leader while offering his personal interpretation of the politics of his time. Bacon’s interpretation goes further, by representing a powerful yet isolated leader, whose excessive individuality has produced a cage in which he remains trapped. Separated from his subjects, this view resembles the excessive attention that the individual is given when understanding leadership and its potential problems. This paper adds to the exploration of aesthetic expressions as a means of enquiring into organizational and social issues, for example, the case of leadership. It evidences the potentialities of considering specific artistic expressions, such as portraiture, as heuristic devices towards understanding some of the processes through which leadership is socially constructed, and the mechanisms promoting one notion or another of leadership in different historical periods...|$|R

30|$|As a prototypical {{semiconductor}} with {{environment friendly}} and high photoelectric property, Titanium oxide (TiO 2) {{is widely used}} in optics, solar cells, sensors etc. [1 – 4], and also considered as a most promising photocatalyst in wastewater treatments [5], due to its low cost, highly physical-chemical stability and nontoxicity. As previous literature reported, though the anatase TiO 2 exhibit better photocatalysis than the Rutile TiO 2, but the band gap of anatase TiO 2 (3.2  eV) is wider than the rutile TiO 2 (3.0  eV), which may restrict the luminous energy utilization ratio in photocatalytic application. What’s more, compare with the metastable anatase TiO 2, the rutile TiO 2 exhibit more highly physical-chemical stability, which is beneficial for cyclic utilization in pollution treatment. With these unique advantages, how to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of the rutile TiO 2 would be a significant issue. As known, the photocatalysis mainly depend on specific surface area or mobility and lifetime of photon-generated carriers, so lots of work have been reported. For specific surface area, lots of excellent morphology have been prepared, such as nanosheets [6], nanobelts [7], nanorods [8], nanofibers [9], and microflowers [10], all of them shows a inspiring results [11 – 14]. On the other hand, the surface noble metal modified or preparation of heterostructure are considered as useful ways to adjust the band structure for improving the mobility and lifetime of photon-generated carriers. However, compared with {{the high cost of}} the noble metal modified, the heterostructure is deemed as a efficient-low cost way. Lots of relevant researches have been reported, such as ZnO/TiO 2 [15 – 17], CdS/ZnO [18 – 20], <b>CeO</b> 2 /graphene <b>etc</b> [21]. Among those semiconductors, the strontium titanate (SrTiO 3) has catched researchers attention due to the thermal stability and resistance to photocorrosion [22], and has been extensively applied in H 2 generation [23], removal of NO [24], water splitting [25], and photocatalyst decomposition of dye [26 – 28]. In particular, as heterostructures composite photocatalyst attracted more attention, such as, Core-shell SrTiO 3 /TiO 2 and heterostructures SrTiO 3 /TiO 2 had showed much higher photocatalytic activity than the pure TiO 2, which is attributed to heterostructures promote the separation of photogenerated carriers [29, 30]. So the SrTiO 3 is considered as a good candidate for coupling with the anatase phase of TiO 2 for adjusting the band structure to enhance its photocatalytic activity. However, there are rare reports about the SrTiO 3 -modified rutile TiO 2 composites nanofibers for the degradation of dye pollutants because of the cumbersome process, so how to simplify the preparation of SrTiO 3 /TiO 2 nano-heterojunction would be an important issue for its practical application. As known, the electrospining is a convenient and efficient method to prepared nanomaterials, which could easily prepare the precursor into nanofibers at the prelusion and then form to series of nanostructure in subsequent annealing, which has been reported in lots literatures [31 – 36].|$|R

In {{order to reduce}} the gate leakage current, and also to maximize gate capacitance, ‘high K’ gate oxide materials such as Al 2 O 3, ZrO 2, HfO 2, Ta 2 O 5, TiO 2, Er 2 O 3, La 2 O 3, Pr 2 O 3, Gd 2 O 3, Y 2 O 3, <b>CeO</b> 2 <b>etc.</b> and some of their silicates such as ZrxSi 1 –xOy, HfxSi 1 –xOy, AlxZr 1 –xO 2 etc. are under investigation. A systematic consideration of the required properties of gate dielectrics indicates that the key guidelines for selecting an alternate gate dielectric are (a) permittivity, band gap and band alignment to silicon, (b) thermodynamic stability, (c) film morphology, (d) interface quality, (e) compatibility with the materials/process used in CMOS devices and (f) reliability. In this study titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is chosen as an alternate to silicon dioxide (SiO 2). This thesis work is aimed at the study of the influence of process parameters like deposition rate, substrate temperature and annealing temperature on the electrical properties like maximum capacitance, dielectric constant, fixed charge, interface trapped charge and leakage current. For making this analysis we have used p–type single crystal silicon () as substrates and employed direct current (DC) reactive magnetron sputtering method with Titanium metal as target and Oxygen as reactive gas. TiO 2 thin films have been deposited with an expected thickness of 50 nm with different deposition rates starting from 0. 8 nm/minute to 2 nm/minute with different substrate temperatures (ambient temperature to 500 ºC). Some of the samples are annealed at 750 ºC in oxygen atmosphere for 30 minutes. SENTECH make Spectroscopic Ellipsometer is used for analyzing the optical properties such as thickness, refractive index etc. The thicknesses of all the samples that are extracted from the Ellipsometry are varying from 35 ± 2 nm to 50 ± 5 nm. Agilent make 4284 A model L−C−R meter along with KarlSUSS wafer probe station is used for the C − V measurements and Keithley make 6487 model Pico ammeter/Voltage source is used for the I−V measurements. MOS capacitors have been fabricated with Aluminium as top electrode to perform the bi directional Capacitance−Voltage and also Current−Voltage analysis. The X–ray diffraction studies on the samples deposited at 500 ºC showed that the films are amorphous. Dielectric constant (K) and effective substrate doping concentration (Na), flat band voltage (VFB), hysteresis, magnitude of fixed charges (Qf) as well as interface states density (Dit') and Equivalent Oxide Thickness (EOT) are obtained from the bi directional C−V analysis. A maximum dielectric constant of 18 is achieved with annealed samples. The best value of fixed charge density we have achieved is 1. 2 x 1011 per cm 2 corresponding to the deposition rate of 2. 0 nm/minute and with 500 ºC substrate temperature. The ranges of Qf values that we have obtained are varying from 1. 2 x 1011 − 1. 0 x 1012 per cm 2. It was also found that, the samples deposited at higher substrate temperatures show lower Qf values than the samples deposited at lower temperatures. The same trend is observed in case of interface states density also. The range of Dit' values we have obtained are in the range of 1. 0 x 1012 cm– 2 eV– 1 to 9 x 1012 cm– 2 eV– 1. The best value of Dit' we have obtained is 1. 0 x 1012 cm– 2 eV– 1 for the sample deposited at 0. 8 nm/minute deposition rate and with substrate temperature of 400 ºC. From the flat band voltage values of different set of samples, {{it was found that the}} flat band voltage is decreasing and in turn trying to approach the analytical value for the films deposited at higher deposition rates. The minimum EOT that we have achieved is 11 nm that corresponds to the film, which is annealed at 750 ºC in oxygen atmosphere. From the I−V analysis it was found that the leakage current density is increasing with increase in substrate temperature and the same trend is observed with annealed films also. The minimum leakage current density achieved is 1. 72 x 10 – 6 A/cm 2 at a gate bias of 1 V (corresponding field of 0. 3 MV/cm). From the time dependent dielectric breakdown analysis it was found that the leakage current is exhibiting a constant value during the entire voltage stress time of 23 minutes. From the I–V characteristics it was found that the leakage current is following the Schottky emission characteristics at lower electric fields (< 1 MV/cm) and is following the Fowler–Nordheim tunneling mechanism at higher electric fields. Since our aim is to study the electrical properties of titanium dioxide thin films for the application as high K gate dielectric in microelectronic applications more emphasis is given on the electrical properties. The maximum dielectric constant we have achieved is in the comparable range of the values for this parameter. The leakage current density values obtained are higher than the required for the microelectronic devices, where as the interface state density values and fixed charge density values are in the same range of values that are reported with this particular oxide and more care has to be taken to minimize these parameters. The EOT values we have achieved are also falling into the range of values that it actually takes as it was reported in the literature...|$|R
