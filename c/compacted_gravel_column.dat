The research reported in this paper elaborates the effectiveness in dissipating seismic pore pressures of a gravel bed and relief well system using <b>gravel</b> <b>columns</b> in a case study in Cilacap, Indonesia. Seismic pore pressure generation was analyzed using commonly available methods in liquefaction analysis. The evaluated pore pressures in the sand layer and <b>gravel</b> <b>columns</b> were used in a 2 D dissipation analysis using finite-difference consolidation equation solutions. The results of this study showed that a simple and cost-effective relief well and gravel bed or strip system can effectively dissipate excess pore pressures in the sand layer and <b>gravel</b> <b>columns</b> to a maximum residual pore pressure below 40 %, thus reducing liquefaction potential as well as protecting the foundations in the sand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The design {{conception}} of composite liners {{consisting of a}} geomembrane(GM), geosynthetic clay liners(GCLs) and <b>compacted</b> <b>gravel</b> soils for landfill is presented based on the climate characteristic, gravel soils material storage in abundance, and GCLs having been exported {{all over the world}} for various applications. The analyses results suggested that the capacity to resist the collapse of wetting-drying and freezing-thawing, long-term barrier performance, and the general sliding stability of barrier system are enhanced obviously by using GCLs/GM as barrier and displacing clay by gravel soils as protector in this paper. It will be plausible as effective design for the barrier system of landfill under wet-dry and freeze-thaw alternating cycles in northwest China...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{transport}} of pesticides to groundwater {{is assumed to}} be impacted by flow processes and geochemical interactions occurring in the vadose zone. In this study, the {{transport of}} S-metolachlor (SMOC) and its two metabolites ESA-metolachlor (MESA) and OXA-metolachlor (MOXA) in vadose zone materials of a glaciofluvial aquifer is studied at laboratory scale. Column experiments are used to study the leaching of a conservative tracer (bromide) and SMOC, MESA and MOXA under unsaturated conditions in two lithofacies, a bimodal gravel (Gcm,b) and a sand (S-x). Tracer experiments showed water fractionation into mobile and immobile compartments more pronounced in bimodal <b>gravel</b> <b>columns.</b> In both lithofacies columns, SMOC outflow is delayed (retardation factor > 2) and mass balance reveals depletion (mass balance of 0. 59 and 0. 77 in bimodal gravel and sand, respectively). However, complete mass elution associated with retardation factors close to unity shows that there is no adsorption of MESA and MOXA in either lithofacies. SMOC transport is characterized by non-equilibrium sorption and sink term in both bimodal <b>gravel</b> and sand <b>columns.</b> Batch experiments carried out using agitation times consistent with column water residence times confirmed a time-dependence of SMOC sorption and high adsorption rates (> 80 %) of applied concentrations. Desorption experiments confirm the irreversibility of {{a major part of the}} SMOC adsorption onto particles, corresponding to the sink term in columns. In the bimodal <b>gravel</b> <b>column,</b> SMOC adsorption occurs mainly on reactive particles in contact with mobile water because of flow regionalization whereas in the sand column, there is pesticide diffusion to the immobile water. Such results clearly show that sorption mechanisms in the vadose zone solids below the soil are both solute and contact-time-dependent and are impacted by hydrodynamic conditions. The more rapid transport of MESA and MOXA to the aquifer would be controlled mainly by water flow through the unsaturated zone whereas SMOC transport is retarded by sorption processes within the vadose zone...|$|R
25|$|By 2003, {{two-thirds of}} the city's {{streetcar}} tracks were in poor condition as the older track was poorly built using unwelded rail attached to untreated wooden ties lying on loose gravel. The result was street trackage falling apart quickly requiring digging up everything after 10–15 years. Thus, the TTC started to rebuild tracks using a different technique. With the new technique, concrete is poured over <b>compacted</b> <b>gravel,</b> and the ties are placed in another bed of concrete, which is topped by more concrete to embed rail clips and rubber-encased rails. The resulting rail is more stable and quieter with less vibration. The new tracks are expected to last 25 years after which only the top concrete layer needs to be removed in order to replace worn rails.|$|R
