Such loans have no place in the conventional <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> based on Haugen (1950) or Weinreich (1953), and research on loan word theory and phonology generally overlooks them. The classic East Asian phenomenon is discussed and a framework is proposed to describe its mechanism. It is argued that graphic loans are more than just 'spelling pronunciations', because they are a systematic and widespread process, independent of but not inferior to phonological borrowing. The framework is then expanded to cover a range of other cases of borrowing between languages to show that graphic loans are not a uniquely East Asian phenomenon, and therefore need to be considered as a major category of loan...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop a model which allowed banks to measure home loan risk and determine prices accordingly. A survey among banks revealed: 1. belief that the home loan market is more risky than 5 years ago 2. belief that lending in the "black" market is riskier than lending in the "white" market 3. no model is used which allows risk-measurement for the purpose of home loan pricing 4. mixed feeling as to the value of the proposed model - value, to a large extent, would depend on flexibility.

Both causes {{had to be in}} place before the crisis could take place.

40|$|The main aim of {{a credit}} scoring {{model is the}} <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loan</b> {{applicants}} into two classes, reliable and non-reliable customers, {{on the basis of}} their potential capability to keep up with their repayments. Nowadays, credit scoring models are increasingly in demand, due to the consumer credit growth. Such models are usually designed on the basis <b>of</b> the past <b>loan</b> applications and used to evaluate the new ones. Their definition represents an hard challenge for different reasons, the most important of which is the imbalanced class distribution of data (i. e., the number of default cases is much smaller than that of the non-default cases), and this reduces the effectiveness of the most widely used approaches (e. g., neural network, random forests, and so on). The Linear Dependence Based (LDB) approach proposed in this paper offers a twofold advantage: it evaluates a new loan application on the basis of the linear dependence of its vector representation in the context of a matrix composed by the vector representation of the non-default applications history, thus by using only a class of data, overcoming the imbalanced class distribution issue; furthermore, it does not exploit the defaulting loans, allowing us to operate in a proactive manner, by addressing also the cold-start problem. We validate our approach on two real-world data sets characterized by a strong unbalanced distribution of data, by comparing its performance with that of one of the best state-of-the-art approach: random forests...|$|R

The failures of the smaller banks (those with less than $ 1 billion in assets) in these states were largely driven by credit losses on commercial real estate (CRE) loans. The failed banks also had often pursued aggressive growth strategies using nontraditional, riskier funding sources and exhibited weak underwriting and credit administration practices. Fair value accounting also has been cited as a potential contributor to bank failures, but between 2007 and 2011 fair value accounting losses in general {{did not appear to}} be a major contributor, as over two-thirds of small failed banks' assets were not subject to fair value accounting.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} utilizes empirical {{methods to}} shed light on the current debate over whether to adopt fair value accounting for loans held for long term. Proponents <b>of</b> fair valuing <b>loans</b> argue that reporting loans at their fair values enhances the overall transparency of financial reporting. In contrast, opponents are against applying fair value accounting to loans because fair values cannot be measured reliably in the case <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> held for long term. Therefore, the key question here is whether loan fair values are sufficiently reliable to provide more relevant and transparent information compared to traditional measurements <b>of</b> <b>loans.</b> To explore this, I compare fair value disclosures <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> under Statement <b>of</b> Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (SFAS 107), Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, with traditional measurements <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> reported on balance sheets. More specifically, this study asks two research questions; (i) whether loan fair values provide more relevant information about future loan losses compared to traditional measurements <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> and (ii) whether banks intentionally manage their fair value estimates <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> when they are financially distressed. SFAS 107 mandates the disclosure of fair values for financial instruments with the objective of providing investors with more relevant information about firms' future cash flows. However, the results show that fair value measurements <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> explained variation in future loan losses, which capture cash flows from loans, less than traditional cost-based measurements <b>of</b> <b>loans.</b> In addition, I find evidence suggesting that financially distressed banks overstated the fair values <b>of</b> their <b>loan</b> portfolios and that fair values <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> in the aggregate lagged considerably behind the market values <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> during the recent credit crisis. Overall, my results suggest that fair value disclosures in bank loan portfolios contain relatively less information about future cash flows because they are measured unreliably and they suffer from a similar lack of timeliness as reported carrying values...|$|R
