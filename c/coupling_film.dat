40|$|The {{stability}} of photoelectrochemical cells based on chemically deposited CdS/CdSe <b>coupled</b> <b>films</b> has been exam-ined. Changes in surface {{structure and composition}} of coated and uncoated CdS 250 /CdSe <b>coupled</b> <b>films</b> as well as CdSe films have been examined by atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The superior stability at short times of the coupled system, compared to CdSe, {{is related to the}} increase in the hexagonal character (stronger bonding) and the small-er recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers. At large operation times, the lower {{stability of}} the coupled system is related to band opening, which increases the oxidation rates of the passivating Se/S layer. The recrystallization illu-minated CdSe photoanodes, and <b>coupled</b> <b>films</b> working in the dark {{can be explained by the}} presence of surface states and back reactions. Stable short-circuit currents were obtained with <b>coupled</b> <b>films</b> coated with a thin layer (350 A) of ZnO. It is likely that oxidation and redeposition of the protective ZnO film competes for hole consumption. The rough morphol-ogy of the coated photoelectrodes correlates to a substantial increase in surface area that resembles ZnO particulate film electrodes sensitized by CdSe and CdS.

40|$|Damages of {{metallic}} aircraft {{structures that}} occur during manufacturing, assembly and in service require local repair. Especially with current service-life extensions of ageing aircraft fleets, {{the importance of}} such repair methods is increasing. Typically, the repair of smaller damages on aluminium fuselage or wing skins is done by riveting a patch onto the flawed structure. However, the use of rivets reduces {{the strength of the}} structure and promotes fatigue. Joining the patch by adhesive bonding would not only offer more homogenous load distribution and weight savings, but even an increase of structural integrity. Metal adhesive bonding is commonly used in aeronautics, but requires elaborated surface treatments of the adherends, employing hazardous chemicals like chromates, due to the high durability demands. Furthermore, these treatments are usually tank processes that are not suitable for local repairs. Hence, there is a strong need for locally applicable surface preparation methods that allow safe and reliable adhesive bonding of primary aircraft structures. / The aim of this thesis is to assess the – still emerging – method of atmospheric pressure plasma deposition of silicon (Si) containing compounds concerning its suitability as surface preparation for adhesive bonding of aluminium aerostructures. Atmospheric plasma deposition is not yet used in the aircraft industry, and the knowledge on functionality of this technology concerning bonding of aluminium parts is limited. / Moreover, the durability requirements of the aircraft industry greatly exceed the standards in other industries. Hence, special attention is paid to a thorough analysis of the key characteristics of the deposited coupling films and their effectiveness in terms of adhesion promotion as well as joint durability under particularly hostile conditions. In order to do so, the altering mechanisms of the treated joints and the behaviour of the coupling films during accelerated ageing will be investigated in detail {{for the first time in}} this thesis. Furthermore, the influence of the aluminium surface pre-treatment (i. e. topography and oxide properties of the substrate) on the overall joint performance after <b>coupling</b> <b>film</b> deposition is thoroughly examined. Based on these findings, the surface preparation is optimised, and a process is developed to achieve maximal joint performance. / As alternative local surface treatments prior to adhesive bonding, solution derived deposition of silane and sol-gel films have already been widely investigated and can be considered as reference, even though these techniques are rarely used in civil aeronautics. The knowledge on their effectiveness and capabilities in corrosive atmosphere is still very limited. Therefore, all analyses of degradation mechanisms are conducted for both plasma deposition and wet-chemical reference treatments to reveal the differences and communalities of the two Si-based coupling films. Physical and chemical analysis of the films, the oxides and the interfaces reveal differing, but interdependent failure mechanisms that are inhibited differently by the individual coupling films. / Using the optimum deposition parameters, plasma films of only several nanometres in thickness significantly enlarge the corrosion resistance of bonded joints, reaching almost the level of anodising treatments with several micrometres thick oxides and strongly outperforming solution derived silane treatments. However, plasma film performance is found to be largely dependent on the precursor selection. With plasma deposition of 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, which has not been reported before, highest joint stability is achieved. Moreover, it is discovered that the properties of plasma and solution derived silane based films are complementary. It is shown that an optimised combined plasma and wet-chemical treatment process provides even superior resistance to bondline corrosion than state-of-the-art anodising techniques...|$|E
