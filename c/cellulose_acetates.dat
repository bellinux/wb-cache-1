40|$|Cellulose acetate {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} esters of cellulose. Depending on the way it has been processed cellulose acetate can be used for great varies of applications (e. g. for films, membranes or fibers). The properties of the applied <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> are very important for these applications. A special field for using cellulose acetate is the synthesis of porous, spherical particles, so called cellulose beads. Different types of technical <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> were used and their ability to form such cellulose beads was characterized. First the different types of <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> were characterized by means of solubility; turbidity and degree of substitution. In addition the molar mass and the distribution of substituents along the polymeric chain were analyzed. Next, the cellulose beads were synthesized within an emulsion process using these different <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates.</b> Then the properties (particle size, porosity, morphology) of the cellulose beads were determined. Finally, the relationship between the characteristic of <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> and properties of cellulose beads was investigated...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{cellulose}} obtained from sisal, {{which is a}} source of rapid growth, was used. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> were produced in heterogeneous medium, using acetic anhydride as esterifying agent and iodine as catalyst, to check if the procedure described in the literature for commercial cellulose also is adequate to sisal cellulose. The results indicated that iodine is an excellent catalyst to obtain sisal <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates,</b> but the reaction is so fast as described in the literature when, instead of sisal, lower average molar weight cellulose (microcrystalline) is used. The crystallinity index (I(c)) of sisal <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> diminished compared to sisal cellulose, but there was no direct correlation between their degree of substitution (DS) and I(c). Probably acetyl groups were introduced more homogeneously along the short chains of microcrystalline cellulose, when compared to sisal cellulose, and then for microcrystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> the Ic decreases as DS increases. Using the linear correlation that was found between degree of substitution (DS) and time reaction is possible to control the DS of sisal <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates,</b> considering a large interval of degrees of substitution (0. 3 - 2. 8) ...|$|E

30|$|A {{plasticization}} {{method for}} <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> (CAs) {{has been developed}} {{that is based on}} the reaction with dibasic acid anhydrides and monoepoxides during the melting processing. As a continuation of the discussion in the previous report, additional evidence is presented for the role of grafting oligoesters onto <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> to prevent the bleeding of homo-oligoesters from the inside of molded articles to their surface. Based on these results, a method for enhancing the amount of grafting has been pursued by varying the combination of dibasic acid anhydrides and monoepoxides. The resulting reactive meltprocessing method allows preparation of biodegradable cellulosic plastics using practical process conditions. Higher biodegradability has been found for the oligoester-grafted CAs than for the unmodified parent CAs.|$|E
