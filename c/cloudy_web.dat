5000|$|Spider-Verse is {{explored}} {{again in}} the fourth season of Ultimate Spider-Man in the [...] "Return to the Spider-Verse" [...] arc. Slightly different storyline, yet somewhat similar to Shattered Dimensions game storyline, it all started from Miles from Home where the 2010s animated Spider-Man shatters the Siege of Perilous across the universe to prevent the alternate 2010s animated Green Goblin from destroying the universe, leading the alternate Goblin and Miles Morales (who goes by Kid Arachnid in the main 2010s animated universe only) are currently stuck on the prime 2010s animated universe. When an evil Spider-Man known as Wolf-Spider (a completely evil Peter Parker from the evil dimension) has the Perilous' fragment and came across the universe to rule all universe, Madame Web, Iron Fist and Doctor Strange sends both Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid to find the missing piece of Perilous before Wolf Spider does, while also not just encountering the other old Spider-Men they've encountered and allied with like Spider-Man Noir, also the new Spider-Men like Blood Spider (an alternate Peter Parker from the world where vampires overruns almost entire Earth but New York in endless <b>cloudy</b> days), <b>Web</b> Beard (an alternate Peter Parker from the world {{where he is a}} pirate and has an anthropomorphic creature similar to Spider-Ham's universe), Web Slinger (an alternate Peter Parker from the old west world where he is an outlaw, and his world's Uncle Ben revealed to be alive, but brainwashed by their world's Doctor Octopus as a Phantom Rider), and, Spider-Gwen (who unlike her original Spider-Gwen counterpart is actually come from a same home as Miles' homeworld and is a human with a technology based Spider-Powers). As Wolf Spider already capture all Spider-Men's good life-force to empower himself with the power of Perilous, Spider-Man have a plan to let himself being absorbed by the Wolf Spider, to overload Wolf-Spider to be shattered due to amount of good Spiders' life-forces may poison the evil Spiders like Wolf-Spider, with his body is now trapped in other dimensions he cannot escape like what happened when alternate Goblin punched Baron Mordo by using the Perilous on him, and all the life-forces of every Spiders he absorbed were restored back to all Spiders from different dimensions.|$|R
