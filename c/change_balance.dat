[...] Sandra Loosemore for CBS Sports in October 1999 — :"The ISU is sending mixed messages to skaters by rewarding other kinds of lifts with a high element of danger, such as one-handed lifts, lifts where the skaters continually <b>change</b> <b>balance,</b> grip and position, and lifts with acrobatic dismounts where the woman is flipped or swung as she is lowered. In addition, while the ISU might have banned an additional class of lifts where the woman is carried or swung in an upside-down position where she would be most vulnerable to head injury, this proposal from the ISU medical advisors was summarily rejected at the last ISU Congress." ...|$|E

She doesn't really need grounding, but it helped my performance to <b>change</b> <b>balance</b> by changing my body. It was fun to play." [...] —Sveen on how pregnancy affected her performance of Ricky In late April 2014, Sveen started filming scenes for a pregnancy storyline. Ricky was [...] "over the moon" [...] when she learned she was {{pregnant with}} Brax's child. However, before she could tell him, she learned that Casey had been shot and killed. Ricky felt unable to tell Brax the news and she confided in Phoebe Nicholson (Isabella Giovinazzo), who urged her to be happy about the development before she worries about anyone else. In order to portray Ricky's pregnancy, Sveen was required to wear a prosthetic pregnancy suit for several months. The suit represented five different stages of the baby's growth. The storyline was played out over eight to nine months in real time, and Sveen commented that it felt [...] "like the world's longest pregnancy. It's gone on for about a year since the time we started shooting." [...] Sveen carried out research at the Royal Hospital for Women and spoke to a midwife about how Ricky's behaviour would be affected by the various stages of pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for remote sensing of aerosol absorption from satellite {{images of the}} earth's surface. The method {{is based on the}} measurement of the change in the upward radiances between a clear and a hazy day over a varying surface reflectance. For a zero <b>change</b> <b>balance</b> between brightening due to scattering and darkening due to absorption and scattering is reached. This balance is utilized via a radiative transfer model to derive the aerosol single-scattering albedo. A sensitivity study is performed, and the method is tested against laboratory measurements. It is suggested that for the case of haze introduced on top of an existing background aerosol and with a fair estimate of the scattering phase function, the error in the remotely sensed single-scattering albedo is in the range of 0. 03 - 0. 05. The main errors in the method arise from variations in the surface reflectance between the clear and the hazy days, uncertainty in the scattering phase function, and variation of the aerosol and gaseous absorption between these two days. If the satellite calibration varies with time, the measurements of single-scattering albedo can be substantially affected...|$|E
40|$|Dysfunction of {{cervical}} receptors in neck disorders {{has been}} shown to lead to disturbances in postural stability. The neck torsion manoeuvre used in the smooth pursuit neck torsion (SPNT) test is thought to be a specific measure of neck afferent dysfunction on eye movement in those with neck pain. This study aimed to determine whether neck torsion could <b>change</b> <b>balance</b> responses in those with persistent whiplash-associated disorders (WADs). Twenty subjects with persistent WAD and 20 healthy controls aged between 18 and 50 years stood on a computerised force plate with eyes closed in comfortable stance under 5 conditions: neutral head, head turned to left and right and neck torsion to left and right. Root mean square (rms) amplitude of sway was measured in the anterioreposterior (AP) and medial elateral (ML) directions. The whiplash group had significantly greater rms amplitude in the AP direction following neck torsion compared to the control group (p < 0. 03). The results show that the neck torsion manoeuvre may lead to greater postural deficits in individuals with persistentWAD and provides further evidence of neck torsion to identify abnormal cervical afferent input, as an underlying cause of balance disturbances in WAD. Further research is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Background: Different {{types of}} foot orthoses have been {{prescribed}} {{for patients with}} flatfoot. Results of several {{studies have shown that}} orthoses were able to <b>change</b> <b>balance</b> parameters in people with flatfoot. However, the possible effect of orthosis flexibility on balance has not yet been investigated. Objectives: The aim of the current study was to investigate the immediate effect of a rigid University of California Berkeley Laboratory (UCBL) foot orthosis, a modified foot orthosis, and a normal shoe on the postural sway of people with flexible flatfoot. Study design: Quasi-experimental. Methods: In all, 20 young adults with flatfoot (aged 23. 5 ± 2. 8 years) were invited to participate in this study. The Biodex Stability System was employed to perform standing balance tests under three testing conditions, namely, shoe only, UCBL, and modified foot orthosis. Total, medial-lateral, and anterior-posterior sway were evaluated for each condition. Results: The results of this study revealed no statistical difference in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior stability indices between foot orthoses and shoed conditions. The overall stability index with the UCBL foot orthosis, however, was significantly lower than that with the modified foot orthosis. Conclusion: The UCBL foot orthosis was able to decrease total sway and improve balance in people with flexible flatfoot. Interdisciplinary Division of Biomedical Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on national systems of innovation (NIS) has neglected {{the issue of}} entrepreneurship because of several incompatibilities between the two notions. The Schumpeterian legacy, the current person-centric view of entrepreneurship, and methodological problems related to treating entrepreneurship at the macro-level, have {{made it difficult to}} integrate entrepreneurship into the NIS perspective. At national level it is more appropriate to treat entrepreneurship as a 'property' (dimension) of NIS. In order to link NIS and entrepreneurship we must establish a common conceptual basis. Our argument is that the functional view of NIS and entrepreneurship presents a common basis for such an approach. We develop criteria for the entrepreneurial NIS which we define as being those that can <b>change</b> <b>balance</b> between individual and cooperative entrepreneurship; that enhance both the opportunity and skill aspects of entrepreneurship; and that can balance generation of uncertainty with support to business models and other organisations which pool uncertainty. From the NIS perspective, we explain entrepreneurship as a systemic phenomenon driven by complementarities between technological, market and institutional opportunities. This framework builds on three research traditions in the entrepreneurship/NIS literature (Schumpeterian, Kirznerian and Listian) which jointly form a multi-level, multi-dimensional framework for understanding entrepreneurship from a NIS perspective. This framework could be useful as a heuristic for empirical research on entrepreneurship. Finally, we analyse policies for entrepreneurship and find that they are highly dependent on underlying and previously discussed conceptions of entrepreneurship...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} {{type 2 diabetes}} in older adults is a major health concern, as older adults with diabetes have a two- to threefold risk of injurious falls and physical disability. Although studies {{on the effects of}} Tai Chi on balance and fall prevention have increased over the last two decades, the benefits for older adults with diabetes, specifically for those with impaired somatosensation in the lower extremities, are limited. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of Tai Chi exercise on balance, peripheral somatosensation, and fitness in older adults with type 2 diabetes. The study included eight adults with type 2 diabetes (mean age: 65. 5 years) who participated in an 8 -week Tai Chi intervention. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included foot tactile sense, ankle proprioception, plantar pressure distribution, balance, and fitness. A convenience sample of healthy older adults was included to establish a normal reference for the assessed variables. Following intervention, the older adults with type 2 diabetes showed significant improvements in ankle proprioception and fitness, and decreased plantar pressure in the forefoot. The Tai Chi intervention did not <b>change</b> <b>balance</b> or tactile sensation. The results of this study suggest that Tai Chi practice may contribute to foot health by distributing the plantar pressure away from the ulcer-prone sites in the forefoot. Tai Chi may also reduce the fall risk in older adults with diabetes by improving the ankle proprioceptive sense, which is thought to be an important factor for automatic balance correcting responses. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{reported}} individuals typically perform well on a task when enhanced expectancy was provided prior to task performance. It has also been reported people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are especially susceptible to pre-task placebo cuing and suggestion. Evidence of this susceptibility has been previously demonstrated through brain imaging studies and with demonstration by individuals with PD improved balance performance. Objective: This {{study was designed to}} further previous studies’ results for improved task performance with enhanced expectancy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate if the pre-task verbal delivery of enhanced expectancy, decreased expectancy and no expectancy would affect the performance of individuals with PD during balance tasks. Design: Two groups of individuals (individuals with PD and age/gender matched healthy adults) were randomly assigned to perform three separate balance tasks. One of three randomly assigned expectancies (enhanced, decreased or neutral) was verbally delivered by a researcher to the individual prior to each balance task performance. Methods: Forty-nine subjects (20 females and 29 males, Age 72 ± 7 years) participated, including 24 patients with idiopathic PD (9 females, Age 73 ± 6. 58; 15 males, Age 73 ± 7. 21) and 25 healthy controls (11 females, Age 70. 27 ± 4. 69; 14 males, Age 71. 86 ± 8. 90) without PD. All participants were asked to perform three balance tasks while three randomly assigned verbal cues were given prior to each task. Non-parametric, repeated measures Friedman’s tests were conducted to compare 1) the effects of verbal cues on balance (Limits of Stability, Maze Control and Random Control) for the PD group and the age-and-gender matched control group, and 2) the converted z scores of the three balance tasks among the three verbal conditions in combined PD and control groups. Alpha was set at 0. 05. Results: Friedman’s ANOVAs showed that the usage of enhanced expectancy, decreased expectancy and no expectancy demonstrated no significant difference on balance performance for each of three separate balance tasks or for individuals with PD or without PD (ps≥. 05). Discussion and conclusion: Although the present research study did not present significant results of the main finding, different expectancy instructions prior to a balance task differently <b>change</b> <b>balance</b> performance, this study did imply for continued future research in pre-task expectancy...|$|E
