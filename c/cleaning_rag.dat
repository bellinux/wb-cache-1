40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} project were to identify and compare factors that influence the purchasing decisions of Multifibres’ customers active in each channel. Multifibres manufactures and distributes industrial <b>cleaning</b> <b>rags</b> to three channels or client categories, these being industrial resellers, industrial end-users and the walk-in customers. An extensive literature review revealed that purchasing decisions are influenced by, amongst other factors, the buyer’s role, the internal cognitive processes of the buyer, as well as factors present in the buyer’s business and external environment. An empirical study was conducted utilising in-depth interviews. The most prevalent, emergent themes that buyers attached the greatest weight to when purchasing <b>cleaning</b> <b>rags</b> were: price; quality; service; relationships; and, convenience. These factors were probed, analysed and compared, based on each buyer category’s unique set of characteristics. When motivating their purchasing preferences, resellers emphasised {{the importance of the}} business relationship and trust as being paramount, while end-users viewed price and service as the most important factors. Walk-in customers valued the combination of price and convenience as the most important reasons influencing their purchasing decisions...|$|R
50|$|Fruit flies are {{attracted}} to ripened fruits and vegetables, usually in the kitchen area, but will breed in garbage disposals, empty bottles and cans, wet or damp mops or <b>cleaning</b> <b>rags,</b> and trash containers. The only requirement for these flies to breed is a moist film of fermenting material. Infestations can originate from over-ripened fruits or vegetables that were previously infested, and then brought into the home, or from fruit over-ripening in the home. Since adults can also fly from the outside through screened doors or windows, it can not always be assumed that the product in question was infested before it was brought into the home. The larvae are found on the inside layer of the fruit, directly beneath the skin. If the outer layer of the fruit is removed, {{the rest of the}} fruit can be salvaged. Fruit flies are primarily a nuisance pest.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the navigation for a floor-mopping robot by new navigation algorithm. This algorithm {{is used for}} a robot that design of <b>cleaning</b> with <b>rags.</b> Which it makes a floor-mopping robot improved efficient. We designed the navigation algorithm using the behaviour-based structure to cover a working area {{as much as possible}} without wetting the floor too much. The effectiveness of the algorithm is tested on simulation only. The results indicated that the behaviour-based algorithm provided more completeness while maintaining low energy compared to other methods. We study other navigation algorithm compared with our algorithm. It includes with zigzag, random and our behaviour-based algorithms. From simulation results, I confirm that behaviour-based algorithm is better than zigzag and random algorithms...|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{built as}} a fulling mill in 1527. The {{machinery}} was {{to be made by}} Cranbrook millwright George Jenkyn. The mill was to have two overshot waterheels 7 ft diameter. The contract was signed on the 8 January 1527, with the mill to be completed by May Day. Total cost of the mill was £88 5s 3d. The mill had been converted to a paper mill by 1700. By the 1830s Otham Paper Mill was occupied by the papermakers at Turkey Mill. A paper making machine was installed, but removed to Turkey Mill in 1859, when the mill was converted to house a two engine washer for <b>cleaning</b> and beating <b>rags</b> for use in the papermaking process. The mill was marked on the first 6" [...] Ordnance Survey map.|$|R
