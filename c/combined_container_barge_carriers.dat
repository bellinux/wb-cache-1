40|$|Recent {{research}} on maritime ports hinterlands {{points out the}} relevance of mass ground transport modes such as barge transport for enormous flows of containers to and from harbours, especially when a maritime port {{is located at the}} mouth of a river. Though, the modal share of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport in French maritime ports (9 % of TEU in Le Havre and 5 % in Marseille in 2007) is significantly lower than elsewhere (32 % in Rotterdam and 33 % in Antwerp). Some reports and studies explain the viscosity of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport flows as a result of several factors, generally concentrated around the seaport community. In continuation of previous seminal works, this paper adopts a neo-institutional approach (Williamson, 1985; 1996) of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport to understand how the factors generating this viscosity are managed. Section 2 describes the characteristics of the transaction of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport. Section 3 is devoted to its attributes (asset specificity, frequency, uncertainty). According to Williamson’s (1996) remediableness criterion, the observed governance structure of a given transaction is presumed efficient and aligned to its attributes. Thus, Section 4 deals with observed governance structures of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport chains with a focus on Le Havre, main French container seaport and shows how agents try to limit opportunism in expost haggling over quasi-rents or under-investments. Implementation of a new institutional environment to modify governance structures is analysed, and a comparison with currently implemented governance structures observed i...|$|R

40|$|Lots {{of studies}} have been devoted to shipper's modal choices since Baumol and Vinodt (1970) seminal papers. But, surprisingly, whereas {{institutional}} aspects play a determinant part {{in the structure of}} relationships in every supply chain, they are barely taken into account in academic papers (McGinnis, 1989; Jiang, 1998; Henscher and Puckett, 2005; Brooks et al., 2012), particularly regarding transaction costs. Indeed, shippers' modal choices are often characterised by their inertia (Golicic et al, 2003), which cannot be explained without Transaction Costs Economics (or New Institutional Economics, see Ruester, 2010), as developed by Coase (1937) and Williamson (1985; 1996) seminal works. This paper aims at showing that transaction costs are partially responsible for the low modal share of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport in French maritime ports (9 % of TEU in Le Havre and 5 % in Marseille in 2007). But instead of dealing with the transaction chain of <b>container</b> <b>barging</b> itself (Fischman and Lendjel, 2012), the paper focuses on shipper's decision making process. The paper finds empirical evidence of those costs in ECHO's survey (Guilbault et al., 2008), focusing on shipments involving barging legs in containerized maritime chains.
