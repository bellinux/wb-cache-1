500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot in London by Moe Musa. It was released on 24 December 2012 through Iyanya's official YouTube account. The video commences with footage from the live concert in which he asks the audience: [...] "It's getting really hot in here, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> my shirt off?". Several scenes display the singer loitering around a shopping centre, dancing in a nightclub, and driving around the city at night. He is also shown dancing with various female companions and hugging {{a few of his}} friends. The visual ends with Iyanya drinking vodka around the aforementioned ladies. Boye appreciated the clip and Iyanya for ending the year off right.|$|E
500|$|Victorin Hulot {{is later}} visited by the Prince of Wissembourg, who {{delivers}} news of economic good fortune. The Marshal, {{prior to his}} death, had made arrangements for repayment of the Baron's debts, as well as employment for Adeline in a Catholic charity. Baron Hulot has disappeared, and Adeline spends her free time searching for him in houses of ill repute. She eventually finds him living with a fifteen-year-old courtesan, and begs {{him to return to}} the family. He agrees, but as he climbs into the carriage, Hulot asks: [...] "mais pourrai-je emmener la petite?" [...] ("But <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> the girl?") The Hulot home is reunited for a time, and Bette's fury at their apparent happiness hastens her death. One evening after the funeral, Adeline overhears Hulot seducing a kitchen maid named Agathe. On her deathbed, Adeline delivers her first rebuke to her husband: [...] "ans un moment, tu seras libre, et tu pourras faire une baronne Hulot." [...] ("In a moment, you will be free, and you can make another Baroness Hulot.") Soon after burying his wife, Hulot marries Agathe.|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry said of Christianity, [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> seriously a God-image that {{requires}} that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That {{sounds to me}} like a very insecure personality." [...] At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which was to have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God Thing. Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry's views were [...] "a far cry from atheism". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: [...] "It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God." [...] He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism [...] "a very beautiful religion. An art form." [...] However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a [...] "substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.|$|E

2500|$|She always {{claimed that}} she could not bestow {{creativity}} onto her students and {{that she could}} only help them to become intelligent musicians who understood the craft of composition. [...] "I can't provide anyone with inventiveness, nor <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> it away; I can simply provide the liberty to read, to listen, to see, to understand." [...] Only inspiration could make the difference between a well-made piece and an artistic one. She believed that the desire to learn, to become better, was all that was required to achieve – always provided the right amount of work was put in. She would quote the examples of Rameau (who wrote his first opera at fifty), Wojtowicz (who became a concert pianist at thirty-one), and Roussel (who had no professional access to music till he was twenty-five), as counter-arguments to the idea that great artists always develop out of gifted children.|$|E
