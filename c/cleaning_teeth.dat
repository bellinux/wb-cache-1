40|$|Background: Impact of {{two methods}} of dental health {{education}} (DHE) on knowledge {{and practices of}} primary school children {{in a rural area}} regarding oral care was planned to be studied. Materials and Methods: Study population comprised of 199 primary school children aged 10 - 13 years in rural field practice area of a medical college. After collecting baseline data, students were allocated into two groups by block randomization using variable blocks. DHE with educational pamphlets and demonstrations was given to both groups. In addition, the intervention group was also shown videos showing correct oral health practices. Data were proposed to be collected at 3 and 6 months from baseline for impact evaluation. The results at 3 months postintervention are being presented. Results: The results after 3 months of intervention found significant difference in the impact on: (a) Practices regarding method of <b>cleaning</b> <b>teeth</b> (P < 0. 001), (b) knowledge on best method of <b>cleaning</b> <b>teeth</b> (P < 0. 001), (c) reason for regular brushing of teeth (P < 0. 001), and (d) requirement to clean teeth after eating something sweet (P < 0. 001) in favor of group receiving additional intervention.

40|$|Introduction: The {{relationship}} between oral health and tooth retention is complex. Dental caries and periodontal diseases {{are the main}} reasons for tooth loss; the contribution of other modifying factors such as cultural beliefs, socioeconomic characteristics, access to dental care, and dental practitioner's philosophy of treatment may also influence the decision to extract teeth. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the prevalence and risk indicators of tooth loss in an adult population visiting community health centers (CHCs), Nellore district. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult patients visiting the outpatient wards of 10 CHCs which were selected by multistage random sampling. A total of 450 patients in the age range of 35 – 74 years were surveyed using a structured questionnaire followed by clinical examination. Questionnaire was regarding age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), smoking habits, dental visiting patterns, and oral hygiene practices. Clinical examination was performed using dentition status from the WHO pro forma and loss of attachment (LOA) with LOA Index. Results: Overall prevalence of tooth loss was 50. 39 %. The highest prevalence of tooth loss was reported in 65 – 74 years old age group (96. 18 %) and upper lower class. Males had highest tooth loss prevalence (64. 29 %) with mean tooth loss of 3. 08 ± 3. 59. Multiple logistic regression done to assess the impact of various independent variables on tooth loss revealed that age, gender, SES, habits of <b>cleaning</b> <b>teeth,</b> frequency of brushing teeth, time of brushing, dietary habits, visit to dentist, dental caries, and LOA had a significant impact on tooth loss. Conclusion: Age, gender, SES, habits of <b>cleaning</b> <b>teeth,</b> frequency of brushing teeth, time of brushing, dietary habits, visit to dentist, dental caries, and LOA were identified as risk indicators for tooth loss among adult people visiting community health centers in Andhra Pradesh...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{analysis}} {{the dependence}} of oral health diseases i. e. dental caries and periodontal disease on considering the number of risk factors through the applications of logistic regression model. Method: The cross sectional study involves a systematic random sample of 1760 permanent dentition aged between 18 - 40 years in Dharwad, Karnataka, India. Dharwad is situated in North Karnataka. The mean age was 34. 26 ± 7. 28. The risk factors of dental caries and periodontal disease were established by multiple logistic regression model using SPSS statistical software. Results: The factors like frequency of brushing, timings of <b>cleaning</b> <b>teeth</b> and type of toothpastes are significant persistent predictors of dental caries and periodontal disease. The log likelihood value of full model is – 1013. 1364 and Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) is 1. 1752 as compared to reduced regression model are - 1019. 8106 and 1. 1748 respectively for dental caries. But, the log likelihood value of full model is – 1085. 7876 and AIC is 1. 2577 followed by reduced regression model are - 1019. 8106 and 1. 1748 respectively for periodontal disease. The area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the dental caries is 0. 7509 (full model) and 0. 7447 (reduced model); the ROC for the periodontal disease is 0. 6128 (full model) and 0. 5821 (reduced model). Conclusions: The frequency of brushing, timings of <b>cleaning</b> <b>teeth</b> and type of toothpastes are main signifi cant risk factors of dental caries and periodontal disease. The fitting performance of reduced logistic regression model is slightly a better fit as compared to full logistic regression model in identifying the these risk factors for both dichotomous dental caries and periodontal disease...|$|E

Methods: The Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) index was assessed in 152 adults aged 25 – 35  years at baseline (T 0), 6  months after bonding (T 1), and 12  months after bonding (T 2). Participants were randomly divided into two groups: CA group (participants treated with clear-aligner) and a control group (FOA group; participants treated with FOA). Baseline malocclusion severity was assessed using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} sociodemographic variables and OIDP scores at baseline between the two groups. Significant changes in OIDP total and subscale scores were observed while wearing FOA: OIDP total score and subscale scores of eating, <b>cleaning</b> <b>teeth,</b> smiling, and social relation at T 1 and T 2 were significantly higher than at baseline (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01). However, only OIDP total score was significantly increased at T 1 compared to the baseline in the CA group. OIDP total score and subscale scores of eating, <b>cleaning</b> <b>teeth,</b> smiling, and social relation were significantly higher in patients wearing FOA than in patients wearing clear-aligner at T 1 and T 2 (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Patients wearing clear-aligner have fewer impacts on daily life than those wearing FOA during treatment, and have no significant changes in OIPD subscale scores at 12  months. FOA therapy significantly impacts daily performance in adult patients during treatment. Keywords: clear-aligner, fixed orthodontic appliance, OIDP, quality of life, oral healt...|$|E
