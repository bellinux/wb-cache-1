40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. During {{the past twenty years}} there has been considerable interest in developing the technology for manufacturing engineering articles from sheet moulding compound (SMC) by compression moulding. Some of the problems with this technology are associated with the flow of SMC during moulding. This research work proposes methods for characterising the rheological behaviour of SMC and predicting the shape of charges for moulding articles free of weld-lines without substantially altering the initial fibre orientation of the matrix. The theoretical development'of the charge shape prediction procedure for moulding symmetrical and unsymmetrical plates includes a mathematical model of the compression flow process. which is used to determine flow front development, and mould cavity pressure and velocity distributions. The mathematical model assumes a Newtonian flow behaviour. An instrumented mould was designed. manufactured and used to test the mathematical model of the compression flow process. The analysis of the experimental work includes: moulding conditions (such as mould cavity pressure, platen displacement and ram-force); fibre orientation measurements (using X-ray techniques); quantification of fibre glass distribution by chemical methods; and material mechanical properties (e. g. tensile strength). There was good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results for moulded symmetrical and unsymmetrical plates. A theoretical and experimental analysis of the rheological behaviour of 5 MC was carried out as a second stage of the research work to test the validity of the Newtonian flow assumption. The work analyses squeeze flow of SMC discs with the aim of obtaining {{a better understanding of the}} basic rheological behaviour of SMC during compression moulding. The theoretical analysis treats the SMC as a viscoelastic material having an equation of state with equal viscous. elastic and yield strain components. The time variation of compression force when squeezing the SMC discs between two parallel plates (one fixed and one mobile) has been derived from the equation of state. The values of the elastic, viscous and yield components were determined by using a least-squares method of curve fitting to the experimental results. The last part of the research work includes the application of the charge shape prediction procedure to mould an engineering article under industrial <b>compression-moulding</b> conditions. ·The results of this practical application of the theory are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Biodegradable {{polymers}} such as PLGA {{have been}} used {{in a wide range of}} biomedical applications due to their hydrolytic degradation and biocompatibility. The mechanical performance of biodegradable polymers during degradation is strongly influenced by the degradation rate. The size dependent degradation mechanisms in these polymers lead to different degradation rates which make significant differences in the mechanical properties of different sized medical device components. Therefore, a clear understanding of the degradation behaviour and the mechanical performance of PLGA material during degradation is required. In this thesis, the mechanical properties of PLGA materials prepared by solvent casting and compression moulding are evaluated using the nanoindentation technique. The measured elastic modulus and hardness are strongly depth dependent for both forms of the material, for indentations less than 3000 nm. The mechanical properties of PLGA material are significantly influenced by the material processing method. The solvent-cast material is more elastically compliant and plastically softer than the <b>compression-moulded</b> material and it also shows lower work hardening characteristics. Changes in the mechanical properties of PLGA material under simulated physiological degradation conditions are evaluated. The relationship between the changes in the molecular weight and the Youngâs modulus of PLGA material is established. It is shown that the PLGA mechanical properties during degradation do not decrease until the number average molecular weight of the polymer chains reaches a critical molecular weight of 1500 g mol- 1. The experimental observations demonstrate that there is no significant difference in the degradation rate and the changes in the mechanical properties of PLGA thicker than 120 Î¼m. It is shown that the material processing methods considered here do not have a significant effect on the degradation rate and the mechanical performance of PLGA material. A computational modelling framework is developed to predict the degradation behaviour and the changes in the mechanical properties of PLGA material during degradation. The degradation behaviour is predicted using both analytical and numerical solutions. When applied to PLGA films, semi-analytical solution cannot capture the differences in degradation rates for films of thickness above 25 Î¼m. When applied to PLGA scaffolds, architecture of the scaffold does not have a significant influence on the degradation rate, but it determines the initial stiffness of the scaffold. The size of the scaffold strut controls the degradation rate and the mechanical collapse. A critical length scale due to competition between diffusion of degradation products and autocatalytic degradation is determined to be in the range 2 - 100 Î¼m. Below this range, slower homogenous degradation occurs; however, for larger samples faster autocatalytic degradation occurs. The experimental observations for the degradation rate and the mechanical performance of PLGA materials support the computational modelling predictions. In conclusion, the use of experimental testing methods and computational modelling in this thesis has led to an improved understanding of the mechanical performance of solvent-cast and <b>compression-moulded</b> PLGA materials with different thicknesses during degradation. 2017 - 04 - 2...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{material}} thickness and processing method on the degradation rate and {{the changes in the}} mechanical properties of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) material during simulated physiological degradation were investigated. Two types of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) materials were considered: 0. 12 Â¿mm solvent-cast films and 1 Â¿mm <b>compression-moulded</b> plates. The experimental results presented in this study were compared to the experimental results of Shirazi et al. (Acta Biomaterialia 10 (11) : 4695 - 703, 2014) for 0. 25 Â¿mm solvent-cast films. These experimental observations were used to validate the computational modelling predictions of Shirazi et al. (J Mech Behav Biomed Mater 54 : 48 - 59, 2016) on critical diffusion length scale and also to refine the model parameters. The specific material processing methods considered here did not {{have a significant effect on}} the degradation rate and the changes in mechanical properties during degradation; however, they influenced the initial molecular weight and they determined the stiffness and hardness of the poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) material. The experimental observations strongly supported the computational modelling predictions that showed no significant difference in the degradation rate and the changes in the elastic modulus of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) films for thicknesses larger than 100 Â¿Â¿m.
