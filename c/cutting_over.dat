In June 2013 the company was finally liquidated and ceased operations after 25 years.|$|E
25|$|Tissue {{preparation}} or fixation {{is essential}} for the preservation of cell morphology and tissue architecture. Inappropriate or prolonged fixation may significantly diminish the antibody binding capability. Many antigens can be successfully demonstrated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. However, some antigens will not survive even moderate amounts of aldehyde fixation. Under these conditions, tissues should be rapidly fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut with a cryostat. The disadvantages of frozen sections include poor morphology, poor resolution at higher magnifications, difficulty in <b>cutting</b> <b>over</b> paraffin sections, and the need for frozen storage. Alternatively, vibratome sections do not require the tissue to be processed through organic solvents or high heat, which can destroy the antigenicity, or disrupted by freeze thawing. The disadvantage of vibratome sections is that the sectioning process is slow and difficult with soft and poorly fixed tissues, and that chatter marks or vibratome lines are often apparent in the sections.|$|E

40|$|During 1988 and 1989, over 200 {{pearl millet}} [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. ] by napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum) hybrids were {{developed}} by SADC/ICRISAT in Zimbabwe to provide superior pearl millet by napier hybrids especially for semi-arid rainfed regions. Eighteen such pearl millet by napier hybrids (SDPN), 20 napiers (SDPP), and two checks, Bana grass (pearl millet x napier hybrid), and Green Gold Harare (Panicum sp.) were evaluated at Aisleby (irrigated) and Lucydale (rainfed) locations during 1990 / 92. There were six <b>cuttings</b> (<b>over</b> 12 months) at Aisleby, and seven <b>cuttings</b> (<b>over</b> 16 months) at Lucydale. Among pearl millet by napier hybrids, SDPN 29 produced the highest total dry matter (DM) yield <b>over</b> <b>cuttings</b> at both locations. SDPN 29 produced 38 t total DM yield ha- 1 (38 % more than the best check, Bana grass) at Aisleby, and 12. 5 t total DM yield ha- 1 at Lucydale (39 % more than the best check, Bana grass). Based on green fodder yield, DM yield, crude protein %, and in-vitro DM digestibility, two hybrids, SDPN 3 and SDPN 29 were selected and the cuttings were supplied to several hundred farmers in Zimbabwe. Among napiers, SDPP 19 and SDPP 10 were the highest yielding entries. During the dry period (April to October) at Lucydale, both SDPNs and SDPPs plants continued to grow and some entries produced DM yields of over 600 kg ha- 1 per cut. This is the period when the forage is most needed. There {{were no significant differences}} for total DM yield <b>over</b> <b>cuttings</b> between highest yielding SDPP and highest yielding SDPN at both locations. The variation in napiers for different traits suggests that the napiers can be improved for forage quality and yield...|$|R

500|$|Barrymore decided next {{to star in}} Hamlet on stage, with Arthur Hopkins directing. They {{spent six}} months preparing, <b>cutting</b> <b>over</b> 1,250 lines from the text as they did so, and Barrymore opted to play Hamlet as [...] "a man's man", {{according}} to Norden. Barrymore later described his Hamlet as a [...] "normal, healthy, lusty young fellow who simply got into a mess that was too thick for him... {{he was a great}} fencer, an athlete, a man who led an active, healthy life. How can you make a sickly half-wit out of a man like that?" [...] Barrymore again used Carrington as a vocal coach; rehearsals started in October, and the play opened on November 16. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. Woollcott, writing for the New York Herald, opined that it was [...] "an evening that will be memorable {{in the history of the}} American theater". while John Corbin, the drama critic for The New York Times, agreed, writing that [...] "in all likelihood we have a new and a lasting Hamlet". The reviewer for Brooklyn Life stated that Barrymore had [...] "doubtless won the right to be called the greatest living American tragedian". In 1963, Orson Welles said that Barrymore was the best Hamlet he had seen, describing the character as [...] "not so much princely– he was a man of genius who happened to be a prince, and he was tender, and virile, and witty, and dangerous".|$|E
2500|$|Metal cutting [...] generates heat due to {{friction}} and energy lost deforming the material. The surrounding air has low thermal conductivity (conducts heat poorly) meaning it {{is a poor}} coolant. Ambient air cooling is sometimes adequate for light cuts and low duty cycles typical of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) or hobbyist work. Production work requires heavy <b>cutting</b> <b>over</b> long time periods and typically produces more heat than air cooling can remove. Rather than pausing production while the tool cools, using liquid coolant removes significantly more heat more rapidly, and can also speed cutting and reduce {{friction and}} tool wear.|$|E

40|$|Adventitious {{roots are}} {{distinct}} from primary and lateral roots in that adventitious roots develop ectopically from aboveground organs. Whole-genome microarrays in poplar provided the first {{glimpse into the}} gene networks that are remodeled in cells prior {{to the development of}} adventitious roots. In the first 24 hr after removal of stem <b>cuttings,</b> <b>over</b> one-half of the transcripts encoded in the genome showed evidence of differential abundance in the cells that will eventually give rise to adventitious roots. Major processes that were regulated appear related to physiological adaptation of the cutting to acute loss of water and nutrients as well as hormone signaling. Comparative transcriptome analysis of genotypes that differ in their competence to form adventitious roots may be a generally useful strategy to identify genes that regulate adventitious rooting efficiency...|$|R

He lived in a mud hovel which he and Tirzah had built for themselves on the border land, and where they kept a tall, thin, smooth-haired dog, with a grey coat, a white waistcoat, a long nose and tail, and blue eyes, which gave him a peculiarly sinister expression of countenance, {{and he had a}} habit of leaping up and planting his fore feet on the gate, growling, so that Dora and Sophy were very much afraid of him, and no one except Mr Harford had ever attempted to effect an entrance into the cottage. It was pretty well understood that Joe Todd and his lurcher carried on a business as poachers, and Tirzah going about with clothes'-pegs, rush baskets, birch brooms, and in their season with blackberries, whortleberries, or plovers' eggs, was able to dispose of their game to the poulterers at Minsterham, with whom she had an understanding. Her smiling black eyes, white teeth, and merry looks, caused a great deal of business to be done through her, and servants were not unwilling to carry in her stories about rabbits knocked down unawares by a stick, and pheasants or partridges killed by chance in reaping. Indeed, she had a little trade in dripping and other scraps with sundry of these servants, which rendered them the more disposed to receive her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd got up early," [...] he said, [...] "to {{feed the}} ferrets, and I was just <b>cutting</b> <b>over</b> to the fives-courts with their grub, when, just as I got across the senior gravel, I saw O'Hara and Moriarty {{standing}} waiting near the second court. O'Hara {{knows all about}} the ferrets, so I didn't try and cut or anything. I went up and began talking to him. I noticed he didn't look particularly keen on seeing me at first. I {{asked him if he}} was going to play fives. Then he said no, and told me what he'd really come for. He said he and Rand-Brown had had a row, and they'd agreed to have it out that morning in one of the fives-courts. Of course, when I heard that, I was all on to see it, so I said I'd wait, if he didn't mind. He said he didn't care, so long as I didn't tell everybody, so I said I wouldn't tell anybody except you, so he said all right, then, I could stop if I wanted to. So that was how I saw it. Well, after we'd been waiting a few minutes, Rand-Brown came in sight, with that beast Merrett in our house, who'd come to second him. It was just like one of those duels you read about, you know. Then O'Hara said that as I was the only one there with a watch--he and Rand-Brown were in footer clothes, and Merrett and Moriarty hadn't got their tickers on them--I'd better act as timekeeper. So I said all right, I would, and we went to the second fives-court. It's the biggest of them, you know. I stood outside on the bench, looking through the wire netting over the door, so as not to be in the way when they started scrapping. O'Hara and Rand-Brown took off their blazers and sweaters, and chucked them to Moriarty and Merrett, and then Moriarty and Merrett went and stood in two corners, and O'Hara and Rand-Brown walked into the middle and stood up to one another. Rand-Brown was miles the heaviest--by a stone, I should think--and he was taller and had a longer reach. But O'Hara looked much fitter. Rand-Brown looked rather flabby.|$|E
