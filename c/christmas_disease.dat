In the comic however, the Syndicate was depicted as evil, and {{was the source of}} a great deal of misery for various characters, including Weapon Brown himself as well as Linus. An emergency which afflicted a number of scientists working for the Syndicate prompted the events depicted in A Weapon Brown Christmas- They had contracted a neuromuscular disease that made those afflicted seem like they are dancing. This continues until either the victims' spines snap or they die with the implication that both usually occurred at once to all victims of the disease.

50|$|Perhaps his {{greatest}} contribution to modern medicine was his deciphering of the Enzyme cascade process of blood coagulation. Working in 1951 with Prof Alexander Stuart Douglas at the Blood Coagulation Research Unit in Oxford they jointly discovered a second strain of haemophilia, {{now known as}} Haemophilia B, but then known as <b>Christmas</b> <b>disease</b> after its first known sufferer, Stephen Christmas.|$|E

50|$|Haemophilia B (or {{hemophilia}} B) is a {{blood clotting}} disorder {{caused by a}} mutation of the factor IX gene, leading to a deficiency of factor IX. It is the second-most common form of haemophilia, rarer than haemophilia A. Haemophilia B was first recognized as {{a different kind of}} haemophilia in 1952. It is sometimes called <b>Christmas</b> <b>disease,</b> named after Stephen Christmas, the first patient described with this disease. In addition, the first report of its identification was published in the Christmas edition of the British Medical Journal.|$|E
50|$|He had house jobs at King's College Hospital, the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London University, Hammersmith and a {{research}} post at Manchester Royal Infirmary.

Episode 218, again headed up by the Berrynutt brothers, though this time for public broadcast, had a sponsor segment featuring, first, Jackie Broyles promoting Jockie's Market, where he now works the cash register. He is, of course, distraught {{to be working for}} his longtime nemesis but needs the money after having his old store torn down and then using the settlement from the Nashville lawyers to try to keep business in Murfreesboro, followed by being deposed as mayor by Ghost Bird. Dunlap serves as the voice of the next sponsor, Weird Eggs, for whom he serves as a social media outreach person. This {{is the first time that}} the sponsor segment for an episode of Red State Update has been provided by someone other than the podcast presenters. In Episode 219, Jackie and Dunlap are again recording their usual podcast, this time from the basement of Dunlap's grandmother's house during Jackie's lunch break from Jockie's Market, which again serves as the sponsor. Dunlap, meanwhile, sponsors Naked Church, a nudist congregation he is attempting to start up. However, this podcast is cut in by the Berrynut Boys once again, which itself is cut in by Bill Berrynutt and the Talking Christmas Gift reporting in from Moscow, Russia, where Berrynutt has been transported by Russian officials for the treatment of his <b>Christmas</b> <b>disease.</b> The Talking Christmas Gift reveals that he has been a Russian agent since 1980 and that <b>Christmas</b> <b>disease</b> is the result of an increasingly refined toxin the Russians have been developing for many years.|$|E

Ordinarily the laboratory diagnosis of classical haemophilia (haemophilia A) and <b>Christmas</b> <b>disease</b> (haemophilia B, plasma thromboplastin component deficiency) is easy using the thromboplastin genera-tion test as described by Biggs and Douglas (1953).

40|$|Hemophilia B (<b>Christmas</b> <b>disease)</b> is a {{chromosome}} X-linked blood clotting disorder which results when factor IX is deficient or functionally defective. The enzyme is synthesized in the liver, {{and the existence}} of animal models for this genetic disease will permit the development of somatic gene therapy protocols aimed at transfer of the functional gene into the liver. We report the construction of an N 2 -based recombinant retroviral vector, NCMVFIX, for efficient transfer and expression of human factor IX cDNA in primary rabbit hepatocytes. In this construct the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter directs the expression of factor IX. Hepatocytes were isolated from 3 -week-old New Zealand White rabbits, infected with the recombinant virus, and analyzed for secretion of active factor IX. The infected rabbit hepatocytes produced human factor IX that is indistinguishable from enzyme derived from normal human plasma.

40|$|Individuals of {{the same}} species may differ from one another in protein composition, these {{differences}} being of two types: in the first type most of the peptide structure of a particular protein is identical in all individuals except for a limited region of the molecule where differences in certain amino acids may occur. This is exemplified by the polymorphism of hemoglobin, pseudocholinesterase, haptogiobin, and of gamma globulin (1). The individual differences in the latter class of proteins, the gamma globulins, have been revealed by isologous antibody and are designated as allotypes (2, 3). Individuals {{of the same}} species may differ from one another also by a second type of variation, consisting in {{the presence or absence of}} certain proteins.

40|$|From the Oxford Haemophilia Centre, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, England When Okamoto and his {{associates}} began their systematic search in 1947 for a synthetic inhibitor of fibrinolysis they aimed to find a substance of value in clinical conditions in which hyperplasminaemia was significant-conditions such as excessive bleeding associated with prostatic and thoracic surgery and with abruptio placentae. They discovered two potent inhibitors of fibrinolysis, epsilon-amino-caproic acid (EACA) l and tranexamic acid (amino-methyl-cyclohexane carboxylic acid) (AMCA). 2 Both drugs have been used with mixed success {{in a variety of}} clinical conditions during the past 20 years. I shall confine myself to their use in treating haemophilia (factor VIII deficiency) or <b>Christmas</b> <b>disease</b> (factor IX deficiency). A third inhibitor of fibrinolysis, aprotinin (Trasylol), prepared from bovine lung is also commercially available. In addition to acting as an inhibitor of plasmin and plasminogen activator it has a weak anticoagulant action. It has been very little used in haemophilia except as an instillation into joints during some forms of joint surgery and will not be discussed. Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) Okamoto and {{his associates}} thought that EACA acted by inhibiting plasmin, but Alkjaersig et al. 3 showed that it was principally a competitive inhi-bitor of plasminogen activator and acted in this respect in vivo at a concentration of 0 - 1 mmol/l.

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{haemorrhage}} {{has been}} {{regarded as one of}} the commonest clinical manifestations of haemophilia and <b>Christmas</b> <b>disease</b> and has always been associated with a high mortality. In a retrospective study of adult patients with haemophilia in the Western Region of Scotland it was found that 32 patients had experienced 107 separate episodes of haematemesis or melaena. This represents an incidence of 25 per cent of the patients at risk. The commonest cause was peptic ulceration •which was proven in 53 per cent of these patients by serial barium-meal examinations. The diagnosis of the cause of bleeding on the first occasion remains a problem as in only nine out of 32 patients was a probable cause shown. Bleeding as a result of ingestion of salicylates or alcohol was uncommon. When dyspeptic symptoms were used to produce a clinical division of the patients into two subgroups it was found that there was a significantly higher number of patients with a severe grade of haemophilia who were eupeptic when they bled whereas in the dyspeptic group there was a significantly higher number of moderately affected patients. Emergency surgical procedures used to be commonplace to control bleeding but in this series only one patient required emergency surgery. All acute bleeding episodes were controlled by plasma or plasma concentrate and elective surgery performed as necessary. Only one patient died of haemorrhage and he was shown to have a potent antihaemophilic factor inhibitor. It is apparent that modern treatment with potent plasma concentrates has substantially altered the prognosis in patients with coagu-lation defects, but has introduced the hazards of serum hepatitis and antihaemophilic factor inhibitors...|$|E
