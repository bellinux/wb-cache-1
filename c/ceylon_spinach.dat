Anthocyanins, a major group of plant pigments, have been revealed to have strong antioxidant activity with potential use as chemotherapeutics. In this report, in vitro culture of <b>Ceylon</b> <b>spinach</b> (Basella rubra L.) was preliminarily studied for anthocyanin production. Two types of explants including stem and leaf were used for callus induction. The method for sterilization and concentration of plant growth regulators were optimized. It was found that sterilization by 7 % (v/v) Clorox for 15 min and placed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0. 1 µML- 1 2, 4 -D and 5 µM L- 1 BA gave a result of 100 % callus production from the stem type explant. The callus was also subjected to cell culture study. The effect of sucrose concentration on cell culture of <b>Ceylon</b> <b>spinach</b> was investigated and {{it was found that}} 0. 5070 g L- 1 d- 1 growth rate can be obtained at 3 % sucrose. Anthocyanin production of the callus was induced by exposing <b>Ceylon</b> <b>spinach</b> callus to UV light for 0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min and culturing on LS medium with 2, 4 -D and BA at 3 µM L- 1 for 2 weeks. The result showed that callus treated with UV for 20 min and 30 min produced anthocyanin at 1. 293 and 1. 157 mg / 100 g. fresh cell weight respectively, whereas anthocyanin from the control callus was found at 1. 001 mg/ 100 g. fresh cell weight...|$|E
40|$|This study {{selected}} 13 {{fruits and}} vegetables to determine their total phenolic and flavonoid contents and their stimulatory effects on splenocyte proliferation from female BALB/c mice. The highest total phenolic content was observed in mulberry (1515. 9 +/- 5. 7 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) / 100 g fresh matter (FM)) among four selected fruit species. The highest total phenolic content was observed {{in a variety of}} red onions (310. 8 +/- 4. 9 mg GAE/ 100 g FM) among nine selected vegetable species. The highest total flavonoid content was observed in mulberry (250. 1 +/- 6. 3 mg quercetin equivalents (QE) / 100 g FM) among the selected fruits. The highest total flavonoid content was observed in <b>ceylon</b> <b>spinach</b> (133. 1 +/- 26. 2 mg QE/ 100 g FM) among the selected vegetables. The mulberry, strawberry and red onion demonstrated an immuno-modulatory potential via stimulating splenocyte proliferation. Bitter melon showed a significantly (P < 0. 05) negative correlation with splenocyte proliferation. Their immuno-modulatory components are highly correlated with phenolics, including flavonoids. The total phenolic contents in all selected {{fruits and vegetables}} significantly correlated with splenocyte proliferation in vitro. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that some {{fruits and vegetables}} have an immuno-modulatory potential on T helper type 1 (Th 1) and Th 2 cytokine secretions. Therefore, Th 1 cytokines including interleukin (IL) - 2, and interferon (IFN) -gamma, and Th 2 cytokines including IL- 4 and IL- 5, produced by mouse splenocytes administrated with 13 selected fruits and vegetables were determined. The results showed that low dose (10 mu g/ml) administration with oriental plum, mulberry, peppers (including green, yellow, and red color varieties), <b>ceylon</b> <b>spinach,</b> and red onion significantly (P IL- 5 > IL- 2. The coefficients from total phenolic content were much greater than those from the total flavonoid content. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of oriental plum, mulberry, green pepper, and red onion 11 showed a significantly positive correlation with the IFN-gamma secretion. This study suggests that in vitro supplementation with phenolic-rich fruits and vegetables might demonstrate an immuno-modulatory potential via the regulation of Th 1 /Th 2 cytokine secretions, especially Th 1 cytokines. The Th 1 /Th 2 immuno-modulatory potentials of these selected fruits and vegetables will be important and useful for the future exploitation of food materials to develop a novel functional food.

40|$|Occurrence of fungi {{associated}} with {{two species of}} Basella and their pathogenic potentiality is reported. A total of 12 species of fungi representing 8 genera of the class deuteromycetes {{were found to be}} {{associated with}} Basella alba L. and B. rubra L [...] The genus Basella belongs to the Basellaceae family and has two chief cultivars, Basella alba, which bears thick, fleshy, broad, oval to heart-shaped leaves all along its vine length and Basella rubra features pink or purplish stems and pink colour veins in the leaves. In either case, leaves and terminal, tender, 8 - 12 inches stems are ready for harvesting about 35 to 45 days after seeding. Most authors agree, however, that the two color forms of Basella are not separate species. Perhaps both would best be treated as forms of Basella rubra. Basella is native to tropical Asia, probably originating in India or Indonesia. Today, it is grown widely in the tropics. Vine spinach is noted by regional names in different regions in Asia. Some of the common names for this herb are <b>Ceylon</b> <b>spinach,</b> Malabar spinach, saan choy (Chinese), mong toi (Vietnamese), alugbati (Philippines), pui saag (Bengali). remayong (Malay), Indian spinach (English), Poi, Safed bachla (Hindi), etc. Young Basella leaves and stems is popular vegetables in Asian countries. Basella alba is popular for its ethanobotanical properties. Various parts of the plant are used for treatment of the diseases as wel...|$|E
40|$|Traditional leafy {{vegetables}} {{belong to the}} group of so-called orphan crops which tropical research has rediscovered in recent years, drawn by their nutritional and economic value. In manuals, they have long been eclipsed by green vegetables of European origin, such as cabbage and lettuce, even though these have far less nutritional content. These days, {{leafy vegetables}} are seen as an ally in the fight against hidden hunger, the term used to describe deficiencies of micro-nutrients such as vitamin A and minerals like iron, which prevents anaemia. Whether they be wild or cultivated, and produced by lianas, tubers or trees, leafy vegetables offer populations with limited access to meat or fish a rich source of protein, which is essential for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as well as for young and growing children. The leaves of Moringa oleifera are rich in protein (see Spore 106). Dry cassava leaves contain up to 36. 8 % protein, while amaranthus and <b>Ceylon</b> <b>spinach</b> both contain 25 %, compared with dried haricot beans, which have just 23. 3 %. These vegetables are particularly useful in times of food shortages or between harvests. A culinary heritage Though ignored by most agronomy manuals, these traditional plants still feature strongly in the dishes and home gardens of ACP countries. When cooked, leafy vegetables also known as bredes in the Indian Ocean and Pacific islands {{play an important role in}} the preparation of famous dishes and sauces served as an accompaniment to cereals and tubers. In Cameroon, bitter leaves, a dish based on the leaves of Vernonia and peanut, is part of the culinary heritage, whilst in Congo, saka saka is made with cassava leaves. In the Pacific Islands, amaranthus, cassava or hibiscus leaves are cooked in coconut milk to make laplap. The women who grow or harvest these leaves are also familiar with their valuable therapeutic properties. Consumption of these plants is closely linked to culture. In certain Pacific islands, some leaves will be highly prized, while on a neighbouring atoll they may be spurned and used only as animal fodder. In Tanzania, leaves of Solanum villosum, a highly sought after variety of nightshade, costs twice the price of the more common amaranthus leaves. For the past 12 years, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) has been trying to educate people on the benefits of leafy vegetables. Campaigns have been conducted in countries of the South to explain, for example, that cooking these green vegetables for a shorter time helps to preserve their vitamin content and nutritional value. From the bush to the towns Lack of knowledge about these indigenous plants is mainly due to the fact that there are a great many of them, and that they often grow spontaneously and in very small areas. But rural populations in particular have long known of and cultivated them. In Africa, urbanisation has changed things and given rise to what are often quite sizeable markets selling the leafy vegetables best suited to transportation. Since freshness is crucial, cultivation of leafy vegetables has also developed in towns and peri-urban settings. A study carried out by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) on urban households in Yaoundé revealed that traditional green vegetables are most frequently grown by poor families (see Spore 110). Total production of leafy vegetables in Cameroon was estimated to be 93, 600 t in 1998, with 21, 549 t made up of Vernonia. In Senegal, leafy vegetables account for as much as 50 to 85 % of the household budget for some farmers. In sub-Saharan Africa, these plants are sold at local but also at regional markets. Leaves from the liana Gnetum africanum (better known as okok in English-speaking countries or eru in Cameroon) are traded in significant quantities between Cameroon and Nigeria, where, highly prized and over-harvested, they have all but disappeared. Fresh, dried or sometimes frozen, some traditional leafy vegetables can also be found in Europe and North America. But according to a recent study, these products, which are symbols of cultural identity are generally confined to Afro-Caribbean shops and restaurants, used mainly by ethnic communities. Assets to be used According to Kenyan ethnobotanist Patrick Maundu, no fewer than one thousand African plants could be consumed as leafy vegetables. In ACP countries, only around 15 varieties are grown and sold on any significant scale. Some wild species, such as Gnetum, which were over-harvested and threatened with extinction, are now being domesticated in Cameroon and Nigeria. But before they can be cultivated, the long process of collecting and conserving ecotypes must be carried out, as well as work to improve varieties and develop techniques for farmers. Researchers from Cameroon, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa and The Gambia are working on all these tasks with the support of Future Harvest (an organisation which groups 16 international research institutes). Many of these plants have the advantage of growing very quickly (in less than 1 - 2 months) in tropical climates and require very little in the way of treatment, compared with other market garden species. These are important plus points at a time when HIV/AIDS is depriving many African countries of its labour force. They can also be easily grown, especially by women, on small plots and used to feed the household or to generate extra income. In addition to their role in cultivating wild leafy vegetables, the job of harvesting and marketing the vegetables has also traditionally fallen to women. Though undervalued in the past, leafy vegetables are a key ingredient in the diets of ACP countries. Recently, researchers have shown strong interest in these traditional greens for their high nutritional value and economic potential...|$|E
