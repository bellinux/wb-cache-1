A community places constraints on its members, restricting the behaviour they can participate in. This may involve a stronger form of constraint than those which result from the traditional binding of objects at interfaces, which requires only that the communication between the objects has some observable properties. This paper discusses the different forms of constraints, and examines the range of forms that community construction may take. In particular, it examines the process of abstracting from a community to yield a <b>community</b> <b>object,</b> and then using this object to fill some role in a broader community.

40|$|Private {{roadside}} memorials {{are part}} of a growing trend among the bereaved who seek to “make sense of senseless deaths” along the public roadways. 2 These memorials, which often feature a Latin cross, {{are part of}} deeply meaningful bereavement practices that support the grieving process. As such, these memorials are created to satisfy a human need during a time of crisis and are, therefore, largely constructed without regard to the legality of erecting such markers. 3 Courts have yet to provide clear guidance on the constitutionality of erecting and maintaining these private memorials on public spaces. This Article considers the constitutional guideposts for evaluating roadside memorial crosses and offers some practical solutions for policymakers struggling to balance the needs of the bereaved with the interests of the community. Within the legal scholarship there has been no systematic examination of the roadside memorial phenomenon or the animating forces behind the growing popularity of commemorating the “last alive” place of a loved one. 13 Understanding the phenomenon is an important first step in analyzing the Free Speech and Establishment Clause issues that are raised by the presence of these private memorials on public space. The Supreme Court has emphasized that “there is a crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect. ” This Article joins the legal scholarship exploring “mixed speech,” which is neither purely private speech nor purely government speech. This Article canvasses the interdisciplinary literature devoted to the roadside memorial phenomenon and then examines the Free Speech interests of memorial makers and the Establishment Clause concerns raised by having private crosses along public roadways. Part I describes the history and animating forces behind the roadside memorial phenomenon. Part II traces public opinion and public policies regarding roadside memorials. In response to this growing phenomenon, state and local policymakers have adopted a patchwork of regulations that range from allowing and promoting roadside memorials to banning and removing all privately made memorials. Public sentiments mirror this range of policies with some individuals respecting and applauding roadside crosses, while others within the <b>community</b> <b>object</b> to the macabre eyesores that seek to sanctify the public roadways. Parts III and IV set out the Free Speech and Establishment Clause framework within which the roadside memorial phenomenon rests. Memorial makers have a Free Speech claim to erect a marker on the “last alive” place of a loved one, and governments must be careful not to appear to endorse a religious message and violate the Establishment Clause by allowing religiously themed markers to remain on public property. 16 The unresolved question that is explored in Part V is whether a government creates grounds for an Establishment Clause challenge by either erecting or allowing roadside crosses to remain along public roadways. It is unclear what the consequences are for states that allow private memorial crosses to remain on public roadways. It is also unclear what happens when official, state-sponsored markers are supplemented with private crosses and religious messages, which the government does not remove. Private religious speech in a designated or traditional public forum is generally free from Establishment Clause concerns. 17 However, private religious speech may lose its “purely private” nature by its placement in a public space. 18 The public roadways have not been treated as traditional public fora where individuals can express themselves without government restraint or limitation. And by not removing the private religious displays, it is unclear if a government runs the risk of appearing to tacitly adopt the religious message. 19 The Supreme Court in Pleasant Grove City, Utah v. Summum reflected this position when it explained, “It certainly is not common for property owners to open up their property for the installation of permanent monuments that convey a message with which they do not wish to be associated. ” 20 Therefore, according to the Court, “Because property owners typically do not permit the construction of such monuments on their land, persons who observe donated monuments routinely—and reasonably—interpret them as conveying some message on the property owner’s behalf. ” 21 Monuments and symbols are subject to more than one interpretation. And these monuments and symbols can communicate a message on behalf of more than one speaker. The roadside crosses undoubtedly speak on behalf of the private individuals who were motivated to erect them. But, by allowing the roadside crosses to remain on public property, the government may also passively adopt the message of the memorial cross. Constitutionally permissible avenues for policymakers to address roadside memorials are discussed in Part V. Governments that create a limited public forum for the bereaved to express the two-fold message of remembrance of the deceased and caution to other drivers may satisfy the Free Speech interests of the memorial makers. Additionally, Establishment Clause concerns about government endorsement of religion may be forestalled if the government consistently applies viewpoint-neutral criteria for speakers and topics and also disclaims control or endorsement of the message...|$|E

40|$|Redonda, comunidade pesqueira distante 200 km de Fortaleza, capital do estado do CearÃ - Brasil, estÃ localizada nas coordenadas geogrÃficas 04 Â 25 Â 28, 79 â S e 037 Â 54 Â 17, 97 â W. A Praia de Redonda tem o segundo maior contingente populacional do municÃpio a que pertence â IcapuÃ, com 3. 000 habitantes, com um total de aproximadamente 610 famÃlias, e tem o segundo maior nÃmero de embarcaÃÃes Ã vela destinadas Ã pesca de lagosta, atrÃs somente da capital Fortaleza. O estudo propÃe a construÃÃo de um modelo de gestÃo participativa â co- gestÃo â que pode promover a conservaÃÃo da pesca e dos recursos pesqueiros em grande escala, a partir da implementaÃÃo de modelo piloto em comunidades pesqueiras, integrando o elemento humano (usuÃrio) ao manejo pesqueiro. O objetivo geral dessa proposta foi realizar um levantamento do estado da arte do setor pesqueiro na comunidade de Redonda e estabelecer um marco de trabalho para o desenho dos planos de gestÃo dos recursos pesqueiros. Os planos de gestÃo incorporam princÃpios de sustentabilidade utilizando uma aproximaÃÃo de gestÃo integrada das Ãreas costeiras. O modelo de gestÃo foi baseado na participaÃÃo de todos os agentes envolvidos no setor pesqueiro, local ou nÃo, participando no processo de desenho, elaboraÃÃo e implementaÃÃo do plano de co-gestÃo. O estudo comeÃou a partir da aceitaÃÃo da necessidade de um novo modelo de gerenciamento pesqueiro cooperativo na Comunidade objeto do estudo, passando pela compreensÃo de que o sucesso da co-gestÃo pesqueira nÃo Ã somente dependente da boa implementaÃÃo do programa, mas tambÃm sobre o modo de como a idÃia foi concebida. Nosso foco no estÃgio da prÃ- implementaÃÃo nos levou a examinar a origem da idÃia e de que maneira, ou circunstÃncias, esse processo comeÃou na Comunidade para, a partir desse ponto, ter inÃcio a fase de levantamento de dados. A coleta de dados foi realizada entre 2007 e 2010 e esteve baseada na coleta de dados primÃrios e dados secundÃrios. O {{principal}} conflito relatado por moradores na Praia de Redonda Ã a luta de seus pescadores contra a presenÃa de mergulhadores na Ãrea de pesca de Redonda. A soluÃÃo da crise apresentada pela populaÃÃo Ã a criaÃÃo de uma AMP - Ãrea Marinha Protegida, com 2. 200 kmÂ, dentro do que preconiza a lei do SNUC â Sistema Nacional de Unidades de ConservaÃÃo, beneficiando 13 comunidades pesqueiras pertencentes aos municÃpios de Aracati e IcapuÃ e aproximadamente 1930 pescadores. Foram contabilizadas 229 embarcaÃÃes pesqueiras somente em Redonda e, dessas, 180 unidades sÃo denominadas bote de casco e representam 78, 6 % da frota local. As principais artes de pesca utilizadas em Redonda sÃo as cangalhas para a captura de lagosta, enquanto que para a captura de peixe sÃo utilizadas as redes de espera, espinhel e linha de mÃo. A produÃÃo mÃdia de lagosta viva desembarcada em Redonda, no perÃodo de 2004 a 2009 foi 47, 8 kg/barco/dia. AlÃm de lagosta, os peixes mais pescados sÃo: guaiÃba, cioba, dentÃo, sirigado, guarajuba, cavala, dourado, agulhÃo e albacora. O estudo demonstra a necessidade da implementaÃÃo do sistema de co-gestÃo pesqueira para a pesca artesanal na regiÃo leste do Estado como forma de propiciar a sustentabilidade da atividade pesqueira. Redonda, {{a fishing}} village that is 200 km away from Fortaleza, capital of CearÃ State - Brazil, located at geographical coordinates 04 Â 25 â 28, 79 â S and 037 Â 54 â 17, 97 â W. Redonda Beach has {{the second largest}} population in the city, to which it belongs - IcapuÃ, with 3, 000 inhabitants, {{with a total of}} about 610 families and a large number of sailing lobster boats, second only to the State capital, Fortaleza. The {{purpose of this study is}} the building of a model of participative management â co-management â which can promote the conservation of fisheries and fishery resources in a large scale, through the implementation of a pilot model in artisanal fisheries villages, integrating the human element (user) to fisheries management. The overall objective of this proposal was to survey the state of the art of the fishing sector in the Redonda community and establish a frame of work for the design of management plans for fishery resources. Management plans incorporate principles of sustainability using an approximation of integrated management of coastal zones. The management model was based on the participation of all stakeholders in the local fishing industry or not, participating in the process of designing, developing and implementing the plan of co-management. The study began by accepting the need for a new model of cooperative fishery management in the <b>Community</b> <b>object</b> of study, and realizing that the success of fisheries co-management is not only dependent on the successful implementation of the program, but also how the idea was conceived. Our focus at the pre-implementation stage led us to examine the origin of the idea and in what manner, or circumstances, this process began in the Community, and from there, began the data collection phase. Data was collected between 2007 and 2010 and was based on primary and secondary data. The main conflict reported by residents in Redonda Beach is its fishermenâs struggle against the presence of divers in the fishing area of Redonda. The solution presented by the population was the creation of an AMP - Marine Protected Area, with 2, 200 square kilometers, in accordance with SNUC - National System of Conservation Units, benefiting 13 fishing communities belonging to the municipalities of Aracati and IcapuÃ and about 1, 930 fishermen. In Redonda, alone, 229 fishing boats were accounted for out of which 180 are called boat hull and represent 78. 6 % of the local fleet. The main fishing gear used are cangalhas to catch lobster and fish is caught through the use of gill nets, longlines and hand line. The average landing of live lobsters in Redonda, from 2004 through 2009 was 47. 8 kg/boat/day. Other than lobster, some important landed species are: yellowtail snapper, red snapper, dentÃo, sirigado, guarajuba, mackerel, dourado, marlin and yellowfin tuna. The study demonstrates the need of implementation of a fisheries co- management system for artisanal fisheries in the eastern coast of the State as a means to provide the sustainability of the fishing activity...|$|E
