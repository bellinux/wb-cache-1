40|$|This study, {{based on}} a survey of 302 <b>cooperating</b> teachers, {{investigated}} what <b>cooperating</b> teachers learn about themselves when working with student teachers, the impact of serving as a <b>cooperating</b> teacher on one's personal career path, satisfying or problematic features {{of the role of}} <b>cooperating</b> teacher, and contributions that <b>cooperating</b> teachers make to their profession. <b>Cooperating</b> teachers recognized their importance and influence over student teachers. They saw themselves as adequately prepared to serve as <b>cooperating</b> teachers, found serving as a <b>cooperating</b> teacher to be personally satisfying, and felt it to be 1 positive professional development experience. They were a little less inclined to view teacher education students as being prepared to benefit from their experience and they were less inclined to report adequate support by university supervisors in their work. <b>Cooperating</b> teachers viewed their role as mainly one of directing student teachers and facilitating growth. More <b>cooperating</b> teachers looked forward to receiving ideas and information from the student teachers than to giving ideas and information.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{experiences}} of <b>cooperating</b> teachers regarding the supervision of student teachers in their practicum year.

This instrument has 77 items and assesses three central domains of the <b>cooperating</b> teachers' experiences, i) benefits, ii) personal impact, and iii) difficulties in the adaptation to the supervisory tasks. It is our aim to investigate the extent in which the variables 'Scientific domain', 'Teaching years', 'Supervisory experience', and 'Specialized training in supervision¿ differentiate the experiences and perceptions of the participants. Data collected point out the lack of impact of the first three variables and the influence of the last in the experiences and perceptions of the <b>cooperating</b> teachers...|$|R
40|$|University teacher {{education}} programs often struggle to attract <b>cooperating</b> teachers. Given this situation, it is obviously of interest to determine what factors may attract teachers to, or repel them from, the <b>cooperating</b> role. It is also of interest to determine, in general terms at least, what characteristics <b>cooperating</b> teachers share. This paper develops a profile of <b>cooperating</b> teachers who agreed to work with student teachers, and discusses factors that encourage or dissuade them from taking on their important role. Results suggest that teachers’ positive motivations to take practicum students revolve around a solid set of professional commitments to self, students, and the profession. However, the actual experience of working with student teachers can run counter to these positive motivations, and may dissuade teachers from continuing in their <b>cooperating</b> role. The findings have strong implications for developing a cohort of motivated, committed and capable school-based <b>cooperating</b> teachers {{to work with the}} future generation of teachers...|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{supervision}} by <b>cooperating</b> {{teachers and}} university supervisors {{has an important}} role in providing pre-service teachers with opportunities to develop their PCK for teaching science. Based on the findings of Faikhamta and Clarke (2015) and Jantarakantee and Roadrangka (2010), pre-service science teachers rarely receive productive suggestions and feedback from <b>cooperating</b> teachers about their teaching. They noted that some <b>cooperating</b> teachers did not have any experience or understanding of student-centred approach or constructivist-based teaching and suggested that the pre-service teachers consult with their supervisors. However, it was apparent that the <b>cooperating</b> teachers need university supervisors to clarify the role of these <b>cooperating</b> teachers when they supervise pre-service science teachers in their teaching. <b>Cooperating</b> teachers also often feel that teacher education programmes are disconnected from their work. While university supervisors and pre-service teachers work collaboratively, they and <b>cooperating</b> teachers have limited opportunities to directly communicate with one another. This problem may be because of traditional models of supervision that are based on a ‘theory into practice’ model. In this model, pre-service teachers learn theories in their university courses and then apply their knowledge in a teaching setting.|$|R

40|$|Multiple <b>cooperating</b> {{mutations}} that deregulate different signaling pathways {{are required}} to induce cancer. Identifying these <b>cooperating</b> mutations {{is a prerequisite for}} developing better combinatorial therapies for treating cancer. Here we show that <b>cooperating</b> cancer mutations can be identified through oncogenic-retrovirus-induced insertional mutagenesis. Among 13 myeloid leukemias induced by transplanting into mice bone marrow cells infected in vitro with a replication-defective retrovirus carrying the Sox 4 oncogene, 9 contained insertional mutations at known or suspected cancer genes. This likely occurred because rare bone marrow cells, in which the oncogenic retrovirus happened to integrate and in which it mutated a <b>cooperating</b> cancer gene, were selected because the host harbored a <b>cooperating</b> cancer mutation. Cooperativity between Sox 4 and another gene, Mef 2 c, was subsequently confirmed in transplantation studies, in which deregulated Mef 2 c expression was shown to accelerate the myeloid leukemia induced by Sox 4. Insertional mutagenesis of <b>cooperating</b> cancer genes by a defective oncogenic retrovirus provides a new method for identifying <b>cooperating</b> cancer genes and could aid in the development of better therapies for treating cancer.

40|$|A {{critical}} component of teacher education is the field experience during which candidates practice {{under the supervision of}} experienced teachers. Programs use the InTASC Standards to define the requisite knowledge, skills, and dispositions for teaching. Practicing teachers are familiar with the concepts of knowledge and skills, but they are less familiar with dispositions. Practicing teachers who mentor prospective teachers are underrepresented in the literature, but they are critical to teacher preparation. The research goals were to describe the self-identified dispositions of <b>cooperating</b> teachers, identify what <b>cooperating</b> teachers consider their role in preparing prospective teachers, and explain challenges that <b>cooperating</b> teachers face. Using a mixed methods design, I conducted a quantitative survey followed by a qualitative case study. 	When I compared survey and case study data, <b>cooperating</b> teachers report possessing InTASC critical dispositions described in Standard 2 : Learning Differences, Standard 3 : Learning Environments, and Standard 9 : Professional Learning and Ethical Practice, but not Standard 6 : Assessment and Standard 10 : Leadership and Collaboration. <b>Cooperating</b> teachers assume the roles of modeler, mentor and advisor, and informal evaluator. They explain student teachers often lack skills and dispositions to assume full teaching responsibilities and recommend that universities better prepare candidates for classrooms. <b>Cooperating</b> teachers felt university evaluations were not relevant to teaching reality. I recommend modifying field experiences to increase the quantity and duration of classroom placements. I suggest further research to detail <b>cooperating</b> teacher dispositions, compare <b>cooperating</b> teachers who work with different universities, and determine if <b>cooperating</b> teacher dispositions influence student teacher dispositions...|$|R
