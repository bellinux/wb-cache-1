On the contrary, with the last approach (and above-mentioned methods: population bootstrap and twisting argument) we may learn the joint distribution of many parameters. For instance, focusing on the distribution of two or many more parameters, in the figures below we report two confidence regions where the function to be learnt falls with a confidence of 90%. The former concerns the probability with which an extended support vector machine attributes a binary label 1 to the points of the [...] plane.

40|$|AbstractFor {{the purpose}} of {{enhancing}} reliability of aileron of Airbus new-generation A 350 XWB, an evaluation of aileron reliability {{on the basis of}} maintenance data is presented in this paper. Practical maintenance data contains large number of <b>censoring</b> <b>samples,</b> information uncertainty of which makes it hard to evaluate reliability of aileron actuator. Considering that true lifetime of <b>censoring</b> <b>sample</b> has identical distribution with complete <b>sample,</b> if <b>censoring</b> <b>sample</b> is transformed into complete sample, conversion frequency of <b>censoring</b> <b>sample</b> can be estimated according to frequency of complete sample. On the one hand, standard life table estimation and product limit method are improved on the basis of such conversion frequency, enabling accurate estimation of various <b>censoring</b> <b>samples.</b> On the other hand, by taking such frequency as one of the weight factors and integrating variance of order statistics under standard distribution, weighted least square estimation is formed for accurately estimating various <b>censoring</b> <b>samples.</b> Large amounts of experiments and simulations show that reliabilities of improved life table and improved product limit method are closer to the true value and more conservative; moreover, weighted least square estimate (WLSE), with conversion frequency of <b>censoring</b> <b>sample</b> and variances of order statistics as the weights, can still estimate accurately with high proportion of <b>censored</b> data in <b>samples.</b> Algorithm in this paper has good effect and can accurately estimate the reliability of aileron actuator even with small <b>sample</b> and high <b>censoring</b> rate. This research has certain significance in theory and engineering practice...|$|R

40|$|For a {{complete}} sample, Chen [Chen, Z., 1996. Joint confidence region for {{the parameters of}} a Pareto distribution. Metrika 44, 191 - 197] proposed an interval estimation of the parameter [theta] and a joint confidence region of two parameters of a Pareto distribution. When the first r lifetimes and the last s lifetimes out of n inspected items are missing, doubly type II censoring has arisen. Since Chen's method cannot be extended to the doubly type II <b>censored</b> <b>sample</b> case, I proposed another joint confidence region for the two parameters of a Pareto distribution. The interval estimation of parameter [nu] is also given for a doubly type II <b>censored</b> <b>sample.</b> Since the complete sample case (r= 0) and the right type II <b>censored</b> <b>sample</b> case (r=s= 0) are special cases of doubly type II censored samples, the proposed confidence region should also be appropriate for these two special cases, and thus can be compared with Chen's method based on {{the area of the}} confidence region. From the simulation results, it can be found that the proposed method is better than Chen's method in obtaining a smaller confidence area. But the difference in area of the two methods becomes very slight when the sample size becomes larger. In this paper, I also proposed the prediction intervals of the future observation and the ratio of the two future consecutive failure times based on the doubly type II <b>censored</b> <b>sample.</b> Finally, an example is given to illustrate the proposed method. ...|$|E

The comparisons made between the samples are based on the Fisher information, expected duration of the life test and the mean squared error of the maximum likelihood estimators.

The results indicate that, if the experimenter would reduce the required time to conclude the test, then he should prefer type II <b>censored</b> <b>sampling</b> than type-I.

40|$|Economists {{and other}} social {{scientists}} often face situations where {{they have access to}} two datasets that they can use but one set of data suffers from censoring or truncation.

Alternatively, they simply use only the uncensored sample and ignore the censored one so as to avoid biases. It is rarely the case that researchers use both datasets together, mainly because they lack guidance about how to combine them. In this paper, we develop a tractable semiparametric framework for combining the censored and uncensored datasets so that the resulting estimators are consistent, asymptotically normal, and use all information optimally. When the <b>censored</b> <b>sample,</b> which we refer to as the master sample, is much bigger than the uncensored sample (which we call the refreshment sample), the latter can be thought of as providing identification where it is otherwise absent.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to derive the {{predictive}} densities for future responses from the three-parameter Weibull model given a doubly <b>censored</b> <b>sample.</b> The predictive density for a single future response, bivariate future response, and a set of future responses has been derived when the shape parameter [alpha] is unknown. A real data example representing 44 patients who were diagnosed with laryngeal cancer (2000 - 2007) at a local hospital is used to illustrate the predictive results for the four stages of cancer. The survival days of eight out of the 44 patients could not be calculated as the patients were lost to follow-up. They were the first four and the last four patients' survival days in order. Thus, the recorded data for the survival days of 36 patients composed of 18 male and 18 female patients with cancer of the larynx are used for the predictive analysis. Furthermore, a subgroup level of the male and female patients follow-up data are considered to obtain the future survival days. A sensitivity study of the mean, standard deviation, and 95 % highest predictive density (HPD) interval of the future survival days with respect to stages and doses are performed when the shape parameter [alpha] is unknown. <b>Censored</b> <b>sample</b> Doubly <b>censored</b> <b>sample</b> Three-parameter Weibull model Bayesian approach Predictive inference...|$|E
