25|$|On 17 June, the Third Estate, {{led by the}} comte de Mirabeau, {{began to}} call {{themselves}} the National Assembly. On the morning of 20 June, the deputies were shocked {{to discover that the}} <b>chamber</b> <b>door</b> was locked and guarded by soldiers. Immediately fearing the worst and anxious that a royal attack by King Louis XVI was imminent, the deputies congregated in a nearby indoor Jeu de paume court in the Saint-Louis district of the city of Versailles, near the Palace of Versailles.|$|E
500|$|Finding {{that the}} old Memory <b>Chamber</b> <b>door</b> has been locked by Sirrus with a special color-code combination, the Stranger goes to the active Memory Chamber to seek aid from the Serenian Protectors, {{who believe that the}} answers can be found in their [...] "mirror realm", known simply as Dream. Obtaining a [...] "spirit guide", the Stranger enters Dream and {{interact}}s with their guide, who tells them to interact with the Ancestors, the spirits of all Serenians who have died and had their memories preserved, to bring them into harmony. After bringing the Ancestors into harmony, the Stranger discovers the combination to Sirrus' color-code lock. Returning to the [...] "waking world" [...] and entering the old Memory Chamber, the Stranger finds Yeesha strapped into a chair, and she begs to be released from it with a silver lever. At that moment, Achenar arrives with a crossbow and the Life Stone, and warns that Sirrus used the Memory Chamber to remove Yeesha's memories and transfer his own into her body; Achenar points to an amber lever, which will reverse the mind-transfer.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{pressure}} difference, it took a watching doctor nearly {{half an hour to}} open the <b>chamber</b> <b>door.</b> Bondarenko's clothing burned until almost all the oxygen in the chamber was used up and he had suffered third-degree burns over most of his body. The attending physician at Botkin Hospital, surgeon and traumatologist Vladimir Golyakhovsky, recalled in 1984 that while attempting to start an [...] intravenous drip, the only blood vessels he could find for inserting a needle were on the soles of Bondarenko's feet, where his flight boots had warded off the flames. According to Golyakhovsky, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin spent several hours at the hospital as [...] "deathwatch officer" [...] and Bondarenko died of shock 16 hours after the accident, less than three weeks before Gagarin's historic Vostok 1 first spaceflight. Manned orbital flight program director Nikolai Kamanin blamed Bondarenko's death on the Institute's poor organisation and control of the experiment.|$|E

50|$|The SPF Facility layout {{is ideal}} for {{performing}} multiple test programs. The facility has two large high bay areas adjacent {{to either side of}} the vacuum chamber. The advantage of having both areas available is that it allows for two complex tests to be prepared simultaneously. One test can be prepared in a high bay while another test is being conducted in the vacuum <b>chamber.</b> Large <b>chamber</b> <b>doors</b> provide access to the test chamber from either high bay.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 Egypt, an archeological dig led by Richard Turkel (Christopher Lee) {{reaches a}} tomb (of Talos), which is {{apparently}} cursed. The hieroglyphics {{at the entrance}} warn that all should avoid the place {{as it has been}} abandoned by all that is holy. Despite this, they proceed to open the <b>chamber's</b> <b>door</b> only to be blasted with a cloud of dust, which causes them to crumble apart as though they are made of fragile stone. Richard manages to blow the tomb shut, killing himself in the process.|$|R

50|$|On occasion, the Senate may go {{into what}} is called a secret, or closed session. During a closed session, the <b>chamber</b> <b>doors</b> are closed, and the {{galleries}} are completely cleared of anyone not sworn to secrecy, not instructed in the rules of the closed session, or not essential to the session. Closed sessions are quite rare, and are usually held only under certain circumstances where the Senate is discussing sensitive subject-matter such as information critical to national security, private communications from the President, or even to discuss Senate deliberations during impeachment trials. Any Senator has the right to call a closed session as long as the motion is seconded.|$|R

Then, pushing the door with his little hands, he ran in, with a kind of cry of joy.|$|E

5|$|The {{layout of}} tombs {{dug into the}} sides of {{mountains}} typically had a front chamber, side chambers, and a rear chambers designed to imitate a complex of aboveground halls.

50|$|When Michael III {{started to}} favour another courtier, Basiliskianos, Basil decided that his {{position}} was being undermined. Michael threatened to invest Basiliskianos with the Imperial title and this induced Basil to pre-empt events by organizing {{the assassination of}} Michael {{on the night of}} September 23/24, 867. Michael and Basiliskianos were insensibly drunk following a banquet at the palace of Anthimos when Basil, {{with a small group of}} companions (including his father Bardas, brother Marinos, and cousin Ayleon), gained entry. The locks to the <b>chamber</b> <b>doors</b> had been tampered with and the chamberlain had not posted guards; both victims were then put to the sword. On Michael III's death, Basil, as an already acclaimed co-emperor, automatically became the ruling basileus.|$|R

5000|$|The first workers {{summoned to}} build the {{railroad}} spur were local people from neighbouring villages and towns, but the camp was primarily built by a Sonderkommando of about 80 Jews from ghettos within {{the vicinity of the}} camp. A squad of Ukrainian Trawniki-Männer, trained at the Trawniki SS compound, guarded the prisoners. Upon completion of construction, the Jews involved were all killed. [...] In mid-April 1942, when the camp was nearly completed, several experimental gassings took place there. Christian Wirth, the commander of Bełżec and Inspector of Operation Reinhard, arrived in Sobibór to witness one of the gassings, with about 30-40 Jewish women from the Krychów camp brought in for this purpose. He reportedly complained about the fitting of the gas <b>chambers</b> <b>doors.</b> Some 250 Jews from Krychów were killed during these trials.|$|R
