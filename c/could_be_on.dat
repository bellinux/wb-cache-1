5|$|The Duke and Jones {{intended}} to run {{no more than}} one train on each section of the line so the line was not built with passing loops or signalling. When more than one horse-drawn train or locomotive was in operation, the Tramway operated a token system using colour-coded staffs to ensure only one train <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a section. Drivers between Quainton Road and Wotton carried a blue staff, those on west of Wotton and the Kingswood siding a red staff.|$|E
5|$|The line stopped {{carrying}} {{passengers on}} 5 December 1964, {{as part of}} the rationalisation known as the Beeching Axe. All stations were closed, and all goods yards, passing loops and sidings removed, except the marshalling yard for the Octel freight. Octel's freight traffic totaled 70,000 tons annually, and the railway was kept in order to serve this traffic. Local freight services ceased, and the electric staff system was withdrawn, so that only one train <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the branch at a time, although that was sufficient for Octel's requirements. The double junction at Gaerwen was also remodelled. Once the freight trains were being worked by diesel locomotives, arrangements were made for the British Rail engines to operate {{all the way to the}} plant.|$|E
25|$|A few testing {{sessions}} with F1 teams including Jordan suggested another comeback <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the cards, {{but it never}} happened.

25|$|As railroads became operational, that of time became dangerous. Trains ran by a {{published}} schedule, but the scheduling was chaotic. If the watches of {{an engineer and}} a switch operator differed by even a minute or two, it could mean disaster.

25|$|Those minstrels {{who stayed}} in New York and similar cities {{followed}} Barnum's lead by advertising relentlessly and emphasizing {{the spectacle of}} minstrelsy. Troupes ballooned; as many as 19 performers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> stage at once, and J. H. Haverly's United Mastodon Minstrels had over 100 members. Scenery grew lavish and expensive, and specialty acts like Japanese acrobats or circus freaks sometimes appeared. These changes made minstrelsy unprofitable for smaller troupes.|$|E
25|$|Unlike modern {{websites}} {{and online}} {{services that are}} typically hosted by third-party companies in commercial data centers, BBS computers (especially for smaller boards) were typically operated from the SysOp's home. As such, access could be unreliable, and in many cases, only one user <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the system at a time. Only larger BBSes with multiple phone lines using specialized hardware, multitasking software, or a LAN connecting multiple computers, could host multiple simultaneous users.|$|E

25|$|In the 1995–96 season, Internazionale {{failed to}} {{challenge}} for a 14th scudetto, finishing {{seventh in the}} Serie A. Ince, though, had a successful first season, playing in all but four of Inter's league matches and performing well after a slow start which had started speculation that he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> {{his way back to}} the English Premier League as early as the November transfer window - with Arsenal and Newcastle United both reported to be interested. However, he would remain in Milan for two seasons.|$|E
25|$|Robson and United {{began the}} {{following}} season in fine form with ten successive victories which suggested the championship <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> {{its way back}} to Old Trafford {{for the first time}} since 1967. But their form slipped after Christmas and they finished the season trophyless in fourth place behind champions Liverpool, runners-up Everton and third-placed West Ham United. Injuries, notably a dislocated shoulder suffering in February 1986, restricted Robson to just 21 out of 42 league appearances for United in 1985–86, though he did manage seven goals.|$|E
25|$|When energy {{transfer}} ceases from a system, this condition {{is referred to}} as thermodynamic equilibrium. Usually this condition implies the system and surroundings are at the same temperature so that heat no longer transfers between them. It also implies that external forces are balanced (volume does not change), and all chemical reactions within the system are complete. The timeline varies for these events depending on the system in question. A container of ice allowed to melt at room temperature takes hours, while in semiconductors the heat transfer that occurs in the device transition from an on to off state <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the order of a few nanoseconds.|$|E

25|$|Cards acquire RHP {{reliever}} John Axford. The Cardinals acquired Milwaukee Brewers closer John Axford, 30, on August 30, {{in exchange}} for a player to be named later. No cash changed hands, leaving the Cardinals to pay Axford the approximately $1 mil. remaining on his $5 mil. 2013 contract. He is eligible for arbitration after the season, and the Cardinals can either non-tender him after the season or work out a new contract for him. He has not saved a game in 2013, and has a 4.45 ERA in 62 games. This is the first deal between the Cardinals and Brewers in 10 years. This is the first deal the Cardinals have done this season to add to the club, and needed to be done before the August 31 deadline so Axford <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the postseason roster.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Gordon asked {{part-time}} driver Mark Martin if he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> standby {{for him to}} {{take over}} the No. 24 car, should he have needed to miss a race to witness the birth of his first child. Daughter Ella Sofia Gordon was born on Wednesday, June 20 in New York City; Gordon traveled to Sonoma, California later that week to compete in the Toyota Save/Mart 350 on June 24. In 2010, Gordon similarly asked road course ringer Scott Pruett to be on standby for him at Watkins Glen due to the impending birth of his second child. Although Gordon let Pruett run a couple of practice laps in Gordon's car, Gordon was able to start and complete the race without Pruett's assistance. Son Leo Benjamin Gordon was born less than a day after the race's conclusion. In 2014, Gordon had Regan Smith on standby for the Coca-Cola 600, as Gordon suffered from back spasms during qualifying and practice. Gordon was able to start and complete the race as scheduled.|$|E
25|$|Paris Saint-Germain faced Maccabi Tel Aviv for a {{place in}} the group stages of the Europa League after the {{play-off}} round draw at UEFA headquarters in Switzerland. PSG's French Cup triumph saw them stamp their ticket for a return to continental competition where they hosted the first leg at the Parc des Princes before heading to Israel for the return tie a week later. Paris Saint-Germain took the lead to Israel for the second leg of their play-off tie with Maccabi Tel Aviv. Péguy Luyindula and Guillaume Hoarau scored the PSG goals. Paris Saint-Germain lost at Maccabi Tel Aviv but still advanced to the group stage of the Europa League on aggregate. Paris Saint-Germain came up against former Champions League winners Borussia Dortmund and former UEFA Cup champions Sevilla in a testing Group J in which Ukrainian team Karpaty Lviv were the outsiders. Nenê pounced for the only goal of the game as PSG notched an upset win away to Sevilla. Paris Saint-Germain were in command of Group J after defeating Karpaty Lviv at the Parc des Princes. Paris Saint-Germain drew with Borussia Dortmund thanks to substitute Clément Chantôme's 87th-minute strike. Paris Saint-Germain were held to a goalless draw by Borussia Dortmund in an entertaining affair in the capital. Mathieu Bodmer, Nenê and Guillaume Hoarau did the damage for the capital club as they qualified for the last-32 after inflicting a second defeat on Sevilla to give a hint that PSG's glory days of Cup Winners' Cup and Intertoto triumphs <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the way back.|$|E

Secondly, important economic sectors <b>could</b> <b>be</b> based <b>on</b> sector-specific multipliers effects; multipliers that occurred in own sector and other sectors.
