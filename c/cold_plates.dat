It is evident that heat fluxes are currently approaching the limits of forced air cooling, and that liquid cooling is now under consideration. In this paper five commercially-available and one custom-made <b>cold</b> <b>plates</b> were characterised experimentally. The six <b>cold</b> <b>plates</b> utilized different geometries which included: an array of jets impinging onto a pin matrix; a fin structure; a pin fin structure; a large serpentine channel structure; a slot jet impinging onto wave shaped fins; and the custom cold plate having no significant geometry associated with it, as it {{was used as a}} bench mark. The bench mark is anticipated to be the minimum cost solution. The pressure drop, thermal resistance and hydrodynamic power consumption were determined for each solution as a function of flow rate. The results showed that there was a variety of operational power consumption costs coupled with a range of performance levels reached by the six <b>cold</b> <b>plates.</b> This emphasizes the need of a optimum cooling package for a specific application. A relationship of thermal resistance as a function of hydrodynamic power consumed was formulated, thus facilitating the selection of a cold plate for a practical application.
