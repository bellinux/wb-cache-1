40|$|This study {{adopted a}} positivistic {{paradigm}} and employed mixed research methods in {{data collection and}} analysis. Covering seven tax regions in Tanzania, surveys and semi-structured interviews were administered to collect data from 205 VAT registered SME taxpayers and 32 Tanzanian Revenue Authority (TRA) tax officials respectively. A deductive logic guided the statistical testing {{of a range of}} hypothesised relationships between tax compliance factors and nine measures of VAT compliance in Tanzania. The researcher identified tax compliance factors from economic and behavioural theories of tax compliance and the general tax literature. Content analysis of qualitative data provided results to corroborate the results from statistical analysis of quantitative data. The findings of the current study indicate partial ability of the economic theory to explain VAT compliance in a developing country, Tanzania. Based on the economic theory, findings indicate several (but not all) factors were associated with VAT compliant behaviour (e. g. perceived detection likelihood and perceived influence of VAT sanctions). Furthermore, the compliance factor that was more significant and indicated a more consistent association with measures of VAT compliance was the perception that collected VAT is a business asset. This finding adds to the existing evidence that shows most SMEs taxpayers fail to differentiate between business money and VAT money. In addition, not all the associations between compliance factors and measures of VAT compliance were consistent with the economic theory predictions. Overall, while this study contributes to the empirical evidence that supports the applicability of tax compliance theories in a developing country context, it is the behavioural theory of tax compliance that appears to have more support from the current study’s findings than economic theory of tax compliance. One key difference between the current study and other studies in developing countries is the mixed approach adopted in investigating VAT compliance. The approach has helped the researcher to investigate the phenomenon of VAT compliance in a much broader way, and generated broader understanding and explanation of the factors influencing VAT compliance, which might be unique for developing countries. In addition, the current study captures the fragmented and less developed characteristic of tax system in a developing country context by testing the compliance factors’ association with compliant behaviour at the different stages of the VAT <b>compliance</b> <b>cycle</b> (i. e. from the initial stage of identifying/registering taxpayers to the final stage where tax authorities collect/receive VAT revenues). Consequently, the research finds taxpayers’ compliance behaviour to be different at every stage of the VAT <b>compliance</b> <b>cycle.</b> For example, compared to female taxpayers, male taxpayers were less compliant during VAT registration (early stage of the VAT <b>compliance</b> <b>cycle),</b> but became more likely to be compliant by agreeing that they were less likely to make intentional mistakes to reduce VAT liability (later stage of the VAT <b>compliance</b> <b>cycle).</b> Likewise, older SMEs taxpayers were more compliant by voluntarily registering for VAT purpose (early stage of the VAT <b>compliance</b> <b>cycle)</b> but indicated that {{they were more likely to}} submit their VAT returns late (later stage of the VAT <b>compliance</b> <b>cycle),</b> which is a VAT non-compliant behaviour. Based on this, uniquely compared to other studies the findings indicate taxpayers’ compliance behaviour could change from being compliant to being non-compliant even within one VAT complying circle. In conclusion, the overall findings of this study contribute to the limited body of knowledge of VAT compliance in developing countries context. The study also contributes to the knowledge of existing tax theories applicability to both VAT compliance and developing countries context...|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{and reliability of}} the EU ETS depends for a substantial part {{on the level of}} compliance in each of the 31 participating states.

40|$|Abstract. Compliance {{checking}} {{of business}} process models against regulation is inevitable. Due to various sources of compliance requirements, {{a conflict of}} interest of such requirements is very likely. Thus, it is crucial to analyze the relation between compliance rules to discover any possible conflicts before even checking such rules against process models. Although this step is important in the <b>compliance</b> management life <b>cycle,</b> there is almost no work that studied this direction. In this paper, we start by checking for consistency between execution ordering compliance rules expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL), addressing control and data flow aspects. To achieve this, we rely on the generation of Büchi automaton from LTL formulas. However, we show that domain-specific knowledge is of crucial importance to draw correct conclusions...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{transferring}} bulk data in environmentally-powered wireless sensor networks where duty <b>cycle</b> <b>compliance</b> is critical for their uninterrupted operation. We propose Pump-and-Nap, a packet train forwarding technique that maximizes throughput while simultaneously enforcing compliance to dynamic duty cycle limitations. A node using Pump-and-Nap operates by pumping a train of packets followed by a napping period where the node forgoes any transmission. Pump-and-Nap employs an adaptive controller to periodically compute the optimal capacity, that is, the maximum number of packets a node can receive and transmit in a train, given its duty cycle constraint. The controller uses prior input-output observations (capacity allocations and their corresponding duty cycle usage) to continuously tune its performance and adapt to wireless link quality variations. Its use of local information makes the controller easily deployable in a distributed fashion. We implemented Pump-and-Nap in TinyOS and evaluated its performance through experiments and testbed simulations. Results show that Pump-and-Nap provides high transfer throughput while it simultaneously tracks the target duty cycle. More importantly, Pump-and-Nap enables sustainable bulk transfer compared to state-of-the-art techniques that greedily maximize throughput at the expense of downtime due to energy depletion...|$|R

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who received at least three catumaxomab infusions. Secondary endpoints included a composite safety score (CSS) summarising the worst grades for the main catumaxomab-related adverse events (pyrexia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), safety, efficacy and the occurrence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Eight of nine screened patients received a second catumaxomab <b>cycle.</b> <b>Compliance</b> with a catumaxomab re-challenge was high: all eight patients (100  %) received all four infusions.

Median puncture-free survival (48  days) and overall survival (407  days) were longer than in CASIMAS (35 and 103  days, respectively), although median time to next puncture was shorter (60 vs. 97  days). Of six patients sampled, all were ADA positive at screening and remained ADA positive until the end of the study. The presence of ADAs did not affect catumaxomab's safety or efficacy.

40|$|AbstractIn the Philippines, Fisheries Registration and Licensing (FRL) is {{embodied}} in national fisheries laws and local (municipal/city) ordinances. The municipality of Bani in the Province of Pangasinan considers FRL as a feasible strategy {{to support the}} sustainable use of its municipal fisheries resources. Spearheaded by the Office of the Municipal Agriculturist (OMAg), Bani initially implemented an FRL system at the municipal level. There was very low compliance under this system primarily because fisher folk from far-flung villages were unable to afford the high transportation costs {{of going to the}} town center to register. In response, the local government of Bani devolved fisheries registration to the village level. Through Executive Order # 03 enacted by the Municipal Mayor in 2006, village officials were mobilized to implement FRL systems in their jurisdictions. To build their capability to undertake such, they were trained by the OMAg {{with the assistance of the}} Sagip Lingayen Gulf Project. Based on the cost-benefit analysis, devolving FRL to the village level has decreased implementation cost and has also shortened the FRL <b>cycle.</b> <b>Compliance</b> rates from 2003 to 2007 revealed that the devolved system has also been effective in increasing the number of registrants. The devolved system is also credited with having facilitated easy and more reliable monitoring of fishing activities given the proximity of village enforcers to fisher folk. Policy-wise, more effective monitoring resulted in more accurate, valid and timely data inputting into the municipality's sustainable fisheries regulation and management decision support system. To date, not all coastal municipalities/cities in the country are implementing an FRL system, despite its crucial role in sustainable coastal governance and in conferring priority rights to municipal fisheries resources to local fisher folk. Given its merits, the Bani experience in devolving FRL could serve as a model that may be replicated in other areas in the Philippines with the same geographic configuration...|$|R

Our method computes a smooth parting line which runs through a band of triangles whose normals are approximately perpendicular to the parting direction. We generate a skeleton of this triangle band to find its distinct topological cycles, and to decompose it into simple pieces. After selecting paths making a good cycle, we generate a final smooth parting line by iteratively improving the geometry of this <b>cycle.</b> <b>Compliance</b> in the physical material, and / or modifications to eliminate minor undercuts ensure that such a parting line is practically useful. Note to Practitioners — Molding {{is the process of}} manufacturing a part by shaping a pliable raw material, such as molten plastic or metal, using a rigid mold. The material hardens and sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. To remove the part from the mold without destroying the mold, the mold must be made of multiple pieces. In the simplest case, a two-part mold is used, and these parts are separated in opposite directions. The curves {{on the surface of the}} part where the pieces of the mold meet are called ‘parting lines’. For a manufacturing perspective, a smooth parting line is more applicable than a theoretically correct parting line. We give a novel method to compute such a parting line in this paper.

40|$|Mounting {{concerns}} over energy independence and security, oil supply volatility and price, and anthropogenic-derived climate destabilization are driving the strategic development of low-carbon biofuels. Recently, second generation biofuels—fuels derived from non-food biofeedstocks including: perennial grasses, short rotation woody crops (SRWCs), and microalgae have gained significant interest from scientific and political actors {{due to their}} potential for reduced life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to baseline petroleum fuels, and fungibility with existing transportation infrastructure and vehicles fleets. However, the environmental sustainability of these second generation biofuels and their capacity to meet U. S. regulatory biofuel mandates remains uncertain, and a point of scientific inquiry. This work investigates the sustainability of emerging second-generation drop-in replacement hydrocarbon biofuels, utilizing sustainability metrics and methodologies derived from multiple disciplines including life cycle assessment, industrial ecology, statistics, thermodynamics, and process modeling. This novel interdisciplinary life cycle framework is applied to study the environmental sustainability of several distinct emerging drop-in replacement biofuel platforms including: (1) cultivation of microalgae in open raceways ponds and hydro-processing of algal-oil to renewable diesel, (2) fast pyrolysis of perennial grasses and hydro-upgrading of bio-oil to green gasoline, and (3) multistage torrefaction of SRWCs and catalytic upgrading to hydrocarbon biofuels. Traditional process-based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and hybrid Ecologically-based Life Cycle Assessment (EcoLCA) models are developed to assess the degradation of ecological good and services, environmental impacts, and resource intensity of producing drop-in replacement biofuels. Rigorous process modeling and statistical analysis is performed to quantify key sustainability metrics including energy return on investment and life cycle GHG emissions for producing hydrocarbon biofuels under different combinations of biofeedstocks, fuel upgrading pathways, and coproduct scenarios, and to determine if renewable fuel(s) meet <b>compliance</b> with life <b>cycle</b> GHG emissions reductions thresholds set by U. S. federal regulatory programs. This interdisciplinary approach captures broader environmental externalities and unintended consequences of biofuel production that are outside the purview of traditional process design, and allows for holistic understanding of the potential tradeoffs, challenges, and broad-based impacts of emerging biofuels prior to their widespread commercialization—information that is pivotal for guiding the sustainable development of the nascent biofuels industry...|$|R
