40|$|In Finland, poor {{water quality}} and {{associated}} ecological damage in the coastal streams related to land use on acid sulfate (a. s.) soils has been drawing {{a considerable amount of}} attention since the 1950 ’s. These soils originate from sulfide-bearing marine sediments mostly occurring in the coastal areas located below the highest shoreline of the former Litorina Sea. Of the many previous studies carried out on soil or water data, quite few gathered both and their geographic extent was relatively limited. This study aimed at assessing a. s. soil probability maps using two <b>chemical</b> <b>indicators</b> measured in the recipient waters (i. e. sulfate content and sulfate/chloride ratio) for 24 catchments along the Finnish coast. All the available data was compiled for these catchments, which were surveyed using different methods (i. e. conventional mapping and two spatial modeling techniques: fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks). High sulfate contents and sulfate/ chloride ratios measured in these rivers were controlled by a. s. soils in the corresponding catchments. The extent of the most probable areas for a. s. soils in the surveyed catchments correlated with the two <b>chemical</b> <b>indicators</b> measured in the recipient waters, suggesting that the probability maps created with different methods are reliable and comparable. The use of a. s. soil related <b>chemical</b> <b>indicators</b> in water, thus, constitutes a complementary, independent and straightforward tool to assess a. s. soil probability maps...|$|R
40|$|The <b>chemical</b> <b>indicators</b> {{evaluated}} {{in this study}} were based on chemical-specific sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) obtained from several sources. SQGs are numeric values intended to help in the interpretation of sediment chemistry data. SQGs are not intended to be a final assessment of environmental condition at a site, but rather to assist in the determination of the potential for biological effects. Numerical SQGs have been developed using both mechanistic and empirical relationships between chemistry and biological effect. Both types of approaches were {{evaluated in}} the early phases of the SQO project, but the mechanistic approaches (i. e., equilibrium partitioning) {{were not included in the}} final statistical evaluations based on the results of preliminary analyses and the recommendation of the SSC. Three types of empirical <b>chemical</b> <b>indicators</b> were compared and evaluated: established indicators that were based on existing published SQGs that were developed for application on a national level, regional indicators that represent established indicator approaches calibrated to California data, and new indicators developed specifically for this project.

The individual chemical SQGs were integrated using a method specific to each approach to describe mixture effects. The chemicals included in each candidate indicator are shown in Tabl...|$|R

50|$|Tar {{paper is}} more {{accurately}} a Grade D building paper (the Grade D designation derives {{from a federal}} specification in the United States), which is widely used in the West. Building paper is manufactured from virgin kraft paper, unlike felts, and then impregnated with asphalt. The longer fibres in the kraft paper allow for a lighter weight product with similar and often better mechanical properties than felt. Grade papers are rated in minutes—the {{amount of time it}} takes for a moisture sensitive <b>chemical</b> <b>indicator</b> to change colour when a small boat-like sample is floated on water. Common grades include 10, 20, 30, and 60 minute. The higher the rating the more moisture resistant and the heavier. A typical 20 minute paper will weigh about 3.3 lbs per square, a 30-minute paper 3.75, and a 60-minute paper about six. The smaller volume of material however does tend to make these papers less resistant to moisture than heavier felts.|$|E

At the final stage of the plant, reverse osmosis removes stains on glass and the smell left after washing. According to an MMOPL official, [...] "The only action the Metro pilot will have to take is slow the train down to under 5 kmph while in the passage of the plant.
