25|$|The {{traditional}} {{law of the}} Urapmin {{was characterized}} by many rules about religious behavior and an elaborate taboo system, focused especially on eating and land use, as well as regulating what could be touched and who <b>could</b> <b>know</b> what information. According to Urapmin tradition, Afek gave ownership of the wild (sep) to the motobil (nature spirits), who themselves gave ownership of the villages (abiip) to humans.

25|$|The {{first known}} {{suggestion}} for viewing randomness {{in terms of}} complexity was made by Leibniz in an obscure 17th-century document discovered after his death. Leibniz asked how one <b>could</b> <b>know</b> if a set of points {{on a piece of}} paper were selected at random (e.g. by splattering ink) or not. Given that for any set of finite points there is always a mathematical equation that can describe the points, (e.g. by Lagrangian interpolation) the question focuses on the way the points are expressed mathematically. Leibniz viewed the points as random if the function describing them had to be extremely complex. Three centuries later, the same concept was formalized as algorithmic randomness by A. N. Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin as the minimal length of a computer program needed to describe a finite string as random.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of Beethoven's hearing loss, his {{conversation}} books are an unusually rich written resource. Used primarily {{in the last ten}} or so years of his life, his friends wrote in these books so that he <b>could</b> <b>know</b> what they were saying, and he then responded either orally or in the book. The books contain discussions about music and other matters, and give insights into Beethoven's thinking; they are a source for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and also his perception of his relationship to art. Out of a total of 400 conversation books, {{it has been suggested that}} 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after Beethoven's death by his secretary Anton Schindler, who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to survive. However, Theodore Albrecht contests the verity of Schindler's destruction of a large number of conversation books.|$|E
25|$|The {{input-output}} equations {{could be}} made to work, only if additional assumptions were made. But even in a dynamic model, it can be shown mathematically that assumptions (1), (3) and (4) have a crippling effect on the plausibility of longterm quantitative results obtained with the model. However, what ought to be concluded from this modelling exercise, still remains very much in dispute (is the theory wrong, are the concepts and assumptions wrong, is the interpretation of the concepts wrong, is there a big difference between the model and the real world, etc.). The math of the classical transformation problem is rather simple; the real difficulty is about whether the economic relationships involved are adequately conceptualized, and how we <b>could</b> <b>know</b> that. Both Marx and von Bortkiewicz implicitly admitted that assumptions (1), (3), (4) and (5) cannot be true in the real world, and this casts doubt on the importance or relevance of the classical transformation problem.|$|E

25|$|On 3 December 1906 Alfred Richardson, {{was given}} {{permission}} {{to join the}} General and Finance Committee of the Northern Police Orphanage and Convalescent Home in Halifax. Chief Constables were encouraged to add their patronage. He wrote a booklet for his men which was an extract from a Council meeting held on 7 May 1906. It was written so that {{all members of the}} Force <b>could</b> <b>know</b> the regulations to which it was their duty to confirm. In 1907 there were several disturbances in Commercial Road, Halifax, during the tram drivers strike, causing much extra work for the police. The local press praised the constabulary for their restraints in handling this situation. By this time Richardson had increased further the reputation of the force as one with a strict sense of discipline and generally having a smart turn out, a sentiment reflected in the local newspapers. Richardson was known to have a love of horses, even to wearing spurs in his office at Harrison Road. Halifax was soon to have its own horses and stables, rather than hire them. Horses were increasingly seen as effective in crowd control. In the annual inspection by His Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary Sir Llewelyn Atcherley in 1930, the Borough Mounted Police in full dress uniform were presented by Richardson to the Inspector.|$|E

In stanza 52, the {{disguised}} Odin asks the jötunn about Odin's own fate. Vafþrúðnir responds that [...] "the wolf" [...] will consume Odin, and that Víðarr will avenge him by sundering its cold jaws in battle. Odin ends the duel with one final question: what did Odin say to his son before preparing his funeral pyre? With this, Vafþrúðnir realizes that he is dealing with none other than Odin, whom {{he refers to as}} [...] "the wisest of beings," [...] adding that Odin alone <b>could</b> <b>know</b> this.

500|$|She {{graduated}} from high school in 1918, and began working as a stenographer at a local law office. There she met Bernard Nevelson, co-owner with his brother Charles of the Nevelson Brothers Company, a shipping business. Bernard introduced her to his brother, and Charles and Louise Nevelson were married in June 1920 in a Jewish wedding at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston. Having satisfied her parent's hope that she would marry into a wealthy family, she and her new husband moved to New York City, where she began to study painting, drawing, singing, acting and dancing. She also became pregnant, and in 1922 she gave birth to her son Myron (later called Mike), who grew up to be a sculptor. Nevelson studied art, despite the disapproval of her parents-in-law. She commented: [...] "My husband's family was terribly refined. Within that circle you <b>could</b> <b>know</b> Beethoven, but God forbid if you were Beethoven." ...|$|E
