6000|$|In Egypt, {{the earlier}} ages and the later times beheld a land {{dominated}} {{by the thought of}} death, whose shadow falls on the monarch on his crowning day, whose whisper bids him send to far-off shores for the granite and the alabaster of the tomb. As life was ruled by the idea of death; so was fact conquered by dream, and all realities hastened to lose themselves in symbols; all gods rushed to merge their identity in the sun, as moths fly towards the flame of a candle. This spectacle of a race obedient to the dead and bowing down before the beasts, this procession of gods that were their own fathers and members together in Ra, wakened the interest of the Greeks, who were even more excited by the mystery of extreme age that hid the beginnings of Egypt. Full of their own memories and legends of tribal movements, of migrations, of invasions, the Greeks acknowledged themselves children of yesterday in face of a secular empire with an origin so remote that it was scarcely guessed at in the conjectures of fable. Egypt presented to them, as to us, the spectacle of antique civilisation without a known beginning. The spade of to-day reveals no more than the traditions of two thousand years ago. The most ancient relics of the earliest dynasty are the massive works of an organised society and an accomplished art. There is an unbridged interval between the builders of the mysterious temple hard by the Sphinx and their predecessors, the <b>chippers</b> of palaeolithic flint axes in the river drift. We know not whence the Egyptians came; we only trifle with hypotheses when we conjecture that her people are of an Asiatic or an African stock; we know not whether her gods arose in the fertile swamps by Nile-side, or whether they were borne in arks, like the Huitzilopochtli of Mexico, from more ancient seats by the piety of their worshippers. Yet as one great river of mysterious source flows throughout all Egypt, so through the brakes and jungles of her religion flows one great myth from a distant fountain-head, the myth of Osiris.* ...|$|E

50|$|Stacked dado set {{consists}} of two circular saw blades fixed {{on either side of}} a set of removable <b>chippers.</b> As the dado set spins, the two outside blades cut the dado walls and the <b>chippers</b> remove the waste material in between and smooth the bottom of the dado. The <b>chippers</b> are added or removed to the set as required to make a dado of the desired width. <b>Chippers</b> can also be interspersed with spacers to finely adjust the dado width. Consequently, changing the dado width requires the complete removal of the dado blade set from the arbor. After disassembly, <b>chippers</b> and/or spacers are used to achieve the desired width of the dado set.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, several demands {{placed on}} concept {{description}} algorithms are identified and discussed. The most important criterion {{is the ability}} to produce compact rule sets that, in a natural and accurate way, describe the most important relationships in the underlying domain. An algorithm based on the identified criteria is presented and evaluated. The algorithm, named <b>Chipper,</b> produces decision lists, where each rule covers a maximum number of remaining instances while meeting requested accuracy requirements. In the experiments, <b>Chipper</b> is evaluated on nine UCI data sets. The main result is that <b>Chipper</b> produces compact and understandable rule sets, clearly fulfilling the overall goal of concept description. In the experiments, <b>Chipper's</b> accuracy is similar to standard decision tree and rule induction algorithms, while rule sets have superior comprehensibility...|$|R

However, he is an incorrigible liar, an indefatigable flirt, and completely self-centered. Tomcat in Love is more picaresque than Bildungsroman.|$|R
