40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} among singers and voice trainers that {{singing in the}} same manner for opening throat like yawn may result in increasing the resonance and thus allow singers to express the content of music in detail. We carried out an experiment to investigate whether the practice is effective in improving vocal skills. We employed a female singer, whose repertoire is mostly consisted of classical music, and asked her to adopt the particular way of singing. We measured its effect in two aspects: 1) Objectively, we measured the vibration of her body while she was singing using a laser interferometer, an innovative optical sensing technology, and 2) Inter-subjectively, we measured how listeners perceived the content of music composition with a questionnaire. As the result, we found the technique to be effective in increasing the resonance of the voice by opening the <b>cavity</b> <b>of</b> larynx and <b>pharynx.</b> The FFT analysis of the vibration revealed that the spectrum values around high tones(750 - 800 Hz) were distinctively high when she opened the <b>cavity</b> <b>of</b> larynx and <b>pharynx,</b> compared to the ones when she did not adopt such a technique. We examined how thirty listeners perceived the content of a song by adopting the Music appreciation evaluation experiment (Mood Adjective Check List) to observe its effects as we expected. We conclude that the singing, in which the throat opens like yawn, resulted in increasing the resonance of voice. We believe that our finding will help singers to improve his or her vocal-skill in musically meaningful ways. I...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} the cellular events during planarian regeneration, we analyzed the process <b>of</b> <b>pharynx</b> regeneration in both head and tail pieces using cell-type-specific markers. Interestingly, cells expressing the pharynx-muscle-specific myosin heavy chain gene (DjMHC-A) appeared within 24 h after amputation (prior {{to the formation}} <b>of</b> a <b>pharynx</b> rudiment) in the mesenchymal space of the stump, not in the blastema region. These DjMHC-A-positive cells migrated to the midline and formed the pharynx rudiment. Even after formation <b>of</b> the <b>pharynx</b> rudiment, DjMHC-A-positive cells constantly appeared in the mesenchymal space in the region surrounding the pharynx rudiment and participated in the growth <b>of</b> the <b>pharynx</b> rudiment. These observations clearly indicated that the cells involved in pharynx-muscle formation are committed in the mesenchymal space of the stump, {{rather than in the}} blastema region or the pharynx rudiment during planarian regeneration.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} postoperative changes of volume and morphology <b>of</b> <b>pharynx</b> and evaluate the relationship between the changes and swallowing functions by videofluoroscopy in patients with surgically treated oral cancer. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients diagnosed with oral cancer who treated surgically in Hokkaido University Hospital from January 2002 to March 2010. All patients were performed reconstruction with the free flap. We evaluated the volume and morphology <b>of</b> <b>pharynx</b> using CT scan at preoperatively and 6, 12 and 24 month and more than after surgery. Assessment of the swallowing function was videofluoroscopic evaluation that performed at more than 24 month postoperatively. Additionally, duration of tongue base contact to posterior pharyngeal wall was measured by using videofluoroscopy. Results: Twenty one patients (13 males and 8 females) were enrolled in this study. Of 21 patients, 14 were undergone partial or subtotal glossectomy and 7 patients mandibular resection. It was showed that the volume <b>of</b> <b>pharynx</b> after surgery changed and unchanged. Some patients had larger antero-posterior diameters <b>of</b> <b>pharynx</b> than preoperation. Patients whose volume <b>of</b> <b>pharynx</b> increased showed poor swallowing function. They showed aspiration or penetration and reverse of bolus into oral cavity and pharyngeal residue. And their duration of tongue base contact to posterior pharyngeal wall was significantly shorter than others(p< 0. 01). Conclusion: In patients with oral cancer swallowing function after surgery related with volume of oropharynx especially antero-posterior pharyngeal diameters. 【目的】進行口腔がんの手術療法では外科的切除と遊離皮弁による再建が行われることが多い．一般に皮弁の形態は経時的に変化し，収縮や周囲組織の瘢痕化などを伴って隣接する咽頭腔の形態もまた変化すると言われている．しかし，これまで咽頭腔の形態や容積の変化を経時的に評価した報告は少なく，嚥下機能との関連について評価した報告はさらに少ない．本研究の目的は，口腔がん術後症例の咽頭腔形態と容積を経時的に評価し，嚥下造影検査による嚥下機能との関連性を明らかにすることである．【対象および方法】研究は後向きコホート研究で行った． 2002 年 1 月から 2010 年 3 月までの期間に北海道大学病院口腔外科で治療を行った口腔がん患者のうち，原発巣の切除と遊離皮弁による再建手術を行い， 3 年以上の経過観察を行い資料の整っている患者を対象とした．咽頭腔の形態分析は術前および術後に経時的に撮影したCT画像を用いて行い，咽頭腔容積，咽頭腔断面積，咽頭腔前後径および左右径を分析した．嚥下機能評価は，嚥下造影検査を行い咽頭期の嚥下動態を評価した．【結果】対象は舌がん 13 例，下顎歯肉がん患者 7 例，口底がん患者 1 例の計 21 例であった．術後の咽頭腔容積は評価期間内で増大している症例と術前とほぼ変化なく推移している症例があった．さらに咽頭腔断面形態を精査すると，咽頭腔前後径あるいは咽頭腔左右径が増大しているものにわかれた．嚥下咽頭期の動態評価を行ったところ，咽頭腔前後径が増大した症例で咽頭期の障害が多く認められた．また，咽頭腔前後径が増大している症例ではその他の症例と比べて舌根・咽頭後壁接触時間が有意に減少していた．【結論】口腔がん術後の咽頭腔容積は，増大している症例とほとんど変化しない症例とにわけられた．手術の影響により咽頭腔前後径や咽頭腔左右径が長くなり咽頭腔断面積は増大することで咽頭腔容積が増大している症例が多くみられた．とくに咽頭腔前後径の増大は術後の嚥下機能障害と関連することが示唆された...|$|R

40|$|We reinvestigated the clonal {{diversity}} and dynamics of Streptococcus mitis {{and two other}} abundant members of the commensal microbiota of the upper respiratory tract, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus infantis, to obtain information {{about the origin of}} frequently emerging clones in this habitat. A culture-independent method was used, based on cloning and sequencing of PCR amplicons of the housekeeping gene gdh, which shows remarkable, yet species-specific, genetic polymorphism. Samples were collected from all potential ecological niches in the oral <b>cavity</b> and <b>pharynx</b> <b>of</b> two adults on two occasions separated by 2 years. Based on analysis of close to 10, 000 sequences, significant diversity was observed in populations of all three species. Fluctuations in the relative proportions of individual clones and species were observed over time. While a few clones dominated, the proportions of most clones were very small. The results show that the frequent turnover of S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. infantis clones observed by cultivation can be explained by fluctuations in the relative proportions of clones, most of which are below the level of detection by the traditional culture technique, possibly combined with loss and acquisition from contacts. These findings provide a platform for understanding the mechanisms that govern the balance within the complex microbiota at mucosal sites and between the microbiota and the mucosal immune system of the host...|$|R

40|$|Patency of the {{collapsible}} segment <b>of</b> the <b>pharynx</b> {{is dependent}} upon the interplay of anatomic and physiologic factors. The upper airway of the typical patient with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is structurally narrowed by fat deposits in the lateral pharyngeal walls. During wakefulness, the upper airway dilator muscles compensate for the structurally reduced pharyngeal size by increasing their activity, thereby pulling the tongue and soft palate forward. As a consequence, the cross-sectional area is relatively preserved, but the shape <b>of</b> the <b>pharynx</b> becomes elliptical along the anteroposterior axis. In the awake patient with OSA, patency <b>of</b> the <b>pharynx</b> is largely dependent upon increased dilator muscle activity. During sleep, {{the activity of the}} muscular apparatus <b>of</b> the <b>pharynx</b> decreases causing a critical narrowing. Because anatomic narrowing appears to be a basic feature, enlarging the pharynx should be beneficial, particularly if its lateral diameter can be increased. Whereas facial advancement surgery structurally increases the anteroposterior diameter <b>of</b> the <b>pharynx,</b> thereby accounting for the good results reported with this technique, it is doubtful that uvulopalatopharyngoplasty has a similar effect on either the anter-oposterior or lateral diameters <b>of</b> the <b>pharynx...</b>|$|R
