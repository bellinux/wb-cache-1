This paper explains how <b>consultation</b> may become an even larger focus in the job of the practitioner.

However, no supporting data are cited; thus it is unclear whether these three <b>consultation</b> models are the most prominent in school psychology today. The current study evaluated the <b>consultation</b> literature over the past twenty-two years in the professional journal School Psychology Review. <b>Consultation</b> articles were analyzed to obtain information regarding the frequency of <b>consultation</b> articles published, the most frequent types of <b>consultation</b> mentioned, topics addressed, and the type of research conducted. Data collected found a minimal decrease in the amount of <b>consultation</b> articles published over the past twenty-two years. A wide array of terminology was found in referring to types of <b>consultation.</b> Behavioral <b>consultation</b> was found to be the most frequently researched and mentioned model.

40|$|<b>Consultation</b> {{research}} {{to date has}} largely concentrated on how <b>consultation</b> practices generally serve only the purpose of procedural compliance. This article identifies and explores the gap in existing research {{on the impact of}} law on <b>consultation</b> practices and purposes. To explore current practices and the potential contribution of law to the nature of <b>consultation</b> practices, the article focuses on the NSW duty to consult Aboriginal people before permitting harm to Aboriginal cultural heritage. Conventional regulatory approaches to <b>consultation</b> assume that Aboriginal interests are accommodated by the same <b>consultation</b> strategies applied to other stakeholders in rural law and policy. This article uses an administrative law doctrinal research approach to identify the specific issues and requirements for Aboriginal <b>consultation</b> relating to cultural heritage. Consideration is given to the effectiveness of the case study <b>consultation</b> requirements, the duty design, and the recent Land and Environment Court judgment of Ashton Coal Operations Pty Limited v Director-General, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water. The article argues that statutory <b>consultation</b> requirements and purposes can, and should, be taken more seriously. The law reform discussion highlighted in the paper considers how identified <b>consultation</b> requirements can be incorporated into Australian Cultural Heritage legislation, and the possible impact of such incorporation on the purpose of the <b>consultation.</b> More broadly, the law reform discussion indicates that when <b>consultation</b> requirements are tailored to suit the purpose of the <b>consultation</b> and the <b>consultation</b> parties, the law can play a positive role in <b>consultation,</b> engagement and capacity building...|$|R

40|$|<b>Consultation</b> is a {{prominent}} indirect service delivery method {{in school psychology}} today. Several publications endorsed by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) have traditionally suggested the mental health, organizational, and behavioral models of <b>consultation</b> as the three prominent <b>consultation</b> models {{in the field of}} school psychology. However, no supporting data are cited and it is unclear if these three models are still prominent in school psychology today. The present research examined the <b>consultation</b> literature over the last 22 years in two prominent school psychology journals, Journal of School Psychology and School Psychology Quarterly (originally called Professional School Psychology). This research involved the analysis of 145 <b>consultation</b> articles from the school psychology literature. The data was analyzed to obtain information regarding the frequency of <b>consultation</b> articles published, any trend that emerged from this data, the most frequent types of <b>consultation</b> mentioned, the type of research conducted, and topics addressed in the articles. Analysis of <b>consultation</b> trends over time indicated a decrease in the frequency of <b>consultation</b> articles published over time in both journals. The terms utilized to address <b>consultation</b> models are greatly varied, demonstrated by the 107 different types of <b>consultation</b> referenced in the <b>consultation</b> articles. Clearly, behavioral <b>consultation</b> is the most frequently researched and referenced <b>consultation</b> model in the literature. The results suggested the three traditional prominent models have been modified over time. Mental health <b>consultation</b> and behavioral <b>consultation</b> were consistently found within the top three models researched and referenced; however, organizational <b>consultation</b> was infrequently mentioned in the literature and researched in only 4 % of the articles reviewed for this study. Therefore, it appeared that organizational <b>consultation</b> is no longer considered {{a prominent}} model of <b>consultation.</b> Analysis of the articles that were not research oriented indicated that 76 % of the articles focused on application of <b>consultation.</b> The topics of multiculturalism, training, and ethics were the focal point to a lesser extent, with each representing fewer than 5 % of articles. Research focused articles that involved aspects of both questionnaire and intervention research tools were employed more frequently than were research involving only questionnaire research or intervention research. Implications for the present findings and future directions for <b>consultation</b> research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Consultation</b> is {{a crucial}} role for school {{psychology}} practitioners. Psychologists routinely use <b>consultation</b> within the schools and actually wish they could spend more of their work hours on this activity. However, when authors write about <b>consultation</b> in the school psychology literature, they use numerous terms and phrases, which cause confusion as to what models of <b>consultation</b> are prominent in the field. The focus {{of the current study}} is to examine the articles that mention <b>consultation</b> in School Psychology Review (Digest) in order to determine whether the three traditional models (behavioral, mental health, and organizational <b>consultation)</b> are still prominent in <b>consultation</b> research and school psychology literature. Analyses of all articles containing the word 2 ̆ 2 <b>consultation</b> 2 ̆ 2 and all words preceding the word 2 ̆ 2 <b>consultation</b> 2 ̆ 2 were done to find the most frequently mentioned <b>consultation</b> terms. Analyses were then done on just the <b>consultation</b> research articles as well as other sources in order to find which terms are most frequently mentioned as part of studies and how the most prominent terms originated. The findings revealed that while behavioral <b>consultation</b> seems to be the traditional model still dominating the literature, mental health and organizational are beginning to fall behind in a shift from using specific models to more frequently using generic terms such as school, school-based or teacher <b>consultation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>consultation</b> between senior managers and employee representatives {{has a long}} history in British employment relations yet has often been overshadowed by discussions on collective bargaining. In the last few decades, the importance of <b>consultation</b> has been elevated by two main trends: the decline in trade union membership and the retreat from collective bargaining in the private sector on the one hand, with the result that <b>consultation</b> may be the only form of collective employee voice available; and the programme of legislative support for <b>consultation</b> by the European Union since the 1970 s on the other. The book charts the meaning and development of <b>consultation</b> in the twentieth century and explores the justifications for the practice. It shows how EU intervention to promote <b>consultation</b> evolved and changed, paying particular attention to the adoption of the Information and <b>Consultation</b> of Employees (ICE) Regulations, which became fully operational in enterprises with 50 or more employees in 2008. Analysing the half-hearted response to EU <b>consultation</b> initiatives by the social partners in Britain, it provides a critical assessment of successive UK governments' handling of the issue. Drawing on the authors' empirical research in twenty-five organizations, the book closely examines the take-up and impact of <b>consultation</b> regulations, and explores the processes involved in effective <b>consultation.</b> <b>Consultation</b> at Work looks at the dynamics of <b>consultation</b> and draws a contrast between 'active' <b>consultation</b> of the type envisaged by the EU, and more limited <b>consultation</b> used as a means of communication.
