50|$|Another {{variation}} of meerschaum pipe is the calabash pipe made iconic by William Gillette's stage portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. The calabash is a gourd {{similar to a}} squash, grown specifically for use in pipes. The shape is determined as the gourd grows by placing small blocks under the stem, forcing it into a gentle curve. The mature gourd is cut and dried, then fitted with a <b>cork</b> <b>gasket</b> to receive a meerschaum bowl. The finished pipe offers one of the coolest, driest smokes available.|$|E
50|$|A Flit gun {{consists}} of a pneumatic pump cylinder with a hand-operated piston to force air through an air nozzle in the front. Below {{the front of the}} pneumatic tube hangs a cylindrical container designed to act as a reservoir for liquid insecticide, this reservoir being set at 90 degrees to the pneumatic tube. In early versions, the reservoir is permanently secured to the pump and equipped with a removable, gasketed screw cap for filling. In later, improved versions, the insecticide reservoir is secured to the pump with a coarse screw fitting and a seal of <b>cork</b> composite or <b>gasket</b> paper, so that it can readily be unscrewed for filling. A siphon tube extends from the pump cylinder downward into the reservoir and {{the upper end of the}} siphon is positioned in front of a nozzle on the air pump. When a jet of high-velocity air exits the pump and streams across end of the siphon tube, it lowers the pressure in the siphon, drawing insecticide upward from the reservoir, which then atomizes the liquid as it is entrained in the air jet. With each vigorous forward stroke of the pump handle a burst of spray is produced, similar to that of a modern aerosol spray can.|$|R
