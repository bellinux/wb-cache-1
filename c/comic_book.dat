5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} <b>Comic</b> <b>Book</b> Guy {{to publish}} a <b>comic</b> <b>book</b> he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of <b>comic</b> <b>book</b> he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. <b>Comic</b> <b>Book</b> Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When <b>Comic</b> <b>Book</b> Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{relationship}} between internal working models derived from adult attachment and the memory and the preference of <b>comic</b> <b>books.</b> It was hypothesized that <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> that carry themes that are consistent with one’s internal working modes would be remembered better. At first, a list of 120 <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> was created. Then, using a 13 item scales, themes of these <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> were rated by 6 judges who read all the <b>comic</b> <b>books.</b> Seventy-six subjects indicated whether they remembered each of the 120 <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> on the list. They also indicated the 10 most preferred <b>comic</b> <b>books.</b> Those who scored high on the avoidance and anxious/ambivalent subscales of adult attachment tended to remember <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> that contain the themes of action and lonely heroes/heroines. In addition, the analyses of the preferred <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> showed different patterns of correlations from the analyses of the memory, which further supported the hypothesis. The contribution of the present study to the adult attachment literature is that the present study found the concept of the internal working modes can be applied to non-self referent materials...|$|R
