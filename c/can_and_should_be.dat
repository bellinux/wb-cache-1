25|$|The social, {{communicative}} {{practice of}} argumentation <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> distinguished from implication (or entailment)—a relationship between propositions; and from inference—a mental activity typically {{thought of as}} the drawing of a conclusion from premises. Informal logic may thus be said to be a logic of argumentation, as distinguished from implication and inference.|$|E

25|$|Many Humanists adopt {{principles}} of the Golden Rule. Some believe that universal moral standards are required for the proper functioning of society. However, they believe such necessary universality <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> achieved by developing a richer notion of morality through reason, experience and scientific inquiry rather than through faith in a supernatural realm or source.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{differences}} between the different disciplines <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> catered for by the use of appropriate shoes. On the same surface a dance shoe with a leather or suede sole will give much less traction than a gym shoe with a composite rubber sole. A sticky floor used for gym is very likely to cause twisted ankles, and a slippery floor used for dancing is liable to cause bad falls.|$|E
25|$|Contravariant and {{covariant}} vectors are geometrically {{very different}} objects. The first <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{thought of as}} arrows. A linear functional can be characterized by two objects: its kernel, which is a hyperplane passing through the origin, and its norm. Geometrically thus covariant vectors should viewed {{as a set of}} hyperplanes, with spacing depending on the norm (bigger = smaller spacing), with one of them (the kernel) passing through the origin. The mathematical term for a covariant vector is 1-covector or 1-form (though the latter is usually reserved for covector fields).|$|E

25|$|The church recognizes and officially welcomes {{gays and}} lesbians as members under {{condition}} that they attempt to live the church's moral code. The church teaches that homosexual feelings, as distinct from behavior, may sometimes seem to be inborn, and that although these feelings are sometimes unwanted, they <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> controlled. The church's law of chastity forbids homosexual sex in all contexts. Consistently breaking the law of chastity may result in excommunication. Nevertheless, Latter-day Saints who identify themselves as gay or lesbian may remain in good standing in the church, without ramification, if they abstain from homosexual relations.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 {{a number}} of Conservative rabbis issued responsa on the same subject, arguing that women <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> counted in the prayer minyan. These papers were written {{as part of the}} process of JTS {{deciding}} on whether or not to admit women to its rabbinic and cantorial programs. However, the Chancellor of JTS at the time took this process out of the hands of the CJLS, and made the process an affair of the JTS faculty, a move that caused strong controversy, and several resignations of Talmud faculty from JTS. The decision to allow women to become rabbinical and cantorial candidates was then based on a vote of JTS faculty, in principle based on their readings of these responsa and their own understanding of the relevant texts.|$|E
25|$|While Conservative Judaism would {{affirm that}} the Torah is Divine in its origin, the revelation at Sinai {{is seen as}} the {{beginning}} of a relationship and not the final word. Interpretation is understood as our communal attempt to understand the will of a compassionate Divine partner. As we mature we are able to understand God's will for us more clearly. If a law appears unconscionable, we would say that the shortcoming is either our previous understanding or that circumstances have so changed that the rule no longer meets its intended result...The Conservative movement maintains {{that the purpose of the}} law in the first place is largely to concretize moral values, and so the specific form of the law <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> changed if it is not effectively doing that. In other words, the Aggadah should control the halakha.|$|E

In the construction industry it has never been very fully applied. This is a mistake [1].

500|$|The volume {{contains}} {{a number of}} arguments. However, four themes have {{a central role in}} the overall work. The first theme given treatment in the analysis is that the lust for power is a part of human nature. Second, the work emphasises that there are different forms of social power, and that these forms are substantially interrelated. Third, Power insists that [...] "organisations are usually connected with certain kinds of individuals". Finally, the work ends by arguing that [...] "arbitrary rulership <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> subdued".|$|E

Jews should engage constructively with the world that they are in to foster goodness and justice within both themselves and the larger community, such as by avoiding sin in their personal lives while also caring for the unfortunate.|$|E

In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon {{is a fact of}} life and those who believe the dragon <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.|$|E
