The Metis notch serves as their boundary. The fine structure of the main ring was discovered in data from the Galileo orbiter and is clearly visible in back-scattered images obtained from New Horizons in February–March 2007. The early observations by Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Keck and the Cassini spacecraft failed to detect it, probably due to insufficient spatial resolution. However the fine structure was observed by the Keck telescope using adaptive optics in 2002–2003.|$|E

50|$|Highway 403, {{although}} {{one of the}} first divided highways conceived for Ontario, {{is one of the most}} recently completed freeways in the province; the multiple segments of the route did not become continuous until 2002. Planning for the route was underway by 1958, with the completion of the Freeman Bypass along the QEW providing a three-legged junction for the new freeway. Sections of Highway 403 through Hamilton opened between December 1963 and September 1969. An isolated section known as the Brantford Bypass was opened in October 1966, and would remain unconnected to other freeways for over 20 years. Plans for a third segment through Mississauga were contemplated throughout the 1960s, but were not finalized until late 1977, after which construction began. Portions opened at both ends in 1980 and 1981, while the <b>central</b> <b>gap,</b> crossing the Credit River, was completed in December 1982.|$|E
5000|$|Most trusses {{have the}} lower chord under tension {{and the upper}} chord under compression. In a {{cantilever}} truss the situation is reversed, at least over {{a portion of the}} span. The typical cantilever truss bridge is a [...] "balanced cantilever", which enables the construction to proceed outward from a central vertical spar in each direction. Usually these are built in pairs until the outer sections may be anchored to footings. A <b>central</b> <b>gap,</b> if present, can then be filled by lifting a conventional truss into place or by building it in place using a [...] "traveling support". In another method of construction, one outboard half of each balanced truss is built upon temporary falsework. When the outboard halves are completed and anchor the inboard halves may then be constructed and the center section completed as described above.|$|E
5000|$|The usual {{solution}} for high-performance aero-engines is a [...] "forked" [...] connecting rod.

A common arrangement for forked rods is for the fork rod to have a single wide bearing sleeve that spans the whole width of the rod, including the <b>central</b> <b>gap.</b> The blade rod then runs, not directly on the crankpin, but on the outside of this sleeve. The two rods do not rotate relative to each other, merely oscillate back and forth, so this bearing is relatively lightly loaded and runs as a much lower surface speed. However the bearing movement also becomes reciprocating rather than continuously rotating, which is a more difficult problem for lubrication.|$|E

5000|$|Within Merkel's {{model of}} {{embedded}} democracy, {{the regime of}} horizontal accountability works to constitutionally ensure that an appropriate amount of power is shared among the different institutions, which helps secure {{the civil rights of}} the people of the state. There should be agencies with the legal power to expose and punish governmental institutions for corruption or other unlawful actions. This ensures that no one branch gains a preponderance of power and is able to unduly influence the policies and governance of the state. This horizontal accountability works in tandem with vertical accountability, which is the systems by which citizens check the power of the government elections, the media, or civil society. However, horizontal accountability carries more weight in ensuring the internal embeddedness of democracy, as it is more frequently used than vertical accountability and has a more substantial support from the constitution of a state.

5000|$|In {{an attempt}} to catch the {{improving}} capabilities of the factory 962Cs, Lloyd commissioned {{the construction of a}} new car for the 1987 season. [...] As before, the monocoque was designed by Nigel Stroud, while standard 962 parts were adapted to fit alongside custom-built pieces. The first chassis, intentionally retaining the identification #106B but not the same chassis as used on the 956 GTi, once again featured noticeable differences from its factory brethren. The rear of the car was completely redesigned, with the rear wing no longer part of the long tail bodywork. Instead, the wing hung off the rear of the car, attached only by struts at the center.As the 1987 season continued on, modifications were made to the front of the car as well. The fenders and nose were rounded off, while the front brake cooling ducts and smaller headlights featured an all-new design.

40|$|Young close {{binaries}} open <b>central</b> <b>gaps</b> in {{the surrounding}} circumbinary accretion disc, but the stellar components may still gain mass from gas crossing through the gap. It is not well understood how this process operates and how the stellar components are affected by such inflows. Our main goal is to investigate how gas accretion takes place and evolves in close T Tauri binary systems. In particular, we model the accretion flows around two close T Tauri binaries, V 4046 Sgr and DQ Tau, both showing peri-odic changes in emission lines, although their orbital characteristics are very different. In order to derive the density and velocity maps of the circumbinary material, we em-ploy two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with a locally isothermal equation of state. The flow patterns become quasi-stable after a few orbits in the frame co-rotating with the system. Gas flows across the circumbinary gap through the co-rotating La-grangian points, and local circumstellar discs develop around both components. Spiral density patterns develop in the circumbinary disc that transport angular momentum efficiently. Mass is preferentially channelled towards the primary and its circumstella...|$|R
40|$|Gray disks {{inserted}} into the <b>central</b> <b>gaps</b> of an Ehrenstein pattern appear to lighten up and scintillate with each movement of the eye or stimulus pattern. We call this phenomenon scintillating lustre. Both phenomena [...] illusory brightness and scintillating lustre [...] depend {{on the presence of}} the radial inducing lines converging onto the gaps. Without the radii the gray disks appear matte. Using parametric stimulus variation, we show that the strength of scintillating lustre covaries with line-induced brightness enhancement when the length, width, number, and contrast of the radial lines, as well as the size of the gaps in the Ehrenstein figure, are varied. Following the proposal by Anstis (2000, Vision Research 40 2551 - 2556), we suggest that lustre results from a competition between the ON and OFF visual pathways. Whereas Helmholtz's binocular gloss is elicited by stereoscopically fused incremental and decremental stimuli, the present study demonstrates that lustre can also arise from the interaction between line-induced brightness (illusory increment) and a dark gray disk (physical decrement) ...|$|R

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the herringbone gear {{is that it}} cannot be cut by simple gear hobbing machines, as the cutter would run into {{the other half of}} the gear. Solutions to this have included assembling small gears by stacking two helical gears together, cutting the gears with a central groove to provide clearance, and (particularly in the early days) by casting the gears to an accurate pattern and without further machining. With the older method of fabrication, herringbone gears had a central channel separating the two oppositely-angled courses of teeth. This was necessary to permit the shaving tool to run out of the groove. The development of the Sykes gear shaper made it possible to have continuous teeth with no <b>central</b> <b>gap.</b> Sunderland, also in England, also produced a herringbone cutting machine. The Sykes uses cylindrical guides and round cutters; the Sunderland uses straight guides and rack-type cutters. The W. E. Sykes Co. dissolved in 1983-84. Since then it has been common practice to obtain an older machine and rebuild it if necessary to create this unique type of gear. Recently, the Bourn and Koch company has developed a CNC-controlled derivation of the W. E. Sykes design called the HDS1600-300. This machine, like the Sykes gear shaper, has the ability to generate a true apex without the need for a clearance groove cut around the gear. This allows the gears to be used in positive displacement pumping applications, as well as power transmission. Helical gears with low weight, accuracy and strength may be 3D printed.|$|E

Highway 24 is {{intended}} to cross the Sierra Madre Occidental from the area of Hidalgo del Parral, Chihuahua, on the east, {{to the area of}} Culiacán, Sinaloa, on the west. A limited central section of about 40 to 50 km is not yet completed or graded. This section lies between the villages of Los Frailes, Durango, on the east, and Soyatita (also known as El Sabino), Sinaloa, on the west. Travel is possible through this area, where the road is not yet completed, on unimproved roads using high clearance two-wheel drive vehicles. The two unconnected segments that extend through Los Frailes and Soyatita are graded, but each segment is unpaved for about the last 75 km. The <b>central</b> <b>gap</b> in the highway is in the rugged mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental. This uncompleted and unpaved portion of the road is not well signed, there are many intersections with other unpaved roads, and it is easy to get lost off the intended route of the highway.

Just outside Los Frailes, the road coming from the east is at 2,750 meters elevation.
