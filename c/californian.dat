5|$|When The Daily <b>Californian</b> {{published}} {{excerpts from}} the Argonne letter on June 11, the DOE obtained {{a court order to}} prevent further publication. Undeterred, The Daily <b>Californian</b> published the letter in its entirety on June 13. In September, the DOE declared the Hansen letter to be classified and obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting The Daily <b>Californian</b> from publishing it, but the Hansen letter was published by the Madison Press Connection on September 16. The government then moved to dismiss their cases against both The Progressive and The Daily <b>Californian</b> as moot.|$|E

50|$|People {{focus on}} notable differences, {{excluding}} {{those that are}} less conspicuous, when making predictions about happiness or convenience. For example, when people were asked how much happier they believe <b>Californians</b> are compared to Midwesterners, <b>Californians</b> and Midwesterners both said <b>Californians</b> must be considerably happier, when, in fact, {{there was no difference}} between the actual happiness rating of <b>Californians</b> and Midwesterners. The bias lies in that most people asked focused on and overweighed the sunny weather and ostensibly easy-going lifestyle of California and devalued and underrated other aspects of life and determinants of happiness, such as low crime rates and safety from natural disasters like earthquakes (both of which large parts of California lack).|$|R

5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} <b>Californian</b> cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of <b>Californian</b> Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E
5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} <b>Californian</b> subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E

40|$|Although asthma occurs among <b>Californians</b> at all {{socio-economic}} levels, it disproportionately affects low-income <b>Californians,</b> who miss {{more days}} {{of work and}} school, {{are more likely to}} have frequent asthma symptoms, and are more likely to go to the emergency department or be hospitalized for asthma care. In this report, the burden of asthma on low-income <b>Californians</b> is examined by geography, race/ethnicity, age and access to care, among other factors. The authors suggest that disparities in asthma prevalence and care are likely due to a number of factors including inadequate access to health insurance coverage, lack of continuity and quality of health care, and an increased likelihood of exposure to asthma triggers and they point to policy and environmental changes that will likely help address these disparities, including adequate health care coverage, quality health care for low-income <b>Californians</b> with asthma, and asthma-friendly environments...|$|R
