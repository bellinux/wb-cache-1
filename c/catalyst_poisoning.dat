50|$|Inhibition {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning.</b> An inhibitor only hinders the working of a catalyst without changing it, whilst in <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> the catalyst undergoes a chemical reaction that is irreversible in the environment in question (the active catalyst may only be regained by a separate process).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> - {{because of}} the direct contact of the gas with the {{catalytic}} surface it may be deactivated in some circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Purification {{of the air}} and {{sulphur dioxide}} (SO2) is {{necessary}} to avoid <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> (i.e. removing catalytic activities). The gas is then washed with water and dried with sulfuric acid.|$|E
50|$|Substances {{that reduce}} {{the action of}} {{catalysts}} are called catalyst inhibitors if reversible, and <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisons</b> if irreversible. Promoters are substances that increase the catalytic activity, {{even though they are}} not catalysts by themselves.|$|R
50|$|The {{technical}} origins for CO-PrOx lies in {{the synthesis}} of ammonia (Haber process). Ammonia synthesis also has a strict requirement of CO-free syngas, as CO is a strong <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison</b> for the usual catalysts used in this process.|$|R
50|$|The conceptually similar Emde route {{involves}} {{reduction of}} ephedrine to chloroephedrine using thionyl chloride (SOCl2), followed by catalytic hydrogenation. The catalysts for this reaction are palladium or platinum. The Rosenmund route also uses hydrogen gas and a palladium <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoned</b> with barium sulfate (Rosenmund reduction), but uses perchloric acid instead of thionyl chloride.|$|R
5000|$|... a H2S sensor is used {{to detect}} {{hydrogen}} sulphide in the hydrogen feed stream of fuel cells to prevent <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> and to measure the quality of guard beds used to remove sulphur from hydrocarbon fuels.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen purity or {{hydrogen}} {{quality is}} a term to describe the lack of impurities in hydrogen as a fuel gas. The purity requirement varies with the application, for example a H2 ICE can tolerate low hydrogen purity where a hydrogen fuel cell requires high hydrogen purity to prevent <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning.</b>|$|E
50|$|Usually, <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> is {{undesirable}} as {{it leads}} {{to a loss of}} usefulness of expensive noble metals or their complexes. However, poisoning of catalysts can be used to improve selectivity of reactions. Poisoning can allow for selective intermediates to be isolated and final products with desirable stereochemistry to be achieved.|$|E
50|$|The {{process is}} carried out in a stirred tank reactor where the olefin and the syngas are bubbled {{from the bottom of}} the reactor through the {{catalyst}} phase under intensive stirring. The resulting crude aldehyde phase is separated at the top from the aqueous phase. The aqueous catalyst-containing solution is re-heated via a heat exchanger and pumped back into the reactor. The excess olefin and syngas is separated from the aldehyde phase in a stripper and fed back to the reactor. The generated heat is used for the generation of process steam, which is used for subsequent distillation of the organic phase to separate into butyraldehyde and isobutyraldehyde. Potential <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisons</b> coming from the synthesis gas migrate into the organic phase and removed from the reaction with the aldehyde. Thus there is no accumulation of <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisons,</b> and the elaborate fine purification of the syngas can be omitted.|$|R
50|$|Organic {{functional}} {{groups and}} inorganic ions with lone pairs often {{have the ability}} to strongly adsorb to metal surfaces, thus prohibiting access to catalyst sites. Common <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisons</b> include the following: carbon monoxide, inorganic ions such as halide, cyanide, sulfide, sulfite, and phosphite and organic molecules such as nitriles, nitros, oximes and nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Agents vary their catalytic properties {{because of the nature of}} the transition metal.|$|R
40|$|Gas {{dehydration}} is {{a common}} process in gas treatment plant, because water and hydrocarbons can form hydrates, which may block valves and pipelines. In addition, water is <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison</b> in some processes and must be remove before the reaction. It is investigated effectiveness parameter of water adsorption on molecular sieve to find optimum operating condition. The obtained experimental breakthrough curves were fitted to theoretical models {{in order to establish}} the main mechanisms of mass transfer...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} {{generation}} of fuel cells catalysts like palladium, ruthenium and platinum are used in combination with hydrogen production from hydrocarbons which results in performance degradation. The <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> induced by carbon monoxide, formic acid, or formaldehyde can be reversed with a high purity hydrogen stream. Sulfur dioxide is problematic ...|$|E
50|$|Depending on the contaminant, <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> can {{sometimes}} be reversed by running the engine under a very heavy load {{for an extended period}} of time. The increased exhaust temperature {{can sometimes}} vaporise or sublimate the contaminant, removing it from the catalytic surface. However, removal of lead deposits in this manner is usually not possible because of lead's high boiling point.|$|E
50|$|<b>Catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> {{refers to}} the partial or total {{deactivation}} of a catalyst caused by exposure {{to a range of}} chemical compounds. Poisoning may be desirable when it results in improved selectivity (e.g. Lindlar's catalyst) but may be undesirable when the catalyst is rendered ineffective (e.g. Lead in catalytic converters).Poisoning refers specifically to chemical deactivation, rather than other mechanism of catalyst degradation such as thermal decomposition or physical damage.|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} hydrogen pumping by organic getters in {{the presence}} of carbon tetrachloride, and how the reduction of pumping {{in the presence}} of this <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison</b> can be minimized through the choice of catalyst. Catalyst A is shown to be preferred in a clean environment, and catalyst B for a poisoned environment. Additional, we examine the effects of temperature on pumping rates, and show that this getter is effective over a large temperature range from - 23 to 107 degrees Celsius...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFC) can use wide {{varieties}} of fuels such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, alcohols {{as well as}} synthesis gases from natural gas, biogas and petroleum. Using such {{a wide range of}} fuels introduces the risk of unwanted impurities, which can affect the function of the SOFC. One of the known impurities is sulfur which is a well known <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison.</b> This work deals with the effect of H 2 S containing fuel gas on SOFC stack performance as well as regeneration processes and their underlying mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|In some cases, {{a highly}} active {{catalyst}} {{can lead to}} undesirable secondary reactions with desired product. In some of these cases, {{the addition of a}} small amount of a <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison</b> increase the yield of the desired product by lower the catalyst activity. For example, in the classical [...] "Rosenmund reduction" [...] of an acyl chloride to the corresponding aldehyde, the palladium catalyst (over barium sulfate or calcium carbonate) is intentionally poisoned by the addition of sulfur or quinoline in order to lower the catalyst activity and thereby prevent further reduction of the aldehyde product to yield a primary alcohol. In the case of Lindlar's <b>catalyst,</b> palladium is <b>poisoned</b> with a lead salt to allow reduction of an alkyne to the corresponding alkene while preventing reduction of the alkene product to the corresponding alkane.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the advantages previously mentioned associated with incorporating enzymes in fuel cells, hydrogenase is a very efficient catalyst for H2 consumption forming electrons and protons. Platinum is typically the catalyst for this reaction however, the activity of hydrogenases are comparable without the issue of <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> by H2S and CO. In the case of H2/O2 fuel cells, there is no production of greenhouse gases where the product is water.|$|E
50|$|This is one {{solution}} to the challenge {{in the development of}} technologies for the capture and storage of renewable energy as fuel with use on demand. The generation of electricity from H2 is comparable with the similar functionality of Platinum catalysts minus the <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning,</b> and thus is very efficient. In the case of H2/O2 fuel cells, where the product is water, there is no production of greenhouse gases.|$|E
50|$|They {{operate at}} very high temperatures, {{typically}} between 500 and 1,000 Â°C. At these temperatures, SOFCs do not require expensive platinum catalyst material, as is currently necessary for lower temperature fuel cells such as PEMFCs, and are not vulnerable to carbon monoxide <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning.</b> However, vulnerability to sulfur poisoning has been widely observed and the sulfur must be removed before entering the cell {{through the use of}} adsorbent beds or other means.|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of Diesel engine exhaust NOx emissions requires a reductant {{due to the}} composition (high oxygen content) of the exhaust gas. An efficient reductant is selected based on the comparison of literature data of different NOx reduction processes. A process for the on-board synthesis of this reductant is proposed. Based on experimental investigations a modell for the main catalytic unit operation {{of this process is}} derived. This modell is extended to consider also the impact of <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisons.</b> The extended modell is being used to calculate the energetic efficiency of the process by system simulations...|$|R
30|$|The {{numerous}} challenges {{associated with}} the various catalysts necessitate the search for more appropriate materials. Catalysts based on molybdenum carbides have been tested {{in a number of}} hydrotreating reactions (especially hydrodenitrogenation and hydrodesulfuration) and give excellent selectivities, thermal stability and resistance to <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisons</b> (Bussell et al. 2003; Da Costa et al. 2004). They are also considerably cheaper than the bifunctional zeolites. These advantages suggest that if molybdenum carbides could be appropriately designed that they might form good hydroisomerisation catalysts. This study reports on the hydroisomerisation of C 6 to C 9 alkanes over Î²-Mo 2 C supported on sulfated ZrO 2 prepared by in situ carburisation.|$|R
40|$|Model {{compound}} {{testing was}} conducted in a batch reactor to evaluate the effects of trace contaminant components on catalytic hydrogenation of sug-ars. Trace components are potential <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisons</b> when processing biom-ass feedstocks to value-added chemical products. Trace components include inorganic elements such as alkali metals and alkaline earths, phosphorus, sulfur, aluminum, silicon, chloride, or transition metals. Protein components in biomass feedstocks can lead to formation of peptide fractions (from hydro-lysis) or ammonium ions (from more severe breakdown), both of which might interfere with catalysis. The batch reactor tests were performed in a 300 -mL stirred autoclave, with multiple liquid samples withdrawn over {{the period of the}} experiment. Evaluation of these test results suggests that most of the catalyst inhibition is related to nitrogen-containing components.

50|$|Additives {{are also}} used to {{overturn}} conformational preferences, increase reaction concentration, and chelate highly polar groups, such as esters or amides, which can bind to the catalyst. Titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4) is commonly used to chelate polar groups to prevent <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> {{and in the case}} of an ester, the titanium Lewis acid binds the carbonyl oxygen. Once the oxygen is chelated with the titanium it can no longer bind to the ruthenium metal of the catalyst, which would result in catalyst deactivation. This also allows the reaction to be run at a higher effective concentration without dimerization of starting material.|$|E
50|$|This {{includes}} the dusting tower, cooling pipes, scrubbers, drying tower, arsenic purifier and testing box. Sulphur dioxide has many impurities such as vapours, dust particles and arsenous oxide. Therefore, {{it must be}} purified to avoid <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> (i.e.: destroying catalytic activity and loss of efficiency). In this process, the gas is washed with water, and dried by sulphuric acid. In the dusting tower, the sulphur dioxide is exposed to a steam which removes the dust particles. After the gas is cooled, the sulphur dioxide enters the washing tower where it is sprayed by water to remove any soluble impurities. In the drying tower, sulphuric acid is sprayed on the gas to remove the moisture from it. Finally, arsenic oxide is removed when the gas is exposed to ferric hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> {{occurs when}} the {{catalytic}} converter is exposed to exhaust containing substances that coat the working surfaces, so that they cannot contact and react with the exhaust. The most notable contaminant is lead, so vehicles equipped with catalytic converters can run only on unleaded fuel. Other common catalyst poisons include sulfur, manganese (originating primarily from the gasoline additive MMT) and silicon, which can enter the exhaust stream if the engine has a leak that allows coolant into the combustion chamber. Phosphorus is another catalyst contaminant. Although phosphorus is no longer used in gasoline, it (and zinc, another low-level catalyst contaminant) was until recently widely used in engine oil antiwear additives such as zinc dithiophosphate (ZDDP). Beginning in 2004, a limit of phosphorus concentration in engine oils was adopted in the API SM and ILSAC GF-4 specifications.|$|E
40|$|Catalytic {{oligomerization}} of isobutene {{to produce}} triisobutenes has been performed over a cation-exchange resin (Amberlyst- 35) by using commercial C 4 feeds. The catalytic {{activity in the}} oligomerization was retained without deactivation up to 90 h of reaction in a simulated reaction feed without butadiene, but its activity was significantly affected {{by the presence of}} butadiene in commercial C 4 feeds. The isobutene conversion with time-on-stream was significantly decreased in the presence of butadiene, indicating the catalyst deactivation by butadiene. However, the stable activity for trimerization was accomplished when the oligomerization was carried out after eliminating butadiene by hydrogenation of the feeds. This work demonstrates that butadiene plays a role as a <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison</b> on the solid acid catalyst, so that its removal in the reactant feed is essential for practical application of trimerization...|$|R
40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} {{is one of}} {{the alternatives}} to producing liquid fuels and chemicals from biomass residues. The gas produced in gasification contains CO, H 2, H 2 O, CO 2, light hydrocarbons and tars. Depending on the gasifier type, operating conditions and fuel, the light hydrocarbons can contain as much as 50 % of the total energy contents in the gas. The gas also contains <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisons</b> such as sulfur, as H 2 S and COS. This paper presents simulation work of a reverse flow partial oxidation reformer that reaches efficiencies approaching conventional catalytical processes. Furthermore, different reactor designs and parameter variations such as pressure are investigated. For comparison, natural gas simulations are included which clearly show the benefits of using reverse flow operation with lean gases such as gasifier product gas. GREENSYNGA...|$|R
40|$|Terminal acetylenes are {{amongst the}} most {{problematic}} substrates for alkyne metathesis {{because they tend}} to undergo rapid polymerization on contact with a metal alkylidyne. The molybdenum complex 3 endowed with triphenylsilanolate ligands, however, is capable of inducing surprisingly effective cross-metathesis reactions of terminal alkyl acetylenes with propynyl(trimethyl) silane to give products of type R 1 âCâ¡CSiMe. This unconventional way of introducing a silyl substituent onto an alkyne terminus complements the conventional tactics of deprotonation/silylation and excels as an orthogonal way of alkyne protecting group chemistry for substrates bearing base-sensitive functionalities. Moreover, it is shown that even terminal aryl acetylenes can be cross-metathesized with internal alkyne partners. These unprecedented transformations are compatible with various functional groups. The need to suppress acetylene formation, which seems to be a particularly effective <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison,</b> is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|These {{catalysts}} often tend towards deactivation {{and display}} poor reusability qualities. This has {{been attributed to}} a variety of causes including: metal oxidation, metal loss due to leaching or sintering, or a decrease in surface area as a result of pore occlusion. The occurrences of metal leaching and oxidation are observed far less often in catalysts composedof palladium. The cause of <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> can generally be attributed to the COx that forms in the duration of a deCOx reaction or due to sulfur or phosphorusimpurities in the reaction feeds. An additional cause of deactivation may occur as a result of aromatic compounds adsorbing to the catalysts; these compounds being found in the feeds or produced {{during the course of a}} reaction. However, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation can be ascribed to surface area loss due to pore occlusion from deposits on the catalyst surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{continuous}} or floating-catalyst {{process was}} patented earlier by Koyama and Endo {{and was later}} modified by Hatano and coworkers. This process typically yields VGCF with sub-micrometre diameters and lengths of a few to 100 Âµm, which accords with the definition of carbon nanofibers. They utilized organometallic compounds dissolved in a volatile solvent like benzene that would yield a mixture of ultrafine catalyst particles (5-25 nm in diameter) in hydrocarbon gas as the temperature rose to 1100 Â°C. In the furnace, the fiber growth initiates {{on the surface of}} the catalyst particles and continues until <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> occurs by impurities in the system. In the fiber growth mechanism described by Baker and coworkers, only the part of catalyst particle exposed to the gas mixture contributes to the fiber growth and the growth stops as soon as the exposed part is covered, i.e. the catalyst is poisoned. The catalyst particle remains buried in the growth tip of the fiber at a final concentration of about a few parts per million. At this stage, fiber thickening takes place.|$|E
5000|$|Polybenzimidazole {{is able to}} be {{complexed}} {{by strong}} acids because of its basic character. Complexation by phosphoric acid makes it a proton conductive material. This renders the possible application to high temperature fuel cells. Cell performance test show a good stability in performance for 200 h runs at 150 degree. Application in direct methanol fuel cells may be also of interest because of a better selectivity water/methanol compared to existing membranes. Wainright, Wang et al. reported that PBI doped with phosphoric acid was utilized as a high temperature fuel cell electrolyte. The doped PBI high temperature fuel cell electrolyte has several advantages. The elevated temperature increases the kinetic rates of the fuel cell reactions. It also can reduce {{the problem of the}} <b>catalyst</b> <b>poisoning</b> by adsorbed carbon monoxide and it minimizes problems due to electrode flooding. PBI/H3PO4 is conductive even in low relative humidity and it allows less crossover of the methanol at the same time. [...] These contribute PBI/H3PO4 to be superior to some traditional polymer electrolytes such as Nafion. Additionally, PBI/H3PO4 maintains good mechanical strength and toughness. [...] Its modulus is three order of magnitudes greater than that of Nafion. [...] This means that the thinner films can be used, thus reducing ohmic loss.|$|E

Î²-Molybdenum carbide {{supported}} tetragonal {{sulfated zirconia}} was successfully synthesized from in situ carburization of 37.51 Â wt% MoO 3 /SO 42 ââZrO 2 at lower temperatures (650 Â Â°C) than those routinely employed (1, 000 Â Â°C). The catalyst activity was {{highly dependent on}} the length of the n-alkane with shorter alkanes undergoing more rapid reaction. Hydroisomerisation products dominate for the shorter alkanes while the higher alkanes produce products resulting from hydrocracking. Although n-nonane and noctane were converted mainly to hydrocracking products, the high selectivities to hydroisomerisation obtained with n-heptane and n-hexane (â¥ 90 %) at all the temperatures employed suggests the catalyst to have a good potential as hydroisomerisation material and possibly a replacement to the currently used catalysts that are either very expensive or rapidly deactivate due to poor thermal stability, coke deposition or interaction with <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison(s)</b> even in trace quantities.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} the mass transport limitations reported in classical PEMFC electrodes, Pt/carbon xerogel catalysts have great potential to replace Pt/carbon black catalysts. These nanostructured materials with well defined pore texture allow for better gas/water diffusion and better contact between the platinum particles and the ionomer (NafionÂ®). Pt/carbon xerogel catalysts with high metal content (~ 25 wt. %) and high metal dispersion (nanoparticles ca. 2 nm in size) were prepared via the âStrong Electrostatic Adsorptionâ method; the impregnation-drying-reduction step with H 2 PtCl 6 was repeated until the desired metal loading was achieved.
