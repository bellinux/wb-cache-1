Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge {{meat from the}} whalers' <b>catch.</b> <b>Some</b> populations, such as in Alaska's Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted. Pedro de Alvarado camped in {{the centre of}} the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy. They managed to <b>catch</b> <b>some</b> locals and used them to send messages to the Tz'utujil lords, ordering them to submit to the king of Spain. The Tz'utujil leaders responded by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche. Three days after Pedro de Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors. A short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain, although Alvarado did not name them in his letters; they confirmed Kaqchikel reports that further out on the Pacific plain was the kingdom called Izcuintepeque in Nahuatl, or Panatacat in Kaqchikel, whose inhabitants were warlike and hostile towards their neighbours.|$|E
5|$|The Secret River is a {{story of}} Magical realism, {{blending}} real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to <b>catch</b> <b>some</b> fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E

25|$|In 399, Tribigild's {{rebellion}} in Asia Minor allowed Gainas to accumulate a significant army (mostly Goths), become supreme in the Eastern court, and execute Eutropius. He now {{felt that he}} could dispense with Alaric's services and he nominally transferred Alaric's province to the West. This administrative change removed Alaric's Roman rank and his entitlement to legal provisioning for his men, leaving his army– the only significant force in the ravaged Balkans– as a problem for Stilicho. In 400, the citizens of Constantinople revolted against Gainas and massacred as many of his people, soldiers and their families, as they could <b>catch.</b> <b>Some</b> Goths at least built rafts and tried to cross the strip of sea that separates Asia from Europe; the Roman navy slaughtered them. By the beginning of 401, Gainas' head rode a pike through Constantinople while another Gothic general became consul. Meanwhile, groups of Huns started a series of attacks across the Danube, and the Isaurians marauded far and wide in Anatolia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{species of}} fish pursued by anglers vary with geography. Among the many species of salt water fish that are caught for sport are swordfish, marlin, tuna, while in Europe cod and bass are popular targets. In North America the most popular fresh water sport species include bass, pike, walleye, muskellunge, yellow perch, trout, salmon, crappie, {{bluegill}} and sunfish. In Europe {{a large number of}} anglers fish for species such as carp, pike, tench, rudd, roach, European perch, catfish and barbel.

2500|$|Unlike Dungeons & Dragons, which {{typically}} uses a d20 to determine outcomes of particular decisions and events, Call of Cthulhu uses percentile dice (with a results ranging from 1 to 100) to determine such events. Every player statistic {{is intended to}} be compatible with the notion that there is a probability of success for a particular action given what the player is capable of doing. For example, an artist may have a 75% of being able to draw something (represented by having 75 in Art skill), and thus rolling a number under 75 would yield a success. Rolling 1/5 or less of the skill level (1-15 in our example) would be a [...] "special success" [...] (or an [...] "impale" [...] for combat skills) and would yield some extra bonus to be determined by the keeper.

The contract involved the purchase of $30,000,000 worth of knocked-down Ford cars and trucks for assembly during the first four years of the plant’s operation, after which the plant would gradually switch to Soviet-made components. Ford sent his engineers and technicians to the Soviet Union to help install the equipment and train the working force, while over a hundred Soviet engineers and technicians were stationed at Ford’s plants in Detroit and Dearborn “for the purpose of learning the methods and practice of manufacture and assembly in the Company's plants.” Said Ford: “No matter where industry prospers, whether in India or China, or Russia, the more profit there will be for everyone, including us.

2500|$|After {{switching}} distributors from Koch to Navarre, Duck Down unveiled their 2005 [...] "Triple Threat" [...] campaign, featuring {{three new}} Boot Camp releases. The {{first was the}} long delayed solo debut from Heltah Skeltah's Ruck, now going by his birth name Sean Price, Monkey Barz. Largely due to Price's rough, humorous lyrics, the album was the most acclaimed of the three Triple Threat albums, and was named Independent Album of the Year by AllHipHop.com. Monkey Barz saw the reunion of Heltah Skeltah, with Rock appearing on the tracks [...] "Jail Shit" [...] and [...] "Slap Boxing". The second of the Triple Threat albums was a collaboration between Buckshot and Little Brother's 9th Wonder, titled Chemistry. 9th produced all of the album's tracks while Buckshot provided the lyrics, with help from fellow Boot Camp Clik and Justus League members. The album was well-received, but did <b>catch</b> <b>some</b> mixed-reviews from underground audiences.
