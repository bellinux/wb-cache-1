5000|$|In 1990, Starkell {{sought to}} trace the Northwest Passage by kayak. Though {{comparatively}} short - at 3,000 miles - the trip was more difficult due to the cold weather. It lasted three years {{and had to be}} terminated just thirty miles short of its planned <b>completion</b> <b>point</b> at Tuktoyaktuk, due to the onset of winter and frostbite. Starkell lost the tops of his fingers and some of his toes. [...] "When I did the Arctic trip, I gave absolutely everything I had and that was success," [...] he said.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the modified threshold requirements, the 1999 revisions introduced several other changes. First, the six-year structure was abandoned and replaced by a [...] "floating completion point" [...] that allows countries to progress towards completion in less than six years. Second, the revised HIPC allows for interim debt relief so that countries begin to see partial relief before reaching the <b>completion</b> <b>point.</b> Third, the PRGF heavily modified ESAF by curtailing the number and detail of IMF conditions and by encouraging greater input from the local community into the program's design.|$|E

50|$|Zambia {{is still}} dealing with {{economic}} reform {{issues such as}} the size of the public sector, and improving Zambia's social sector delivery systems. Economic regulations and red tape are extensive, and corruption is widespread. The bureaucratic procedures surrounding the process of obtaining licences encourages the widespread use of facilitation payments. Zambia's total foreign debt exceeded $6 billion when the country qualified for Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) debt relief in 2000, contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria. Initially, Zambia hoped to reach the HIPC <b>completion</b> <b>point,</b> and benefit from substantial debt forgiveness, in late 2003.|$|E
5000|$|Going even further, in December 1994, {{creditors}} {{decided to}} implement a new treatment called [...] "Naples terms", which can be implemented {{on a case by}} case basis. Thus, for the poorest and most indebted countries, the level of cancellation of eligible credit is increased to 50% or even 67% (as of September 1999, all treatments carry a 67% debt reduction). In addition, stock of treatments can be applied in each case for countries that have complied satisfactorily previous commitments. Up to 2008, 35 of 39 countries have reached the <b>completion</b> <b>point</b> of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries HIPCs.|$|E

5000|$|While {{applying}} hot patches, kGraft {{does not}} require a running kernel to be stopped for patched versions of functions to be introduced into it. Instead of replacing functions atomically, kGraft provides consistent [...] "world views" [...] (or [...] "universes") to userspace processes, kernel threads and interrupt handlers, which are monitored during their execution so the original versions of patched kernel functions can continue to be used. To accomplish that, kGraft maintains original versions of patched functions in a read-copy-update (RCU) fashion, and dynamically selects between the original and patched versions depending on which process, kernel thread or interrupt handler executes them. More specifically, original versions of functions continue to be usedat the time when a hot patch is appliedfor processes currently executing within the kernel space, for kernel threads until they reach their <b>completion</b> <b>points,</b> and for currently executing interrupt handlers.|$|R

The paper which took exceptions in the above contending complexities within the context of HIPCI in Cameroon and the fact that no World Bank economic partnership agreement had benefited the Africans, it concluded that except the government and people of Cameroon accept to execute government projects without fraudulent practices, the institutionalization of good governance and the eradication of poverty and corruption in South West Region and Cameroon in general will remain a veritable mirage...|$|R
50|$|The {{country was}} deemed {{eligible}} {{to participate in}} the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative in 2008. In June 2010, the country reached the <b>completion</b> <b>point</b> of the HIPC initiative, qualifying it for relief from its entire external debt. That same month, the World Bank and IMF agreed to fund $1.5 billion in writing off the Liberia's multilateral debt. On 16 September, the Paris Club agreed to cancel $1.26 billion, with independent bilateral creditors canceling an additional $107 million, essentially writing off Liberia's remaining external debt. Sirleaf vowed to prevent unsustainable borrowing in the future by restricting annual borrowing to 3% of GDP and limiting expenditure of all borrowed funds to one-off infrastructure projects.|$|E
50|$|One of PRGF's {{goals is}} to ensure that impoverished nations re-channel the {{government}} funds freed from debt repayment into poverty-reduction programs. To that end, each country's PRGF program is modeled around a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). PRSPs describe the macroeconomic, structural, and social programs that a country will follow to promote economic growth and reduce poverty. A broad range of government, NGO, and civil-society groups must participate {{in the development of the}} PRSP to ensure the plan has local support. Under the revised HIPC, a country reaches the decision point once it has demonstrated progress in following its PRSP. The country then reaches its <b>completion</b> <b>point</b> once it has implemented and followed its PRSP for at least one year and has demonstrated macroeconomic stability.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{soon began}} to attack HIPC's scope and its structure. First, they criticized HIPC's {{definition}} of debt sustainability, arguing that the debt-to-export and debt-to-government-revenues criteria were arbitrary and too restrictive. As evidence, critics highlighted that, by 1999, only four countries had received any debt relief under HIPC. Second, the six-year program was too long and too inflexible to meet the individual needs of debtor nations. Third, the IMF and the World Bank did not cancel any debt until the <b>completion</b> <b>point,</b> leaving countries under the burden of their debt payments while they struggled to institute structural reforms. Fourth, the ESAF conditions often undermined poverty-reduction efforts. For example, privatization of utilities tended to raise the cost of services beyond the citizens' ability to pay. Finally, critics attacked HIPC as a program designed by creditors to protect creditor interests, leaving countries with unsustainable debt burdens even upon reaching the decision point.|$|E

40|$|As {{perhaps the}} highest profile group of {{management}} speakers in the world, so-called management gurus use their appearances {{on the international}} management lecture circuit todisseminate their ideas and to build their personal reputations with audiences of managers. This article examines the use of humour by management gurus during these public performances. Focusing on video recordings of lectures conducted by four leading management gurus (Tom Peters, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Peter Senge and Gary Hamel), the article explicates the verbal and nonverbal practices that the gurus use when they evoke audience laughter. These practices allow the gurus to project clear message <b>completion</b> <b>points,</b> to signal their humourous intent, to ‘invite’ audience laughter, and to manipulate the relationship between their use of humour and their core ideas and visions. The article concludes by suggesting that the ability of management gurus to use these practices effectively is significant because audience laughter {{can play an important}} role with respect to the expression of group cohesion and solidarity during their lectures...|$|R
40|$|Atomicity is used widely {{for expressing}} interference-freedom {{requirements}} between code blocks in executions of concurrent programs. In this study, we propose a new notion of atomicity called “rollback atomicity”. Commonly used definitions of atomicity have the following form: A concurrent execution σ conc {{of a program}} is atomic iff there exists an equivalent, serialized execution σ ser in which every atomic block by thread t is executed with no interruption by actions of other threads. Rollback atomicity fits into this template as well. In rollback atomicity, we require {{a particular kind of}} match between the states of σ conc and the witness execution σ ser at certain points in each execution approximately corresponding to <b>completion</b> <b>points</b> of atomic blocks. A subset F of the shared data variables is designated by the user as the “focus ” variables. The rest of the shared variables (the set P) are called “peripheral ” variables.

50|$|Alleviating poverty: {{at the end}} of {{the civil}} war in 1992, Mozambique ranked among the poorest {{countries}} in the world. It still ranks among the least developed countries, with very low socioeconomic indicators. In the last decade, however, it has experienced a notable economic recovery. Per capita GDP in 2000 was estimated at $222; in the mid-1980s, it was $120. With a high foreign debt (originally $5.7 billion at 1998 net present value) and a good track record on economic reform, Mozambique was the first African country to receive debt relief under the initial Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative. In April 2000, Mozambique qualified for the Enhanced HIPC program as well and attained its <b>completion</b> <b>point</b> in September 2001. This led to the Paris Club members agreeing in November 2001 to substantially reduce the remaining bilateral debt. This will lead to the complete forgiveness of a considerable volume of bilateral debt, including that owed to the United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{access to}} the peaks and pinnacles of {{the central part of}} the Brenta Group was {{facilitated}} by the construction -by order of the SAT- of a via ferrata that would respectfully avoid the summits but would connect the passes and indentures called bocchette between the peaks. The work on the Via dell Bocchette Centrali started in 1935.Much of the work at that stage was done by the Brenta guides of that era: Bruno Detassis and Enrico Giordano. The itinerary completed two years later enabled climbers to reach the apex of the Campanile Basso Via Normale. The works were interrupted by the Second World War but were resumed in 1948 mostly by effort of Celestino Donini, until reaching its <b>completion</b> <b>point</b> at the Bocca dei Armi. Later, in 1968-'69 the itinerary was extended towards the Bocca del Tuckett by a trajectory called Via delle Bocchette Alte, a challenging itinerary that reaches a quota of 3002 meters and traverses the Cima Brenta east face just under the summit. At a later stage the itinerary of vie ferrate was extended towards Passo del Grostè by means of the Sentiero Benini and still later on extended further over the Northern Chain towards Rifugio Peller: Sentiero Costanzi.|$|E
