5|$|The car was {{initially}} an Enzo Ferrari but the owner James Glickenhaus preferred the styling of Ferrari's 1960s race cars, the P Series. The project cost Glickenhaus US$ 4million and was officially {{presented to the}} public in August 2006 at the Pebble Beach <b>Concours</b> d'Elégance. Several websites were allowed to publish images of the clay model in July 2006.|$|E
5|$|Its design {{began in}} September 2005 with {{sketches}} by Jason Castriota moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent wind tunnel testing. More than 200 components were designed {{especially for the}} car. Most components, including the engine, drivetrain, are modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo from which it was derived. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on August 18, 2006 at the Pebble Beach <b>Concours</b> d'Elégance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, an {{exhibition}} in the Grand Palais of Paris {{was devoted to}} his work, during the annual salon of the Société des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Society) of France. Gaudí participated on the invitation of count Güell, displaying a series of pictures, plans and plaster scale models of several of his works.

5|$|Hayao Miyazaki {{made his}} {{credited}} directorial debut in 1979 with The Castle of Cagliostro, a film {{which was a}} distinct departure from the antics of the Lupin III franchise, but still went on to receive the Ofuji Noburo Award at the 1979 Mainichi Film <b>Concours.</b> Although Cagliostro was not a box office success, Toshio Suzuki, editor of the magazine Animage, {{was impressed by the}} film and encouraged Miyazaki to produce works for Animage's publisher, Tokuma Shoten. Miyazaki's film ideas were rejected, and Tokuma asked him to do a manga: this {{led to the creation of}} Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Miyazaki began writing and drawing the manga in 1981, and it quickly became Animage's most popular feature. Hideo Ogata and Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the founders of Animage and Tokuma Shoten respectively, encouraged Miyazaki to work on a film adaptation. Miyazaki initially refused, but agreed on the condition that he could direct.|$|E
25|$|The school {{continued}} {{to expand and}} include new subjects, seeking {{to cover all the}} disciplines of natural and social sciences.

On August 12, 2009, news reports suggested that the LF-A would be released as the LF-L, with the change in name from A to L to signify its appearances at Le Mans and to draw on its pre-production racing development. However, a production non-convertible designated LFA premiered in October 2009.|$|E
25|$|Three {{engines and}} four {{transmissions}} {{were available for}} every 1977 Chevrolet Nova, including <b>Concours.</b> Buyers could choose from a 110-horsepower 250-cubic-inch inline six, a 145-horsepower 305 cubic-inch two-barrel V-8, or 170-horsepower 350 cubic-inch four-barrel V-8. Shifting was accomplished by three-speed (column or floor shift) and four-speed manuals or Turbo Hydra-Matic. Novas might also be equipped with a heavy-duty suspension or the F41 sport suspension. A surprising number of police departments ordered Novas with either a 305- or 350-cubic-inch V-8 engine, {{following the lead of}} the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, which had given the compacts an exhaustive evaluation.|$|E
25|$|William Didier-Pouget (Toulouse 14 November 1864 - Digulleville 12 September 1959) was a French artist, born in 1864, Toulouse, France, {{known for}} his {{landscape}} paintings. He focused primarily on the countryside of southern France, infusing his landscapes, always painted outdoors (en plein air), with light and color. Didier-Pouget {{is associated with the}} later phase of Impressionism, although not actually identified with the group of artists typically known as the Impressionists. His career as an exhibiting artist stems from 1886 onwards. He {{was a member of the}} Société des Artistes Français, a member of l'École de Crozant and Société des Peintres de Montagne. Also, laureate of l'Institut au <b>Concours</b> Troyon, Officer of the order of Nichan Iftikar (Order of Glory (Tunisia)) and Officer of the Legion of Honour.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{generation}} GS had its world premiere at the Pebble Beach <b>Concours</b> d'Elegance in California in August 2011. The vehicle {{was shown to}} have a more subtle version of the LF-Gh's spindle grille, while overall exterior dimensions are almost identical to the previous generation. L-shaped LED front daytime running lamps and rear LED tube lamps are a new design feature. The new GS was the centerpiece of Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda's initiative to restore passion to the Lexus brand and better compete with German luxury automakers that had been gaining market share in the United States. It was reported that Toyoda initially opposed the styling choices made for the new model, but since thanked the design team that persuaded him to greenlight the project.|$|E
25|$|The same aircraft, {{along with}} another TE.1, was amongst eight contestants in the <b>Concours</b> d'Avions Économiques or light-plane contest held at Orly between 9-15 August 1926. The aim was to decide the most {{practical}} of the five different types, including ease of folding/wing detachment for road transport, the ability to accommodate parachutes and fire protection, as well as performance (take off distance, climb, speed) and fuel efficiency; more controversial was an economy coefficient which deliberately enhanced the final scores of two-seaters {{on the grounds of}} their greater practicality. The two Albert machines were the fastest present and were placed first and second before the economy coefficient was applied, after which they fell behind the two two-seat Avia BH-11s into third and fourth place.|$|E
25|$|Only two {{examples}} of the two-seater were built, but Nieuport-Delage entered the single-seater in the 1925 <b>concours</b> des monoplaces, a competition by the Army's Technical Service to find a replacement for the NiD 29. The NiD 42 was selected from a field of eleven competitors, and an order for 50 aircraft was placed, of which 25 were eventually delivered. Although impressive {{at the time it}} was designed, technology had already surpassed the NiD 42 when it entered service in 1928, particularly with regard to its wooden structure, and most of the development work associated with the design was made in an effort to cure it of a tendency to enter a flat spin. Nevertheless, it provided the foundation for further development as the NiD 52 and NiD 62.|$|E
25|$|Fitch went on {{to design}} and build a {{prototype}} of the Fitch Phoenix, a Corvair-based two-seat sports car, superficially resembling a smaller version of the Mako Shark based Corvette. With a total weight of , even with a steel body, and with the Corvair engine modified with Weber carburetors to deliver , the car delivered spirited performance for $8,760. The ability to produce automobiles on a small scale, along with Chevrolet's decision to terminate production of the Corvair, meant the end of Fitch's plan. He still retained the prototype, and occasionally exhibited it at car shows until his death. One June 1, 2014, the Fitch Phoenix when to auction at Bonhams in the Greenwich <b>Concours</b> and sold for 230,000 US dollars. The car is still in Connecticut with the new owner.|$|E
25|$|Wine {{competitions}} {{are held}} to assess whether a wine is of good quality and whether it is true to its character. In 2014, more than 20 wine competitions were held in South Africa, many of them concentrating on specific styles or varietals. The only South African wine competition acknowledged as a truly international wine <b>concours</b> is the annual Michelangelo International Wine & Spirits Awards, founded in 1997. The first Michelangelo Liqueur Awards were held in 2014 {{as part of the}} wine awards. Only accredited wine judges, wine makers and sommeliers from Europe, USA, Australia and Asia are invited to judge the approximately 1700 South African wines and spirits entered by producers in the Michelangelo International Wine & Spirits Awards (www.michelangeloawards.com). Another South African wine competition, the national Veritas award, was started in 1990. The Top 100 South African Wine Competition is a newer example of a local wine competition.|$|E
25|$|In the Romantic era, Leipzig {{became a}} centre of {{trombone}} pedagogy. The trombone {{began to be}} taught at the new Musikhochschule founded by Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. Later, the Paris Conservatory and its yearly <b>concours</b> would also contribute to trombone education. At the Leipzig academy, Mendelssohn's bass trombonist, Karl Traugott Queisser, {{was the first in}} a long line of distinguished professors of trombone. Several composers penned works for Quiesser, including Ferdinand David (Mendelssohn's concertmaster) who wrote in 1837 the Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra, Ernst Sachse and Friedrich August Belcke, whose solo works all remain popular today in Germany. Queisser almost single-handedly helped to reestablish the reputation of the trombone in Germany and began a tradition in trombone playing that is still practised there today. He championed and popularised Christian Friedrich Sattler's new tenorbass trombone during the 1840s, leading to its widespread use in orchestras throughout Germany and Austria.|$|E
25|$|Taine {{was born}} in Vouziers, but entered a {{boarding}} school, the Institution Mathé, whose classes were conducted at the Collège Bourbon, {{at the age of}} 13 in 1841, {{after the death of his}} father. He excelled as a student, receiving a number of prizes in both scientific and humanistic subjects, and taking two Baccalauréat degrees at the École Normale before he was 20. Taine's contrarian politics led to difficulties keeping teaching posts, and his early academic career was decidedly mixed; he failed the exam for the national <b>Concours</b> d'Agrégation in 1851. After his dissertation on sensation was rejected, he abandoned his studies in the social sciences, feeling that literature was safer. He completed a doctorate at the Sorbonne in 1853, with considerably more success in his new field; his dissertation, Essai sur les fables de La Fontaine, won him a prize from the Académie française.|$|E
25|$|From 1919 to 1922 Derscheid was {{enrolled}} in the Science Faculty of the Université libre de Bruxelles, studying under Professor Auguste Lameere and earning a doctorate in Zoology based on his dissertation on the morphology of bird skulls (Morphologie du squelette céphalique des oiseaux). He was awarded the gold medal of the <b>Concours</b> Interuniversitaire (1922–1924) for his thesis on bird classification as well as another on the olfactory organs of fish. His first professional job was as temporary section head at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium (1924–1926). Most of Derscheid's scientific articles were published during this period, including those on the longfin herring (Ilisha africana), hornbill, okapi, and African wild dog. He continued to publish {{on a wide range}} of topics after this period, including articles on the tropicbird, dugong, exotic ducks and the mountain gorilla. He also published on his experiences with the Akeley expedition, including on ethnic groups in the region of the expedition and the new park.|$|E
