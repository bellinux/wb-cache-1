25|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that interactions between neurotrophic factors could alter the optimal concentrations of each factor. While cell survival and phenotype maintenance are important, the emphasis of evaluation was on neurite extension. A combination of NGF, glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and <b>ciliary</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> (CNTF) was presented to Dorsal root ganglion cultures in vitro. One factor from each neurotrophic family was used. It was determined {{that there is not}} a difference in individual optimal concentration and combinatorial optimal concentration; however, around day 5 or 6 the neurites ceased extension and began to degrade. This {{was hypothesized}} to be due to lack of a critical nutrient or of proper gradients; previous studies have shown that growth factors are able to optimize neurite extension best when presented in gradients. Future studies on neurotrophic factor combinations will need to include gradients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciliary</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> (CNTF) is a cytosolic {{protein that}} is not secreted. CNTF {{has been shown to}} promote the {{survival}} of neuronal cultures in vitro, and it can also act as a differentiator and trophic factor on glial cells. Further, CNTF has been previously shown to affect the differentiation of glial precursor cells in vitro; however, the influence of CNTF in the in vivo setting has only recently been determined. Winter et al. used CNTF over-expressing transgenic mice as well as wildtype controls that had CNTF levels artificially elevated via injection, were subjected to neuronal damage using ZnSO4 (a known neuronal degenerative factor), which was injected intranasally in the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory bulb was then assessed for the expression of GFAP mRNA- a common marker for the glial scar. It was determined that mice with elevated levels of CNTF increased their GFAP mRNA expression two-fold. This data suggests that CNTF may mediate glial scar formation following CNS damage.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) have the {{capability}} to self-renew and to differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages. Many culture methods have been developed for directing NSC differentiation; however, the creation of biomaterials for directing NSC differentiation is seen as a more clinically relevant and usable technology. One approach to develop a biomaterial for directing NSC differentiation is to combine extracellular matrix (ECM) components and growth factors. A very recent study by Nakajima, Ishimuro et al. examined the effects of different molecular pairs consisting of a growth factor and an ECM component on the differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes and neuronal cells. The ECM components investigated were laminin-1 and fibronectin, which are natural ECM components, and ProNectin F plus (Pro-F) and ProNectin L (Pro-L), which are artificial ECM components, and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). The neurotrophic factors used were epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and <b>ciliary</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> (CNTF). The pair combinations were immobilized onto matrix cell arrays, on which the NSCs were cultured. After 2 days in culture, the cells were stained with antibodies against nestin, β-tubulin III, and GFAP, which are markers for NSCs, neuronal cells, and astrocytes, respectively. The results provide valuable information on advantageous combinations of ECM components and growth factors as a practical method for developing a biomaterial for directing differentiation of NSCs.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to observe the {{expression}} of <b>ciliary</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factors</b> (CNTFs) in the facial motor neurons in rats during facial nerve regeneration. METHODS: The expression amount of CNTFs in eight groups was determined with immunohistochemical staining and image analysis. RESULTS: The expression of CNTFs increased during the process of nerve regeneration, and reached the maximum one-week and one-month after nerve injury respectively. After one month, the intensity of CNTFs reduced gradually. The expression of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) did not show distinct difference comparing with the control, but beta transforming growth factors (TGF-beta) benefited the expression of CNTFs during nerve regeneration. CONCLUSION: The endogenous CNTFs promotes the axon outgrow during regeneration, and TGF-beta promotes the expression of CNTFs to rescue motoneuron during facial nerve regeneration. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|A recent study, done in November 2010 and {{published}} March 2011, {{was done by}} a team of scientists from the University of Rochester and University of Colorado School of Medicine. They did an experiment to attempt to repair trauma to the Central Nervous System of an adult rat by replacing the glial cells. When the glial cells were injected into the injury of the adult rat’s spinal cord, astrocytes were generated by exposing human glial precursor cells to bone morphogenetic protein (Bone morphogenetic protein is important because it is considered to create tissue architecture throughout the body). So, with the bone protein and human glial cells combined, they promoted significant recovery of conscious foot placement, axonal growth, and obvious increases in neuronal survival in the spinal cord laminae. On the other hand, human glial precursor cells and astrocytes generated from these cells by being in contact with <b>ciliary</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factors,</b> failed to promote neuronal survival and support of axonal growth at the spot of the injury.|$|R
40|$|A 20, 000 -D protein called {{purpurin}} {{has recently}} been isolated from the growth-conditioned medium of cultured embryonic chick neural retina cells (Schubert, D., and M. LaCorbiere, 1985, J. Cell Biol., 101 : 1071 - 1077). Purpurin is a constituent of adherons and promotes cell-adheron adhesion by interacting with a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan. It also prolongs the survival of cultured neural retina cells. This paper shows that purpurin is a secretory protein that has sequence homology with a human protein synthesized in the liver that transports retinol in the blood, the serum retinol-binding protein (RBP). Purpurin binds [3 H]retinol, and both purpurin and chick serum RBP stimulate the adhesion of neural retina cells, although the serum protein is less active than purpurin. Purpurin and the serum RBP are, however, different molecules, for the serum protein is approximately 3, 000 D larger than purpurin and has different silver-staining characteristics. Finally, purpurin supports the survival of dissociated ciliary ganglion cells, indicating that RBPs can act as <b>ciliary</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Axons in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) in adult mammals do not {{generally}} regenerate after damage. It is hypothesized that the lack of axonal regeneration is because of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The extrinsic factors would include the insufficient supply of trophic factor and/or neurite growth permissive molecules and the presence of inhibitory molecules in the axons. The intrinsic factor could be the decrease in the axonal growth potential in adult mammals. We have used a series of approaches to alter the extrinsic environment and to enhance the growth potentials of adult axons in the optic nerve and spinal cord. The external environment of the CNS axons could be enhanced by providing an environment suitable for axon regeneration, e. g., through the provision of a conduit using peripheral nerve graft for the damaged axons or Schwann cells or olfactory-ensheathing cell transplantation. We could also neutralize the inhibitory molecules using IN- 1 or Nogo receptor blocker or to block inhibitory signaling pathways via Rho pathway inhibitor. The prevention of scar tissue formation by Chondroitinase ABC could also promote axon regeneration in CNS. The intrinsic factors could be modified to enhance regeneration by supplementing appropriate <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factors,</b> e. g., <b>ciliary</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factors</b> (CNTF), or by elevating intrinsic regrowth capability, e. g., via the use of cAMP. Our studies suggest that a combined experimental approach is critical in optimizing the regeneration ability of CNS axons in adult mammals. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors encoding brain-derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> (BDNF) or <b>ciliary</b> derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> (CNTF) promote the viability and regeneration of injured adult rat retinal ganglion cells. However, these growth-inducing transgenes are driven by a constitutively active promoter, thus we examined whether long-term AAV-mediated secretion of BDNF or CNTF affected endogenous retinal gene expression. One year after the intravitreal injection of AAV-green fluorescent protein (GFP), bi-cistronic AAV-BDNF-GFP or AAV-CNTF-GFP, mRNA was extracted and analyzed using custom 96 well polymerase chain reaction arrays. Of 93 test genes, 56 % showed significantly altered expression in AAV-BDNF-GFP and/or AAV-CNTF-GFP retinas compared with AAV-GFP controls. Of these genes, 73 % showed differential expression in AAV-BDNF versus AAV-CNTF injected eyes. To focus on retinal ganglion cell changes, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was undertaken on mRNA (16 genes) obtained from fixed retinal sections in which the ganglion cell layer was enriched. The sign and extent of fold changes in ganglion cell layer gene expression differed markedly from whole retinal samples. Sustained and global alteration in endogenous mRNA expression after gene therapy should be factored into any interpretation of experimental/clinical outcomes, particularly when introducing factors into {{the central nervous system}} that require secretion to evoke functionality...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe reduced {{expression}} (haplodeficiency) of {{the main}} brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> receptor, namely TrkB is associated with reduced atherosclerosis, smooth muscle cells accumulation and collagen content in the lesion. These data support the concept that brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> of vascular origin may contribute to atherosclerosis. However, to date, no experimental approach was possible to investigate this issue due to the lethality of brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> null mice. To overcome these limitations, we generated a mouse model with a conditional deletion of brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> in endothelial cells (Tie- 2 Cre recombinase) on an atherosclerotic prone background (apolipoprotein E knock out) and investigated the effect of conditional brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> deficiency on atherosclerosis. Despite brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> reduction in the vascular wall, mice with conditional deletion of brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> did not develop larger atherosclerotic lesion compared to controls. Smooth muscle cell content {{as well as the}} distribution of total and fibrillar collagen was similar in the atherosclerotic lesions from mice with brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> conditional deficiency compared to controls. Finally an extended gene expression analysis failed to identify pro-atherogenic gene expression patterns among the animal with brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> deficiency. In spite of the reduced brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> expression, similar atherosclerosis development was observed in the brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> conditional deficient mouse compared to controls. These pieces of evidence indicate that endothelial derived-brain derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> is not a pro-atherogenic factor and would rather suggest to investigate the role of other TrkB activators on atherosclerosis...|$|R
