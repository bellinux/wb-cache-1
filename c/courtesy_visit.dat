5|$|By late 1963, Diệm knew a coup was brewing {{and that}} the 7th Division at Mỹ Tho outside Saigon might be involved.

Diệm put Phát in command of the 7th Division on 31 October. According to tradition, Phát had to pay the corps commander a <b>courtesy</b> <b>visit</b> before assuming control of the division. However, General Tôn Thất Đính, commander of the III Corps was part of the plot and deliberately refused to see Phát and told him to come back at 14:00 the following day, by which time the coup had already been scheduled to start.

25|$|The {{success that}} Fenton, Murray and Wood enjoyed {{because of the}} high quality of their {{workmanship}} attracted the hostility of competitors, Boulton and Watt.

Murray, rather foolishly, welcomed them, and showed them everything. On their return they informed their employers that Murray's casting work and forging work were much superior to their own, and efforts were made to adopt many of Murray's production methods. There was also an attempt by the firm of Boulton and Watt to obtain information from an employee of Fenton, Murray and Wood by bribery. Finally, James Watt jnr purchased land adjacent to the workshop in an attempt to prevent the firm from expanding.|$|E

The plan included provisions for the college to offer more academic opportunities for the community and to explore moving its bookstore into the downtown area, develop student housing in the downtown area, and to expand student use of the downtown eating, shopping, and visiting destinations. The City of Washington began a downtown revitalization project featuring new sidewalks, landscaping, and fiber-optic cables.

2500|$|Robert Stinnett's Day of Deceit {{suggests}} a memorandum prepared by Commander McCollum {{was central to}} U.S. policy in the immediate pre-war period. Stinnett claims the memo suggests only a direct attack on U.S. interests would sway the American public (or Congress) to favor direct involvement in the European war, specifically {{in support of the}} British. An attack by Japan would not, could not, aid Britain. Although the memo was passed to Captains Walter Anderson and Dudley Knox, two of Roosevelt's military advisors, on October 7, 1940, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest Roosevelt ever saw it, while Stinnett's claims of evidence he did is nonexistent. Moreover, although Anderson and Knox offered eight specific plans to aggrieve the Japanese Empire and added, [...] "If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better," [...] of the eight [...] "plans" [...] (actions to be taken) offered in the memo, many if not all were implemented, but there is considerable doubt the McCollom memo was the inspiration. Nonetheless, in Day of Deceit Stinnett claims all action items were implemented. Yet there were numerous instances of members of the Roosevelt Administration insisting on not provoking Japan. Mark Parillo, in his essay The United States in the Pacific, wrote, [...] "hese theories tend to founder on the logic of the situation. Had Roosevelt and other members of his administration known of the attack in advance, they would have been foolish to sacrifice one of the major instruments needed to win the war just to get the United States into it." [...] Furthermore, on 5 November 1941, in a joint memo, Stark, CNO, and Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, warned, [...] "if Japan be defeated and Germany remain undefeated, decision will still not have been reached.... War between the United States and Japan should be avoided...." [...] Additionally, in a 21 November 1941 memo, Brigadier Leonard T. Gerow, head of Army War Plans, stated, [...] "one of our present major objectives [...] the avoidance of war with Japan... insure continuance of material assistance to the British." [...] He concluded, [...] "t is of grave importance to our war effort in Europe..." [...] Furthermore, Churchill himself, in a 15 May 1940 telegram, said he hoped a U.S. commitment to aid Britain would [...] "quiet" [...] Japan, following with a 4 October message requesting a USN <b>courtesy</b> <b>visit</b> to Singapore aimed at [...] "preventing the spreading of the war" [...] And Stark's own Plan Dog expressly stated, [...] "Any strength that we might send to the Far East would...reduce the force of our blows against Germany..." [...] Roosevelt could scarcely have been ignorant of Stark's views, and war with Japan was clearly contrary to Roosevelt's express wish to aid Britain and with Churchill's to [...] "quiet" [...] Japan.|$|E
