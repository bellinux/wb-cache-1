40|$|This study aims {{to reveal}} {{the role of a}} Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB) as a {{destination}} marketing organization inmarketing of destinations for tourism purposes. Meetings, fairs and exhibitions have created the most economic value and are thefastest growing section of the tourism industry even if they indicate some fluctuations due to reasons such as economicstagnation, the increase in oil prices and terrorist attacks. As a special kind of tourism which has different features compared toothers, the basic attraction element for the <b>convention</b> <b>tourism</b> is the convention itself. For the <b>convention</b> <b>tourism,</b> accessibilityof a destination is more important than destination attraction elements which are seen as crucial elements for many tourism types. As a country or city, presence of infrastructure and quality convention and accommodation superstructure which require ratherlarge investments are essential {{to be able to get}} a share from <b>convention</b> <b>tourism</b> which has high-status participants and provideshigher yield both from the economical and image points of view with its organization. But today, having the necessary infrastructure and superstructure is not enough to get the desired share from conventiontourism. Because of its high return, almost all countries’ efforts to develop required supply structure to get a share fromconvention tourism constantly intensify the competition in the sector. In addition to infrastructure and superstructure, increasingcompetition in <b>convention</b> <b>tourism</b> makes marketing and promotion activities important and highlights the role of CVBs asdestination marketing organizations. Although all enterprises which form the sector contribute to marketing and promotion of tourism destinations for tourismpurposes at a certain level, the main marketing tasks are carried out by the CVBs. CVB is defined as a non-profit organizationwhich is commissioned with representing a particular destination and help communities’ development in the long term through atravel and tourism strategy, is a destination marketing organization. The main task of the CVBs to develop their cities as attractivedestinations for visitors with convention and entertainment purposes, promote them, improve their image, and provide economiccontribution. With a developing role of the CVBs in the tourism sector through the history, today they have turned into anorganizations which continues to maintain marketing activities not only for <b>convention</b> <b>tourism</b> purposes but also general tourismpurposes. CVBs are the assistant organizations in inviting the visitors who form their target markets, tour operators and meetingplanners to their cities by its services, providing information on tourism attractions of cities, facilities and conditions required forthe conventions and establishing a communication bridge between producers and enterprises. In short, they are the organizationswhich sell the cities. CVBs fulfill their tasks by improving the image of cities which they market as an attractive destination for meetings and visitors, coordinating the enterprises and organizations which form the tourism industry and the public sector,working together with meeting and group planners, preventing conflicts between supply and demand sides as an impartialorganization, providing information and answering visitors’ questions and playing a leadership role in the industry. The basic causes for the emergence of the CVBs, its most important areas of interest today and basic pursuits are MICE(Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions) market. Although CVBs work often as an organization to market cities forconvention and general tourism purposes, they may also operate at regional or national scale. CVBs are public in structural terms,autonomous, non-profit or private organizations. The basic reality of CVBs is that to sell a product which has no control in its production process and ownership to a personor group who have responsibilities to others. Therefore, their success depends on having adequate financial resources, being in aclose cooperation with enterprises which form the sector and providing up-to-date and accurate information to buyers whichform the demand side. Istanbul with a convenient geographical location, its infrastructure for <b>convention</b> <b>tourism</b> purposes, convention centers andquality accommodation enterprises is a city where vast majority of national and international conventions have been held and thefirst convention and visitors bureau of Turkey was founded. Istanbul Convention and Visitors Bureau (ICVB) were founded in 1997. Because this study is a case study, as a qualitative method semi-structured ten questions for face to face interviews wereused and the secondary data relating to the activities of the Bureau was obtained during these interviews. The semi-structuredinterview questions were formed by taking two key elements into account; the questions which provide basic information ICVBand the role of ICVB in <b>convention</b> <b>tourism.</b> ICVB managers had stressed the matter that using statistical data of ICCA (International Congress and Convention Association) in relation to the eighth question would be more healthy. In addition, theypointed out that it was not possible to answer the second part of the question. In this respect, statistical data showing thedevelopment of Istanbul in the convention market was derived from the ICCA’s data. According to the survey results, through its activities from its foundation year to the present, ICVB have made Istanbul a wellknown <b>convention</b> <b>tourism</b> destination in top twenty destination in the world in terms of the number of conventions andparticipants. The Bureau is not different from other similar organizations in Europe and the world when they are compared instructural terms. Distinction arises from focusing on the <b>convention</b> <b>tourism</b> in the Bureau’s mission, promotion and marketingactivities. It is obvious that ICVB’s contribution to Istanbul and Turkey’s <b>convention</b> <b>tourism</b> development and increase in theirshare in Europe and the world will continue if the problems of the inadequate budget, security, inadequate superstructure andaccommodation supply and under utilization of accommodation and convention facilities, lack of public sector institutions’support, difficulty in finding sponsors and the lack of interpreters problems are resolved. This study has some limitations. The basic limitation of the study is the insufficient statistical data related to national andinternational conventions held in Istanbul. In this context, there are inconsistencies between the ICCA’s national conventionstatistics and statistical data available at ICVB’s web site. Impossibility to identify the conventions which had been brought toIstanbul through ICVB’s marketing and promotion efforts constitutes the limitation. Another limitation is that the lack of regularaccurate data on annual work plans, marketing budget, general budget covering the time series starting from ICVB’s foundation tothe present. The real impact of ICVB in Istanbul’s development in <b>convention</b> <b>tourism</b> in real terms can only be determined byprovision of accurate reliable statistics...|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} rational suggestion for creating a useful theory of decision making via a qualitative review of the “grand models ” of consumer behavior and then applying this theory to conference decision-making context.

These models, labeled the “grand models ” of consumer decision-making which tend to describe the process of proceeding throughout a major buying decision as a rational problem solving approach. However, objections against use of grand models have been expressed since their introduction. The main objective {{of this research is}} to challenge these criticisms and prove that grand models are properly applicable in the context of conference decision-making based on logical discussions.

40|$|As public {{awareness}} {{on environmental issues}} is gradually increasing nowadays, green elements seem as a crucial modern marketing tool that can induce people’s perception and behavioural intentions. Throughout tourism industry, most organizations belief destination image can be enhanced by implementing green practices and obtaining green recognition. To be precise, organizations of convention centre have started to promote themselves as a green convention {{in order to be}} sustained in convention industry as well as important for image positioning among the stakeholders. From the above notion, this study attempted to investigate how the perception of green convention centre image (cognitive and overall image) can affect future behavioural intentions (word of mouth and revisit intention). A self-administrated questionnaire was distributed to the selected 49 event organizers by conducting a face to face interview. A series of analyses using descriptive and inferential were used to analyze the data. The results indicate cognitive green convention image has a positive impact on the event organizers’ behavioural intentions. The overall green convention image also found positively related with both favourable behavioural intentions constructs. The role of the overall image as a moderator has been proved as this image component mediates the relationship between cognitive image and behavioural intentions. Theoretically, {{the results of this study}} contribute to the <b>convention</b> <b>tourism</b> literatures by providing additional insights into cognitive image, overall image as a mediating variable, word of mouth and revisit intention. The findings will also assist management of convention centre in discovering which cognitive attributes and behavioural intentions constructs that least or most influence their customers’ perception.

40|$|<b>Convention</b> <b>tourism</b> has {{received}} more attention as well as {{research in the field}} has been growing in number since the past decade. This {{is due to the fact}} that the industry is evidenced as a source of contributing substantial revenues to economies, and this has also proved to be a case of developing countries like Thailand where the recently promoted convention sector has contributed significantly to the national GDP. Referring to its relatively newness and less maturity in the global market, many convention city destinations in Thailand seem not to manifest remarkably their ability to compete or attract the global convention tourists, and Chiang Mai city could also be a case. This study was then conducted to evaluate competitiveness of Chiang Mai city as a convention destination from perceptions of critical/primary groups of stakeholders in Chiang Mai convention industry, as well as to evaluate differences in perceptions of stakeholder groups in factors attributing to convention destination competitiveness of Chiang Mai city. The data was collected via a questionnaire survey in 2016 from 46 stakeholders derived from the census sampling which included convention venue providers, professional organisers (professional convention organisers and destination management companies), and hotels facilitating world-class convention facilities and service. The results showed that the stakeholders perceived tourist resources and attractors as well as the city&# 039;s overall host environment highly competitive and strengthening convention destination competitiveness of Chiang Mai city. On the other hand, they perceived government support and industry cooperation as well as human resources development as factors less contributing to the competitiveness of the city.
