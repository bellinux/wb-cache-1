5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} <b>claim</b> for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis}} that the personal injury <b>claim</b> had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the <b>claim</b> before filing a defence, {{on the basis that}} the <b>claim</b> could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E

5|$|The <b>claim</b> {{could be}} mined freely for a year, after which a $100 ($2,800) fee {{had to be}} paid annually. Should the {{prospector}} leave the <b>claim</b> {{for more than three}} days without good reason, another miner could make a <b>claim</b> on the land. The Canadian government also charged a royalty of between 10 and 20 percent on the value of gold taken from a <b>claim.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1946, Native American land <b>claims</b> were {{explicitly}} {{barred from}} <b>Claims</b> Courts by statute. The Indian <b>Claims</b> Commission Act of 1946 (ICCA) created forum of Indian land <b>claims</b> before the Indian <b>Claims</b> Commission (subsequently merged into the United States Court of <b>Claims,</b> {{and then the}} United States Court of Federal <b>Claims).</b> However, the ICCA created a four-year statute of limitations. Moreover, the ICC and its successors may award only money damages, and cannot—for example—title land. Finally, the ICCA is the exclusive forum to pursue <b>claims</b> against the federal government.|$|R
50|$|In England and Wales, a <b>claims</b> {{management}} {{company is a}} business that offers <b>claims</b> management services to the public. <b>Claims</b> management services consist of advice or services in respect of <b>claims</b> for compensation, restitution, repayment or any other remedy for loss or damage, or in respect of some other obligation. <b>Claims</b> management services cover litigation, or <b>claims</b> under regulation schemes or voluntary arrangements.|$|R

5|$|Under Canadian law, miners {{first had}} to get a license, either when they arrived at Dawson or en route from Victoria in Canada. They could then {{prospect}} for gold and, when they had found a suitable location, lay <b>claim</b> to mining rights over it. To stake a <b>claim,</b> a prospector would drive stakes into the ground a measured distance apart and then return to Dawson to register the <b>claim</b> for $15 ($410). This normally had to be done within three days, and by 1897 only one <b>claim</b> per person at a time was allowed in a district, although married couples could exploit a loophole that allowed the wife to register a <b>claim</b> in her own name, doubling their amount of land.|$|E
5|$|Variations of the {{original}} theory were also proposed, including the <b>claim</b> that the plot involved overseas groups intent on overthrowing the Chakri dynasty, the <b>claim</b> that media consolidation was a core component of the conspiracy, the <b>claim</b> that the Plan was aimed at maintaining a constitutional monarchy while reducing {{the powers of the}} monarch to a mere figurehead, and the <b>claim</b> that a law designed to further decentralize central administrative power to the Thai provinces, and the <b>claim</b> that Thaksin wanted to establish a government based on the model of western democracies.|$|E

5|$|A {{settlement}} {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837. He made a more accurate survey of the reservation lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140km²) within the reservation. He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude {{certain parts of the}} east bank that {{had been part of the}} 1805 cession to Zebulon Pike. His plan was to stake a pre-emption <b>claim</b> at the falls. However, Franklin Steele also had plans to stake a <b>claim.</b> On July 15, 1838, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi Rivers. Steele rushed off to the falls, built a shanty, and marked off boundary lines. Plympton's party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to <b>claim</b> the most desirable land. Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele's <b>claim,</b> as did other settlers such as Pierre Bottineau, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin. Steele went on to build a dam at the falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from the Rum River area.|$|E
5|$|After Alfred's {{death in}} 899, Æthelwold disputed the throne with Alfred's son, Edward the Elder. As senior ætheling (prince {{of the royal}} dynasty {{eligible}} for kingship), Æthelwold had a strong <b>claim</b> to the throne. He attempted to raise an army to support his <b>claim,</b> {{but was unable to}} get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Viking-controlled Northumbria, where he was accepted as king. In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex, where he was also accepted as king.|$|E
5|$|All {{daughter}} isotopes (decay products) of element 117 {{were previously}} unknown; therefore, their properties {{could not be}} used to confirm the <b>claim</b> of discovery. In 2011, when one of the decay products (289115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element 117. The discoverers did not submit a <b>claim</b> for their findings in 2007–2011 when the Joint Working Party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.|$|E

30|$|In 485 cases, {{there was}} an {{original}} allegation of multidisciplinary team malpractice (76.4 % of the entire population). Those team malpractice <b>claims</b> were divided into <b>claims</b> targeting only orthopedic teams (51 % of all <b>claims)</b> and <b>claims</b> that were also targeting other clinical branches (25.4 % of the total <b>claims),</b> in particular anesthesiology and radiology. <b>Claims</b> focusing only on a single specialized orthopedist totaled 311 (49 %), while 161 cases targeted a single specialized orthopedist {{as well as other}} physicians. Team malpractice <b>claims</b> typically related to surgical adverse events. <b>Claims</b> targeting single orthopedists were mainly focused on wrong diagnoses in the ER setting as well as surgical adverse events. Figure  1 shows the chronological trend for team versus single-physician malpractice <b>claims.</b>|$|R
50|$|Joinder of <b>claims</b> {{refers to}} {{bringing}} several legal <b>claims</b> against {{the same party}} together. In U.S. federal law, joinder of <b>claims</b> is governed by Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. These rules allow claimants to consolidate all <b>claims</b> that they have against an individual who is already {{a party to the}} case. Claimants may bring new <b>claims</b> even if these new <b>claims</b> are not related to the <b>claims</b> already stated; for example, a plaintiff suing someone for breach of contract may also sue the same person for assault. The <b>claims</b> may be unrelated, but they may be joined if the plaintiff desires.|$|R
5|$|Another <b>claim</b> for {{the origin}} of the term comes from the works of science fiction author Motoko Arai, who used the word in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted the term for themselves. However, a {{different}} <b>claim</b> points to a 1981 Variety magazine essay.|$|E

5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the <b>claim,</b> not that {{the statute of limitations}} would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not that it would not bar the <b>claim</b> if it applied, and the District Court had held the <b>claim</b> barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E
50|$|The {{insurance}} company (payer) processes the <b>claims</b> usually by medical <b>claims</b> examiners or medical <b>claims</b> adjusters. For higher dollar amount <b>claims,</b> the {{insurance company}} has medical directors review the <b>claims</b> and evaluate their validity for payment using rubrics (procedure) for patient eligibility, provider credentials, and medical necessity. Approved <b>claims</b> are reimbursed for {{a certain percentage of}} the billed services. These rates are pre-negotiated between the health care provider and {{the insurance company}}. Failed <b>claims</b> are denied or rejected and notice is sent to provider. Most commonly, denied or rejected <b>claims</b> are returned to providers in the form of Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Electronic Remittance Advice.|$|R
50|$|<b>Claims</b> {{against the}} State of New York were {{originally}} heard and {{decided by the}} New York State Legislature. In 1874, a constitutional amendment was ratified which prohibited the Legislature to assess <b>claims</b> against the State, and in 1876 the State Board of Audit (later renamed Board of <b>Claims)</b> was created to step in. In 1897, the Board of <b>Claims</b> was abolished and a Court of <b>Claims,</b> consisting of three judges, created instead. On July 31, 1911, the Court of <b>Claims</b> was abolished and the Board of <b>Claims,</b> consisting of three commissioners, was restored.|$|R

5|$|Author Michael Occleshaw {{made the}} <b>claim</b> in his 1995 book The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor that Tatiana {{might have been}} rescued and transported to England, where she married a British officer and lived under the name Larissa Tudor. Occleshaw based this <b>claim</b> on {{studying}} the diaries of the British agent Richard Meinertzhagen, who hinted at the successful liberation of a Grand Duchess, allegedly Tatiana. However, historians discount this <b>claim.</b> Survival stories persist because two bodies were missing from the mass grave found in the forest outside Yekaterinburg and exhumed in 1991. Those bodies were identified as Tsarevich Alexei {{and one of the}} four grand duchesses, generally thought by Russians to be Grand Duchess Maria and by Americans to be Grand Duchess Anastasia. Most historians believe that all of the Romanovs, including Tatiana, were assassinated at Ekaterinburg.|$|E
40|$|Selected {{characteristics}} and total medical <b>claims</b> of health risk appraisal (HRA) responders and non-responders were compared {{in a sample}} of employees having a three-year employment and <b>claims</b> history. HRA responders were younger and more likely to file medical <b>claims</b> than non-responders. Although mean medical <b>claims</b> were greater for HRA responders than non-responders, when adjusted for age and sex this difference reflected the proportion of employees reporting <b>claims,</b> not a difference in the <b>claims</b> amount...|$|R
