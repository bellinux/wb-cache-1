40|$|During the {{start-up}} {{and shut down}} phase of reciprocating compressors the loads on all components of driven train system are very high. In this paper a method for the calculating the forces on coupling, e-motor, crank shaft as well other components of the system will be described. The modelling of the electrical induction motor, <b>coupling,</b> <b>crank</b> shaft, damper {{as well as the}} compressor resistance torque are extremely important in simulating start-up and shut down of reciprocating compressor. Equally important, are the switching torque of the electrical motor and the instantaneous moment of inertia of the reciprocating compressor crank gear. The transient start-up and shut down process under loaded and unloaded is described using a non-linear differential equation for driven train system: EMotor – Coupling – Flywheel – Reciprocating compressor - Damper. Shaft torsional moments on the drive train and especially on the coupling, whether elastic or stiff, can then only be calculated using numerical simulation...|$|E

If the heat exchangers enforce Fourier’s law q=constant the resulting u(t) increases with the time t exponentially leading to possible turbulence in the gas.

40|$|In this article, we derive a quantal self-consistent time-reversal {{invariant}} parameter-free cranking {{model for}} isoscalar monopole excitation coupled to intrinsic motion in even-even light nuclei. The model uses a wavefunction {{that is a}} product of monopole and intrinsic wavefunctions and a constrained variational method to derive, from a many-particle Schrodinger equation, a pair of coupled self-consistent cranking-type Schrodinger equations for the monopole and intrinsic systems. The monopole co-ordinate used is the trace of the quadrupole tensor and hence describes the overall deformation of the nucleus. The monopole and intrinsic wavefunctions are coupled to each other by the two cranking equations and their associated parameters and by two constraints imposed on the intrinsic system. For an isotropic Nilsson shell model and an effective residual two-body interaction, the two <b>coupled</b> <b>cranking</b> equations are solved in the Tamm Dancoff approximation. The strength of the interaction is determined from a Hartree-Fock self-consistency argument. The excitation energy of the first excited state is determined and found to agree closely with those observed in the nuclei He- 4, Be- 8, C- 12, O- 16, Ne- 20, Mg- 24, and Si- 28. The variation of the model parameters are explained. In particular, it is found that the monopole excitation energy {{as a function of the}} mass number undergoes an increase whenever the nucleons begin to occupy a new sub-shell state with non-zero orbital angular momentum as a consequence of suppressing or constraining the resulting spurious monopole excitation in the intrinsic system. Comment: The statements added to the article on pages 1, 2, 3, 6, and 10 clarifies why the model can be and is used to describe oscillations in spherical and deformed light nuclei. The reason is that the monopole nuclear radius coordinate used describeds overall nuclear deformatio...|$|R
50|$|The rack {{locomotive}} had plate frames, arranged outside the coupled wheels, and {{was equipped with}} the Heusinger von Waldegg version of Walschaerts valve gear. The pinion for the rack was mounted between the coupled wheels, just forward of the driving axle.

50|$|In 1995, Yamaha fitted 270° {{crankshaft}} to its TRX850 and in 1996 to the TDM850 MK2, plus {{a balance}} shaft {{to counter the}} resulting combination of free forces and rocking <b>couples.</b> The 270° <b>crank</b> has smaller free forces than the 360° crank (but {{much larger than the}} 180° crank) and smaller rocking couples than the 180° crank (the 360° crank has no such couple). Whilst firing was as uneven as a 90° V-Twin, the 270° crank was not as uneven as the 180°. The 270° configuration represents a successful compromise and has been adopted for Honda's NC700 and 2016 Africa Twin, Hinckley Triumph's Scrambler and Thunderbird cruiser, Yamaha's MT-07 / FZ-07 and a number of others.|$|R

5000|$|The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was {{a pioneer}} in the use of {{jackshaft}} driven locomotives. While the drive axle of the first Grasshopper locomotive was directly driven by spur gears from the crankshaft, the Traveler delivered in 1833, used a jackshaft, as did all the later Grasshopper and Crab locomotives. These locomotives used step-up gearing to achieve a reasonable running speed using small diameter driving wheels. It is notable that the term jackshaft was not used by the designers of these machines. Instead, they referred to what would later be called a jackshaft as [...] "a separate axle, about three feet forward of the front axle, and carrying <b>cranks</b> <b>coupled</b> by connecting rods to cranks on the two road axles."

40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is {{developing}} a free-piston engine as an innovative internal combustion engine for the generation of electrical power. The arrangement of the Free Piston Linear Generator (FPLG) in opposed-piston design consists of two piston units oscillating freely, thereby alternately compressing the common combustion chamber {{in the center of}} the unit and gas springs on either side. Linear alternators convert the kinetic energy of the moving pistons into electric energy. Since the pistons are not mechanically <b>coupled</b> to a <b>crank</b> train, the bottom and top dead centers of the piston movement can be varied during operation e. g. to adjust the compression ratio. Utilizing these degrees of freedom, the present paper deals with the analysis of different combustion processes in a port scavenged opposed-piston combustion chamber prototype. This contains the experimental investigation of spark ignition (SI) as well as the transition to homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). Based on test bench results, a 3 D-CFD model, which has been used to develop the first prototype, is calibrated by actual measurements. The simulation results enable a deeper analysis of scavenging and in-cylinder processes exceeding the measurement possibilities on a test bench...|$|R
5000|$|For in-line 4's {{there are}} 3 types of crankshaft. No counter weights, fully counter {{weighted}} (FCW) and semi-counter or half-counter weighted (SCW/HCW). Cranks without counter weights ("bent sticks") were used on in-line 4's {{up to the}} mid 1930s for auto-mobiles but are still {{to be found in}} agricultural use with attendant problems. Without counter weights an in-line 4 crank is balanced for primary forces, primary and secondary couples but not for secondary forces. Secondary force out balance can not be balanced on the crank, requiring 2 contra-rotating balance shafts running at twice engine speed. These will only be fitted on premium quality cars that demand very smooth running or on large engines in excess of 2.4L where the level of secondary vibration becomes obtrusive. The primary <b>couples</b> bend the <b>crank</b> to a S shape with the deflection increasing with rpm. Without counter weights this deflection causes fatigue and main bearing failures when the deflection exceeds the bearing clearance resulting in rubs. These failures have resulted in a public perception that high rpm is bad for the engine that lingers to this day. FCW cranks have 2 counter weights on each crank throw. SCW cranks have one counter weight on each crank throw, these are on each end of the crank and both sides of the centre main. The counter weights produce moment <b>couples</b> in the <b>crank</b> that counter the primary couple and pull the crank straighter to enable repeated and sustained high rpm with long fatigue and bearing life. The moment couple is proportional to mass x radius of centre of gravity x distance from pivot, the [...] "pivots" [...] being between 1-2 and 3-4. As they are close to the [...] "pivot", the counter weights adjacent to the pivots on a FCW crank only contribute about 1/4 to 1/3 of the moment. The counter weights balance each other completely for primary forces and couples and have no secondary forces/couple. Counter weights do not affect overall engine balance and vibration. There is no benefit in having FCW crank over SCW. The SCW crank is always lighter and allows more rapid engine and vehicle acceleration but may need a heavier flywheel. FCW cranks are used on engines to save space as the piston has to clear the counter weight at bottom dead centre, SCW although only 25-33% larger to obtain the required couple would make the engine taller and the crankcase wider. For automotive use the switch from SCW to FCW is typically around 1.8-2.2L engine capacity. There are a few [...] "hybrid" [...] cranks (Nissan Z22, LD20), these have large counter weights in the SCW position that are as big as the crankcase and piston clearance permits and small counterweights in the remaining positions to produce the required couple. This gives the lightest crank that the crankcase space permits.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} paper {{deals with}} the development process and initial measurement results of an opposed-piston combustion engine for application in a Free-Piston Linear Generator (FPLG). The FPLG, which is being developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), is an innovative internal combustion engine for a fuel based electrical power supply. With its arrangement, the pistons freely oscillate between the compression chamber of the combustion unit and a gas spring with no mechanical <b>coupling</b> like a <b>crank</b> shaft. Linear alternators convert the kinetic energy of the moving piston into electric energy. The virtual development of the novel combustion system {{is divided into two}} stages: On the one hand, the combustion system including e. g. a cylinder liner, pistons, cooling and lubrication concepts has to be developed. On the other hand, 3 D-CFD-simulations are used in the early stage within the virtual development process toward the optimization of the geometry of the scavenging ports and ducts, the gas exchange, injection and ignition. With the high variability of the free piston concept, a strategy for a dual combustion mode operation with spark ignition and HCCI is developed. The new engine is constructed on and implemented at the hydraulic free-piston test bench at DLR and was successfully taken into operation. First measurement results show the engine behavior with dual spark ignition and two opposed injectors...|$|R
5000|$|Many [...] "tuning" [...] firms {{producing}} [...] "billet" [...] cranks misunderstand {{the design}} criteria of counterbalance weights. They produce cranks that although made from better materials lack sufficient counter weights and deflect more than OEM standard at high rpm. Other [...] "tuning" [...] firms offer [...] "lightening" [...] and [...] "knife edging" [...] of OEM cranks, this is largely {{at the expense}} of the counterbalance weights. To restore the couple and reduce crankshaft deflection back to OEM spec further work has to undertaken, either installing slugs of high density metal (tungsten) in the counterweights or core drilling the big end journals. For both billet and re-worked OEM cranks if the deflection is greater than OEM spec the results will be poor fatigue and bearing life. For worst cases this may require frequent engine tear downs to replace bearing shells when the crank rubs on the bearing and seasonal replacement of the crank. All of the rotating <b>couple</b> due to <b>crank</b> throw and rotating portion of con-rod and 1/2 the reciprocating couple should be countered. As the balance mass is dependent on the mass of the piston and con-rods if these are changed (for lighter after-market items) then the effect on the couple should be calculated and corrected. Any reputable maker of billet or re-worked cranks should be able to either specify the weights of con-rods and pistons or correct the crank counter weights to suit con-rods and pistons.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} investigation of homogeneous charge compression ignition in a free-oscillating two-stroke free-piston engine. The Free Piston Linear Generator (FPLG), which is being developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), is an innovative internal combustion engine for the generation of electrical power. This concept can for example be used in hybrid electric vehicles, as an auxiliary power unit or in {{combined heat and power}} units. The FPLG consists of three main components. In the two-stroke combustion unit, heat is released by burning a fuel-air mixture and a piston is accelerated. This energy is then converted into electric energy in the second component, the linear generator. This subsystem consists of electromagnetic coils as a stator and permanent magnets as a mover. The mover is rigidly coupled to the combustion piston. The third component, the gas spring, serves as an intermediate energy storage and reverses the piston motion by decelerating it. With this arrangement, the piston oscillates freely between the compression chamber of the combustion unit and the gas spring with no mechanical <b>coupling</b> like a <b>crank</b> shaft. Due to the free piston movement, the top and bottom dead centers and consequently for example the compression ratio are no longer fixed. This freedom and the use of a fully variable valve train provide the opportunity for a fundamental optimization of the internal combustion process. The homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is one advantageous combustion process which leads to low raw emissions and high efficiencies. As a basis to utilize a HCCI process, the paper firstly presents a strategy for the transition between the spark ignition mode and HCCI-mode in the FPLG using the high variability of the engine concept. The auto ignition of the lean fuel-air mixture is enabled by the adaption of the compression ratio and an internal exhaust gas recirculation. The latter is accomplished by an early intake valve opening and intermediate storage of combustion gases in the intake manifold. Additionally, the challenges that come with a freely oscillating piston will be discussed here. In the analysis of the experimental results, the pressure curve and free piston movement will be discussed in detail. Due to the free piston movement stochastic variations in the ignition can be equalized by the system without external control. This effect and the measured efficiencies show the promising potential for the HCCI process in free-piston engines...|$|R
