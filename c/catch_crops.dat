The objectives are (i) to discuss {{the potential benefits of}} <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> introduction taking into account the limitations due to the physiographic and agricultural context of the area (ii) to propose a multicriteria classification of these scenarios as a basis for discussion with stakeholders. We used the distributed agro-hydrological model TNT 2 to simulate 25 scenarios of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> management, differing in length of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> growing period, place in the crop rotation and residue management. The scenarios were classified considering the variations in main crop yields and either nitrogen fluxes in stream or the global nitrogen mass balance at the catchment level. The simulations showed that in the catchment studied, little improvement can be expected from increasing the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> surface. <b>Catch</b> <b>crop</b> cultivation was always beneficial to reduce nitrogen losses, but led to adverse effects on main crop yields in some cases. Among the scenarios involving additional <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> surface, introducing <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> between two winter cereals appeared as the most promising. The classification of scenarios depended on the chosen criteria: when considering only the reduction of nitrogen fluxes in streams, exporting <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> residues was the most efficient while when considering the global nitrogen mass balance, soil incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> residues was the most beneficial.

40|$|After its {{late harvest}} a leek (Allium porrum) crop will {{normally}} leave {{large quantities of}} nitrogen (N) in the soil which {{may be subject to}} leaching. A possible method to reduce N leaching losses is to establish a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> before the harvest of the leek crop. It was the aim of this study to investigate the effects of incorporating a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> in a leek crop with minimal competition and to monitor how root growth affected N availability across soil depths at different distances between <b>catch</b> and leek <b>crop</b> rows. To reduce competition between both crops leek was planted at 0. 5 and 0. 75 m row distances and chicory (Cichorium intybus) as a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> at an interrow spacing of 0. 75 m.

At the same time the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> had extended its roots to a depth of at least 1. 25 m and was exploring the full width of the 0. 75 m interrow with some roots even below the leek rows.

The field was divided into eight separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 840 m². The amount of drainage water was measured and water samples were collected twice a month. The water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Soil samples were taken periodically from the 0 - 90 cm soil layer for analysis of mineral nitrogen. Plant material was sampled in late summer, late sutumn and early spring to measure plant growth and nutrient in crops, weeds and plat residues. The crop sequence was: oats (1993 and 1994), spring barley (1995), potatoes (1996), oats (1997) and spring barley (1998). The fertilizer regimes were commercial fertilizer according to normal reccommendations (90 kg N/ha) or half the dose of commercial fertilizer (45 kg N/ha) supplemented with pig slurry (on average, 94 kg tot-N/ha) applied before sowing in spring. Treatments with <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> were ploughed either in April-May or in early November, whereas other treatments without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> were stubble cultivated in August-September and plouged in November, or only plouged in April-May. The <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> didn't impact negatively on the yield; instead incorporation if <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> material seemes {{to increase the amount}} of nitrogen available for the next crop, due to increased nitrogen mineralization. Further, the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> reduced nitrogen leaching during the cold seasons to half when the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> was left to grow until spring ploughing. In late autumn, the amount of nitrogen in <b>catch</b> <b>crop,</b> including other green vegetation, was 15 - 17 kg N/ha, which were in the same range as the decrease of nitrogen leaching in treatments with spring ploughing and an undersown ryegrass. When tillage was delayed from early autumn to spring (without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop),</b> nitrogen leaching decreased with 25 %, due to lower mineralization during autumn and winter. Ploughing in spring did not result in increased nitrogen delivery from the soil during growing season, compared with tillage in early autumn. When pig slurry was used, nitrogen leaching increased somewhat, compared with treatments with commercial fertilizer nitrogen, due to increased nitrogen mineralization. The amount of plant available soil nitrogen during the growing season was also larger in treatments with pig slurry applications. Balances of nitrogen were positive in all treatments, especially in treatments with <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and spring ploughing. By spring ploughing and using a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> it seems to be possible to manipulate the mineralization to be lower wintertime and increse during the growing season.

5000|$|Some {{forms of}} {{cultural}} control of Orobanche aegyptiaca include sanitation {{efforts to help}} prevent the movement of seeds, individual picking of weeds by hand, and avoidance by changing the sowing time or not growing a host plant. Reducing spread of infected soil via farm machinery, avoidance of grazing on infected plants, and staying away {{from the use of}} hay produced from [...] "Orobanche"-infested plants are all methods to help prevent the movement of seeds. The individual picking of weeds by hand is very important as the plant is able continue living as only a stem and produce a flower that can spread seeds even while not connected to the host. Any avoidance strategy must be carried out with a plant that cannot be parasitized by [...] "Orobanche aegyptiaca" [...] and could take up to 15-20 years to complete, as this is how long the plant's seeds can remain viable in the soil. Also, because seeds can safely pass through an animal digestive system, it’s important to ensure manure is not contaminated. Another option for cultural control is the use of trap crops or <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> Trap crops promote the germination of O. aegyptiaca seeds but will not allow parasitism; these include flax, mung bean, maize, and sorghum. <b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> allow parasitism but are destroyed before the parasitic plant flowers, so the broomrape seeds cannot be produced and dispersed. Finally, there has been some success with host plant resistance in sunflower, fafa bean, lentil, and tomato but it has been very limited. Resistant cultivars of sunflower were bred in Russia and Spain but quickly lost their host-plant resistance due to selection towards more aggressive biotypes of the plant that had adapted to the new cultivars. In the resistant sunflower cultivars, germination was still induced but the plant's germ tube never develops after penetration by the haustorium. Because has been shown that macromolecules are transferred from the host to the parasite, one method for resistance is the introduction of anti-microbial gene from the flesh fly into the host genome. This allows for its protein product to be transferred to the parasite and work as a means of control.|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} adaptive {{strategy for}} reducing climate change risks and increasing agro-system resiliency is broadening cropping system diversity, heightening {{the flexibility of}} cultivation and tillage methods. Climate change impacts on standard cultivation practices such as mineralisation and nitrate leaching due to mild and rainy winters, as well as frequent drought or water saturation, not only limiting fieldwork days, but also restricting ploughing. This calls for alternative methods to counteract these propensities. From 2010 to 2013, a farming system experiment was conducted on a distinctly heterogeneous organic farm in Brandenburg, Germany. With the intention of devising a more varied and flexible winter wheat cultivation method, standard organic farming practices (winter wheat cultivation {{after two years of}} alfalfa-clover-grass and ploughing in mid-October) were compared to four alternative test methods, which were then evaluated for their robustness and suitability as adaptive strategies. Two of the alternative methods, early sowing and <b>catch</b> <b>crop,</b> entailed moving up the date for alfalfa-clover-grass tilling to July. Instead of a plough, a ring-cutter was used to shallowly (8 cm) cut through and mix the topsoil. In the early sowing test method, winter wheat was sown at the end of August, after repeated ring-cutter processing. With the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> method, winter wheat seeding followed a summer <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and October tillage. The two oat methods (oat/plough; oat/ring-cutter) entailed sowing winter wheat in September, following oat cultivation. Overall, the cultivation methods demonstrated the following robustness gradation: standard practice = <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> ≥ early sowing > oat/plough > oat/ring-cutter. When compared to standard procedures, the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and early sowing test methods showed no remarkable difference in grain yields. Measured against early sowing, the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> test method was significantly more robust when it came to winterkill, quality loss, and weed infestation (40 % lower weed-cover). High N min- values (up to 116 kg N ha - 1) in autumn could have caused the chamomile and thistle infestation in both oat/plough oat/ring-cutter test methods, which led to crop failure in the hollows. Compared to standard practices, the oat ring-cutter test method brought in over 50 % less grain yield. This was attributed to ring-cutter processing, which reduced N mineralisation and caused high weed infestation. However, the ring-cutter effectively regulated alfalfa-clover-grass fields in both exceedingly wet and very dry weather; a temporal flexibility which increases the number of fieldwork days. The <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and early sowing test methods contributed most to boosting future agronomic diversity...|$|R

Two field experiments were performed, which included different animal manure regimes and different soil K- and N-levels. The residual effect of the clover catch crop on the yields of a succeeding spring barley test crop was significantly higher than for the ryegrass. When animal manure (70 kg total-N ha- 1) was added to the succeeding spring barley in the ryegrass system the difference between the clover and ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> disappeared. Thus clover appeared to have the potential for substituting animal manure. Leaching of nitrate-N and K were estimated by means of porous ceramic suction cups installed at 0. 8 m depth. The annual N leaching from a spring barley reference treatment without <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were approximately 100 kg ha- 1. Clover and ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> reduced the losses significantly by 40 to about 80 % depending on the year, and {{there were no significant differences}} between the two catch crop types.

40|$|A {{model of}} soil {{nitrogen}} dynamics under competing intercrops is described {{and used to}} interpret two sets of experimental field data from the literature. In one series of experiments, maize received slurry and mineral nitrogen (N) fertiliser or mineral N alone and was grown either alone or intercropped with undersown grass or with a subsequent rye <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> during 7 years continuously. In the second system, the model compares field beans intercropped spatially at different densities with winter wheat. The model suggests that undersowing grass between the rows of an established maize crop can reduce concentrations of nitrate in water draining from soils during winter by 15 mg l¿ 1 compared with a conventional <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and by more than 20 mg l¿ 1 compared with a fallow soil. The model further suggests that the yield and profitability of mixed stands of commercial crops is inversely related to the residual nitrate at harvest (potential leaching). It is concluded that intercropping may be a useful means to reduce nutrient pollution from farming while maintaining yields Keywords: Intercropping; Model; Nitrogen; Leaching; Environmen...|$|R
40|$|In {{maritime}} climates {{the production}} of winter wheat often leads to high nitrate leaching losses. In this study mixtures of winter wheat and <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were analyzed as alternative growing system to avoid high leaching losses. In a field experiment pure winter wheat grown as control showed highest N-losses. Leaching losses of 140 kg N ha- 1 after the pre-crop grass-clover and of 50 kg N ha- 1 after oats as pre-crop were measured. Compared to this, growing winter wheat in mixture with forage rape or oats reduced nitrate leaching by 50 %. Common vetch as mixture partner to winter wheat had a lower potential to reduce leaching losses. Comparable results were obtained growing the <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> alone followed by spring wheat. Due to the competition for growth factors between <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and cereal, yields of the tested mixtures were {{lower than those of}} spring wheat grown after <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> {{as well as of the}} winter wheat control. Early sown mixtures of winter wheat and <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> showed satisfactory yields...|$|E
40|$|In {{organic farming}} winter wheat is {{typically}} grown after good pre-crops, as it pays well for {{this in terms}} of yield and quality. However, winter wheat develops slowly during the autumn, and much nitrate may be lost by leaching before spring. System with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> followed by spring wheat, or maybe <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> intercropped with winter wheat could improve the utilization of the pre-crop effects in wheat cropping. In this experiment we studied wheat and catch crop root growth, crop and soil N dynamics, and effects on yield and baking quality in wheat cropping systems with <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> The results showed that the com-bination of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and spring wheat was ideal for resource use, but also that winter wheat had a much deeper root system (c. 2. 0 m) than spring wheat (c. 1. 0 m), and that the N loss from the winter wheat crops therefore became smaller than expected. Intercropping systems with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and winter wheat showed some promising results, but they are also very difficult to manage. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> might reduce {{sulphate}} leaching {{and thereby}} increase the overall S use efficiency in crop rotations. At 2 experimental sites in Denmark (a sandy loam and a coarse sand) S uptake of catch crop species was measured. Furthermore net release of S following incorporation {{of this material}} (S contents 0. 13 - 1. 03 %, C:S ratios of 40 - 329 and lignin content of 1 - 10. 8 %) was investigated in a pot experiment with spring barley in sandy soil. The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> showed huge differences {{in their ability to}} sequester S. The best <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (legumes on sandy loam), sequestered 10 - 12 kg S ha- 1 and the poorest <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (ryegrass and sorrel on coarse sand), sequestered less than 3 kg S ha- 1. The S mineralisation rates were highest for crucifers (57 - 85 % of total S added) and lowest for legumes (up to 46 % of total S added). Differences can partly be explained by the C:S ratio, whereas no significant relationship was found with the lignin content of the incorporated <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> may constitute a solution that can help avoiding S deficiency and increase synchrony between plant demand and available soil S in a crop rotation. However, the release of S will not fulfil the need of S demanding crops and even for cereals the mineralisation will most often only make a contribution. In the case of legume <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> it is advisable to use a supplemental S source...|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} is conducted {{which focuses on}} crop rotations for cereal production in organic farming. The objective of the experiment is to explore the possibilities for both short-term and long-term increases in organic cereal production through manipulation of crop rotation design on different soil types. This paper describes {{the design of a}} rather complex experiment, and later papers will describe and discuss the results. Three factors are included in the experiment in a factorial design with two replicates: A) fraction of grass-clover and pulses in the rotation (<b>crop</b> rotation), B) <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> (with or without <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> or bi-cropped clover), and C) manure (with or without animal manure applied as slurry). All fields in all rotations are represented each year. The experimental factors are defined to allow management to be adjusted for optimisation of the individual treatment combinations. This makes the systems more realistic and the results more applicable in practical farming. The experiment is conducted at four locations representing major soil types and climate regions in Denmark. The main design criteria are related to requirements for a long-term experiment and the need of performing studies and experiments within the experiment itself...|$|R
