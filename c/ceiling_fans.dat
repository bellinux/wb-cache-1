40|$|Summary: This study {{examines}} {{the way of}} utilizing a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> for airflow control in a large air-conditioned room. Although it seems that CFD simulation is useful in predicting the airflow around a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan,</b> modeling of a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> as a body of rotation is very complicated. Therefore, in this study, airflow of a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> is modeled as boundary conditions of air velocity data measured near the <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan.</b> In this paper, the measured airflow pattern around a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> is compared with the CFD simulation result using the airflow model of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan,</b> {{in order to examine}} the validity of the airflow model.

40|$|In this study, {{the way of}} {{utilizing}} a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> for airflow control in a large air-conditioned room was examined. Although it seems that CFD simulation is useful in predicting the airflow, modeling of a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> as a rotational body is very complicated. Therefore, the airflow by <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> is modeled by fixing air velocity measured near the <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan.</b> In this paper, CFD simulation for airflow around the <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> with standard k-ε model and Reynolds stress model was conducted. The calculation result of Reynolds stress model {{turned out to be}} in agreement with the measurement one. The calculation result of standard k-ε model was different from it, concerning the impinging region on the floor. Moreover, CFD simulation using this airflow model was conducted near the ceiling. In the limited situations where the <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> was extremely close to the ceiling, this model might be hardly applicable...|$|R

25|$|In 2010, the non-teaching staff {{organised}} {{a strike}} against the management (headed by then trustee of Parshvanath Charitable Trust – Mr. Tekchand Shah) for non-payment of their salaries. Due to the strike, classes were not held for several days. At the same time, the political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's local branch also held a movement on college campus against then vice-principal and applied chemistry lecturer Mr. S. D. Shah for alleged harassment of some female {{students and staff}} members. The students also protested against {{certain aspects of the}} college that made student life difficult. For example: absence of basic facilities like <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> in classrooms, canteen for the college, etc.; certain college rules like students not being allowed to wear T-shirts (and punishments like college IDs being confiscated, fines of Rs 100 or more being imposed on students not obeying these rules, or found loitering outside class during lecture/practical hours). The events led to the arrest (and later release on bail) of Mr. S. D. Shah, change of the PCT trustee from Mr. Teckchand Shah to Mr. Ashok Bhai Shah, and change of the college principal from Dr. Ram Reddy to Dr. Uttam D. Kolekar. In the transition process, the college was managed by the state government of Maharashtra. Mr. S. D. Shah has not been working in the college since his arrest.|$|E

500|$|Even {{though the}} woods in each cab were {{arranged}} in four basic patterns, all the elevator cabs used a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that [...] "if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [...] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences {{on the design of}} the entire building." [...] The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also [...] customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans.</b> Curcio writes that these elevators [...] "are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and {{it is fair to say}} that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them". Curcio also compares the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side. The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings. Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary marquetry.|$|E

The performance is gauged through response parameters namely volumetric flow rate, mass flow rate, torque and energy efficiency.
