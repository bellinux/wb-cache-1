The paper {{presents}} {{the provisions of}} Directive 2011 / 7 /EU on combating late payment in commercial transactions by virtue of which the EU Member States are obliged to limit the contractual freedom in contracts between undertakings. The Directive’s rules on the <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> period of 60 calendar days and on the exceptionally longer <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> period, {{as well as on}} payment schedules providing for instalments, are also analysed. The author argues the position that, if the payment period is not fixed in the contract but the contract stipulates that the determination of the payment period is left to the will of one of the contracting parties, then such unilaterally decided payment period should be considered as the payment period fixed in the contract {{in the sense of the}} provisions of Directive 2011 / 7 /EU. The same solution should be applied when the payment period is determined through commercial customs or practice established between undertakings. As one of the possible improvements of the legal regime established by the Directive, the author proposes a restriction of the contractual freedom of undertakings regarding the stipulation of the date of commencement of <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> period in order to prevent potential abuse of freedom of contract...|$|R

50|$|For a fully amortizing loan, with a fixed (i.e., non-variable) {{interest}} rate, {{the payment}} {{remains the same}} throughout the term, regardless of principal balance owed.

Paying down more than the monthly contractual amount reduces the amount outstanding and thus the interest that is payable to the lender; if the <b>contractual</b> monthly <b>payment</b> stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must decrease.

5000|$|ERISA Reimbursement is the {{terminology}} utilized to describe an ERISA Plan’s effort {{to require that}} it be paid back for medical bills expended {{on behalf of a}} Participant or Beneficiary of the ERISA Plan. The concept of “reimbursement” {{can be traced to the}} traditional doctrine of “Subrogation,” but it exists today without the traditional safeguards established in the development of the law concerning subrogation. When an insurer pays a claim to an insured, the insurer generally has the right to “step in the shoes” of the insured for the purpose of recapturing that money by pursuing a claim against the tortfeasor who may be liable for the loss. [...] An ERISA plan’s “right of reimbursement” is essentially a subrogation claim. Although there are subtle legal distinctions between “subrogation” and “reimbursement,” these devices are essentially the same.Unfortunately, there is little or no oversight on the ability of ERISA Plans (and their insurers) to pursue reimbursement claims. Historically, subrogation actions were limited at common law to matters involving property damage claims, with subrogation on personal injury claims being specifically prohibited. [...] Authority for “ERISA reimbursement" [...] claims is attributed to federal preemption under the auspices of ERISA which was enacted in 1974. At the time ERISA was enacted by Congress, however, subrogation for health insurers was uniformly prohibited in the United States. Such claims were deemed unlawful in all jurisdictions. [...] The first reported judicial decision involving an effort of a health insurer to seek subrogation on a personal injury claim is the 1982 decision in Frost v. Porter Leasing Corp., 436 N.E.2d 387 (Mass. 1982) in which subrogation was denied. “ERISA reimbursement” claims began arising in the late 1980s and have been resisted by some federal courts. According to industry statistics, ERISA plans and related insurers are collecting close to $1 billion per year through the seizure of tort recoveries or other <b>contractual</b> <b>payments</b> received by insured personal injury victims. The plans tend to pursue reimbursement on a [...] "first dollar priority" [...] basis in order to maintain steady insurance premiums for their members.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} industry in Ghana, {{like many others}} worldwide, has had {{its fair share of}} damning independent reviews. Huge and unsustainable foreign debt, excessive budget deficits, huge <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> arrears, poor construction performance, corruption and pressure from international financial institutions, forced the government to commit to a reform of public procurement, which culminated in the passing of the Public Procurement Act, 2003 (Act 663). The paper outlines the events leading to, and features of, the public procurement reform in Ghana and analyses its potential impact and the unique challenges it presents. Comparisons are also drawn from relevant scenarios in other countries. The paper concludes that while the Procurement Act sets out the legal, institutional and regulatory framework to secure fiscal transparency and public accountability, the sole reliance on traditional contracting and price-based selection limits the scope for the value for money achievable. Expanding the reforms to cover procurement and project delivery methods and strategies, with a focus on ‘best value’, will increase the potential and likelihood of achieving value for money in public construction in Ghana. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5000|$|Research of Nöldeke & Schmidt (1995) {{argued that}} the underinvestment problem due to the hold-up problem is {{eliminated}} if parties are able to write a simple option contract.

However, such a contract is unachievable unless it is possible to enforce the payments conditional on the delivery decision of the seller. That means that the court must be able to verify delivery of the good to the buyer by the seller.

40|$|In {{developed}} countries in everyday business, payment delays often present a problem. Payment delays {{have already been}} a matter of discussion in Slovenia for several years. Irrespective of some positive movements in the past years, the state of payment discipline in Slovenia is not at a satisfactory level. In this area, Slovenia could be classified among the less successful countries when compared to other countries in Europe. Our paper determines factors behind this fact. The findings are important not only for Slovenia, but also for other EU candidate countries faced with similar problems of transition. The paper has led to the following conclusions. Firstly, the more indebted companies have longer payment delays. Secondly, the longer the <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> period, the shorter the payment delay. Longer payment periods are mostly received by larger companies. And thirdly, the longer the payment delays on the side of companies. buyers, the higher the incidence of late payments by the company.

40|$|Transit {{properties}} in the USA have historically experienced loss of market share {{and low levels of}} farebox recovery. They resorted to service expansion to maximize subsidies. Experience suggests that: (a) fare increases have not had the desired effect; (b) fare reductions can boost ridership but can also reduce revenue and increase subsidies. The challenge lies with the adoption of such strategies as deep discount group pass programs that can produce more marginal revenue than cost. Deep discount transit pass programs provide groups of people with unlimited-ride transit passes in exchange for a <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> for or on behalf of pass users by an employer or other organizing body. i Although successes of deep discount group pass programs are documented, there is substantial skepticism toward their wide-scale deployment because transit management perceives them as “special treatments ” or “favors ” to participants.
