25|$|At {{the end of}} the 109th Congress, the Gang of 14 deal expired. On November 7, 2006, the Democrats retook {{control in}} the 110th Congress. Starting in January 2007, they possessed a 51-49 {{majority}} in the Senate. As the new Senate majority, the Democrats easily blocked several conservative appellate judicial nominees without resorting to the filibuster. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing. If a Supreme Court justice had chosen to retire during the 110th Congress, {{it would have been easy}} for the Democrats to have blocked his proposed replacement in committee, or even by a party-line vote on the Senate floor, if it somehow <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> As it developed, no Supreme Court justice retired or died during the 110th Congress.|$|E
25|$|In December 2013 in a blog {{article for}} The Spectator website {{published}} shortly after Nelson Mandela died, Rod Liddle wrote of BBC coverage: But for Christ's sake BBC, {{give it a}} bloody break for five minutes, will you? It's as if the poor bugger now has to bear your entire self-flagellating white post-colonial bien pensant guilt; look! Famous nice black man dies! Let's re-run {{the entire history of}} South Africa. That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.|$|E

2500|$|The Syrian {{tradition}} {{was introduced to}} Jerusalem by Raphael Altaras, who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> city from Aleppo in 1845 and founded a Baqashot circle at the Kehal Tsiyon synagogue. [...] In this way the custom of Baqashot {{became part of the}} mainstream Jerusalem Sephardic tradition. [...] Another important influence was Jacob Ades (1857–1925), who immigrated to Jerusalem in 1895 and introduced the tradition to the Persian and Bukharan communities. [...] The main centre of the tradition today is the Ades Synagogue in Nachlaot, where the leading spirit was Shaul Aboud, a pupil of Moshe Ashear.|$|E
2500|$|The book {{starts in}} the preterite, [...] "Oeroeg was my friend", and in reverse chronological order tells how the narrator <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> conclusion. The narrator grows up {{the child of a}} white Dutch family on Java, with Oeroeg, a native young man; as high-school {{students}} they live together in a boarding house. One crucial event is the death of Oeroeg's father, who died while saving the narrator from drowning. During World War II the narrator joins the Dutch army, and when he returns to Java finds that the world has changed: Indonesian nationalists have declared independence, and no longer accept the colonial overlord. In addition, the narrator's father is murdered, and he suspects his old friend, who has joined the Indonesian nationalist movement, of avenging his own father's death. At the end of the novel, the narrator has lost his friend, his identity, and his home country.|$|E
2500|$|The Astros won the National League Division Series {{against the}} Atlanta Braves, 3-1, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players {{used by a}} single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6-1, Lance Berkman hit an eighth inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6–5. In {{the bottom of the}} ninth, catcher Brad Ausmus, hit a game tying home run that allowed the game to {{continue}} in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the fifteenth inning, Roger Clemens made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out Julio Franco, at the time the oldest player in the MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, if it <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> Clemens struck out, but the next batter, Chris Burke, hit a home run to left field for the Astros win, 7–6. Oddly enough, a fan in the [...] "Crawford Boxes" [...] in left field had previously caught Berkman's grand slam and this same fan caught Burke's home run. [...] The National League Championship Series featured a rematch of the 2004 NLCS. The Astros lost the first game in St. Louis, but would win the next three games, with Roy Oswalt getting the win. Though the Astros were poised to close out the series in Game Five in Houston, Brad Lidge gave up a monstrous two-out three-run home run to Albert Pujols, forcing the series to a sixth game in St. Louis, where the Astros clinched a World Series appearance. Roy Oswalt was named NLCS MVP, having gone 2–0 with a 1.29 ERA in the series. Current honorary NL President William Y. Giles presented the league champion Astros with the Warren C. Giles Trophy. Warren Giles, William's father and President of the National League from [...] to , had awarded an MLB franchise to the city of Houston in 1960.|$|E
