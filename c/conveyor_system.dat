In 2011, Coca-Cola also awarded Star Breweries the Gold Medal among 27 competing African countries for the company's standards of quality and environmental protection {{in the production of}} its beer and other beverages. Frequent brownouts resulting from the overtaxed national power grid produce power cuts to the THB breweries that have negatively affected the volume and cost effectiveness of production since the early 2000s.|$|E

25|$|Seattle Mayor George Cotterill, an engineer, was not {{in favor}} of some of the farmer's plans and the idea of such a large {{municipal}} bond. Cotterill appointed a committee to study the various requests and complaints of the farmers, and the committee {{came to the conclusion that}} the planned floor expansion and <b>conveyor</b> <b>system</b> the farmers wanted would be unsanitary, difficult to maintain, and far more expensive than they had projected. In response, Cotterill drafted an alternate ballot initiative, for a $25,000 municipal bond. Cotterill's initiative would result in Pike Place becoming a paved road rather than the wood road it currently was, would expand the sidewalks along the arcades by , and would improve all the Market roadsides for wagon stalls and tables, placing them all under roofing. On March 13, 1913, Seattle voters rejected the farmer initiative, and passed the mayor's initiative. The first major expansion work on the Market began immediately.|$|E

500|$|On November 6, 1928, an {{electronic}} news ticker {{known as the}} Motograph News Bulletin (colloquially known as the [...] "zipper") was introduced near {{the base of the}} building. The zipper originally consisted of 14,800 light bulbs, with the display controlled by a chain <b>conveyor</b> <b>system</b> inside the building; individual letter elements (a form of movable type) were loaded into frames to spell out news headlines. As the frames moved along the conveyor, the letters themselves triggered electrical contacts which lit the external bulbs (the zipper has since been upgraded to use modern LED technology). The first headline displayed on the zipper announced Herbert Hoover's victory in that day's presidential election. The zipper was used to display other major news headlines of the era, and its content later expanded to include sports and weather updates as well. On the evening of August 14, 1945, the zipper was famously used to announce Japan's surrender from World War II to a packed crowd in Times Square.|$|E
500|$|There are {{different}} ways in which the raw materials are charged into the blast furnace. Some blast furnaces use a [...] "double bell" [...] system where two [...] "bells" [...] are used to control the entry of raw material into the blast furnace. The purpose of the two bells is to minimize the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace. First, the raw materials are emptied into the upper or small bell which then opens to empty the charge into the large bell. The small bell then closes, to seal the blast furnace, while the large bell rotates to provide specific distribution of materials before dispensing the charge into the blast furnace. A more recent design is to use a [...] "bell-less" [...] system. These systems use multiple hoppers to contain each raw material, which is then discharged into the blast furnace through valves. These valves are more accurate at controlling how much of each constituent is added, as compared to the skip or <b>conveyor</b> <b>system,</b> thereby increasing the efficiency of the furnace. Some of these bell-less systems also implement a discharge chute in the throat of the furnace (as with the Paul Wurth top) in order to precisely control where the charge is placed.|$|E

The conveyor runs at an elevation of 10–13m and has provision for longitudinal movement along the road to the plots and transverse movement for stacking coal at individual plots.
