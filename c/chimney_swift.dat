25|$|The {{legs of the}} <b>chimney</b> <b>swift,</b> {{like those}} of all swifts, are very short. Its feet are small but strong, with very short toes that are tipped with sharp, curved claws. The toes are anisodactyl—three forward, one back—like those of most birds, but the <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> can swivel its back toe (its hallux) forward to help it get a better grip. Unlike the legs and feet of most birds, those of the <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> have no scales; instead, they are covered with smooth skin.|$|E
25|$|The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> has a twittering call, {{consisting}} of a rapid series of hard, high-pitched chirps. It sometimes gives single chirps.|$|E
25|$|The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> (Chaetura pelagica) is a bird {{belonging}} to the swift family Apodidae. A member of the genus Chaetura, it {{is closely related to}} both the Vaux's swift and the Chapman's swift; in the past, the three were sometimes considered to be conspecific. It has no subspecies. The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> is a medium-sized, sooty gray bird with very long, slender wings and very short legs. Like all swifts, it is incapable of perching, and can only cling vertically to surfaces.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, Mary Day of New Jersey {{observed}} {{a pair of}} <b>chimney</b> <b>swifts</b> nesting in a chimney, and noted the incubation period was 19 days. The first detailed study of <b>chimney</b> <b>swifts</b> began in 1915 by self-taught ornithologist Althea Sherman in Iowa. She commissioned a 28 foot tall tower, of a similar design to a chimney, with ladders and peep holes installed to facilitate observation. <b>Chimney</b> <b>swifts</b> nested in her tower, and for over fifteen years, she meticulously recorded her observations, filling over 400 pages. Sherman remarked that although the tower had been designed with a limited knowledge of the nesting behaviour of <b>chimney</b> <b>swifts,</b> {{after many years of}} observation she believed that the original design was ideal.|$|R

25|$|The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> {{looks very}} much like the closely related Vaux's swift, but is {{slightly}} larger, with relatively longer wings and tail, slower wingbeats and a greater tendency to soar. It tends to be darker on the breast and rump than the Vaux's swift, though there is some overlap in plumage coloring. It can be as much as 30 percent heavier than the Vaux's swift, and its wings, which are proportionately narrower, show a pronounced bulge in the inner secondaries. The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> is smaller, paler and shorter tailed than the black swift. In Central America, it is most similar to the Chapman's swift, but it is paler (matte olive rather than glossy black) and has a stronger contrast between its pale throat and the rest of its underparts than does the more uniformly colored Chapman's swift.|$|E
25|$|A {{widespread}} breeding {{visitor to}} much of the eastern half of the United States and the southern reaches of eastern Canada, the <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> migrates to South America for the winter. It is a rare summer visitor to the western U.S, and has been recorded as a vagrant in Anguilla, Barbados, Greenland, Jamaica, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is found over open country, savanna, wooded slopes and humid forests.|$|E
25|$|Many swifts {{and some}} {{hummingbirds}} use thick, quick-drying saliva to anchor their nests. The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> starts by dabbing two globs of saliva onto {{the wall of}} a chimney or tree trunk. In flight, it breaks a small twig from a tree and presses it into the saliva, angling the twig downwards so that {{the central part of the}} nest is the lowest. It continues adding globs of saliva and twigs until it has made a crescent-shaped cup.|$|E

25|$|After sudden {{temperature}} drops, the <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> sometimes hunts {{low over}} concrete roads (presumably following insect prey {{drawn to the}} warmer road), where collisions with vehicles become more likely. Severe storms, such as hurricanes, encountered during migration can seriously impact the chimney's swift's survival rates. Swifts caught up in 2005's Hurricane Wilma were swept {{as far north as}} Atlantic Canada and Western Europe. More than 700 were found dead. The following year, roost counts in the province of Quebec, Canada showed a decrease of 62 percent, and the overall population in the province was halved.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature {{changed the}} chimney swift's status from least concern to near threatened. Although the global {{population}} {{is estimated at}} , it has declined precipitously across {{the majority of its}} range. The causes of population declines are largely unclear, but {{may be related to the}} alteration of the insect community due to pesticide use in the early half of the 20th century. In Canada, they were listed as threatened by COSEWIC for several years with a likely future listing as a Schedule 1 species of the Species at Risk Act. In the U.S., the <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Neither birds nor nests can be removed from chimneys without a federally-issued permit.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} insects, arachnids, and birds prey on these ants, {{especially}} when queens {{are trying to}} establish a new colony. Many species of dragonfly, including Anax junius, Pachydiplax longipennis, Somatochlora provocans, and Tramea carolina, capture the queens while they are in flight; 16 species of spiders, including the wolf spider Lycosa timuga and the southern black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans), actively kill red imported fire ants. L. mactans captures all castes of the species (the workers, queens, and males) within its web. These ants constitute 75% of prey captured by the spider. Juvenile L. mactans spiders have also been seen capturing the ants. Other invertebrates that prey on red imported fire ants are earwigs (Labidura riparia) and tiger beetles (Cicindella punctulata). Birds that eat these ants include the <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> (Chaetura pelagica), the eastern kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus), and the eastern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus virginianus). The eastern bobwhite attacks these ants by digging out the mounds looking for young queens. Red imported fire ants have been found in stomach contents inside of armadillos.|$|E

Like many bird species, the <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> periodically coughs up pellets composed of indigestible bits of prey items.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> is a monogamous breeder which {{normally}} mates for life, though {{a small percentage}} of birds change partners.

2500|$|During the {{breeding}} season, {{at least half}} of the chimney swift's forays occur within [...] of its nest; however, it ranges up to [...] away. While most of its food is seized following aerial pursuit, some is gleaned from the foliage of trees; the bird hovers near the ends of branches or drops through upper canopy levels. The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> generally flies quite high, though it descends during cold or rainy weather. When feeding, it regularly occurs in small groups, and sometimes hunts with swallows, particularly barn swallows and purple martins; in mixed-species flocks, it is typically among the lower fliers. There is at least one record of a <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> attempting to steal a dragonfly from a purple martin, and it has been observed chasing other purple martins. In general, it is a diurnal feeder which remains active into early evening. However, there are records, particularly during migration periods, of chimney swifts feeding well after dark over brightly lit buildings.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> {{carries a}} number of {{internal}} and external parasites. It is the type host for the nematode species Aproctella nuda, the feather mite species Euchineustathia tricapitosetosa, and the biting lice species [...] Dennyus dubius, and is also known to carry the tapeworm species Pseudochoanotaenia collocaliae. Its nest is known to host the Hemiptera species Cimexopsis nyctali, {{which is similar to}} the bedbug and can (on rare occasions) become a pest species in houses.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> is a [...] species, and {{is seldom}} seen alone. It {{generally}} hunts {{in groups of}} two or three, migrates in loose flocks of 6–20, and (once the breeding season is over) sleeps in huge communal roosts of {{hundreds or thousands of}} birds. Like all swifts, it is a superb aerialist, and only rarely seen at rest. It drinks on the wing, skimming {{the surface of the water}} with its beak. It also bathes on the wing, gliding above the surface of a body of water, briefly smacking its breast into the water, then flying off again, shaking its feathers as it goes. It has been recorded by pilots flying more than a mile above the surface of the earth, including one seen at [...] It is incapable of perching upright like most birds do; instead, it clings to vertical surfaces. If it is disturbed while at rest, the <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> will clap its wings loudly once or twice against its body; it does this either in place, or while dropping down several feet to a lower location. This behavior can result in a loud [...] "thundering" [...] sound if large roosts of the birds are disturbed. The sound is thought to be the bird's way of scaring away potential predators.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> has large, deep set eyes. These are {{protected}} by small patches of coarse, black, bristly feathers, which are located {{in front of each}} eye. The swift can change the angle of these feathers, which may help to reduce glare. It is far-sighted and, like some birds of prey, this swift is bifoveal: each eye having both a temporal and a central fovea.

2500|$|Before {{the arrival}} of European colonists into North America, the <b>chimney</b> <b>swift</b> nested in hollow trees; now, it uses human-built {{structures}} almost exclusively. While the occasional nest is still built in a hollow tree (or, exceptionally, in an abandoned woodpecker nest), most are now found in chimneys, with smaller numbers in airshafts, the dark corners of lightly used buildings, cisterns, or wells. The nest is a shallow bracket made of sticks, which the birds gather in flight, breaking them off trees. The sticks are glued together (and the nest to a vertical surface) with copious amounts of the bird's saliva. During the breeding season, each adult's salivary glands more than double in size, from [...] in the non-breeding season to [...] during the breeding season.|$|E
2500|$|Mississippi kites, {{peregrine}} falcons and merlins are raptors {{that are}} known to take adult <b>chimney</b> <b>swifts</b> in flight, being among the select few avian hunters fast enough to overtake the appropriately named swift on the wing. Eastern screech-owls have been seen attacking colonies, as have non-avian predators including eastern rat snakes, northern raccoons and tree squirrels. These {{are most likely to}} take nestlings but may take some nesting adults as well. When disturbed by potential predators (including humans) at the colony, adult <b>chimney</b> <b>swifts</b> slap their wings together after arching back and taking flight, making a very loud noise known either as [...] "booming" [...] or [...] "thunder noises".

25|$|The species shows two weight peaks each year: one at {{the start}} of the {{breeding}} season, and a higher one shortly before it begins its migration south in the autumn. Its lowest weights are typically recorded during the breeding season, when it also begins a complete molt of its plumage. The <b>chimney</b> <b>swift's</b> weight gain before migration is smaller than that of some passerines, suggesting that it must refuel en route at various stopover points.|$|R
