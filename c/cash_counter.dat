You put all bills together and pay at the <b>cash</b> <b>counter</b> and take it to the delivery section where your payment is verified and your purchases are delivered to you. This method has been highly acclaimed by many organizations and institutions as a very efficient way of processing checkouts, at a store that is always crowded.

40|$|This paper {{brings up}} {{this idea of}} using Near Field Communication (NFC) for {{inventory}} control system instead of using traditional barcodes. NFC because of its high security, ease of use and efficiency can be very suitable for systems like inventory control. In traditional inventory control systems, each product has a barcode pasted on it, which is vulnerable to attacks as barcodes are open and have no security. Furthermore, barcodes are prone to damages and can be unreliable when pasted on different types of products e. g. hot and frozen products, circular shaped products and irregular shaped products like clothes etc. NFC {{on the other hand}} is very efficient, secure and reliable when it comes to short-range wireless communication. In this paper we will present our prototype for the inventory control system of an electronic store in which each product has a passive NFC tag pasted to it. When a customer buys a product the receipt of the product is generated using NFC between the NFC passive tag on the product and NFC enabled device (e. g. smart phone or reader) at the <b>cash</b> <b>counter...</b>|$|E

Several researchers have contributed in the direction of general distributed service time queueing system. To mention a few notable works of researchers in this area, we refer [Baba (1986]), [Doshi (1990]) and [Medhi (1997]) and references cited therein. The queueing system under the special consideration with respect to idle period (i.e., vacation) is not new. [Levy and Yechiali (1975]) have considered such model under the assumption that the server takes a sequence of vacations until it finds at least one unit is waiting in the system. The analysis of M/G/ 1 queue by using the method of supplementary variables has been done by [Takagi (1991]).|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 51). Premier bank limited {{is one of the}} leading private commercial banks in the country. It is serving the nation from last 13 years. It has become the largest competitors among its peer group. Customer satisfaction is a measure of how products and services supplied by a company meet or surpass customer expectation. It is seen as a key performance indicator within a business. So, evaluating the level of customer satisfaction actually helps to measure an organization„s position in business. I„ve measured the customer satisfaction level of Premier Bank Limited, Uttara Branch. I„ve calculated the Customer Satisfaction Index by using SERVQUAL instrument having 22 statements on service quality dimensions through face to face interviews with the accountholders of the bank. Their agreements (agree & strongly agree) with the SERVQUAL statements touching the cut off score (4 & 5) used in 5 point Likert Scale is considered as satisfied in this study. The study shows that customers conceive this bank as reliable in getting accurate promised services, problem solving and in maintaining error free record. They also believe that there is assurance of competency, courtesy, credibility & security by the bank. They are also satisfied by the tangible appearances of the bank. But the customers are not enough satisfied in getting personal attention and they think that employees do not understand their specific needs. The unweighted SERVQUAL score of 4. 27 and weighted score or Customer Satisfaction Index of 4. 25 indicates a satisfactory state in the overall level of customer satisfaction. On the basis of conducted Key Informants Interviews, the quantitative study result and my observation I believe that appointing more employees under General Banking department, maintaining time slots for each customer to serve, setting up of electronic calling machine for <b>cash</b> <b>counter</b> and customer service, setting up of query desk, replacement of core banking software by better one, regular arrangement of employee training workshops, appointing female employees, etc. will help to increase the satisfaction level of the customers of the bank.

40|$|This {{research}} memorandum {{presents and}} discusses {{the results of}} the 12 th DNB-euro survey which was held in July 2001 among the Dutch public and business sector. The business community has energetically embarked upon preparing for the euro. Large scale and medium-sized enterprises have materialised 70 % of the necessary investments, small businesses around 50 %. Although quite a few things have yet to be done, the enterpreneurs themselves are confident on the outcome. Two thirds of Dutch society has faith in the euro as a successor to the guilder. Both satisfaction about the provision of information and the actual euro knowledge has improved considerably. This particularly holds for the knowledge of the correct duration of the dual fase, although this remains a subject of constant concern. Public and business community are rather worried whether a smooth transition from guilder to euro is feasible. They fear it's too complex an operation and foresee long cues at <b>cash</b> desks, <b>counters</b> and booking offices. To alleviate the burden of the euroconversion carried by retailers a growing number of Dutchmen is prepared to use payment cards. Finally, four out of five interviewees assume that the euroconversion will lead to veiled price increases, although so far neither the Consumentenbond nor the Nederlandsche Bank found facts or arguments to sustain their fear. euro; EMU; euro-conversion...|$|R

This was {{necessary in order to}} meet the close tolerances required to reliably encode and read the data on the Magnetic Stripe Cards by magnetic write/read heads. The magnetic stripe was encoded with a single track of data utilizing the IBM Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code format. The Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code was developed by the IBM Systems Development Division working at Research Triangle Park in Raleigh North Carolina headed up by George J. Laurer. Other members of the group were N. Joseph Woodland, Paul McEnroe, Dr. Robert Evans, Bernard Silver, Art Hamburgen, Heard Baumeister and Bill Crouse. The IBM group in Raleigh was competing with RCA, Litton-Zellweger and other companies who were working with the National Retail Merchants Association NRMA to develop a standard optical bar code to be used in the retail industry. NRMA wanted an optically readable code that could be printed on products allowing purchasers to rapidly [...] "check out" [...] at the new electronic <b>cash</b> register/checkout <b>counters</b> being developed. The code would also be used for production and inventory control of products. Of the many optical bar codes submitted to NRMA by IBM and other companies, NRMA finally selected the later version of the IBM bar code known as the Delta Distance D Optical Bar Code format. The Delta Distance C Code was an earlier version of the UPC Universal Product Code. The UPC code was selected in 1973 by NRMA as their standard and has become the World Wide Standard that we all know today as the UPC Uniform Product Code.|$|R

This essay examines how management accounting is affected by restricted cash handling. The theory clarifies that management accounting strategies create guidelines and provides specific framework for employees and managers in the organization.

Bank staff were asked about the strategy regarding restricted cash handling, and how they expect it to affect management accounting. The results of the study shows that the banking industry is a highly controlled industry. Furthermore, restricted handling of cash partially affects the bank staff at a functional level. The service to manage <b>cash</b> over the <b>counter</b> is decreasing and begins to disappear and the service {{is replaced}} by ATM's and thus administrative management is the most affected.
