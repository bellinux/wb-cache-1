5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar in {{principle}} to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient.</b> This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to extracellular fluid, cytosol {{has a high}} concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient</b> through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the inert gas component of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient</b> will be greater for a given depth. This is usually achieved by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas, as substituting a different inert gas may have counter-diffusion complications due to differing rates of diffusion, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression.|$|E

40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and operation}} of a gradient-generating microfluidic device for studying cellular behavior is described. A microfluidic platform is an enabling experimental tool, because it can precisely manipulate fluid flows, enable high-throughput experiments, and generate stable soluble <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients.</b> Compared to conventional gradient generators, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) -based microfluidic devices can generate stable <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> of growth factors with well-defined profiles. Here, we developed simple gradient-generating microfluidic devices with three separate inlets. Three microchannels combined into one microchannel to generate <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients.</b> The stability and shape of growth factor gradients were confirmed by fluorescein isothyiocyanate (FITC) -dextran with a molecular weight similar to epidermal growth factor (EGF). Using this microfluidic device, we demonstrated that fibroblasts exposed to <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> of EGF migrated toward higher concentrations. The directional orientation of cell migration and motility of migrating cells were quantitatively assessed by cell tracking analysis. Thus, this gradient-generating microfluidic device might be useful for studying and analyzing the behavior of migrating cells...|$|R
5|$|The liquid thermal {{diffusion}} process {{was based on the}} discovery by Carl Ludwig in 1856 and later Charles Soret in 1879, that when a temperature gradient is maintained in an originally homogeneous salt solution, after a time, a <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient</b> will also exist in the solution. This is generally known today as the Soret effect. David Enskog in 1911 and Sydney Chapman in 1916 independently developed the Chapman–Enskog theory, which explained that when a mixture of two gases passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter gas at the warm end. This was experimentally confirmed by Chapman and F.W. Dootson in 1916.|$|E
5|$|This {{phosphorylation}} {{reaction is}} an equilibrium, {{which can be}} shifted by altering the proton-motive force. In {{the absence of a}} proton-motive force, the ATP synthase reaction will run from right to left, hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane. However, when the proton-motive force is high, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction; it proceeds from left to right, allowing protons to flow down their <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient</b> and turning ADP into ATP. Indeed, in the closely related vacuolar type H+-ATPases, the hydrolysis reaction is used to acidify cellular compartments, by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP.|$|E
5|$|Two {{special classes}} of protein {{deal with the}} ionic {{gradients}} found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient</b> to an area of higher chemical potential. The energy source can be ATP, {{as is the case}} for the Na+-K+ ATPase. Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.|$|E

5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient</b> set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the inert gas component of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient</b> will be greater for a given depth. This is achieved by increasing the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas used, whereas substitution of a different inert gas will not produce the desired effect. Any substitution may introduce counter-diffusion complications, owing to differing rates of diffusion of the inert gases, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression, and up to 2.8 bar for therapeutic decompression.|$|E

40|$|Chemotaxis allows {{bacteria}} to approach sources of attractant chemicals or to avoid sources of repellent chemicals. Bacteria constantly monitor {{the concentration of}} specific chemoeffectors by comparing the current concentration to the concentration detected a few seconds earlier. This comparison determines the net direction of movement. Although multiple, competing gradients often coexist in nature, conventional approaches for investigating bacterial chemotaxis are suboptimal for quantifying migration in response to <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> of attractants and repellents. Here, we describe {{the development of a}} microfluidic chemotaxis model for presenting precise and stable <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> of chemoeffectors to bacteria and quantitatively investigating their response to the applied gradient. The device is versatile in that <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> of any desired absolute <b>concentration</b> and <b>gradient</b> strength can be easily generated by diffusive mixing.

25|$|Specialized transmembrane {{proteins}} {{recognize the}} substance and {{allow it to}} move across the membrane when it otherwise would not, either because the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane is impermeable to the substance moved or because the substance is moved against the direction of its <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient.</b> There are two forms of active transport, primary active transport and secondary active transport. In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use the chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which are usually derived through exploitation of an electrochemical gradient. This involves pore-forming proteins that form channels across the cell membrane. The difference between passive transport and active transport is active transport requires energy and moves substances against their respective <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient,</b> whereas passive transport requires no energy and moves substances in the direction of their respective <b>concentration</b> <b>gradient.</b>|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse numerically-modelled, local <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> in street canyons. In a preliminary analysis of the physical processes within an urban built environment, a single idealised street canyon has been used. It has been shown that very steep <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> exist at the leeward lower corner of the street canyon. Consequently, small differences in monitoring station positioning may yield significant variations of measured mean concentration due to large local <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients.</b> The study has been extended to assess the behaviour of local <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> using a more complex urban geometry such as: a staggered cross-road, an idealised complex configuration of street canyons, and finally a real configuration of street canyons. The numerical modelling results obtained in this study are compared with both the field measurements obtained during a continuous air monitoring campaign of Glasgow City Council, Scotland, and physical modelling in the wind tunnel at the University of Hamburg, Germany. These results have significant implications for the positioning of monitoring equipment, not just in street canyons, but in wind tunnel experiments as well. Nevertheless, the obtained results are tentative and require a detailed, specifically designed, physical modelling investigation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{subsurface}} environments, <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> develop at interfaces between {{surface water}} and groundwaterbodies, such as hyporheic zones, saline wedges or recharge areas, {{as well as}} around contaminant plumes and fluidsinjected in subsurface operations. These areas generally represent hotspots of biogeochemical reactions, such asredox, dissolution and precipitation reactions, as <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> create opportunities for reactive agentsto mix and generate chemical disequilibrium. While macrodispersion theories predict smooth gradients, decayingin time due to dispersive dissipation, we show that <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> can be broadly distributed since theyare enhanced by velocity gradients induced by medium heterogeneity. We thus present a stochastic theory linkingthe Probability Density Function (PDF) of <b>concentration</b> <b>gradients</b> to flow heterogeneity (Le Borgne et al., 2017). Analytical predictions are validated from high resolution simulations of transport in heterogeneous Darcy fieldsranging from small to large permeability variances and low to high Peclet numbers.
