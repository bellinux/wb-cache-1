5|$|Tickets on the Signatur {{service cost}} NOK25 more than with {{conventional}} trains, which {{would continue to}} run. Tickets were also made available via Amadeus, a ticket reservation system in Norway previously only used for airlines. Prices became differentiated, with prices between Oslo and Kristiansand varying between NOK250 and 780, depending on time of travel and class. NSB stated that they hoped to compete with airlines between the two cities, as travel time from city <b>center</b> <b>to</b> <b>center</b> {{was about the same}} as by plane.|$|E
5|$|In July 2003, Linx {{reduced the}} number of daily {{services}} from Gothenburg to Copenhagen from ten to four. The company stated that this was because of insufficient ridership. Linx had offered tickets with a lower price than Scandinavian Airlines, who operated the airline service between Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. Ryanair also provided an airline service, but with fewer departures and with the same center-to-center transport time because it flew from the secondary Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. From 1 September 2003, Norwegian Air Shuttle started services from Gardermoen to Arlanda, and became a more direct competitor to Linx. From 27 October, Nordic Airlink (later FlyNordic) also started a flight between the same airports. With shorter travel time from <b>center</b> <b>to</b> <b>center</b> and comparable fares, Norwegian and Nordic started taking market shares away from Linx.|$|E

2500|$|The ten pins {{are usually}} {{automatically}} set by machine into four rows which form an equilateral triangle {{where there are}} four pins on a side (Pythagorean Tetractys). Neighboring pins are set up [...] apart, measured from <b>center</b> <b>to</b> <b>center.</b> There are four pins in the back row, then three, then two, and finally one in the front {{at the center of}} the lane.

2500|$|If {{the shooter}} wishes to improve {{accuracy}} and precision, wishes to increase range or wishes {{to do all}} of these things, the accuracy of [...] "estimates" [...] of external factors must improve accordingly. At extreme ranges, extremely accurate [...] "estimates" [...] are required and even with the most accurate estimates, hitting the target becomes subject to uncontrollable factors. For example, a rifle capable of firing a 1/2 MOA (approximately 1/2" [...] <b>center</b> <b>to</b> <b>center</b> of the two holes furthest apart) 5-round group (often referred to as [...] "grouping") at 100 yards will fire a theoretical 12.5 group at 2500 yards. Unless the group is centered perfectly on the target at 100 yards, the 2500- yard group will be centered 25 times the off-center error at 100 yards. This example ignores all other factors and assumes [...] "perfect" [...] no-wind shooting conditions and identical muzzle velocities and ballistic performance for each shot.|$|E
2500|$|The candlepins {{themselves}} are [...] tall, have a cylindrical shape which tapers equally towards each end (and therefore having no distinct [...] "top" [...] or [...] "bottom" [...] end, unlike a tenpin), giving them an overall appearance somewhat {{like that of}} a candle, and have a maximum weight of [...] apiece. [...] Candlepin bowling uses the same numbering system and shape for the formation within the ten candlepins are set, as the tenpin sport does. Also, as in tenpin bowling, due to the spacing of the pins ( [...] , <b>center</b> <b>to</b> <b>center),</b> it is impossible for the ball to strike every one. However, while in tenpin a well-placed ball (usually between the head pin and the 2 or 3 pin) may knock down all ten pins (a [...] "strike" [...] if on the first ball in a frame) from the chain reaction of pin hitting pin, in candlepins the smaller thickness of the pins makes throwing a strike extremely difficult. In order to count, the pin must be knocked over entirely; in unlucky circumstances, a pin may wobble furiously, or, even more frustratingly, be [...] "kicked" [...] to the side by several inches, yet come to rest upright, thus not being scored (and not be reset to its original position for any throws that remain, though it may of course still be knocked over by subsequent balls). It is even possible [...] in the candlepin sport. However, in the event that a fallen pin returns to a standing position, the pin is still counted as fallen and is played as live wood.|$|E
