5|$|Applewood Farm is a {{farmstead}} in Ledyard, Connecticut, United States. Constructed in 1826 by Russel Gallup, {{the farmhouse}} was built with a colonial center chimney design with Federal style details {{that has been}} modernized to the early 20th century without significantly changing the floor plan. Named after the apple orchards planted by Russel Gallup, Applewood Farm developed significantly under the ownership of Everett Gallup, the last {{member of the family}} to own the property. The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen and a 40-acre parcel was sold off in November 1984. After the Betz family became the owners it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and operated as a bed and breakfast through the 1990s. In 1987, the property included five contributory structures, the farmhouse, <b>corn</b> <b>crib,</b> barn, silo and chicken coop. The property also has one non-contributing structure, a machinery shed from the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of both grain feed and fodder for {{livestock}}. It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried kernels are used as feed. They are often kept on the cob for storage in a <b>corn</b> <b>crib,</b> or they may be shelled off for storage in a grain bin. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the corn stover) can be used later as fodder, bedding (litter), or soil amendment. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually chopped all at once and ensilaged, as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. Maize silage {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. Before the advent of widespread ensilaging, it was traditional to gather the corn into shocks after harvesting, where it dried further. With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today ensilaging can occur not only in siloes but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as green forage to the animals.|$|E

They are seen nowadays un-maintained, left to decay; announcing a dying facility that was replaced with the new storage buildings equipped with automatic temperature and humidity controls. Other than being technologically obsolete, these dilapidating <b>corn</b> <b>cribs</b> also announce the gradual disappearance of a way of life in the American Midwest.

2500|$|Like the Sugarlands to the west, Greenbrier was {{a largely}} {{isolated}} community {{until the early}} 20th century. [...] The valley's economy was based on subsistence farming, with most farms {{ranging in size from}} 50 to , part of which was woodland.

[...] Most farms included a barn, <b>corn</b> <b>crib,</b> smokehouse, springhouse, and a small orchard. [...] Some of the wealthier families owned their own grist mill. [...] As game was plentiful, many farmers supplemented their income by hunting and trapping.|$|E
2500|$|Like most of Southern Appalachia, {{the early}} 19th-century {{economy of the}} Smokies relied on {{subsistence}} agriculture. [...] The average farm consisted of roughly , part of which was cultivated and part of which was woodland. [...] Early settlers lived in [...] x [...] log cabins, although these were replaced by more elaborate log houses and eventually, as lumber became available, by modern frame houses. [...] Most farms included at least one barn, a springhouse (used for refrigeration), a smokehouse (used for curing meat), a chicken coop (protected chickens from predators), and a <b>corn</b> <b>crib</b> (kept corn dry and protected it from rodents). [...] Some of the more industrious farmers operated gristmills, general stores, and sorghum presses. [...] Religion was a central theme {{in the lives of}} the early residents of the Smokies, and community life was typically centered on churches. [...] Christian Protestantism—especially Primitive Baptists, Missionary Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians; dominated the religious culture of the region.|$|E
50|$|Victorian <b>Corn</b> <b>Cribs</b> are {{historic}} agricultural {{buildings at}} St. Michael's, Talbot County, Maryland.

50|$|Barns not {{involved}} in animal husbandry were most commonly the <b>crib</b> barn (<b>corn</b> <b>cribs</b> or other types of granaries), storage barns, or processing barns. Crib barns were typically built of unchinked logs, although they were sometimes covered with vertical wood siding. Storage barns often housed unprocessed crops or those awaiting consumption or transport to market. Processing barns were specialized structures that were necessary for helping to actually process the crop.|$|R

2500|$|The {{visitor center}} {{consists}} of [...] of exhibition and administrative spread over four buildings. Visitors enter through a south door, and proceed {{through a series}} of corridors and galleries to the north. The initial spaces are narrow and have low ceilings, reflecting the restrictions of slavery. Interior areas become more spacious and feature more natural light as the visitor moves to the north. The west wall of the northernmost building consists of 18 windows of varying shape, each with a different stained glass design depicting a different season of the year. The [...] exhibit halls contains a number of interactive exhibits focused on three themes: The Choptank River area, the local community, Tubman's family, and Tubman's Christian faith; the Underground Railroad; and how Tubman and her activities remain relevant today. Exhibits include a recreation of the <b>corn</b> <b>crib</b> in which Tubman and her brothers hid in 1854' a sculpture depicting the Raid at Combahee Ferry, which Tubman helped lead; and displays about the disguises Tubman used, her method of soundlessly walking through the forest to avoid capture, and her use of spirituals as a means of communication. There is also a small movie theater, which will screen a 10-minute film about Tubman.|$|E
2500|$|He {{expanded}} his family's holdings by selling off land, paying down debt, and starting new businesses. Over {{the next few}} years, Surratt acquired or built a carriage house, <b>corn</b> <b>crib,</b> general store, forge, granary, gristmill, stable, tobacco curing house, and wheelwright's shop. The family had enough money to send all three children to nearby Roman Catholic boarding schools. Isaac and John Jr. attended the school at St. Thomas Manor, and Anna enrolled at the Academy for Young Ladies (Mary's alma mater). The family's debts continued to mount, however, and John Sr.'s drinking worsened. John sold another [...] of land in 1856 to pay debts. By 1857, Surratt had sold all but [...] of the family's formerly extensive holdings (which represented about half the [...] he had originally owned). Most of the family's slaves were also sold to pay debts. Still, his alcoholism worsened. In 1858, Mary {{wrote a letter to}} her local priest, telling him that Surratt was drunk every single day. In 1860, St. Thomas Manor School closed, and Isaac found work in Baltimore, Maryland. The Surratts sold off another [...] of land, which enabled Anna to remain at the Academy for Young Ladies and for John Jr. to enroll at St. Charles College, Maryland (a Catholic seminary and boarding school in Ellicott's Mills). The couple also borrowed money that same year against their townhouse in Washington, DC, and at some point used the property as collateral for a $1,000 loan.|$|E

It is well shielded by trees from the surrounding development.|$|R
50|$|After Vanderbilt's {{death in}} 1920, the mansion went through several phases and visitors, {{including}} a brief stay during Prohibition by gangster Dutch Schultz. Around that time, cow stalls, pig pens and <b>corn</b> <b>cribs</b> {{on the farm}} portion of Idle Hour were converted into a short-lived bohemian artists' colony that included figures such as George Elmer Browne and Roman Bonet-Sintas. The estate was most recently the home of Dowling College, a struggling school which closed in August 2016.|$|R
