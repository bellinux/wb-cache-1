5|$|Highland cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Canada in the 1880s. Both the Honourable Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Robert Campbell of Strathclair, Manitoba, imported one bull each. There were also Highland <b>cattle</b> <b>in</b> Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 1880s. However, their numbers were small until the 1920s when large-scale breeding and importing began. In the 1950s cattle were imported from and exported to North America. The Canadian Highland Cattle Society was officially registered in 1964 and currently registers all purebred <b>cattle</b> <b>in</b> Canada. Towards {{the end of}} the 1990s, there was a large semen and embryo trade between the UK and Canada. However, that has stopped, largely due to the BSE (mad cow disease) outbreaks in the United Kingdom. Today, Highland cattle are mainly found in eastern Canada. The population of Highland cattle for Canada and the United States of America combined is estimated at 11,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, Jacques-Joseph Saint-Martin, an agronomist from Limoges, {{acknowledged}} {{the importance of}} Limousin <b>cattle</b> <b>in</b> the markets of cities such as Paris, Lyon and Toulouse. Limousin cattle actually came from the departments of Charente, Dordogne, Haute-Vienne, Vienne, Lot, Corrèze and Creuse. The market for Limousin cattle declined slightly in the early 19th century, but livestock still remained a major activity in the region.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} situation improved {{with the arrival}} of <b>cattle</b> <b>in</b> the colony. It is unknown when the first cattle arrived, but the division of land for the grazing of <b>cattle</b> <b>in</b> 1627 represented one of the first moves towards private land ownership in the colony. Cattle became an important source of wealth in the colony; the average cow could sell for £28 in 1638 (£ in 2010, or $ at PPP). However, the flood of immigrants during the Great Migration drove the price of cattle down. The same cows sold at £28 in 1638 were valued in 1640 at only £5 (£ in 2010, or $ at PPP). Besides cattle, there were also pigs, sheep, and goats raised in the colony.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} breed associations have been testing the F94L status of cattle registered in their herd books. The absence of F94L genes in some tested cattle {{might be a}} result of a sire or dam ancestor that had double muscling (MH) genes, or more likely that the myostatin gene was the normal or wild type variant found most commonly in beef <b>cattle.</b> <b>In</b> the latter case, loss of the F94L variant will arise when grading up to purebred when base animals are not Limousins.|$|E
5|$|According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, {{because the}} calves of water bulls and {{ordinary}} cows might bring disaster to the herd, {{they are supposed}} to be killed at birth; it is impossible to kill them by drowning, so other methods have to be used.

5|$|Most Limousin cattle have a {{coloration}} that {{varies from}} light wheat to darker golden-red. Other coloration, mainly black, {{has been developed}} through cross-breeding and grading up from other breeds of <b>cattle.</b> <b>In</b> addition to altering natural coloration, other traits, such as polled (a genetic lack of horns), have been introduced through cross breeding. Angus cattle have been the dominant source of black and polled genes now present in graded-up high content Limousins found throughout the world.|$|E

It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of <b>cattle</b> <b>in</b> the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and the answer is a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E
5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a misfolded protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America. First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild {{in a number of}} regions. Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation and listlessness, and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated <b>cattle.</b> <b>In</b> 2002, South Korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.|$|E

5|$|Due to its unusual nature, both heavy {{snowfall}} {{and strong}} winds caused {{a swath of}} devastation stretching from the Mid-Atlantic states to northern New England. In the Middle-Atlantic region, moderate damage occurred at sea but little was noted inland. In New England, strong gusts inflicted significant damage to numerous churches. Widespread residential damage, in contrast, was mostly negligible and had no lasting consequences. Thousands of trees were knocked over, obstructing roads and fiscally damaging the timber industry throughout the region. Cold temperatures, wet snow, and high winds downed numerous branches in fruit orchards, froze potato crops, flattened dozens of barns, and killed over a hundred <b>cattle.</b> <b>In</b> general, the agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock trades suffered most acutely following {{the passage of the}} snow hurricane, while structural damage was widespread but generally inconsequential.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles (Scarabidae) {{have been}} {{successfully}} used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies, such as Musca vetustissima and Haematobia exigua which are serious pests of <b>cattle</b> <b>in</b> Australia. The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe to reduce populations of Musca vetustissima, following successful trials of this technique in Hawaii. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.|$|E
5|$|Male progeny go to {{a station}} in Pépieux {{in the south}} of France, where they are fed a ration of corn silage before being {{slaughtered}} at the age of 16 months. In addition to evaluations of growth and conformation in the live animals, carcases, including fat composition, are evaluated. The best bulls identified in progeny testing are formally given the award Young Beef <b>Cattle</b> (<b>in</b> French Viande Jeunes Bovins, abbreviated to JB). Female progeny go to a test station in Moussour in Corrèze, where they are inseminated with the same bulls and calve at two years in confinement before being put out to pasture with their calves. The test station evaluates weight, growth, morphology, fertility, calving ability and milking ability in order to assess their maternal qualities. The best bulls following the tests on their daughters are identified as Maternal Qualities (in French Qualités Maternelles, abbreviated to QM).|$|E
