40|$|Background: Light {{exposure}} can cascade numerous {{effects on}} the human circadian process via the non-imaging forming system, whose spectral relevance is highest in the short-wavelength range. Here we investigated if commercially available compact fluorescent lamps with different <b>colour</b> <b>temperatures</b> can impact on alertness and cognitive performance. Methods: Sixteen healthy young men were studied in a balanced cross-over design with light exposure of 3 different light settings (compact fluorescent lamps with light of 40 lux at 6500 K and at 2500 K and incandescent lamps of 40 lux at 3000 K) during 2 h in the evening. Results: Exposure to light at 6500 K induced greater melatonin suppression, together with enhanced subjective alertness, well-being and visual comfort. With respect to cognitive performance, light at 6500 K led to significantly faster reaction times in tasks associated with sustained attention (Psychomotor Vigilance and GO/NOGO Task), but not in tasks associated with executive function (Paced Visual Serial Addition Task). This cognitive improvement was strongly related with attenuated salivary melatonin levels, particularly for the light condition at 6500 K. Conclusions: Our {{findings suggest that the}} sensitivity of the human alerting and cognitive response to polychromatic light at levels as low as 40 lux, is blue-shifted relative to the three-cone visual photopic system. Thus, the selection of commercially available compact fluorescent lights with different <b>colour</b> <b>temperatures</b> significantly impacts on circadia...|$|R

40|$|Context. We {{present the}} first {{results from the}} project Galactic cold cores, where the cold {{interstellar}} clouds detected by the Planck satellite are studied with Herschel photometric observations. The final Planck catalogue is expected to contain several thousand sources. The Herschel observations during the science demonstration phase provided the first glimpse {{into the nature of}} these sources. Aims. The main goal of the project is to derive the physical properties of the cold core population revealed by Planck. We examine three fields and confirm the Planck detections with Herschel data, which we also use to establish the evolutionary stage of the identified cores. Methods. We study the morphology and spectral energy distribution of the sources using the combined wavelength coverage of Planck and Herschel. The dust <b>colour</b> <b>temperatures</b> and emissivity indices are determined. The masses of the cores are determined with distance estimates which are taken from the literature and are confirmed by kinematic and extinction information. Results. The observations reveal extended regions of cold dust with dust <b>colour</b> <b>temperatures</b> down to T_(dust) 11 K. The fields represent different evolutionary stages ranging from a quiescent, cold filament inMusca to regions of active star formation in Cepheus. Conclusions. The Herschel observations confirm that the all-sky survey of Planck is capable of making a large number of new cold core detections. Our results suggest that many of the sources may already have left the pre-stellar phase or are at least closely associated with active star formation. High-resolution Herschel observations are needed to establish {{the true nature of the}} Planck detections...|$|R
