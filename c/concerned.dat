40|$|Many <b>concern</b> metrics {{have been}} defined to {{quantify}} properties of crosscutting <b>concerns,</b> such as scattering, tangling, and dedication. To quantify these properties, <b>concern</b> metrics directly {{rely on the}} projection (assignment) of <b>concerns</b> into source code. Although <b>concern</b> identification tools have emerged over the last years, they are still rarely used in practice to support <b>concern</b> projection and, therefore, it is a task often performed manually. This means {{that the results of}} <b>concern</b> metrics are likely to be influenced by how accurately programmers assign <b>concerns</b> to code elements. Even though <b>concern</b> assignment is an important and long-standing problem in software engineering, its impact on accurate measures of crosscutting <b>concerns</b> has never been studied and quantified. This paper presents a series of 5 controlled experiments to quantify and analyse the impact of <b>concern</b> projection on crosscutting <b>concern</b> measures. A set of 80 participants from 4 different institutions projected 10 <b>concern</b> instances into the source code of two software systems. We analyse the accuracy of <b>concern</b> projections independently made by developers, and their impact on a set of 12 <b>concern</b> metrics. Our results suggest that: (i) programmers are conservative when projecting crosscutting <b>concerns,</b> (ii) all <b>concern</b> metrics suffer with such conservative behaviour, and (iii) fine-grained tangling measures are more sensitive to different <b>concern</b> projections than coarse-grained scattering metrics...|$|R

30|$|Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) aims at {{improving}} the modularization {{of a system}} by providing language abstractions that are dedicated to modularize crosscutting <b>concerns</b> (CCs). CCs are <b>concerns</b> which cannot be accurately modularized by using conventional paradigms (Kiczales et al. 1997). Without proper language abstractions, crosscutting <b>concerns</b> become scattered and tangled with other <b>concerns</b> of the software, affecting maintainability and reusability. In AOP, there is usually a distinction between base <b>concerns</b> and crosscutting <b>concerns.</b> The base <b>concerns</b> (or Core-concerns) are those which the system was originally designed to deal with. The crosscutting <b>concerns</b> are the <b>concerns</b> which affect on other <b>concerns.</b> Examples of crosscutting <b>concerns</b> include global restrictions, data persistence, authentication, access control, concurrency and cryptography (Kiczales et al. 1997).|$|R

40|$|A {{software}} modification task often addresses several <b>concerns.</b> A <b>concern</b> {{is anything}} a stakeholder {{may want to}} consider as a conceptual unit, including features, nonfunctional requirements, and design idioms. In many cases, the source code implementing a <b>concern</b> is not encapsulated in a single programming language module, and is instead scattered and tangled throughout a system. Inadequate separation of <b>concerns</b> increases the difficulty of evolving software in a correct and costeffective manner. To make it easier to modify <b>concerns</b> that are not well modularized, we propose an approach in which the implementation of <b>concerns</b> is documented in artifacts, called <b>concern</b> graphs. <b>Concern</b> graphs are abstract models that describe which parts of the source code are relevant to different <b>concerns.</b> We present a formal model for <b>concern</b> graphs and the tool support we developed to enable software developers to create and use <b>concern</b> graphs during software evolution tasks. We report on five empirical studies, providing evidence that <b>concern</b> graphs support views and operations that facilitate the task of modifying the code implementing scattered <b>concerns,</b> are costeffectiv...|$|R

30|$|In {{the context}} of {{requirements}} engineering (RE), a <b>concern</b> {{can be understood as}} a set of software requirements related to the same purpose [1]. The two main categories of software <b>concerns</b> are functional and non-functional <b>concerns.</b> The first one regards to <b>concerns</b> that are related to the functional features of the software, such as “Payment,” “Order Management,” “Reservation,” among others. The last one corresponds to <b>concerns</b> related to the non-functional features of the software, such as “Security,” “Persistence,” “Performance,” “Logging,” among others. Several traditional RE approaches, such as those based on viewpoints, goals, use cases, and scenarios have been developed in order to allow the modularization of software <b>concerns</b> in a more appropriated way [2]. However, there are some <b>concerns</b> that may not be easily modularized, even in the early phases of software development cycle. These <b>concerns</b> are known as CrossCutting <b>Concerns</b> or Early-Aspects and consist of software <b>concerns</b> (functional or non-functional) whose requirements are spread over requirements of other software <b>concerns</b> [3]. For instance, a security <b>concern</b> may contain requirements related to the encryption and/or authorization mechanisms. These requirements, in turn, may affect (cut across) some requirements related to “Orders Management” <b>concern,</b> for instance.|$|R
