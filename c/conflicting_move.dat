50|$|A signal cannot {{display a}} 'proceed' aspect unless the {{infrastructure}} item(s) that it protects {{are in the}} correct position for {{the passage of a}} train or, in the case of flat junctions and gauntlet track, no other signal is cleared for a <b>conflicting</b> <b>move.</b> This is enforced by interlocking.|$|E
50|$|Much more traffic {{took the}} {{diverging}} route at Elderslie towards Cart Junction—all {{of the new}} line traffic, {{as well as the}} fast Greenock boat trains—and the opportunity was taken to provide a burrowing junction at Elderslie for this route: when the Ayr main line was built, it crossed the canal by a bridge. The canal was long defunct, and a new line was built passing under the bridge and running to Cart Junction, eliminating the <b>conflicting</b> <b>move.</b> This opened in 1906.|$|E
5000|$|Winchester Chesil {{station was}} chosen for an {{innovative}} system of signalling, developed in about 1923 by L M G Ferreira of Siemens Brothers and Co Ltd and R J Insell of the GWR. A route setting frame was installed, with miniature levers: the frame was small, measuring 2 ft 10 in by 2 ft 4 in (863 mm by 711 mm). It was a forerunner of the one control switch system; the levers set up routes; when the lever was moved to mid-stroke the interlocking proved that the route was free and no <b>conflicting</b> <b>move</b> had been set up; and the points moved to the required position, after which the lever could be moved to the reverse position and the signal cleared. There were 16 miniature levers and 15 routes could be selected; the sixteenth was a king lever. The points were operated by a 120-volt supply from the signal box. Track circuits were provided at the points: they were described as [...] "point protection tracks", that is, route locking track circuits, {{but there were no}} track circuits in the plain line. The night illumination was provided by oil lamps except for two signals located in the tunnel; ground signals were miniature semaphores of novel design.|$|E

50|$|Where {{one or more}} of {{the lines}} meeting at the {{junction}} are multi-track, the presence of a triangular junction does introduce a number of potential <b>conflicting</b> <b>moves.</b> For this reason, where traffic is heavy, the junction may incorporate flying junctions on some, or all, or the legs of the triangle.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the territorial changes from the war, this conflict sparked {{major changes in the}} Russian military. While the Russian army was still a [...] "semi-standing, mobilized seasonally", this <b>conflict</b> <b>moved</b> it along the path toward a standing army, laying the groundwork for Russian military successes under Peter the Great and Catherine the Great.|$|R

When the <b>conflict</b> <b>moved</b> to Earth, Kilowog battled his Sinestro Corps counterpart, Arkillo. Kilowog {{defeated}} the villain and removed his ring. After the war's climax, Kilowog was seen on Mogo, eating dinner with energy constructs of his family members.|$|R

50|$|In March 2016, a new £250 million flyover {{was opened}} {{just to the}} north of the station to allow the Stoke branch to be fully grade-separated from the main line to Crewe. Services to/from Manchester now use the slow lines from Stafford, a new {{junction}} near Little Bridgeford and the new flyover instead of having to make potentially <b>conflicting</b> <b>moves</b> across the flat junction as before.|$|R
50|$|The fort {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} {{again in the}} early 19th century when the main theater of <b>conflict</b> <b>moved</b> from the colonies to mainland Europe, and the economies of the islands were insufficient for its upkeep. It {{may also have been}} that, if the fort was designed to protect a source of freshwater, when the source dried up (there is no freshwater pond there today) the necessity for the fort disappeared.|$|R
30|$|Now the {{question}} {{that needs to be}} addressed is why is state A 7 not the finishing point of the 2008 analysis? The answer is that state A 7 (or B 11) are actually the equilibria, but state A 3 is a very considerable transition state. This nuclear conflict is very complicated since the DMs have changed their decisions on several occasions. That is why the <b>conflict</b> <b>moved</b> from state A 7 to A 3 in the 2008 conflict (Table 4).|$|R
5000|$|Train {{services}} were electrified in May 1962, using overhead lines carrying 25Kv A.C {{south of here}} and 6.25kV to the north (due to clearance issues - the system was upgraded to 25kV throughout in 1973). During the upgrade work, a grade separated junction was installed south of here to reduce <b>conflicting</b> <b>moves</b> between Circle line trains towards Cathcart and those heading for Kirkhill. The island platform layout here allows easy & convenient cross-platform interchange between the two branches to Neilston & Newton and Circle line trains.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Joint" [...] line is now {{generally}} {{referred to}} as Peterborough (Werrington Junction) to Doncaster via Lincoln although in truth this is historically inaccurate. There are two main issues that {{will need to be}} addressed in the future - firstly some form of grade separation will eventually be needed at Werrington Junction to remove <b>conflicting</b> <b>moves</b> with services on the busy East Coast Main Line and secondly the joint route now passes through the centre of Lincoln and will increase the usage of a key level crossing causing road congestion in the area.|$|R
50|$|With the {{cease-fire}} of December 1, 1911, the <b>conflict</b> <b>moved</b> {{from the military}} arena to the political one. This was a politically calculated decision of Yuan Shikai, who understood that if the revolution, which had him indispensable to the regime, were to be fully suppressed, he would again be destined to retirement. At the same time, at the Battle of Yangxia, he had demonstrated that his Beiyang Army was the most powerful in China. With his personal power at its height, he chose to maneuver politically to place himself {{at the top of}} the new political regime.|$|R
40|$|We model {{simultaneous}} inter {{and within}} identity-group conflict in two territories connected by cross-territorial spill-overs. Within each territory, two groups contest {{the division of}} a group-specific public good, and all members contest the division of group income. Each group has a cross-border affiliate. Greater success (share) of its affiliate 'spills over' into higher efficiency of a group in inter-group conflict. We find that inter-group and total <b>conflict</b> <b>move</b> together within a territory, while within-group <b>conflict</b> and output <b>move</b> in the opposite direction. A unilateral increase in cross-border spill-over reduces inter-group conflict in the source territory but increases it in the destination; an equi-proportionate bilateral increase affects conflict in a non-monotone manner. Population increase in a territory, a larger minority, weaker property rights, higher relative labour productivity of the majority, may all increase inter-group conflict in the other territory. Community-neutral growth in labour productivity within a territory reduces inter-group conflict therein...|$|R
50|$|Group {{living in}} all species is {{dependent}} on tolerance of other group members. In crab-eating macaques, successful social group living maintains postconflict resolution must occur. Usually, less dominant individuals lose to a higher-ranking individual when conflict arises. After the conflict has taken place, lower-ranking individuals tend to fear {{the winner of the}} conflict to a greater degree. In one study, this was seen by the ability to drink water together. Postconflict observations showed a staggered time between when the dominant individual begins to drink and the subordinate. Long-term studies reveal the gap in drinking time closes as the <b>conflict</b> <b>moves</b> further into the past.|$|R
50|$|The Primera Junta sent {{military}} {{campaigns to}} the viceroyalty, {{in order to}} secure support to the new authorities and retain the authority held as the capital of the viceroyalty. The victories and defeats of the military conflict delimited the areas of influence of the new United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. With the non-aggression pact arranged with Paraguay early on, most of the initial conflict took place in the north, in Upper Peru, and in the east, in the Banda Oriental. In {{the second half of the}} decade, with the capture of Montevideo and the stalemate in Upper Peru, the <b>conflict</b> <b>moved</b> to the west, to Chile.|$|R
5000|$|In 1873 {{a signal}} box was {{opened at the}} west end of the Bristol-bound {{platform}} to control trains through the station; until then signals had been worked independently but they were now all able to be interlocked to prevent <b>conflicting</b> <b>moves.</b> A footbridge was provided from 1880 to allow passengers to cross the tracks, but a road bridge was also available at the east end of the station. [...] June 1874 saw a third rail laid along each track to give a mixed gauge which allowed [...] standard gauge trains to operate through the station, although broad gauge services to Cornwall continued to operate until May 1892.|$|R
5000|$|In his hometown, protesters target Goldner as an abortionist {{and succeed}} in getting him {{dismissed}} as a sex education teacher from a local school. The <b>conflict</b> <b>moves</b> {{to the center of}} community politics when Goldner applies to be reinstated by the local school board. After a wide-ranging dispute, the board denies his request. The film concludes that doctors like Wayne Goldner often stop providing abortions because of the [...] "profound sense of isolation they endure." [...] The film aim is to show that, more than violence, it is a lack of social support for abortion providers that has left 86% of counties in the US without abortion service.|$|R
50|$|Permissive block working {{may also}} be used in an emergency, either when a driver is unable to contact a {{signalman}} after being held at a danger signal for a specific time, although this is only permitted when the signal does not protect any <b>conflicting</b> <b>moves,</b> and also when the signalman is unable to contact the next signal box {{to make sure the}} previous train has passed, for example if the telegraph wires are down. In these cases, trains must proceed at very low speed (typically 20 mph or less) so that they are able to stop short of any obstruction. In most cases this is not allowed during times of poor visibility (e.g., fog or falling snow).|$|R
50|$|Allen {{was born}} in Orwell, Ohio, {{the son of a}} baker. At the age of four he moved to Detroit, Michigan, where his father worked as an {{electrician}} until World War I. During the war, Allen's father re-enlisted in the United States Navy and, after the <b>conflict,</b> <b>moved</b> the family to Fort Worth, Texas to work at the automobile manufacturing plant for the Texas Star. When the company folded two years later they moved again, this time to Huntington Park, California, in the home state of his mother. He was the middle child of three siblings; his brother {{was born in}} Detroit and his sister in California. His father died early of alcoholism, leaving the mother to raise the family.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Network Rail {{announced}} tentative {{proposals to}} electrify the Rutherglen - Whifflet section, {{as part of}} a £1.4bn upgrade to Scotland's railways (these were confirmed in May 2013). The main benefits of this scheme is to provide an enhanced frequency for the Whifflet-Central routes, reduce <b>conflicting</b> <b>moves</b> on the WCML, and to provide an electric diversionary path for long distance WCML services. Electrification also would mean the Whifflet Line being added to the Argyle Line system with services through Glasgow Central Low Level to the western suburbs. This work was completed in time for the December 2014 timetable change and led to a timetable recast that saw Whifflet Line services replace those to/from Lanark in the service pattern through the core section via Central Low Level.|$|R
50|$|In October 2000, the Townsville Peace Agreement, {{was signed}} by the Malaita Eagle Force, {{elements}} of the IFM, and the Solomon Islands Government. This was closely followed by the Marau Peace agreement in February 2001, signed by the Marau Eagle Force, the Isatabu Freedom Movement, the Guadalcanal Provincial Government, and the Solomon Islands Government. However, a key Guale militant leader, Harold Keke, refused to sign the agreement, causing a split with the Guale groups. Subsequently, Guale signatories to the agreement led by Andrew Te'e joined with the Malaitan-dominated police to form the 'Joint Operations Force'. During {{the next two years}} the <b>conflict</b> <b>moved</b> to the Weathercoast of Guadalcanal as the Joint Operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture Keke and his group.|$|R
50|$|In {{fact the}} GWR {{considered}} the HH&BR line worthy of developing as an ally, and the GWR General Manager, John Grierson, visited Hereford in November 1863 and agreed a compromise. A junction could be formed {{that did not}} directly cross the GWR (former NA&HR) line, but ran to the back (west side) of Barton station without making <b>conflicting</b> <b>moves.</b> An agreement was finalised on 24 August 1864, although many details were to be agreed later; nevertheless the first HH&BR train ran into Barton station on 1 October 1864. The agreement stipulated that the facilities granted to the HH&BR might {{be transferred to the}} Brecon and Merthyr Railway if required. The HH&BR and the B&MR were discussing an amalgamation at the time.|$|R

50|$|The initial {{outbreak}} {{occurred in}} Yunnan Province in south-western China in the 1850s. The disease was stable within the province, but was spread {{due to the}} Panthay Rebellion. The rebellion displaced local tribes, and also changed animal harvesting practices, leading to greater contact with infected animals. In addition, the rebellion meant that refugees from the <b>conflict</b> <b>moved</b> south, into regions of China with larger populations. The plague went with them, producing {{an increasing number of}} casualties. In the city of Canton, beginning in March 1894, the disease killed 60,000 people in a few weeks. Daily water-traffic with the nearby city of Hong Kong rapidly spread the plague.

25|$|Through {{platforms}} will {{be increased}} {{from six to}} nine, all of which will accommodate 12 car trains, and allow the station to function as an emergency terminus for services from the West when needed. Historically, platforms 4, 5 & 6 served services bound for both Charing Cross station and the Thameslink core, creating <b>conflicting</b> <b>moves</b> and capacity problems during peak hours. In the new design, Charing Cross services have been assigned to four new dedicated platforms, and a final phase is now underway to complete construction of two dedicated platforms for Thameslink services which will resume calling at the station at significantly higher frequency in 2018.
