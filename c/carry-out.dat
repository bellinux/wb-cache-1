In addition, falafel in Berlin is usually served as take-away food, combined with vegetables and different sauces in a pita or döner bread.

All of the leads turn into dead ends. While investigating the Adena Watson scene, police find coagulated blood and hair on a piece of metal. Battel witnesses the find, but agrees to hold the information until police authorize it, as long as she gets the story first. She also tells Bayliss about a <b>carry-out</b> store owner who claims to know who the murderer is. The episode ends with an emotional Bayliss attending Watson's funeral.|$|E

The closest businesses (hair salons, <b>carry-out</b> {{fast food}} stores, auto repair and tire shops) were three blocks away, and no plans for retail development had been submitted despite the city's action six years earlier. Nonetheless, McGrath and the nonprofit Anacostia Economic Development Corp. both believed new restaurants, new service businesses, and housing redevelopment were coming quickly.|$|E

25|$|The flag of Saudi Arabia {{bears the}} shahada or Islamic {{declaration}} of faith. Because the shahada is considered holy, Saudi Arabia's flag code is extremely strict {{and even the}} slightest violation amounts to desecration {{not only of the}} flag but is also blasphemous to Islam. This has led to several incidents of controversy. In 1994, McDonald's printed <b>carry-out</b> bags bearing the flags of all nations participating in the FIFA World Cup (with a green flag with Saudi Arabia's coat of arms superimposed, rather than the Saudi flag), while Coca-Cola did the same on cans of soda. Because of Saudi outrage, the companies stopped producing those items. Also during the FIFA World Cup, in 2002, Saudi officials protested against printing the flag on a soccer ball on the belief that kicking the creed with the foot was totally unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Second World War, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 5,000 Estonian Jews. About 50% of Estonia's Jewish community, {{aware of the}} fate that otherwise awaited them following the Nazi invasion, managed to escape to the Soviet Union; virtually all those remaining were forced to wear badges identifying them as Jews, stripped of their property, and eventually killed by Einsatzgruppe A and local collaborators {{before the end of}} 1941. With the invasion of the Baltics, the Nazi government found willing volunteers to assist the Einsatzgruppen and auxiliary police from this region, which incidentally enabled them <b>carry-out</b> mass genocide in this region. Right-wing Estonian units, known as the Omakaitse were among those who aided the Einsatzgruppen in killing Jews. At the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, Estonia was reported to be Jew-free. Jews from countries outside the Baltics were shipped there to be exterminated—as was the case for 7,130 Jews sent to Estonia in September 1943, where just a few months later, they were murdered. During the winter of 1941–1942, Einsatzgruppe A operating in Ostland and the Army Group Rear, reported having killed 2,000 Jews in Estonia. An estimated 20,000 Jews were sent to labor camps in Estonia from elsewhere in Eastern Europe.|$|E
500|$|Until the 2008 Malaysian general election, Sabah {{along with}} the states of Kelantan and Terengganu, are the only three states in Malaysia that had ever been ruled by {{opposition}} parties {{not part of the}} ruling BN coalition. Under Joseph Pairin Kitingan, PBS formed government after winning the 1985 state election and ruled Sabah until 1994. In the 1994 state election, despite PBS winning the elections, subsequent cross-overs of PBS assembly members to the BN component party resulted in BN having majority of seats and hence took over the helm of the state government. A unique feature of Sabah politics was a policy initiated by then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in 1994 whereby the chief minister's post is rotated among the coalition parties every two years regardless of the party in power at the time, thus theoretically giving an equal amount of time for each major ethnic group to rule the state. However, in practice this system was problematic as it is too short for any leader to <b>carry-out</b> long term plan. This practice has since stopped with power now held by majority in the state assembly by the UMNO party, which also holds a majority in the national parliament. Direct political intervention by the federal, for example, introduction and later convenient [...] abolition of the chief minister's post and earlier PBS-BERJAYA conflict in 1985, along with co-opting rival factions in East Malaysia, is sometimes seen as a political tactic by the UMNO-led federal government to control and manage the autonomous power of the Borneo states. The federal government however tend to view that these actions are justifiable as the display of parochialism amongst East Malaysians is not in harmony with nation building. This complicated Federal-State relations hence become a source of major contention in Sabah politics.|$|E

2500|$|Schellenberg {{returned}} to Germany to attend university, {{first at the}} University of Marburg and then, in 1929, at the University of Bonn. He initially studied medicine, but soon switched to law. While in law school, Schellenberg performed some spy work for the SD. He reported actually having been recruited by two SD agents who were college faculty, who also advised him to join the Civil Service. After graduating he joined the SS in 1933. From what Schellenberg later wrote, the [...] "better type of people" [...] preferred the SS over the other Nazi organizations. While educated as a lawyer, Schellenberg distrusted administrative attorneys and was intent on ensuring the SD could operate outside the constraints of normal law. Subscribing to the Führer-Prinzip, Schellenberg also thought Hitler's directives were beyond {{the framework of the}} legal system and believed it was best to [...] "unquestioningly" [...] <b>carry-out</b> anything ordered by the Nazi leader.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{predominantly}} Catholic countries of Italy and Croatia the Catholic Church {{has been the}} main opponent to either the introduction of civil unions or marriage for same-sex-couples. In July 2013, 750,000 petition signatures were collected by the conservative pressure group [...] "In the Name of the Family", strongly supported by Catholic church leaders. This directly led to the 2013 referendum whereby the constitution was amended to state that marriage is only a union {{between a man and}} a woman (aimed at prohibiting same-sex marriage). In 2007, Angelo Bagnasco, the Archbishop of Genoa, was criticized by a minister in the Italian government for comparing the idea of recognizing same-sex unions directly with state recognition for incest and pedophilia. In February 2016 the Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, rejected the Catholic Church's interference in a parliamentary debate to introduce civil unions and adoption rights for same-sex partners. This followed Bagnasco's attempt to get the Italian Senate to <b>carry-out</b> a secret ballot in the hope it would make it easier for lawmakers to follow their conscience, rather than the party line.|$|E

50|$|The summands {{are reduced}} using a common 1-bit full adder that accepts two 1-bit terms and a {{carry-in}} bit. It produces a sum and a <b>carry-out.</b> The full adders are arranged {{such that the}} sum remains in the same column of summands, but the <b>carry-out</b> is shifted left. In each round of reduction, three bits in a single column are used as the two terms and carry-in for the full adder, producing a single sum bit for the column. This reduces the bits in the column {{by a factor of}} 3. However, the column to the right will shift over <b>carry-out</b> bits, increasing the bits in the column by a third of the number of rows of summands. At worst, the reduction will be 2/3 the number of rows per round of reduction.|$|E
