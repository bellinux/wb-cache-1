5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These <b>ceiling</b> <b>tiles</b> feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Many common {{building}} materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, <b>ceiling</b> <b>tiles,</b> shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber {{do not occur}} unless the {{building materials}} are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.|$|E

50|$|Masking {{speakers}} {{have been}} {{mounted on the}} tops of panels for a number of years. Most were associated with Herman Miller furniture systems. Early versions had a spherical ball with an upward facing speaker mounted in it. The ball was placed on top of a short rod which was connected {{to the top of a}} furniture panel. The sound radiated upward and reflected from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>tile.</b> Each masker had volume and spectrum controls that were accessible to persons on either side of the panel. Since most open offices had many panels, proper spacing of the masking was not a problem. The effectiveness of the masking was somewhat determined by the sound absorption characteristics of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>tile.</b> This masker was later replaced by the maker shown in the figure on the right; control of the level and spectrum was centralized.|$|R
25|$|Target {{released}} a 13-page report in 2007 that outlined their {{current and future}} plans for becoming more earth-friendly according to LEED. Such efforts include installing sand filtration systems for the stores' wastewater. Recycling programs will be aimed at garment hangers, corrugated cardboard, electronics, shopping carts, shrink wrap, construction wastes, carpeting and <b>ceiling</b> <b>tiles</b> and roofing materials. All stores in Oklahoma will be partnered with Oklahoma Gas & Electric to exclusively use wind power for all Target stores {{in order to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions. Stores nationwide use only LED and fluorescent lights and low-flow restrooms that reduce waste water by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or green roofs, which absorb storm water and cut down on surface runoff, mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds. There are currently four green-roof Target stores in Chicago.|$|E
25|$|As student {{enrollment}} continued to grow, another renovation project was planned {{to increase the}} capacity of the high school while updating the facilities to better meet students' needs. The two-year project began in 1995 and required the ninth grade students to remain in their respective middle schools another year. Students in grades 10-12 occupied half of the high school while the other half was being renovated. Staff and students then picked up and moved all books, furniture and equipment into the renovated half of the building in 1996, and construction began on the other half. The $30 million renovation project connected the former ninth grade building and the high school. New construction took place over the former parking tiers with a new cafeteria (seating capacity of 600), gymnasium (capacity of 2000), library/media center, and enclosed walkway. All classrooms were reconfigured with additional classrooms located in the former library and cafeteria. The familiar curving hallways remained, but new terrazzo floors, <b>ceiling</b> <b>tiles,</b> and freshly painted lockers were added. Along with updated lab facilities, technology was a huge part of the project, as over 500 computers were added throughout the building.|$|E
25|$|The Medical Treatment and Care Building {{included}} a basement level that was exposed (above grade) {{on the east}} and south sides, mixed (above and below grade) on the west side, and below grade {{on the north side}} of the building, due to the shallow slope at the site. The complete structure, including the four external stairways, could be considered five separate buildings, since the stair towers were detached from the main building by about four inches. Earthquake bracing used in the building's second through fifth floors consisted of shear walls, but a rarely used slip joint technique used with the concrete walls at the first floor level excluded them from being used with that system. Damage to the building (including <b>ceiling</b> <b>tiles,</b> telephone equipment, and elevator doors) was described as excessive at the basement and first floor levels, with little damage further up. The difference in rigidity at the second floor was proposed as a cause of the considerable damage to the lower levels. As a result of the first floor nearly collapsing, the building was leaning to the north by nearly two feet, and three of the four concrete stair towers fell away from the main building.|$|E

25|$|During the 1950s, {{while the}} airport was still named Uplands and a joint-use civilian/military field, {{it was the}} busiest airport in Canada by {{takeoffs}} and landings, reaching a peak of 307,079 aircraft movements in 1959, nearly double its current traffic. At the time, the airport had scheduled airline flights by Trans-Canada Air Lines (Toronto, Montreal, and Val-d'Or), Trans Air (Churchill), and Eastern Air Lines (New York via Syracuse and Washington via Montreal). With the arrival of civilian jet travel, the Canadian government built a new field south of the original one, with two much longer runways and a new terminal building designed to handle up to 900,000 passengers/year. The terminal building {{had been scheduled to}} open in 1959, but during the opening ceremonies, a United States Air Force F-104 Starfighter went supersonic during a low pass over the airport, and the resultant sonic boom shattered most of the glass in the airport (including the entire north wall) and damaged <b>ceiling</b> <b>tiles,</b> door and window frames, and even structural beams. As a result, the opening was delayed until April 1960. The original terminal building and Trans-Canada Airways/DOT hangar continued in private use on the airport's north field until the Fall 2011 when it was demolished.|$|E
25|$|Another ambitious {{restoration}} effort {{began in}} 2004, when Conservancy staff and contractors {{worked together to}} refurbish the 15,876 Minton tiles that hang on {{the ceiling of the}} Bethesda Arcade. Originally designed by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould, the ceiling of the Arcade is lined by 15,876 elaborately patterned encaustic tiles. Made by Minton and Company, a leading 19th-century ceramic manufacturer in England, the <b>ceiling</b> <b>tiles</b> are divided into 49 panels, each containing 324 tiles. Salt and water infiltration from the roadway above had badly damaged the tiles, leaving their backing plates so corroded they had to be removed in the 1980s. The tiles sat in storage for more than 20 years until the Conservancy received a generous private donation for their restoration. The Conservancy embarked on a $7 million restoration effort to return the Minton tiles to their original luster in 2004. A team of seven conservation technicians cleaned and repaired more than 14,000 original tiles by hand. Only three panels of replica tiles were needed to replace those that had been damaged beyond repair. For those recreations, the Conservancy decided to commission Maw and Company, Minton's successor in Stoke-on-Trent, England. The completed Bethesda Terrace Arcade was unveiled to much fanfare in March 2007. In 2006, the Conservancy completed a nine-month renovation of the Mall in a project that returned the landscape to its original character and ensured the protection of its great American Elms.|$|E

40|$|Sorption of {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) by building materials can have {{significant effect on the}} indoor VOC concentration levels and indoor air quality in buildings. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate experimentally the effects of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity and air velocity) on the sorption rate and capacity of three typical types of building materials (carpet, <b>ceiling</b> <b>tile</b> and painted drywall), and to evaluate existing sorption models with experimental data. A small-scale chamber test system has been developed in this study to conduct sorption tests under different environmental conditions. The sorption data collected were analyzed by three different analysis methods: the integration method, the linear Langmuir model method and the diffusion model method. The results of the integration method indicated that for the painted drywall, the differences among different environmental conditions were so small compared with the experimental uncertainties that no statistically significant environmental effect could be observed at 95 % confidence level. The sorption of VOCs on <b>ceiling</b> <b>tile</b> decreased with the increase of the air velocity and temperature, but did not change significantly with the relative humidity. The sink strength of benzaldehyde under high humidity was much stronger than any other conditions. The sorption of VOCs on carpet appeared to be a diffusion-controlled process. With the increase of temperature, the diffusion coefficient increased while the partition coefficient decreased. A higher air velocity increased the sink capacity of dodecane on carpet. The relative humidity had no significant effect on the sorption of VOCs on carpet. Based on the model evaluation conducted in this study, the linear Langmuir model appeared to be suitable for painted drywall and <b>ceiling</b> <b>tile</b> while the diffusion model is more suitable for carpet. by Jinsong Zhang.
