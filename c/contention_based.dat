40|$|Head-of-line (HOL) {{blocking}} {{limits the}} throughput of an input-buffered unicast switch to 0. 586. This {{becomes even more}} serious for multicast packet switches. In this paper, a packet scheduling algorithm for multicast switches, called Contention-Based Ordering (CBO) algorithm, is proposed. Unlike conventional scheduling algorithms, CBO aims at maximizing the throughput measured at switch output ports, minimizing mean output packet delay, and maintaining a fair access for packets with different fan-outs. To achieve these, a packet compatibility matrix is used to provide the information on packet output <b>contentions.</b> <b>Based</b> on it, the CBO algorithm schedules the packets with the highest contention with others first. The performance of CBO is compared with the previously proposed cyclic-priority reservation (CPR) scheme through simulations. We found that CBO outperforms the CPR algorithm in both throughput, mean packet delay and scheduling fairness. For a 15 × 15 switch with input load p = 0. 2 and fan-out probability q = 0. 3, a 52 % decrease in mean output packet delay and a 6 % increase in throughput are obtained as compared to CPR. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
