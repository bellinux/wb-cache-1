25|$|HMS Guardian was a 44-gun Roebuck-class fifth-rate two-decker of the Royal Navy, later {{converted}} to carry stores. She was completed {{too late to}} take part in the American War of Independence, and instead spent several years laid up in ordinary, before finally entering service as a store and convict transport to Australia, under Lieutenant Edward Riou. Riou sailed the Guardian, loaded with provisions, animals, convicts and their overseers, to the Cape of Good Hope where he took on more supplies. Nearly two weeks after his departure on the second leg of the journey, an iceberg was sighted and Riou sent boats to collect ice to replenish his water supplies. Before he could complete the re-provisioning, a sudden change in the weather obscured the iceberg, and the Guardian collided with it while trying to pull away. She was badly damaged and in immediate danger of sinking. The crew made frantic repair attempts but to no apparent avail. Riou eventually allowed most of the crew to take to the Guardians boats, but refused to leave his ship. Eventually through <b>continuous</b> <b>work</b> he and the remaining crew were able to navigate the ship, by now reduced to little more than a raft, back to the Cape, a nine-week voyage described as 'almost unparalleled'. Riou ran the Guardian aground to prevent her sinking, but shortly afterwards a hurricane struck the coast, wrecking her. The remains were sold the next year, in 1790.|$|E

For boss themes, he included hard rock elements to properly convey the battle between a strong enemy and the party. Meguro changed the way the music flowed {{when compared to the}} last two Persona games: instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the general score, he described the entire score as a single <b>continuous</b> <b>work.</b> A recurring musical element he included across the soundtrack was described as a [...] "do-la" [...] syllable: the opening used [...] "so la re mi" [...] on strings as a hook, which then led into the [...] "do-la" [...] syllable for other tracks such as the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received help from Hashino when he made positive comments on early tracks created for an internal demo. Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack without any restrictions, with about 80% of the tracks used in the game being his. His work on the soundtrack lasted for around three years.|$|E
2500|$|Noctis is voiced in Japanese by Tatsuhisa Suzuki as an adult, and by Miyuki Satō as a child. Suzuki {{was cast}} in 2009, seven {{years prior to the}} game's final release and when the project was still titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII. When he was first voicing the character, Suzuki said Noctis was far more introverted, {{speaking}} with a gruff manner and showing little sympathy for those beyond his immediate circle. When the change was made to Final Fantasy XV, Noctis became more outgoing and emotional, working with the production team to create a new persona for the character. For the final game, Suzuki recorded his lines together {{with the rest of the}} central cast. To aid his performance, Suzuki modeled it on the stage mannerisms of Kurt Cobain, lead singer of the rock band Nirvana. While he did not do <b>continuous</b> <b>work</b> on the game due to the game development's [...] "twists and turns", he found himself constantly keeping the character in mind so he could easily portray him when it was time to record voicework for the game.

When voicing the character for Brotherhood, Suzuki—who had established a good rapport with the main cast—talked with them about how to alter their portrayals for the altered storytelling medium.|$|E
