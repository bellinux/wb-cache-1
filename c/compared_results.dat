2500|$|In 1980, Zajonc {{proposed}} the affective primacy hypothesis, which hypothesizes that affective reactions (i.e. liking) can be [...] "elicited with minimal stimulus input". Through mere-exposure experiments, Zajonc sought to {{provide evidence for}} the affective-primacy hypothesis, namely, that affective judgments are made without prior cognitive processes. Zajonc tested this hypothesis by presenting repeated stimuli to participants at suboptimal thresholds such {{that they did not}} show conscious awareness or recognition of the repeated stimuli (when asked whether they had seen the image, responses at chance level), but continued to show affective bias towards the repeatedly exposed stimuli. Zajonc <b>compared</b> <b>results</b> from primes exposed longer which allowed for conscious awareness to stimuli shown briefly such that participants did not show conscious awareness. He found that the primes shown more briefly and not recognized prompted faster responses for liking as compared to primes shown at conscious levels.|$|E

50|$|Since laser {{diffraction}} analysis {{is not the}} sole way of measuring particles it {{has been compared to}} the sieve-pipette method, which is a traditional technique for grain size analysis.

Results can easily be manipulated because the data is on a digital surface. Both the sieve-pipette method and laser diffraction analysis are able to analyze minuscule objects, but laser diffraction analysis resulted in having better precision than its counterpart method of particle measurement.|$|E

40|$|Data from {{multiple}} genome-wide association studies are often analyzed {{together for the}} purposes of combining information from several studies of the same disease or <b>comparing</b> <b>results</b> across different disorders. We provide a valid and efficient approach to such meta-analysis, allowing for overlapping study subjects. The available data may contain individual participant records or only meta-analytic summary results. Simulation studies demonstrate that failure to account for overlapping subjects can greatly inflate type I error when combining results {{from multiple}} studies of the same disease and can drastically reduce power when <b>comparing</b> <b>results</b> across different disorders. In addition, the proposed approach can be substantially more powerful than the simple approach of splitting the overlapping subjects among studies, especially for <b>comparing</b> <b>results</b> across different disorders.

50|$|One early {{example of}} a finding was {{reported}} by Visser, Krosnick, Marquette and Curtin (1996) who showed that surveys with lower response rates (near 20%) yielded more accurate measurements than did surveys with higher response rates (near 60 or 70%). In another study, Keeter et al. (2006) <b>compared</b> <b>results</b> of a 5-day survey employing the Pew Research Center’s usual methodology (with a 25% response rate) with results from a more rigorous survey conducted over a much longer field period and achieving a higher response rate of 50%. In 77 out of 84 comparisons, the two surveys yielded results that were statistically indistinguishable. Among the items that manifested significant differences across the two surveys, the differences in proportions of people giving a particular answer ranged from 4 percentage points to 8 percentage points.|$|E

5000|$|BINAC, the Binary Automatic Computer, was {{an early}} {{electronic}} computer designed for Northrop Aircraft Company by the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in 1949. Eckert and Mauchly, though they had started the design of EDVAC at the University of Pennsylvania, chose to leave and start Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC), the first computer company. BINAC was their first product, the first stored-program computer in the United States; the BINAC is also sometimes wrongly {{claimed to be the}} world's first commercial digital computer [...] even though it was very limited in scope, never fully functional and always economically unviable. ==Architecture== The BINAC was an advanced bit-serial binary computer with two independent CPUs, each with its own 512-word acoustic mercury delay line memory. The CPUs continuously <b>compared</b> <b>results</b> to check for errors caused by hardware failures. It used approximately 700 vacuum tubes. The 512-word acoustic mercury delay line memories were divided into 16 channels each holding 32 words of 31 bits, with an additional 11-bit space between words to allow for circuit delays in switching. The clock rate was 4.25 MHz (1 MHz according to one source) which yielded a word time of about 10 microseconds. The addition time was 800 microseconds and the multiplication time was 1200 microseconds. New programs or data had to be entered manually in octal using an eight-key keypad. BINAC was significant for being able to perform high-speed arithmetic on binary numbers, with no provisions to store characters or decimal digits.|$|E
