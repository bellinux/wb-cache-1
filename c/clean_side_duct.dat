40|$|Master Thesis {{work was}} done at Volvo Cars, Powertrain Installation department, Air Induction System group. Scope of the thesis was to {{investigate}} <b>clean</b> <b>side</b> <b>duct</b> and optimize it for compressor performance. After literature review work was narrowed down and focused on swirling airflow and its influence on turbocharger compressor performance from efficiency and NVH point of view. Throughout thesis work CFD simulations were used to design swirl generators and investigate swirl behaviour in the ducts. Then, flow bench experimental tests were done to validate CFD simulations and define best settings for swirl modelling. Finally, experimental tests were done in turbocharger test rig to investigate swirl influence on compressor performance. Thesis outcome was a set of guidelines for Air Induction System group, that covers swirl creation methods and swirl effect on compressor performance. Results showed that swirling motion can move compressor map improving surge or choke limit. In addition, small amounts of positive swirl can also improve compressor efficiency up to 0. 8 %...|$|E
40|$|Air {{intake system}} (AIS) plays an {{important}} role on affecting the performance of the engine and the vehicle. The design and optimization of the structures and materials of AIS contributes to producing a quality reliable system, reducing noise, cost and weight at the same time, which are significant to improve the performance of engine and vehicle. Fresh air hoses/pipes are intended to transport, in air cleaner purified, air from the air cleaner to the throttle fitted on the inlet manifold or to the compressor fitted to the exhaust manifold. Air cleaner box is responsible for filtering out the dust and impurities in the air. The charge air pipes are intended to transport purified compressed air from the compressor to the charge air cooler and then to the throttle fitted on the inlet pipe. For the air cleaner box optimization, through the benchmarking and the innovation ideas from the daily life, two alternative optimized designs were introduced to reduce the cost and weight. The first is four clips connectors and the other is spring clamps. For the hose clamps, another innovation design was introduced to replace the previous hose clamps, which is called friction connector on the inner side of the bellow hose, the outer side of the air cleaner box lid and the <b>clean</b> <b>side</b> <b>duct.</b> For the material of the charge air ducts, TPEE was selected to replace the previous EACM rubber hoses. Further tests and prototypes should be conducted and produced to verify the effect of the optimization...|$|E

30|$|The {{incidence}} of bile leaks following liver resection varies from 2  % to 30  % [18] and {{depends on the}} type, extent and reason for liver resection, with higher risk for intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas [19]. The risk of internal leak is higher after central hepatectomy involving segments IV, V and VIII, possibly due to drainage from aberrant right <b>sided</b> <b>ducts</b> draining into left duct.|$|R

50|$|The Aston Martin has a {{very high}} belt-line, broad shapes and few surface breaks. The {{front of the car}} is {{designed}} to develop minimal downforce and to force as much air into the ducts. The air then moves through the car instead of over the top. There are numerous ducts inside the high bodywork, one for brake cooling, two through the side vents and one for rear gearbox cooling. One air scoop is in place to feed the turbocharger. Two <b>side</b> <b>ducts</b> on the rear of the car are for rear-brake cooling. The exhaust exits {{at the bottom of the}} vertical fin.|$|R
50|$|The ejector venturi {{is unique}} among {{available}} scrubbing systems since it {{can move the}} process gas {{without the aid of}} a fan or blower. The liquid spray coming from the nozzle creates a partial vacuum in the <b>side</b> <b>duct</b> of the scrubber. The partial vacuum is due to the Bernoulli effect, and is similar to water aspirators used in chemistry labs. This partial vacuum can be used to move the process gas through the venturi as well as through the facility's process system. In the case of explosive or extremely corrosive atmospheres, the elimination of a fan in the system can avoid many potential problems.|$|R

50|$|Designed by Yoshi Suzuka and Trevor Harris, the P35 bore little {{resemblance}} to NPTI's GTP cars given the very different regulations as well as differing airflow requirements {{that needed to be}} taken into account. The water radiator was placed in the nose with inlets for brake cooling situated there as well, the engine inlet was placed above the cockpit. The <b>side</b> <b>ducts</b> located in the horizontal face of the side pods took air to the oil coolers (and also had a unique boundary layer suction feature). A low rear wing was also used, although a dual rear wing was briefly tested. The chassis of the P35 was intended to be built from carbon fibre, yet the initial test chassis were built from a hybrid of aluminium and carbon to save time, due to NPTI's lack of experience with building carbon chassis.|$|R

5000|$|The major {{risks to}} the success of all forms of ceramic {{filtration}} are hairline cracks and cross-contamination. If the unit is dropped or otherwise abused, the brittle nature of ceramic materials can allow fine, hard to see cracks, and can allow larger contaminants through the filter. Work is being done to modify clay/sawdust ratios during manufacture to improve the brittle nature and fracture toughness of these clay ceramic water filter materials. Also, if the [...] "clean" [...] water side of the ceramic membrane is brought into contact with dirty water, hands, cleaning cloths, etc., then the filtration will be ineffective. If such contact occurs, the <b>clean</b> <b>side</b> of the filter should be thoroughly sterilized before reuse.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Fender {{introduced}} the Super-Sonic model, which draws heavily on {{elements of the}} Prosonic.

40|$|The {{morbidity}} after pancreaticoduodenectomy is very high. Different complications {{determined by}} pancreatic stump can appear: pancreatic leak (23. 4 %), acute pancreatitis (2. 9 %), hemorrhage etc. The postoperative complications rate depends by some factors: anastomosis technique (end to end, end to <b>side,</b> <b>duct</b> to mucosis), type of pancreatico-digestive anastomosis (pancreatico-jejunal or pancreatico-gastric anastomosis), the drainage of the pancreatic duct, octreotide therapy. Material and methods: 51 pancreaticoduodenectomies were performed from 1994 to 2004. In all cases we also performed a duct to mucosis pancreatico-jejunostomy. In 45 cases {{we made a}} personal type of drainage of the pancreatic duct. Octreotide was given to 32 patients. Overall postoperative morbidity was 33 % with only one pancreatic fistula (2 %). Mean hospital stay was 20 days and postoperative mortality was 4 %. Conclusions: The drainage of the pancreatic duct and an octreotide therapy are necessary when we appreciate a high risk pancreatic stump (soft pancreas, pancreatic duct smaller then 3 mm) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{wind wheel}} turbine (WWT) is studied. Evaluation of the {{probable}} performance, possible practical applications, and economic viability {{as compared to}} other conventional wind energy systems is discussed. The WWT apparatus is essentially a bladed wheel which is directly exposed to the wind on the upper half and exposed to wind through multiple ducting on the lower half. The multiple ducts consist of a forward duct (front concentrator) and two <b>side</b> <b>ducts</b> (<b>side</b> concentrators). The forced rotation of the wheel is then converted to power through appropriate subsystems. Test results on two simple models, a paper model and a stainless steel model, are reported. Measured values of power coefficients over wind speeds ranging from 4 to 16 m/s are given. An analytical model of a four bladed wheel is also developed. Overall design features of the wind turbine are evaluated and discussed. Turbine sizing is specified for a 5 and 25 kW machine. Suggested improvements to the original design to increase performance and performance predictions for an improved WWT design are given...|$|R
25|$|The race began {{shortly after}} 8pm local time with Lewis Hamilton making a clean start from pole position. Nico Rosberg took {{advantage}} {{of being on the}} <b>clean</b> <b>side</b> of the track to overtake Sebastian Vettel into the first corner. Fernando Alonso attempted to also pass Vettel but was unsuccessful, giving Mark Webber the opportunity to overtake Alonso on the outside of Turn 7. Both Alonso and Webber went off track as Webber completed the move. Stewards deemed Webber's move illegal and on lap seven he was told to hand the position back to Alonso, which also meant letting Timo Glock through as the German had also passed Alonso on the first lap. Alonso's Renault teammate Romain Grosjean was not having any more luck, having to retire at the end of lap three with a recurring brake problem.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{solution}} {{is to use the}} Hall effect to create a current that flows with the fluid. The normal scheme is to place arrays of short, vertical electrodes on the <b>sides</b> of the <b>duct.</b> The first and last electrodes in the duct power the load. Each other electrode is shorted to an electrode on the opposite <b>side</b> of the <b>duct.</b> These shorts of the Faraday current induce a powerful magnetic field within the fluid, but in a chord of a circle at right angles to the Faraday current. This secondary, induced field makes current flow in a rainbow shape between the first and last electrodes.|$|R
25|$|At the {{penultimate}} {{round of}} the championship in Japan at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost. Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the <b>clean</b> <b>side</b> of the racetrack. After qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton, the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit {{on the right to}} better position oneself at the first corner would have not been appropriate, further infuriating Senna. At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner. While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot on the accelerator and the cars collided at 270km/h (170mph) and spun out of the race, making Senna world champion.|$|R
50|$|Air {{injection}} {{can also}} be achieved {{by taking advantage of}} the negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system at engine idle. A sensitive reed valve assembly called the aspirator valve is placed in the air injection pumping, which draws its air directly from the <b>clean</b> <b>side</b> of the air filter. During engine idle, brief but periodic negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system draw air through the aspirator valve and into the exhaust stream at the catalytic converter. This system, marketed as Pulse Air, was used by American Motors, Chrysler, and other manufacturers beginning in the 1970s. The aspirator provided advantages in cost, weight, packaging, and simplicity compared to the pump, but the aspirator functions only at idle and so admits significantly less air within a significantly narrower range of engine speeds compared to a pump. This system is still used on modern motorcycle engines, e.g. the Yamaha AIS (Air Injection System).|$|R
50|$|The {{championship}} {{featured a}} dramatic battle between Senna and former team-mate Alain Prost, {{who had made}} the switch to Ferrari. Prost mounted Ferrari's first title challenge for several years, and led the championship after three consecutive mid-season wins. Senna fought back strongly and went into the penultimate round at the Suzuka circuit in Japan with a nine-point lead over Prost. There, Senna took pole position only for Prost to beat him off the line; the Brazilian driver then drove into the Frenchman at the first corner, putting both out and thus settling the championship in Senna's favour. This was the second year in succession that the two drivers had collided at Suzuka. Senna admitted the following year that the collision was deliberate, as he was furious that Prost had been able to start on the <b>clean</b> <b>side</b> of the grid and had decided {{that he was not going}} to allow the Frenchman to 'make the corner' should he lose the start.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the entire}} fleece {{has been removed}} from the sheep, the fleece is thrown, <b>clean</b> <b>side</b> down, on to a wool table by a shed hand (commonly known in New Zealand and Australian sheds as a roustabout or roustie). The wool table top {{consists}} of slats spaced approximately 12 cm apart. This enables short pieces of wool, the locks and other debris, to gather beneath the table separately from the fleece. The fleece is then skirted by one or more wool rollers to remove the sweat fribs and other less desirable parts of the fleece. The removed pieces largely consist of shorter, seeded, burry or dusty wool etc. which is still useful in the industry. As such they are placed in separate containers and sold along with fleece wool. Other items removed from the fleece on the table, such as faeces, skin fragments or twigs and leaves, are discarded a short distance from the wool table so as not to contaminate the wool and fleece.|$|R
