According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the unapproved antibiotic <b>ceftiofur</b> is routinely injected into eggs in Quebec and Ontario to discourage infection of hatchlings.

50|$|Limb {{perfusion}} {{is commonly}} used for antibiotic administration in cases of localized infection, such as lacerations, cellulitis, infection of a synovial structure (joint, tendon sheath, bursa), or osteomyelitis. RLP {{has been shown to}} produce antibiotic concentrations 25-50 times the minimum inhibitory concentration in septic joints. Antibiotic selection is important. Antibiotics must be approved for intravenous use, and are ideally chosen based on culture and susceptibility results. Concentration-dependent antibiotics, such as gentamicin and amikacin, are best suited for RLP because they have higher efficacy at higher concentrations, while time-dependent antibiotics such as penicillin and <b>ceftiofur</b> may be used, but have a shorter duration. However, expense is usually less of a limiting factor because a smaller amount may be used relative to systemic administration.|$|E

50|$|A. pleuropneumoniae {{was found}} to be the causative agent for up to 20% of all {{bacterial}} pneumonia cases in swine. The main disease associated with this bacterium is porcine pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious respiratory disease, affecting primarily young pigs (usually less than 6 months). All of the symptoms and signs of porcine pleuropneumonia can be attributed to its virulence factors. The symptoms include respiratory distress, bloodstained discharge (usually frothy) from the mouth, fever, anorexia, mild diarrhea, cyanosis, lethargy, and spontaneous abortion in sows. The most common sign for a pig farmer is the sudden death of several pigs over a short period of time. Peak mortality is usually reached when pigs are 10-16 weeks old. It is not uncommon for mortality rates to reach 20-80% in fattening pigs, with similarly high morbidity. Pigs that do survive the disease remain as carriers and spread the bacterium to other swine. Several bacterial combinations are seen in vivo, the most common simultaneous infection being Pasteurella multocida. Treatment must be immediate and continuous. Antibiotics used include <b>ceftiofur,</b> tetracycline, synthetic penicillins, tylosin, and sulfonamides.|$|E
50|$|Mastitis, a {{potentially}} fatal inflammatory {{infection of the}} mammary glands, is a common health problem in dairy cows in the United States and causes great economic losses for the dairy industry each year due to reduced milk production in cows with mastitis. While the influence of contagious gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus) - {{which used to be}} the primary cause for mastitis in dairy cows - has been significantly reduced in recent years, environmental pathogens such as coliform bacteria (e.g. E. coli) and noncontagious Streptococcus now play a larger role in the infection of dairy cows. This is cause for concern as environmental bacteria, noncontagious Streptococcus especially, are becoming increasingly resistant to antimicrobial intramammary therapy. McCowan et al. (2005) set out to determine if certain housing facilities, husbandry practices, and/or use of antimicrobial agents caused higher levels of resistant environmental bacteria. The researchers sampled the bulk tank milk of nearly 100 California dairies and conducted a face-to-face on-site questionnaire for approximately 50 of the dairies found to have at least 3 environmental bacteria isolates. McCowan et al. (2005) analyzed the results and found that not drying udders before attaching the milk units significantly increased chances of antimicrobial resistance, as did the use of some antimicrobial agents (<b>ceftiofur,</b> Sulfadimethoxine) for treatment of non-mastitis diseases. Surprisingly, no antimicrobial agents used to treat mastitis were found to cause increased resistance.|$|E

40|$|Third-generation {{cephalosporin}} {{resistance of}} Salmonella and commensal Escherichia coli isolates from cattle in the United States is predominantly conferred by the cephamycinase CMY- 2, which inactivates β-lactam antimicrobial drugs {{used to treat}} {{a wide variety of}} infections, including pediatric salmonellosis.

40|$|The {{existence}} of resistance mechanisms of bacteria against {{the action of}} antimicrobial drugs is a well documented fact and has complicated treatment of bacterial disease {{since the beginning of}} antimicrobial therapy in the last century. Drug resistance is a problem of veterinary and human medicine alike, especially when considering infections with food-borne pathogens such as Salmonella. Fecal E. coli isolates were used as a model to measure the effect of treating dairy cows systemically with <b>ceftiofur</b> on antimicrobial resistance of this important pathogen. <b>Ceftiofur,</b> a third-generation cephalosporin, is an attractive treatment for certain diseases in dairy cattle such as metritis and interdigital necrobacillosis since withholding times for meat are short and milk {{does not need to be}} withheld from marketing. Third-generation cephalosporins are also used in human medicine, for example in the treatment of systemic non-typhoidal salmonellosis in children. Therefore, the emergence and spread of resistance towards this class of antimicrobials has been a focus of concern. Effects of <b>ceftiofur</b> treatment on a group of cattle were compared to a penicillin treated group and a healthy control group not receiving treatment. Reduction of susceptibility of E. coli was tested for ampicillin, tetracycline and three different concentrations of <b>ceftiofur.</b> A significant decrease in the concentration of fecal E. coli on days 2 and 7 post-treatment was detected in animals treated with <b>ceftiofur.</b> Treatment did not have a significant effect on the proportion of isolates expressing reduced susceptibility to <b>ceftiofur.</b> The result of the reduction of total E. coli count in the samples during and after <b>ceftiofur</b> use is consistent with results reported by other authors. The large number of isolates analyzed provided a high possibility of detecting major effects of <b>ceftiofur</b> treatment on E. coli susceptibility. However we did not observe a net increase in reduced susceptible E. coli isolates with the exception of decreased tetracycline susceptibility in the <b>ceftiofur</b> treated group on day 2. The results of this work lead to the conclusion that the emergence and spread of resistance-encoding genes in a bacterial population under the influence of <b>ceftiofur</b> are rare and that the effect could not be measured even though we were able to draw information on a large number of isolates analyzed compared to other investigations previously published on this topic.

40|$|The U. S. Food and Drug Administration {{recently}} issued {{new rules}} for using <b>ceftiofur</b> in food animals {{in part because}} of an increasing prevalence of enteric bacteria that are resistant to 3 (rd) -generation cephalosporins. Parenteral <b>ceftiofur</b> treatment, however, has limited effects on enteric bacteria so we tested the hypothesis that excreted <b>ceftiofur</b> metabolites exert significant selection pressure for ceftiofur-resistant Escherichia coli in soil. Test matrices were prepared by mixing soil with bovine feces and adding urine containing <b>ceftiofur</b> metabolites (CFM) (0 ppm, ∼ 50 ppm and ∼ 100 ppm). Matrices were incubated at 23 °C or 4 °C for variable periods of time after which residual CFM was quantified using a bioassay. Bla(CMY- 2) plasmid-bearing <b>ceftiofur</b> resistant (cef(R)) E. coli and one-month old calves were used to study the selection effects of CFM and transmission of cef(R) bacteria from the environment back to animals. Our studies showed that urinary CFM (∼ 13 ppm final concentration) is biologically degraded in soil within 2. 7 days at 23 °C, but persists up to 23. 3 days at 4 °C. Even short-term persistence in soil provides a > 1 log(10) advantage to resistant E. coli populations, resulting in significantly prolonged persistence of these bacteria in the soil (∼two months). We further show that resistant strains readily colonize calves by contact with contaminated bedding and without antibiotic selection pressure. <b>Ceftiofur</b> metabolites in urine amplify resistant E. coli populations and, if applicable to field conditions, this effect is far more compelling than reported selection in vivo after parenteral administration of <b>ceftiofur.</b> Because <b>ceftiofur</b> degradation is temperature dependent, these compounds may accumulate during colder months and this could further enhance selection as seasonal temperatures increase.

(A) the analysis of <b>ceftiofur,</b> desfuroylceftiofur and/or desfuroylceftiofur cystein disulfide, (B) the derivatization of <b>ceftiofur</b> metabolites to desfuroylceftiofur acetamide and (C) the chemical hydrolysis using ammonia in order to produce a marker compound for <b>ceftiofur.</b> We found that approach A is not suited for quantitative analysis of total <b>ceftiofur</b> concentration nor for effectively detecting off-label use of <b>ceftiofur.</b> Approach B resulted in adequate quantitative results, but is considered to be a single compound method because it depends on the cleavage of a thioester group which is present in only a limited number of cephalosporin antibiotics. Approach C showed adequate quantitative results as well. In contrast to approach B, this approach is applicable to a range of cephalosporin antibiotics and therefore applicable as a broad quantitative screening of cephalosporin compounds in poultry tissue samples to indicate off-label use of cephalosporins in poultry breeding. Based on the research presented here, it is concluded that the multi-method following approach C is the most suited to detect off-label use of a range of cephalosporin antibiotics in the fight against emerging bacterial resistance...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{efficacy}} of nine different intervention strategies to minimize losses associated with experimental coinfection of nursery age pigs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Streptococcus suis. The antibimicrobials tested included penicillin, ampicillin, tiamulin, and <b>ceftiofur</b> hydrochloride. Vaccines tested included two commercial modified live PRRSV vaccines, an autogenous killed S. suis vaccine, and an experimental live autogenous S. suis vaccine. We found that the most effective treatment was intramuscular injection of 5 mg/kg <b>ceftiofur</b> hydrochloride on three consecutive days following S. suis inoculation. The live autogenous S. suis vaccine and treatment with <b>ceftiofur</b> hydrochloride every third day for three treatments also significantly reduced mortality...|$|E
40|$|The Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance {{describes}} {{a strong correlation}} (r = 0. 9, p< 0. 0001) between ceftiofur-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg isolated from retail chicken and incidence of ceftiofur-resistant Salmonella serovar Heidelberg infections in humans across Canada. In Quebec, changes of <b>ceftiofur</b> resistance in chicken Salmonella Heidelberg and Escherichia coli isolates appear related to changing levels of <b>ceftiofur</b> use in hatcheries during the study period, from highest to lowest levels before and after a voluntary withdrawal, to increasing levels after reintroduction of use (62 % to 7 % to 20 %, and 34 % to 6 % to 19 %, respectively). These events provide evidence that <b>ceftiofur</b> use in chickens results in extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in bacteria from chicken and humans. To ensure the continued effectiveness of extended-spectrum cephalosporins for treating serious infections in humans, multidisciplinary efforts are needed to scrutinize and, where appropriate, limit use of <b>ceftiofur</b> in chicken production in Canada...|$|E
40|$|The study {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effects of two treatment regimens on quantities of <b>ceftiofur</b> and tetracycline resistance genes in feedlot cattle. The two regimens were <b>ceftiofur</b> crystalline-free acid (CCFA) administered to either one or all steers within a pen and subsequent feeding/not feeding of therapeutic doses of chlortetracycline. A 26 -day randomized controlled field trial was conducted on 176 steers. Real-time PCR was used to quantify bla[subscript CMY- 2], bla[subscript CTX-M], tet(A), tet(B), and 16 S rRNA gene copies/gram of feces from community DNA. A significant increase in <b>ceftiofur</b> resistance and a decrease in tetracycline resistance elements were observed among the treatment groups in which all steers received CCFA treatment, expressed as gene copies/gram of feces. Subsequent chlortetracycline administration led to rapid expansion of both <b>ceftiofur</b> and tetracycline resistance gene copies/gram of feces. Our data suggest that chlortetracycline is contraindicated when attempting to avoid expansion of resistance to critically important third-generation cephalosporins...|$|E
40|$|Stability of <b>ceftiofur</b> {{sodium and}} {{cefquinome}} sulphate in intravenous solutions was studied. Chromatographic separation and quantitative determination were performed {{by using a}} high-performance liquid chromatography with UV-DAD detection. During the stability study, poly(vinylchloride) minibags were filled with a solution containing 5 [*]mg of <b>ceftiofur</b> sodium or cefquinome sulphate and diluted to 0. 2 [*]mg/mL with suitable intravenous solution depending on the test conditions. The solutions for the study were protected from light and stored at room temperature (22 °C), refrigerated (6 °C), frozen (− 20 °C) for 30 days, and then thawed at room temperature. A comparison of results obtained at 22 °C and 6 °C for the same intravenous solutions showed that temperature as well as components of solutions and their concentration had an influence on the stability of <b>ceftiofur</b> sodium and cefquinome sulphate. It was found that <b>ceftiofur</b> sodium and cefquinome sulphate dissolved in intravenous solutions {{used in this study}} may be stored at room temperature and at 6 °C for up to 48 [*]h...|$|E
