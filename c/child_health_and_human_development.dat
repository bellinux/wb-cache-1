40|$|In {{mammalian}} testes, such as rats, the mechanism(s) {{that regulate}} blood-testis barrier (BTB) restructuring at stages VIII-IX of the seminiferous epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis {{to facilitate the}} transit of preleptotene/leptotene spermatocytes is not known. This {{is due to the}} lack of information on the regulatory proteins at the BTB. Herein, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, is shown to structurally interact with occludin and ZO- 1 to form a functional protein complex at the BTB. Its expression at the BTB in the seminiferous epithelium is stage specific, being lowest at stage VIII-IX tubules, analogous to the expression pattern of occludin. Using primary Sertoli cells cultured in vitro with an established tight junction (TJ) permeability barrier that mimics the BTB in vivo, the knockdown of FAK by RNAi led to a transient disruption of the TJ barrier. This was accompanied by a loss of association between occludin and ZO- 1, likely the result of reduced occludin phosphorylation at Tyr and Ser residues, but not Thr, which in turn led to a redistribution of occludin at the Sertoli-Sertoli cell interface, moving from cell membrane into cell cytosol, thereby disrupting the BTB. These findings suggest that a similar mechanism is in place in the testis in vivo to regulate BTB restructuring to facilitate the transit of primary spermatocytes. Furthermore, FAK was shown to be a molecular target of cadmium because its knockdown would desensitize Sertoli cells to cadmium-induced TJ barrier disruption. in summary, FAK is a unique regulator of BTB dynamics in the testis.

40|$|BACKGROUNDThe {{onset of}} puberty is first {{detected}} as {{an increase in}} pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis results in central precocious puberty. the timing of pubertal development is driven in part by genetic factors, but only a few, rare molecular defects associated with central precocious puberty have been identified. METHODSWe performed whole-exome sequencing in 40 members of 15 families with central precocious puberty. Candidate variants were confirmed with Sanger sequencing. We also performed quantitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assays to determine levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) in the hypothalami of mice at different ages. RESULTSWe identified four novel heterozygous mutations in MKRN 3, the gene encoding makorin RING-finger protein 3, in 5 of the 15 families; both sexes were affected. the mutations included three frameshift mutations, predicted to encode truncated proteins, and one missense mutation, predicted to disrupt protein function. MKRN 3 is a paternally expressed, imprinted gene located in the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region (chromosome 15 q 11 -q 13). All affected persons inherited the mutations from their fathers, a finding that indicates perfect segregation with the mode of inheritance expected for an imprinted gene. Levels of Mkrn 3 mRNA were high in the arcuate nucleus of prepubertal mice, decreased immediately before puberty, and remained low after puberty. CONCLUSIONSDeficiency of MKRN 3 causes central precocious puberty in humans.
