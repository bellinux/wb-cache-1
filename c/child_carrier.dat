40|$|In 2007, the {{neonatal}} screening programme in the Netherlands was expanded with 14 disorders, {{one of which}} was sickle cell anemia. Un unintended side-effect of this was that not only affected children could be identified, but also carriers of sickle cell anemia. The latter is not directly in the child’s’ best interest, and therefore the parents will have {{to decide whether or not}} information on their <b>child’s</b> <b>carrier</b> status should be disclosed to them. If the parents would decide that they do not want any information on their <b>child’s</b> <b>carrier</b> status, they could ‘opt-out’. Otherwise, information on their <b>child’s</b> <b>carrier</b> status would be disclosed to them. The most important reason to disclose information about a <b>child’s</b> <b>carrier</b> status to the parents is to enable parents to base their future reproductive choices on this information. The aim of this study was to explore how (future) parents are being informed about this newly introduced possibility to learn more about their <b>child’s</b> <b>carrier</b> status for sickle cell disease, to learn how parents perceive their <b>child’s</b> <b>carrier</b> status being disclosed to them, and to see whether this information is taken into account with regard to the parents future reproductive choices. Parents of children who from March to September 2007 were diagnosed as carriers of sickle cell disease by the newborn-screening programme,,were invited by the Dutch heel prick organisation (‘Entadministratie’) to take part in a qualitative semi-structured interview carried out by the VU University medical center. 48 parent-couples were invited, 19 couples accepted the invitation; eventually 13 interviews could be held. Parents were unaware of the possibility they could ‘opt-out’ from being informed about their <b>child’s</b> <b>carrier</b> status. Initially, parents were shocked after hearing the diagnosis of their child being a sickle cell anaemia carrier, mainly because they did not know anything about it, and were not aware that their child would fall ill. Most parents looked for information on the Internet, after which they became less worried, even though most parents still did not understand the proper meaning of carriership. None of the parents linked their <b>child’s</b> <b>carrier</b> status to their own future reproductive choices. The way in which information on carrier status of sickle cell anaemia is being disclosed to parents needs to be improved. The most important reason for disclosing information about their <b>child’s</b> <b>carrier</b> status - to enable the parents to make future reproductive choices - is not yet being achieved.

To address this question, semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents of 32 children with cystic fibrosis, haemophilia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy who wanted to know the carrier status of their other children.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) {{constitutes}} a sub-epidemic in Brazil. Due {{to the increasing}} number of women infected by the virus, the vertical transmission increased substantially, and {{due to the lack of}} adequate prophylactic treatment, many children are infected and show manifestations of the disease in early ages. Multiple systems are affected by the HIV virus, and the skin is often the first organ to be involved. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to analyze the clinic, dermatological and epidemiological profiles of <b>children</b> <b>carriers</b> of the virus in the City of Manaus aiming at identifying the most frequent dermatoses that affect these children and try to relate these dermatoses to the immunologic deterioration. METHODS: A study was conducted where <b>children</b> <b>carriers</b> of the HIV virus from the Fundação Alfredo da Matta and Fundação de Medicina Tropical were studied from March 2007 to July 2008. These children were submitted to dermatological and laboratorial exams such as viral load dosage and CD 4 + and CD 8 + counts. RESULTS: During the study period, 70 HIV + children were examined; all of them had AIDS and had been contaminated by vertical transmission. The average number of dermatoses by children was 1. 73, and 95. 5 % had at least one dermatosis during the study period. The most frequent manifestations were atopic dermatitis (22. 9 %), childhood prurigo (20 %) and warts (18, 6 %).

40|$|Background: Carrier {{screening}} for recessive (autosomal and X-linked) genetic disorders is performed to identify healthy couples {{at risk of}} conceiving an affected <b>child.</b> <b>Carrier</b> screening allows carrier couples to make informed reproductive decisions and, if they choose so, to prevent the birth of an affected child. Expanded carrier screening (ECS) is a new paradigm in carrier screening, brought about by recent advances in targeted genotyping and next-generation sequencing technologies, and involves {{screening for}} {{a large number of}} disorders (usually more than 100) in a single test. Due to its ability to inexpensively include additional disorders on the screening panel, ECS has recently grown in popularity and could soon be implemented in the context of reproductive healthcare. However, large-scale adoption of ECS would have major implications for the practice of reproductive healthcare and is associated with important challenges. Methods: During the period of April to September 2014, we conducted semi-structured interviews with sixteen European clinical and molecular geneticists with expertise in carrier screening to explore their views on the implementation of ECS in the clinical setting. The interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: Our participants believed ECS would ideally be targeted at couples before pregnancy, although they were of the opinion that screening during pregnancy should also be accessible. They were worried about the limited awareness of carrier screening in the general public, as well as among non-geneticist healthcare providers, suggesting that the implementation of a population ECS should be preceded by efforts to improve knowledge about carrier screening. All of our participants agreed it was essential to ensure informed and voluntary participation in ECS, recommending measures to minimize external pressure on prospective parents to undergo screening. Furthermore, all participants emphasized the need to provide adequate genetic counselling and follow-up for couples identified to be at risk, in order to facilitate informed, autonomous reproductive decision-making and ensure necessary psychological support. Finally, we observed some disagreement regarding the acceptability of performing ECS in individuals rather than as part of a couple, with several participants actively opposing individual-based screening while others considering this a viable complementary strategy to couple-based screening. Discussion: Population-wide ECS offers substantial benefits, but its successful implementation is conditional on the provision of the availability of adequate pre-test information and post-test counselling. Public education efforts need to be focused on the advantages of preconceptional ECS in couples, as opposed to screening during pregnancy. Additionally, the findings of our study suggest that more research is indicated into the acceptability of individual-based carrier screening. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Familial hypercholesterolemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, {{and long}} QT Syndrome are genetic {{cardiovascular}} conditions which {{may lead to}} sudden cardiac death at a young age. Preventive measures include lifestyle modifications, medications, and/or cardiac devices. Hence, identification of <b>carrier</b> <b>children</b> can protect them for the potentially life threatening consequences at a young age. Yet, informing children about their genetic risk status and subjecting them to treatment may have negative consequences. This preliminary study aimed to explore (1) how the health-related {{quality of life of}} <b>carrier</b> <b>children</b> compares to {{the quality of life of}} Dutch children in general; and (2) to what extent the carrier children's quality of life and their parents' perception thereof concur. Our method involved <b>carrier</b> <b>children</b> (n = 35), aged between 8 and 18 years, and their parents (n = 37) who completed a self-report questionnaire. Children's health-related quality of life was assessed with a children and parent version of the KIDSCREEN. Dutch reference data were available from a representative national sample. Our results show no statistically significant differences in scores between <b>carrier</b> <b>children</b> and the reference group.

40|$|Can {{a parent}} {{adjust to the}} idea that its child is at risk for a sudden death? This {{question}} is raised by a diagnostic procedure in which children were tested for an inherited Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). This potentially life-threatening but treatable cardiac arrhythmia syndrome may cause sudden death, especially in children and young adults. The long-term psychological effects are described for parents whose children were tested for inherited LQTS. The adverse short-term impact of such testing has been described previously. The goal of this investigation is to determine whether this distress endures. Thirty-six parents completed measures of psychological distress. With the twenty-four parents of <b>carrier</b> <b>children,</b> a semi-structured interview was held 18 months after DNA disclosure. Parents of <b>carrier</b> <b>children</b> reported more distress than parents of non-carrier <b>children.</b> Parents of <b>carrier</b> <b>children</b> remained vulnerable to high levels of distress; up to one-third of these parents showed clinically relevant high levels of distress. High levels of distress were reported by parents of <b>carrier</b> <b>children</b> who (1) were highly distressed at previous assessments, (2) were familiar with the disease for a longer time, (3) had experienced a sudden death in the family, (4) were lesser educated, and who (5) were unsatisfied with the given information. Parents were particularly concerned about possible hazardous behavior during puberty. We conclude that the continuous threat of developing LQTS symptoms despite prophylactic treatment affected the psychological well-being of the parents for a long time. In light of the tempetuous developments in the areas of cardiac genetics, periodical information on new insight and developments may act as a buffer for the parents' (growing) concerns about their child's inherited disorder.
