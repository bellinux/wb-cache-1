The powders made by both processes are indistinguishable.A critical aspect of the production is the ability to produce particles of sizes in the tens of nanometer range, as well as with a limited distribution of particle sizes. In 2002, the production of nano-sized aluminium particles required considerable effort, and commercial sources for the material were limited.

50|$|The first {{representative}} of the TAP family was prepared by Kobayashi and co-workers, using high-temperature template <b>condensation</b> <b>method,</b> which resembles the classical procedures of phthalocyanine synthesis. Melting of anthracene-2,3-dicarboxyimide with sodium biphenylacetate {{in the presence of}} zinc acetate resulted in the formation of zinc complex of triarylsubstituted TAP. The synthesis of both meso-unsubstituted and meso-arylsubstituted TAPs was reported by Ono and coworkers using a common approach to extended porphyrins relying on thermal retro-Diels−Alder extrusion of ethylenefrom bicyclo2.2.2octadiene-annelated porphyrins. Thus obtained materials were reported to be poorly soluble and unstable toward photooxidation.An obvious drawback of reported syntheses of TAPs is a need for harsh conditions of condensation or aromatization steps, which are poorly compatible with the emerging huge and fragile TAP system. This results in low yields and poor quality of the obtained materials and limits opportunities of introducing functionality to improve solubility and stability or to modulate optical properties.|$|E

Among <b>condensation</b> <b>methods,</b> modal <b>condensation</b> and Krylov projection methods {{have the capability}} of generating excellent approximations of the response in a selected frequency band. Here are presented error bounds on the response in the band to complement these and other Galerkin Rayleigh–Ritz <b>condensation</b> <b>methods.</b> The bounds guarantee that {{the magnitude of the}} error is below the computed threshold. They are based on the expansion of exact expressions of the error using interior and exterior eigenpairs. The interior error is bounded by using existing error bounds on the interior eigenpairs. Sylvester’s theorem allows one to determine if all interior eigenvalues are approximated. The exterior error is bounded by using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and matrices that bound the restriction of the system matrix to the exterior eigenpairs. Two general algorithms are presented as a general framework to compute bounds on the eigenpairs and bounds on the error and the response.

40|$|The modern intertial {{navigation}} devices often utilize {{elastic suspension}} based sensitive elements. In general elastic suspension has a complicated structure, and its optimization requires numerous calculations for various parameters, such as stiffness characteristics. The major {{contribution to the}} solution of the above optimization problem is brought by highly effective nodal <b>condensation</b> <b>method.</b> This method however is often overcomplicated by difficulties in the analytical determinization of stiffness matrixes of the elastic elements. Furthermore, it is even impossible to perform exact calculations in some cases. On countrary to the nodal <b>condensation</b> <b>method,</b> the finite elements analysis tools provide inexact solutions to the optimization problems, and thus can be applied for elastic elements of even complicated structure. The disadvantages of the finite elements method is in large computational resourses required for the calculations, {{and in the absence of}} the preprocessing analytical structural analysis that might simplify the following calculations. Hence the research on the possible integration of the nodal <b>condensation</b> <b>method</b> into the finite-elements analysis tools is of the primary importance for the handling of the complicated designs. In this work, we investigate the results of the aformentioned integration for the stiffness characteristics analysis of the micromechanical tuning-fork gyroscopes. More precisely, stiffness characteristics and the computation of the loads on the individual elastic elements are proposed to compute using the equations of the nodal <b>condensation</b> <b>method.</b> After the individual characteristics are calculated, the finite-elements method is used to compute the optimal stiffness characteristics for the elastic element. Combination of the nodal <b>condensation</b> <b>method</b> and the finite elements method, was applied for the calculation of the stiffness characteristics of the micromechanical tuning-fork gyroscope. It showed better performance compare to their separate application, thus proving its effectiveness. Analysis of the results obtained in the conducted investigation provides a conclusion of the principal superiority of the proposed method. It allows to improve the precision of the obtained optimal solution, and to reduce the computational effort. In summary, proposed method gives an opportunity of utilizing strong sides of both nodal <b>condensation</b> <b>method</b> and finite elements method for the analysis of the application of different loads on the individual elements of the mechanical design. ? ??????????? ???????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ? ???????? ?????????. ? ????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ????? ??? ???????????????? ???????????, ? ????? ?? ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ?, ? ?????? ???????, ????????????? ?????????. ??????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ???????-??????????? ???????. ??? ???? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ? ????????????? ????, ?????????? ????? ??????? ? ???????? ??????. ??????????? ??????????? ???? ??????? ??????????? ?? ??????? ??????? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????????????? ?????????. ??? ????????? ????????? ????????????? ? ?????? ???????-??????????? ???????. ?????????? ??????? ? ??????????? ?????????. ????? ??????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ???????-??????????? ???????...|$|E
