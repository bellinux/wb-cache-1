5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for bombing, and there were several near-misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign. During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, this good fortune came to an end. As bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area, the rolling stock parked in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was badly damaged. Multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck the <b>central</b> <b>section</b> of the terminus building. While the LNC's office building and the station platforms survived, the <b>central</b> <b>section</b> of the station was reduced to rubble. On 11 May 1941 the station was officially declared closed.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME {{of the newly}} formed Southern Railway in 1923, and inherited the 1920 SECR order for ten Kclass locomotives. The order was still outstanding in 1924, {{although most of the}} component parts had been made. On 14 January 1925, Maunsell ordered No.790 to be overhauled and trialled on the <b>Central</b> <b>section.</b> As the locomotive proved suitable for the operating conditions of this section, the Southern Railway's Locomotive Committee proceeded with the assembly of the Kclass parts using outside contractors. Nine sets of parts (Nos. A791A799) were conveyed to Armstrong Whitworth for assembly and the finished locomotives delivered in May and June 1925. These were dual-fitted with vacuum and Westinghouse (air) brakes for use with the former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) rolling stock on the <b>Central</b> <b>section.</b> Other differences from the prototype included the relocation of the regulator to the dome and an increase in superheater area. The tenth set of parts was retained by Ashford and used for the first member of the K1class later that year.|$|E
5|$|No part of M-189 {{is listed}} on the National Highway System. In 2009, the Michigan Department of Transportation {{conducted}} a survey to determine the traffic volume along the highway, reported using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). The department determined that 892vehicles a day used the highway near the state line while 5,308vehicles used the <b>central</b> <b>section</b> through Caspian. The northernmost segment near US2 had an AADT of 4,079 vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The last {{work in the}} {{published}} set was written before numbers four and five. It was originally a harp piece, composed for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire in 1904. Cortot made a transcription for piano, published in 1913 as Fauré's Op 86 bis. The outer sections are light and brilliant, with a gentler <b>central</b> <b>section,</b> marked meno mosso.|$|E
5|$|The work {{consists}} of three sections, an introduction, a <b>central</b> <b>section</b> that details the trial itself, and a conclusion. The introduction and conclusion summarise St-Calais' career {{before and after the}} trial. Although the authenticity of the main account has been challenged in the past, most historians consider it a contemporary record of the trial. Six manuscripts containing the work survive, and it was first printed in 1655, with other editions, including translations, appearing after that.|$|E
5|$|A major 18-month {{redevelopment}} of {{the square}} led by W.S. Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides {{of the square}}, demolishing the <b>central</b> <b>section</b> of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace {{in front of the}} National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a café. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.|$|E

5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the <b>Central</b> <b>Section</b> of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the <b>central</b> <b>section,</b> which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, all of M-40 {{south of}} I-94 to Niles was reassigned the {{designation}} M-51 while M-40 was {{shifted to the}} east {{to take over the}} routing of the contemporary M-119 between Paw Paw and its intersection with US12 in Porter Township near Mottville. The routing of M-51 was extended down to the state line in April 1998 when US33 was decommissioned out of the state of Michigan; the extension formed a concurrency with Business US12 (Bus. US12) through Niles in the process. In early 2010, the <b>central</b> <b>section</b> of Bus. US12 was transferred to the City of Niles. In doing so, the Bus. US12 designation was decommissioned in the city, removing that designation from the M-51 concurrency.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the State Planning Commission {{proposed}} {{defining a}} reservation for {{the extension of}} the Kwinana Freeway to the southern edge of Perth Metropolitan Region, north-east of Mandurah. The northern and southern sections of the route were predetermined by factors including existing and proposed developments, power transmission lines, the location of wetlands and the Serpentine River, and required setbacks from an explosives depot at Baldivis. A number of routes were investigated for the <b>central</b> <b>section,</b> between Mortimer Road and Stakehill Road. The EPA found all proposed routes acceptable, and that the preferred route minimised environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{an unknown}} mudbrick mastaba was {{discovered}} in Quesna, an archaeological site located in the Monufia Governorate (in the Nile Delta). The mastaba was once 14m in length and 6m in width. Its substructure contains a 3m wide corridor chapel, divided into three architectural sections: the first (northern) section is filled with rubble, the second (<b>central)</b> <b>section</b> contains a double room as the burial chamber and the third (southern) section has a burial shaft in its center.

5|$|Much of {{the land}} {{near the mouth of}} Mahoning Creek is developed. A strip of land {{crossing}} the watershed in its <b>central</b> <b>section</b> is also developed. The southernmost part of the watershed is largely agricultural land. North of this is an area of mostly forested land and {{the central part of the}} watershed is mostly agricultural land. The northern part includes both forested and agricultural land. The fastest development in Montour County is occurring in the watershed of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} 14.5million years, the Anahim hotspot has created at least 40volcanoes. They can be {{organized}} into three groupings: the eastern section, which comprises several small cinder cones {{and is the}} location of all modern volcanic activity; the <b>central</b> <b>section,</b> which consists of predominantly shield volcanoes; and the western section, {{all of which have}} since been reduced to remnants of eruptive breccia and high-level plutons and dike swarms. These form one of the six Neogene-Quaternary volcanic provinces in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Suitable {{work for}} the class began to decline under British Railways {{ownership}} after the widening of bridges and tunnels on the Hastings line, which enabled Bulleid's powerful Q1class 0-6-0 to be used on freight trains between Hastings and Tonbridge. Following {{the completion of the}} Kent Coast electrification in 1959, the class was congregated at Tonbridge shed alongside members of the U1class to haul local services throughout the <b>Central</b> <b>section.</b> The reduction of work over the Brighton main line and the prevalence of the N class precipitated another move to Stewarts Lane shed in London. However, with remaining work being allocated to Bulleid's Light Pacifics, the class was withdrawn from service in November 1962.|$|E
