In this process, polypeptides that have a unique stretch of 3 amino acids (asparagine - X - serine/threonine, where X {{represents}} any amino acid except proline) are modified with a <b>complex</b> <b>sugar</b> moiety on the amide group of asparagine. Other types of glycosylations include S-linked (via cysteine residues), C-linked (via tryptophan) and O-linked (via serine or threonine).

Most GBE1 gene mutations result in a shortage (deficiency) of the glycogen branching enzyme, which leads to the production of abnormal glycogen molecules. These abnormal glycogen molecules, called polyglucosan bodies, accumulate within cells and cause damage. Neurons appear to be particularly vulnerable to the accumulation of polyglucosan bodies in people with this disorder, leading to impaired neuronal function.|$|E

50|$|Simple sugars {{are also}} {{produced}} {{as a consequence}} of the malting process that eventually produces beer. The <b>complex</b> <b>sugars</b> are not broken down by the yeast, and are eventually consumed by the beer drinker, possibly causing flatulence. Homebrewers have found adding Beano to their brew may produce a beer that has a less malty flavor. The Beano breaks the <b>complex</b> <b>sugars</b> into simple sugars, and these simple sugars are consumed by the yeast, producing alcohol (or some acetic acid in the aerobic reactions in early fermentation).|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} yeast to convert sugar into ethanol has been {{harnessed}} by the biotechnology industry to produce ethanol fuel. The process starts by milling a feedstock, such as sugar cane, field corn, or other cereal grains, and then adding dilute sulfuric acid, or fungal alpha amylase enzymes, {{to break down}} the starches into <b>complex</b> <b>sugars.</b> A glucoamylase is then added to break the <b>complex</b> <b>sugars</b> down into simple sugars. After this, yeasts are added to convert the simple sugars to ethanol, which is then distilled off to obtain ethanol up to 96% in purity.|$|R

50|$|Bees produce honey by {{collecting}} nectar, a clear liquid consisting of nearly 80 percent water and <b>complex</b> <b>sugars.</b> The collecting bees store the nectar {{in a second}} stomach {{and return to the}} hive, where worker bees remove the nectar. The worker bees digest the raw nectar for about 30 minutes, using enzymes to break down the <b>complex</b> <b>sugars</b> into simpler ones. Raw honey is then spread in empty honeycomb cells to dry, reducing its water content to less than 20 percent. When nectar is being processed, honey bees create a draft through the hive by fanning with their wings. When the honey has dried, the honeycomb cells are sealed (capped) with wax to preserve it.|$|R
25|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>sugars</b> {{consumed}} by the organism {{can be broken down}} into simpler sugar molecules called monosaccharides such as glucose. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that possesses readily available energy, through two different pathways.|$|R
50|$|Beano {{contains}} the enzyme α-GAL, which {{is derived from}} the fungus Aspergillus niger. The enzyme works in the digestive tract to break down the <b>complex</b> or branching <b>sugars</b> (polysaccharides and oligosaccharides) in foods such as legumes (beans and peanuts) and cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts, among others). The enzyme breaks those <b>complex</b> <b>sugars</b> into simple sugars, making these foods somewhat more digestible, and reducing intestinal gas.|$|R
50|$|Yeasts that ferment at warmer temperatures, usually between , form a {{layer of}} foam {{on the surface of}} the fermenting beer, which is why they are {{referred}} to as top-fermenting yeasts. Yeasts that ferment at considerably lower temperatures, around , have the ability to process a chemical compound known as raffinose, a <b>complex</b> <b>sugar</b> created during fermentation. These yeasts collect at the bottom of the fermenting beer and are therefore referred to as bottom-fermenting yeast. The majority of beer in production today is fermented in this way and is called lager.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{interest}} in using MOS to protect gastrointestinal health originated from {{work done in}} the late 1980s. At this time researchers looked at the ability of mannose, the pure version of the <b>complex</b> <b>sugar</b> in MOS, to inhibit salmonella infections. Different studies showed that salmonella can bind via type-1-fimbriae (finger-like projections) to mannose. The binding to mannose {{reduces the risk of}} pathogen colonization in the intestinal tract. Different forms of mannose-type sugars interact differently with type-1-fimbriae. The form present in the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (α-1,3 and α-1,6 branched mannans; for more details see Structure defines function) is particularly effective at binding pathogens. Based on those facts, Newman et al. investigated the effect of MOS in calves and reported improved performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{researchers}} in the Biomolecular Systems department, headed by Peter H. Seeberger, are using new methods for synthesizing sugar chains. Until recently most of the known naturally occurring sugars were those that supply energy to organisms such as sucrose (household sugar) and starch (in plants). However, the <b>complex</b> <b>sugar</b> molecules, which belong to the carbohydrate, are also involved in many biological processes. They cover all cells {{in the human body}} and play a crucial part in molecular identification of cell surfaces for example in infections, immune reactions and cancer metastases. Complex sugars are omnipresent as cell coatings in nature and can therefore also be used for vaccine development, e.g. against malaria. Carbohydrates are thus of significant interest for medicine; the major significance of sugar residues on the surfaces of cells for biology and medicine has only been recognized during the past approximately 20 years.|$|E

40|$|The autocatalytic {{nature of}} the base catalyzed {{condensation}} of formaldehyde to formose sugars is eliminated by using as a cocatalyst, an aldose, or ketose having an alpha-hydrogen. This is more strongly complexed by base than is formaldehyde and the cocatalyst and sugar products accumulate as catalyst complexes instead of formaldehyde. Because {{of the presence of}} alpha-hydrogen atoms in cocatalysts and formose sugars, their removal by cross Cannizzaro reaction of <b>complexed</b> <b>sugars</b> does not occur, so the formose reaction behaves autocatalytically due to this accumulation. It is believed that a given catalytic formose complex is not a discrete <b>complexed</b> <b>sugar,</b> but rather, a scrambled dynamic mixture of sugars having weakened structures. The <b>sugar</b> <b>complexes</b> derive from a common salt-like formaldehyde complex, which, because of the absence of alpha-hydrogen, has a greater tendency to undergo Cannizzaro reaction, rather than formose condensation. Because of this, the Cannizzaro reaction can proceed without measurable formose condensation. The reverse is not possible...|$|R

40|$|The {{direct contact}} of cells to the {{environment}} is mediated in many organisms by an extracellular matrix. One common aspect of extracellular matrices is that they contain <b>complex</b> <b>sugar</b> moieties in form of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and/or polysaccharides. Examples include the extracellular matrix of humans and animal cells consisting mainly of fibrillar proteins and proteoglycans or the polysaccharide based cell walls of plants and fungi, and the proteoglycan/glycolipid based cell walls of bacteria. All these glycostructures play vital roles in cell-to-cell and cell-to-environment communication and signalling...|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that a}} 1 -adrenergic receptors in BC 3 H 1 muscle cells are glycoproteins containing complex but not high mannose oligosacchandes. In the present study we investigated {{the role of the}} <b>complex</b> <b>sugars</b> in functional aspects of the receptor by treating BC 3 H 1 cells with 1 -deoxymannojinmycin (dMM), which blocks conversion of high mannose oligosaccha-rides to complex chains. Receptors were photoaffinity labeled in intact cells with 125 l-azido prazosin; drug treatment with dMM resulted in conversion of the 87 -kDa receptor to 62 kDa. The 62 -kDa protein was sensitive to mannosidase, indicating loss of <b>complex</b> <b>sugars.</b> Radioligand ([3 H]prazosin) binding analysis car-ned out at 37 #{ 176 }to intact cells indicated that dMM treatment increased the affinity of the a 1 -receptors for [‘H]prazosin 2 -fold and decreased the number of total cellular receptors by 1 5 %.
