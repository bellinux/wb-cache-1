5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In Psycho, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> scene for his cameo {{so that he could}} be in a scene with his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others have suggested that he <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> early appearance in the film in order to avoid distracting the audience.|$|E
5|$|Taylor gave up {{appealing}} {{his sentence}} after his request for retrial {{was rejected by}} the Utah Supreme Court. He became the second person to be executed by firing squad in the United States (after Gary Gilmore) since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Taylor said he <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> method of execution to embarrass the state of Utah. On January 26, 1996, the day of Taylor's execution, legislation was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives to eliminate the firing squad.|$|E
5|$|The Achaean League <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> {{moment to}} fight Rome but was swiftly defeated. In 146 BC (the {{same year as}} the {{destruction}} of Carthage), Corinth was besieged and destroyed, {{which led to the}} league's surrender. After nearly a century of constant crisis management in Greece, which always led back to internal instability and war when she withdrew, Rome decided to divide Macedonia into two new Roman provinces, Achaea and Macedonia.|$|E

5|$|Again {{assisted}} by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a skullcap (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long cranium with a sagittal keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the chimpanzee was sometimes known at the time. He <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> name because a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E
5|$|Antigonus, who {{had brought}} with him a large force of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through Euboea towards the Peloponnese. The hostile Aetolian League occupying parts of Thessaly had threatened to oppose him if he went further south than Thermopylae, despite their neutrality {{at that point in}} the war. Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus. He <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> location to avoid facing the Macedonian phalanx head-on.|$|E
5|$|In late 1401, the new {{war against}} the Order {{overstretched}} {{the resources of the}} Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces. Another of Władysław's brothers, the malcontent Švitrigaila, <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> moment to stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke. On 31 January 1402, he presented himself in Marienburg, where he won the backing of the Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.|$|E

5|$|Moonraker was {{intended}} by its creator Ian Fleming {{to become a}} film even before he completed the novel in 1954, since he based it on a screenplay manuscript he had written even earlier. The film's producers had originally intended to film For Your Eyes Only, but instead <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> title due {{to the rise of}} the science fiction genre {{in the wake of the}} Star Wars phenomenon. Budgetary issues caused the film to be primarily shot in France, with locations also in Italy, Brazil, Guatemala and the United States. The soundstages of Pinewood Studios in England, traditionally used for the series, were only used by the special effects team.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 2004, Hyundai Rotem, Mitsui, RM Transit Technology and dU LexBuild {{received}} {{an order to}} refurbish all 396 carriages, costing S$142.7 million in total. The works included the refurbishment of interior fixtures, the addition of wheelchair spaces, the upgrading of onboard communications equipment, enhancement of the public announcement system, and general improvement of the cars' appearance. SMRT Corporation said the reasons for refurbishment were wear and damage of important components {{over the past two}} decades and water leaks from the air-conditioning system on some trains. The company <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> option instead of buying new rolling stock, which would have cost S$792 million. The first refurbished train began revenue service on 5 November 2006, and all remaining trainsets had been refurbished by the end of 2008.|$|E
5|$|The first town to {{fall into}} the Lombards' hands was Forum Iulii (Cividale del Friuli), the seat of the local magister militum. Alboin <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> walled town close to the {{frontier}} to be capital of the Duchy of Friuli and made his nephew and shield bearer, Gisulf, duke of the region, with the specific duty of defending the borders from Byzantine or Avar attacks from the east. Gisulf obtained from his uncle the right to choose for his duchy those farae, or clans, that he preferred.|$|E

5|$|While {{the route}} to the falls from Eagle on the Hill was on public land, the {{alternative}} route along the gully was through private properties. Nevertheless, many visitors <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> route, and a combination of public demand and a desire {{from some of the}} landowners for improved access to and from their propertiesespecially from the Mügge familyled to pressure to build a road through the gully. Although there was opposition from some of the locals, the Waterfall Gully road was built in the late 1880s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hastings returned, {{he had decided}} to become a barrister. There were various {{problems}} with this aim: in particular, he had no money, and the training for barristers was extremely expensive. Despite this, he refused to consider a change of career, and joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901. It is uncertain why he <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> particular Inn of Court (his uncle J. Comyns Carr, his only connection with the Bar, {{was a member of the}} Inner Temple), but the most likely explanation was that the Middle Temple was popular with Irish barristers, and Hastings was of Irish ancestry. The examinations required to become a barrister were not particularly difficult or expensive, but once a student passed all the exams he would be expected to pay the then-enormous sum of £100 when he was called to the Bar – £100 in 1901 would be worth approximately £ in 2015 – and Hastings was literally penniless.|$|E
5|$|Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are {{currently}} categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category C– games which carry {{a high risk}} of disorder amongst supporters. For the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure that the games passed by without any incident. In 2013 a member of West Ham's hooligan Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising violence between West Ham and Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012. He <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham, but who instead, turned out in force to prevent trouble. In November 2014 the two sides' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup. The Metropolitan Police took preventative measures against any trouble occurring, demanding the game at Rush Green kick-off at 12pm and be played behind closed doors.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{financial}} success of Dr. No, United Artists greenlit a second James Bond film. The studio doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions with $2 million, and also approved {{a bonus for}} Sean Connery, who would receive $100,000 along with his $54,000 salary. As President John F. Kennedy had named Fleming's novel From Russia with Love among his ten favourite books of all time in Life magazine, producers Broccoli and Saltzman <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> as the follow-up to Bond's cinematic debut in Dr. No. From Russia with Love was the last film President Kennedy saw at the White House on 20 November 1963 before going to Dallas. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam, who {{went to work on}} Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain; title designer Maurice Binder was replaced by Robert Brownjohn, and stunt coordinator Bob Simmons was unavailable and was replaced by Peter Perkins though Simmons performed stunts in the film. John Barry replaced Monty Norman as composer of the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows. Each season of The Wire consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in {{the year}} since {{publication}} received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E

5|$|The debate {{continues}} over why Peribsen <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> name. Earlier {{theories have}} favoured {{the idea that}} Egypt was split in two realms during Peribsen's time or {{that he was a}} heretic, who sought to start a new monotheistic religion with Seth as the only worshipped god. However, newer evidence and evaluations tend to show that the Egyptian kingdom was unified, but witnessed a vast and profound reform during the second dynasty. Seal impressions from tombs of this era reveal great changes in the titles held by high officials, pointing to a reduction of their power. Further seal impressions show that several deities were worshipped under Peribsen, refuting the monotheism theory, with other contemporary inscriptions indicating that the Egyptian grammar was perfected during his reign: In particular, the earliest seal impressions with complete sentences date back to Peribsen's reign. Thus, Peribsen's reign was in fact a time of cultural and religious advancement.|$|E
5|$|The small burns {{that are}} tributaries to the East Burn {{contributed to the}} {{draining}} of the lands of Dunnikier Estate. The burn emerges from a deep-set culvert to flow under the Victoria Viaduct, down a deep gorge, through the site of Hutchison's Flour Mills before running parallel to the harbour wall and into the sea. From the mid-19th century, the Hutchison's buildings became a significant landmark adjacent to the burn. The flour millers <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> area for its railway connection which linked the main station to the harbour, rather than for the {{need to use the}} burn to power the mills. The West (or Tiel) Burn, was also important, providing power for textile mills. This burn flowed out of the Raith Estate lands where scenically and recreationally it was used to create Raith Lake (with its tributary, the Dronachy Burn). The mill owners in Linktown also made use of the burn.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{expedition}} ended in failure {{the members of}} the Uitvoerend Bewind became very nervous {{in the days before the}} Battle of Bergen. The Agent for Foreign Affairs, Van der Goes who had been in favor of distancing the Republic from the French, <b>chose</b> <b>this</b> inopportune moment to secretly approach the King of Prussia as a mediator, with a scheme in which the Hereditary Prince was to become a kind of constitutional monarch in a constitution on the model of the American Constitution. The Republic would revert to its traditional neutrality, while Britain would occupy North Holland, and France Zeeland. The overture was rejected, and it caused a lot of embarrassment in the relations with the French Directoire. At this time Napoleon Bonaparte performed his coup of 18 Brumaire, establishing the French Consulate. The Franco-Batavian relations now entered a whole new era.|$|E
