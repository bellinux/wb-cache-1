"In {{with your}} oars, lads, and rig the mast, reef down the sail {{to the last}} point; we must show a little to keep her dead before the wind; we shall have a {{tremendous}} sea when we are once fairly away from {{the shelter of the}} island. This gale will soon knock up the sea, and with the <b>cross</b> <b>swell</b> from the Atlantic it will be {{as much as we can}} do to carry through it." ...|$|E
6000|$|A <b>cross</b> <b>swell</b> {{had set in}} {{from the}} {{direction}} of Formosa Channel about ten o'clock, without disturbing these passengers much, because the Nan-Shan, with her flat bottom, rolling chocks on bilges, and great breadth of beam, had the reputation of an exceptionally steady ship in a sea-way. Mr. Jukes, in moments of expansion on shore, would proclaim loudly that the [...] "old girl was as good as she was pretty." [...] It would never have occurred to Captain MacWhirr to express his favourable opinion so loud or in terms so fanciful.|$|E
6000|$|The morning {{had been}} clear but close, till a fine sea breeze set in unusually early. [...] "The doctor" [...] seldom {{rises in the}} Gaboon before noon at this season; often he delays his visit till 2 P.M., and {{sometimes}} he does not appear at all. On the other hand, he is fond of late hours. Before we had progressed a mile, suspicious gatherings of slaty-blue cloud-heaps advanced from the north-east against the wind, with a steady and pertinacious speed, showing that mischief was meant. The [...] "cruel, crawling sea" [...] began to rough, purr, and tumble; a heavy <b>cross</b> <b>swell</b> from the south-west dandled the up-torn mangrove twigs, as they floated past us down stream, and threatened to swamp the deeply laden and cranky old boat, which was far off letter A1 of Lloyd's. The oarsmen became sulky {{because they were not}} allowed to make sail, which, in case of a sudden squall, could not have been taken in under half an hour. Patience! Little can be done, on the first day, with these demi-semi-Europeanized Africans, except to succeed in the inevitable trial of strength.|$|E

40|$|Numerical wave {{models are}} {{powerful}} tools for investigating global wave climate. Here a global wave hindcast is employed {{to estimate the}} global pattern of <b>crossing</b> <b>swells.</b> However, the global patterns of <b>crossing</b> <b>swells</b> derived from the model {{are different from those}} derived from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wave mode products of quasi-linear inversion, indicating one of them is questionable. The comparison shows that the first two most energetic swells inversed by SAR are often not in accordance with the first two most energetic swells in the model, and this will have a large impact on the statistics of the data. Before this problem is solved, SAR wave products of quasi-linear inversion should be treated with care in wave climate studies...|$|R

40|$|Waves {{breaking}} at {{the ocean}} surface {{are important to the}} dynamical, chemical and biological processes at the air-sea interface. The traditional view is that the white capping and aero-dynamical surface roughness increase with wind speed up to a limiting value. This view is fundamental to hurricane forecasting and climate research but it has never been verified at extreme winds. Here we show with observations that at high wind speeds white caps remain constant and at still higher wind speeds are joined, and increasingly dominated, by streaks of foam and spray. At surface wind speeds of ? 40 m/s the streaks merge into a white out, the roughness begins to decrease and a high-velocity surface jet begins to develop. The roughness reduces to virtually zero by ? 80 m/s wind speed, rendering the surface aero-dynamically extremely smooth in the most intense part of extreme (or major) hurricanes (wind speed > 50 m/s). A preliminary assessment shows that <b>cross</b> <b>swell,</b> dominant in large regions of hurricanes, allows the roughness under high wind conditions to increase considerably before it reduces to the same low values.

We <b>crossed</b> <b>swell</b> after swell of the windy common in increasing darkness and entire silence. Suddenly Basil stopped and turned to us, {{his hands in his}} pockets. Through the dusk I could just detect that he wore a broad grin as of comfortable success.|$|R
60|$|It is {{needless to}} say how cheerfully he was obeyed. In {{a few more minutes}} they ascended and <b>crossed</b> a <b>swell</b> of the land, after which the flight was {{continued}} {{at the top of their}} horses' speed, keeping the indicated star in view, as the labouring bark steers for the light which points the way to a haven and security.|$|R

60|$|When Jimmy Skunk {{had rolled}} over onto his feet again, there sat old Mr. Toad {{right in the}} path, and old Mr. Toad was very, very <b>cross</b> indeed. He <b>swelled</b> and he puffed and he puffed and he swelled, till he was twice as big as Jimmy Skunk had ever seen him before.|$|R
60|$|While <b>crossing</b> the <b>swell</b> of land just mentioned, {{the wind}} changed with a suddenness {{that we are}} apt to think American, but which occurs more {{frequently}} in this hemisphere, or rather {{in this part of}} it, than in our own. The peculiarity of the American climate is its exaggeration rather than its fickleness; its passages from extreme heat to extreme cold, more than the frequency of its lesser transitions. One never thinks of an umbrella in America, with a cloudless sky; whereas, during the spring months in particular, there is no security against rain an hour at a time, near the western coast of Europe, more especially north of the Bay of Biscay. On the present occasion, we passed in a few minutes from the oven to the ice-house, and were travelling with cloaks about us, and closed windows, long before we reached Aix-la-Chapelle, at which ancient town we arrived about six. Unlike Spa, where we had the choice among a hundred furnished houses, Aix was so crowded that we got narrow lodgings, with great difficulty, in a second-rate hotel.|$|R
60|$|Shoals {{surrounded}} the basin where Mossamedes rode {{two miles from}} land. From her deck {{it looked as if}} she were at sea, for the banks that sheltered her were only marked by lines of foam. Although she rolled, the motion was not violent, and Kit got a sense of space and freedom. He liked the lonely anchorage better than a noisy port. In the morning they hoisted the boat's lugsail, and following the edge of the sands, stopped where fish were numerous. A disturbed <b>swell</b> <b>crossed</b> the shoals, and spray blew about. Sometimes when the boat sank in the trough they could not see the ship, but the fresh breeze tempered the heat and drove along a thin haze that softened the light. Kit caught strange, deep-bodied fish with square heads, and was content.|$|R
60|$|I <b>crossed</b> one <b>swell</b> {{of living}} turf after another, {{looking for a}} place to sit down and draw. Do not, for heaven's sake, imagine I was going to sketch from Nature. I was going to draw devils and seraphim, and blind old gods that men worshipped before the dawn of right, and saints in robes of angry crimson, and seas of strange green, and all the sacred or monstrous symbols that look so well in bright colours on brown paper. They are much better worth drawing than Nature; also they are much easier to draw. When a cow came slouching by in the field next to me, a mere artist might have drawn it; but I always get wrong in the hind legs of quadrupeds. So I drew the soul of the cow; which I saw there plainly walking before me in the sunlight; and the soul was all purple and silver, and had seven horns and the mystery that belongs to all the beasts. But though I could not with a crayon get the best out of the {{landscape}}, it does not follow that the landscape was not getting the best out of me. And this, I think, is the mistake that people make about the old poets who lived before Wordsworth, and were supposed not to care very much about Nature because they did not describe it much.|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} hotspot trails is controversial. Explanations range from deep mantle plumes {{rising from the}} core-mantle {{boundary}} (CMB) to shallow plate cracking. However, these mechanisms cannot explain uniquely the scattered hotspot trails distributed across a 2, 000 -km-wide swell in the sea floor of the southeast Atlantic Ocean. This swell projects down {{to one of the}} two largest and deepest distinct regions at the CMB, the Africa Low Shear Wave Velocity Province. Here we use 40 Ar/ 39 Ar isotopic analyses to date lava samples erupted at several hotspot trails across the Atlantic swell. We combine the eruption ages with an analysis of the structure and age of the sea floor, and find that the trails formed synchronously, in a pattern consistent with movement of the African Plate over plumes rising {{from the edge of the}} Africa Low Shear Wave Velocity Province. However, we also find that the seamounts initially formed only at the edge of the swell, where the oceanic crust was spreading apart. Later, about 44 million years ago, the hotspot trails began to <b>cross</b> the <b>swell,</b> but only in locations where the lithosphere was sufficiently young and thin that magma could reach the surface. We conclude that the distribution of hotspot trails in the southeast Atlantic Ocean is controlled by the interplay between deep-sourced mantle plumes and the motion and structure of the African Plate...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper new {{algorithms}} to derive sea state developed at the German Aerospace Center are briefly introduced and used to determine SAR derived spectral sea state and individual parameters. As an example of SAR measurements for a severe North Pacific storm, which produced significant wave height (SWH) above 10 m are compared to ECMWF model results and Radar Altimeter. The results are intercompared and validated. Further {{an example of a}} cross sea is analyzed. It occurred in the South East Pacific and was captured clearly by consecutive ERS- 2 SAR wave mode images acquired on August 10, 2000. The WAM model spectra, SAR cross spectra and nonlinear SAR retrieved spectra together with derived integral parameters of the spectra are used to analyze the generation and development of the <b>cross</b> sea. The <b>swell</b> dissipation is observed to increase in the cross sea...|$|R
30|$|It is {{apparent}} that {{there are very few}} islands close to divergent plate boundaries in the Pacific, largely because both the crests and (steep-sided) flanks of most mid-ocean (or back-arc basin) ridges are in deep ocean. Following island formation at the crests, islands are generally carried into deeper water and often may not reach the surface until they <b>cross</b> a lithospheric <b>swell,</b> for instance, which may be thousands of kilometers from the plate boundary at which they originated. For this reason, divergent plate boundary islands are comparatively few and usually emergent only when other processes have contributed to their upgrowth. Examples from the Pacific Basin were once thought to include Easter Island, which is close to the mid-ocean ridge (MOR) named the East Pacific Rise, but no evidence of MOR basalts is found there (Ray et al. 2012). Better examples come from the back-arc basins in the western Pacific where small MORs have produced islands like Niuafo’ou (Tonga) and Mota Lava (Vanuatu) (Sorbadere et al. 2013; Tian et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|The time-honored {{topic of}} fully {{developed}} wind seas pioneered by Pierson and Moskowitz is revisited {{to review the}} asymptotic evolution limits of integral spectral parameters used by the modeling community in the validation of wind-wave models. Discrepancies are investigated between benchmark asymptotic limits obtained by scaling integral spectral parameters using alternative wind speeds. Using state-of-the-art wind and wave modeling technology, uncertainties in the Pierson-Moskowitz limits due to inhomogeneities in the wind fields and contamination of the original data by <b>crossing</b> seas and <b>swells</b> are also investigated. The resulting reanalyzed database is used to investigate the optimal scaling wind parameter and to refine the levels of the full-development asymptotes of nondimensional integral wave spectral parameters used by the windwave modeling community. The results are also discussed in relation to recent advances in quantifying wave-breaking probability of wind seas. The {{results show that the}} parameterization of integral spectral parameters and the scaling of nondimensional asymptotes as a function of U 10 yields relations consistent with similarity theory. On the other hand, expressing integral spectral parameters and scaling nondimensional asymptotes as a function of u‡, or alternative proposed scaling wind speeds yields relations that do not conform to similarity requirements as convincingly. The reanalyzed spectra are used to investigate parameter values and shapes of analytical functions representing fully developed spectra. These results support an analytical form with a spectral tail proportional to f- 4...|$|R
6000|$|The {{following}} morning early we rowed away again, full of longing, {{but not of}} hope, of reaching one or other of the Guacharo caves. [...] Keeping along under the lee of the island, we crossed the 'Umbrella Mouth,' between it and Huevos, or Egg Island. On our right were the islands; on our left the shoreless gulf; and ahead, the great mountain of the mainland, with a wreath of white fleece near its summit, and the shadows of clouds moving in dark patches up its sides. As we <b>crossed,</b> the tumbling <b>swell</b> which {{came in from the}} outer sea, and the columns of white spray which rose right and left against the two door-posts of that mighty gateway, augured ill for our chances of entering a cave. But on we went, with a warning not to be upset if we could avoid it, {{in the shape of a}} shark's back fin above the oily swell; and under Huevos, and round into a lonely cove, with high crumbling cliffs bedecked with Cereus and Aloes in flower, their tall spikes of green flowers standing out against the sky, twenty or thirty feet in height, and beds of short wild pine- apples, {106} like amber-yellow fur, and here and there hanging leaves trailing down to the water; and on into a nook, the sight of which made us give up all hopes of the cave, but which in itself was worth coming from Europe to see. The work of ages of trade-surf had cut the island clean through, with a rocky gully between soft rocks some hundred feet in width. It was just passable at high tide; and through it we were to have rowed, and turned to the left to the cave in the windward cliffs. But ere we reached it the war outside said 'No' in a voice which would take no denial, and when we beached the boat behind a high rock, and scrambled up to look out, we saw a sight, one half of which was not unworthy of the cliffs of Hartland or Bude. On the farther side of the knife edge of rock, crumbling fast into the sea, a waste of breakers rolled through the chasm, though there was scarcely any wind to drive them, leaping, spouting, crashing, hammering down the soft cliffs, which seemed to crumble, and did doubtless crumble, at every blow; and beyond that the open blue sea, without a rock or a sail, hazy, in spite of the blazing sunlight, beneath the clouds of spray. But there ceased the likeness to a rock scene on the Cornish coast; for at the other foot of the rock, not twenty yards from that wild uproar, the land-locked cove up which we had come lay still as glass, and the rocks were richer with foliage than an English orchard. Everywhere down into the very sea, the Matapalos held and hung; their air-roots dangled into the very water; many of them had fallen into it, but grew on still, and blossomed with great white fragrant flowers, somewhat like those of a Magnolia, each with a shining cake of amber wax as big as a shilling in the centre; and over the Matapalos, tree on tree, liane on liane, up to a negro garden, with its strange huge- leaved vegetables and glossy fruit-trees, and its black owner standing on the cliff, and peering down out of his little nest with grinning teeth and white wondering eyes, at the white men who were gathering, off a few yards of beach, among the great fallen leaves of the Matapalos, such shells as delighted our childhood in the West India cabinet at home.|$|R
