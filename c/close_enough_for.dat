5|$|The WZ Sagittae-type dwarf nova DY CMi (also {{known as}} VSX J074727.6+065050) flared up to {{magnitude}} 11.4 over January and February 2008 before dropping eight magnitudes to around 19.5 over approximately 80 days. It is a remote binary star system where a white dwarf and low mass star orbit each other <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the former star to draw material off the latter and form an accretion disc. This material builds up until it erupts dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of such an event. The timing and prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. Betelgeuse is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is not <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} the predator mimics an organism that its prey is indifferent to. Unlike in all cases above, the predator is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the predator to strike. This is effectively a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), may provide one such example. It flies amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over {{whether this is a}} true case of mimicry.|$|E

50|$|The {{chirping}} of {{the more}} common field crickets is not as reliably correlated to temperature—their chirping rate varies depending on other factors such as age and mating success.

5|$|Property in the County of Tripoli, {{granted to}} the Knights in the 1140s, {{included}} the Krak des Chevaliers, the towns of Rafanea and Montferrand, and the Beqa'a plain separating Homs and Tripoli. Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city. While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, it also meant Homs was <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> them to raid. Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, Yūnagi {{detached}} from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she {{lost sight of the}} other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E
50|$|Survivorship bias of {{exchange}}s: exchanges {{often go}} bust (just as governments default; for example, Shanghai stock exchange during 1949 communist takeover), and this risk {{needs to be}} included - using only exchanges which have survived for the long-term overstates returns. Exchanges <b>close</b> often <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> this effect to matter.|$|R

50|$|However, if {{the bodies}} are {{conformal}} to an accuracy of better than 10 angstroms (1 nanometer), then a sufficient surface area is in <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> contact <b>for</b> the intermolecular interactions to have an observable real world physical manifestation—that is, the two objects stick together. Such a condition requires {{a high degree of}} accuracy and surface smoothness, which is typically found in optical components, such as prisms.|$|R
5|$|Hale–Bopp {{may have}} had a near {{collision}} with Jupiter in early June 2215BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215BC may have been its first passage through the inner Solar System. The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to the inner Solar System around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{are able}} to track the Osaarian vessel, finding a large 1,000-year-old sphere {{constructed}} out of a single alloy. Archer and his away team discover a series of habitat modules containing most of the stolen items. The crew also finds a cargo manifest, and Ensign Sato soon learns they had also recently attacked a Xindi ship. Archer once again confronts Orgoth, demanding {{to know everything about}} the Xindi. He then drags the Osaarian to an airlock, initiating the decompression cycle. Orgoth soon relents, revealing they downloaded the Xindi database, while providing the access codes to their computer. When the alien ship returns, Mayweather maneuvers Enterprise <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Sato to download the bulk of it. Archer sends Orgoth back to his people.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{faint star}} that appears <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> to Elnath <b>for</b> astronomers to {{consider}} it a double star. Its visual companion, known as BD+28 795B, has a PA of 239 degrees and is separated from the main star by 33.4 arcseconds.|$|R
40|$|A {{statistically}} significant difference in mean values between two laboratory quantitation methods is interpreted as a bias. Sometimes such a difference is so minute {{that it does not}} constitute any practical concern. An alternative approach is to test statistically whether the two methods are <b>close</b> <b>enough,</b> not <b>for</b> equality. This {{is to look at the}} confidence interval of the mean method difference and does not entail any additional statistical tests...|$|R
60|$|Signals were {{exchanged}} {{between the two}} English vessels, and {{in a very short}} time they were steaming toward the repeller. It was a dangerous thing for two vessels of their size to come <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> together <b>for</b> both to ram an enemy at the same time, but it was determined to take the risks and do this, if possible; for the destruction of the repeller was obviously the first duty in hand.|$|R
5|$|With a {{subtropical}} ridge {{in the vicinity}} of the Marianas Islands, the nascent depression moved to the northwest. On August3, the JMA upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, naming it Etau. An upper-level low to the northeast improved northerly outflow, allowing the storm to strengthen quickly. On August4 the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the region, naming it Kabayan. Late on August4, the JMA upgraded Etau to typhoon status, with the storm later developing an eye. An approaching shortwave trough weakened the ridge, causing Etau to turn more to the north. At around 0030UTC on August7, the typhoon made its closest approach to Okinawa, passing within 120km (75mi), and <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the 100km (60mi) wide eye to cross over the island. Later that day, the JMA estimated peak maximum sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph), sustained over a duration of 10minutes; the JTWC estimated 1minute winds of 205km/h (125mph).|$|E
5|$|Ethalion {{took over}} pursuit of Bellone from Melampus, {{and for two}} hours {{maintained}} continuous fire with her bow-chasers on the French ship. Ethalion was faster than her quarry, and she slowly pulled parallel with Bellone during the afternoon, but could not get <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a decisive blow. It took another two hours of pursuit before the battered Bellone eventually surrendered. Hoche apart, Bellone had suffered more casualties than any other ship present. To the south of this conflict, the struggling Anson discovered herself in danger when the surviving frigates of the French vanguard swept towards her en masse. Captain Durham was initially confused by their approach {{as he had been}} too distant to witness the action and the French ships flew false British ensigns, but he rapidly realised their true identity and at 16:00 opened fire on Loire. The damaged Anson was severely hampered by her inability to manoeuvre, and so could do nothing when the French ships pulled back and sailed away, except to continue to fire until they were out of range. During the evening, the surviving French frigates gradually pulled away from their pursuers and disappeared into the gathering night, leaving behind four of their squadron, including their flagship, as captives.|$|E

25|$|All atomic nuclei, being {{composed}} of protons and neutrons, repel one another {{because of their}} positive charge. However, if the atoms have a high enough temperature and pressure (for example, {{in the core of}} the Sun), then their random motions can overcome such electrical repulsion (called the Coulomb force), and they can come <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the strong nuclear force to take effect, fusing them into heavier atoms.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{continued}} {{to publish the}} poetic works of Aikin and Barbauld {{as well as those}} of George Dyer, Joseph Fawcett, James Hurdis, Joel Barlow, Ann Batten Cristall and Edward Williams. Most of the poets that Johnson promoted and published are not remembered today. However, in 1793, Johnson published William Wordsworth's An Evening Walk and Descriptive Sketches; he remained Wordsworth's publisher until a disagreement separated them in 1799. Johnson also put out Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Fears of Solitude (1798). They were apparently <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> friends <b>for</b> Coleridge to leave his books at Johnson's shop when he toured Europe.|$|R

25|$|When {{reporting}} air-borne {{rather than}} water-borne densities, {{a slightly different}} convention is used since air is approximately 1000 times less dense than water. In water, 1µg/m3 is roughly equivalent to parts-per-trillion whereas in air, it is roughly equivalent to parts-per-billion. Note also, {{that in the case}} of air, this convention is much less accurate. Whereas one liter of water is almost exactly 1kg, one cubic meter of air is often taken as 1.143kg—much less accurate, but still <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> many practical uses.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{reactions}} {{occur when}} {{two or more}} atomic nuclei come <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> long enough that the nuclear force pulling them together exceeds the electrostatic force pushing them apart, fusing them into heavier nuclei. For nuclei lighter than iron-56, the reaction is exothermic, releasing energy. For nuclei heavier than iron-56, the reaction is endothermic, requiring an external source of energy. Hence, nuclei smaller than iron-56 {{are more likely to}} fuse while those heavier than iron-56 are more likely to break apart.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> long enough so the {{strong nuclear force}} can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, {{there is a large}} energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the Coulomb barrier.|$|E
