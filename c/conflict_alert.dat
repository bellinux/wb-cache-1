Benefits in patient safety are often as a result of some clinical decision support (CDS) within the system. Objective To study the characteristics of the CDS alerts generated within a commercially available EP system in use at a tertiary care paediatric hospital in the UK. Methods Retrospective review and characterisation of CDS alerts recorded in the EP system over 1 year. Results A total of 16 182 <b>conflict</b> <b>alerts</b> were recorded when ordering 26 836 items, of which 3507 (13 alerts per 100 prescription orders (95 % confidence interval, 12. 8 to 13. 6)) were visible to the user. Eighty nine percent (3119 / 3507) of all visible alerts were overridden by the user at point of prescribing. Drug-allergy <b>conflict</b> <b>alerts</b> were the most accepted, and exact drug duplication alerts the least. Conclusion We found a high incidence of alert override, which is undesirable but consistent with that reported in the literature.

40|$|Assessing {{the safety}} effects of {{prediction}} errors and uncertainty on automationsupported {{functions in the}} Next Generation Air Transportation System concept of operations is of foremost importance, particularly safety critical functions such as separation that involve human decision-making. Both ground-based and airborne, the automation of separation functions must be designed to account for, and mitigate the impact of, information uncertainty and varying human response.

In this study, we evaluated an airborne separation capability operated by a simulated pilot. The experimental runs are part of the Safety Performance of Airborne Separation (SPAS) experiment suite that examines the safety implications of prediction errors and system uncertainties on airborne separation assistance systems. Pilot actions required by the airborne separation automation to resolve traffic conflicts were delayed within a wide range, varying from five to 240 seconds while a percentage of randomly selected pilots were programmed to completely miss the <b>conflict</b> <b>alerts</b> and therefore take no action.

40|$|The Tactical Separation-Assisted Flight Environment (TSAFE) is {{designed}} to alert air traffic controllers to imminent conflicts (predicted loss of separation within approximately 3 minutes).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} the feasibility of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) performing delegated separation in the national airspace system (NAS). Delegated separation is the transfer of responsibility for maintaining separation between aircraft or vehicles from air navigation service providers to the relevant pilot or flight operator.

40|$|An {{operational}} {{error is}} {{an incident in}} which an air traffic controller allows the separation between two aircraft to fall below the minimum separation standard. The rates of such errors in the US have increased significantly {{over the past few}} years. This paper proposes new detection methods that can help correct this trend by improving on the performance of <b>Conflict</b> <b>Alert,</b> the existing software in the Host Computer System that is intended to detect and warn controllers of imminent conflicts. In addition to the usual trajectory based on the flight plan, a "dead-reckoning" trajectory (current velocity projection) is also generated for each aircraft and checked for conflicts. Filters for reducing common types of false alerts were implemented. The new detection methods were tested in three different ways. First, a simple flightpath command language was developed t o generate precisely controlled encounters for the purpose of testing the detection software. Second, written reports and tracking data were obtained for actual operational errors that occurred in the field, and these were "replayed" to test the new detection algorithms. Finally, the detection methods were used to shadow live traffic, and performance was analysed, particularly with regard to the false-alert rate. The results indicate that the new detection methods can provide timely warnings of imminent conflicts more consistently than <b>Conflict</b> <b>Alert...</b>|$|E

Current alerting systems have been very successful at preventing mid-air collisions in the en-route environment but have limited benefit in high-density environments such as near airports where most mid-air collisions occur (59 %). Furthermore, introducing an ADS-B-enabled <b>conflict</b> <b>alerting</b> system generates an incentive for General Aviation users to voluntarily equip with ADS-B avionics. The work presented in this thesis describes the process followed to develop an ADS-B-enabled, high-precision <b>conflict</b> <b>alerting</b> system. This system will {{be the basis for}} the international certification standard guiding future implementations of such systems. The work was conducted as part of the larger development effort of the Traffic Situation Awareness with Alerting (TSAA) ADS-B application. As a first step, a set of 18 high-level system requirements was identified based on a stakeholder analysis and review of mid-air collisions that occurred over the last 10 years. An alerting algorithm was then developed based on the system requirements that builds on the precedent set by current alerting systems but takes advantage of the improved state information available via ADS-B. The distinguishing factors of the algorithm are its use of a constant turn rate trajectory prediction and its consideration of the current and predicted encounter geometry in the alerting decision. Next, a method to tune the performance of the algorithm was developed and demonstrated. The method applies the Latin hypercube sampling approach to generate a large set of different algorithm implementations, which were then evaluated by simulating the alerting performance on a representative data set of airborne encounters. Lastly, the method introduced an approach to evaluate and "visualize" the five-dimensional performance space defined by the five performance metrics of interest for alerting systems. Using the tuned algorithm, a flight test program was conducted. The performance of the algorithm during the flight test was analyzed in-depth and compared to the expected performance. Given the insights from the tuning and the flight test, additional alerting logic was introduced to the basic algorithm, which significantly improved overall alerting performance. The performance of the final system implementation is significantly better or equal to that of the current industry standard for all five performance metrics. The nuisance and overall alert rate were each reduced by a factor of more than 4 and the average time of alert before the closest point of approach increased by 6 seconds as compared to current systems. Enabled by this performance improvement, TSAA introduces reliable collision alerting to the Airport Environment where most of today's mid-air collisions occur and where today's alerting systems are of limited benefit due to high rates of nuisance alerts. by Fabrice Kunzi.

40|$|Methods for {{maintaining}} separation between {{aircraft in the}} current airspace system have been built from a foundation of structured routes and evolved procedures. However, as the airspace becomes more congested and the chance of failures or operational error become more problematic, automated <b>conflict</b> <b>alerting</b> systems have been proposed to help provide decision support and to serve as traffic monitoring aids. The problem of conflict detection and resolution has been tackled {{from a number of}} different ways, but in this thesis, it is recast as a problem of prediction in the presence of uncertainties. Much of the focus is concentrated on the errors and uncertainties from the working trajectory model used to estimate future aircraft positions. The more accurate the prediction, the more likely an ideal (no false alarms, no missed detections) alerting system can be designed. Additional insights into the problem were brought forth by a review of current operational and developmental approaches found in the literature. An iterative, trial and error approach to threshold design was identified. When examined from a probabilistic perspective, the threshold parameters were found to be a surrogate to probabilistic performance measures. To overcome the limitations in the current iterative design method, a new direct approach is presented where the performance measures are directly computed and used to perform the alerting decisions. The methodology is shown to handle complex encounter situations (3 -D, multi-aircraft, multi-intent, with uncertainties) with relative ease. Utilizing a Monte Carlo approach, a method was devised to perform the probabilistic computations in near realtime. Not only does this greatly increase the method's potential as an analytical tool, but it also opens up the possibility for use as a real-time <b>conflict</b> <b>alerting</b> probe.
