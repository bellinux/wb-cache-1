40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} {{show that a}} {{wavelength}} division multiplexed (WDM) split crossconnect is strictly, wide-sense, or rearrangeably non-blocking {{if and only if}} a corresponding 3 -stage Clos network is strictly, wide-sense or rearrangeably non-blocking. This observation implies known results on strictly non-blocking WDM split <b>cross-connects</b> and gives rise to new results on wide-sense and rearrangeably non-blocking WDM split <b>cross-connects.</b> We next introduce a routing algorithm for the Clos networks which show that there are widesense non-blocking Clos networks which are not strictly non-blocking. Hence, the same holds for the WDM split <b>cross-connects.</b> We also consider another demand model for WDM split <b>cross-connects</b> and present associated results. Routing algorithms for WDM split crossconnects could be viewed as on-line and off-line algorithms to edge-color a class of bipartite multi-graphs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} problem of {{determining}} the minimum number of limited-range wavelength converters needed to construct strictly, wide-sense, and rearrangeably nonblocking optical <b>cross-connects</b> for both unicast and multicast traffic patterns. We give the exact formula to compute this number for rearrangeably and wide-sense nonblocking <b>cross-connects</b> under both the unicast and multicast cases. We also give optimal crossconnect constructions {{with respect to the}} number of limited-range wavelength converters.

40|$|Abstract. The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} the vertebrate skeletal muscle Z band reflects its function as the muscle component essential for tension transmission between successive sarcomeres. We have investigated this structure {{as well as that}} of the nearby I band in a normal, unstimulated mammalian skeletal muscle by tomographic three-dimensional reconstruction from electron micrograph tilt series of sectioned tissue. The three-dimensional Z band structure consists of interdigitating axial filaments from opposite sarcomeres connected every 18 _+ 12 nm (mean _+ SD) to one to four <b>cross-connecting</b> Z-filaments. Most often, the <b>cross-connecting</b> Z-filaments are observed to meet the axial filaments in a fourfold symmetric arrangement. The substantial variation in the spacing betwee...|$|R
