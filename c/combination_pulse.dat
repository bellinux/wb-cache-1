40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{efficiency}} and tolerance of two pulse therapy regimens: <b>combination</b> <b>pulse</b> therapy with highdose methotrexate (MT) and high-dose dexamethasone and pulse therapy with dexamethasone. Subjects and methods. The trial enrolled 100 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with two pulse therapy regimens and then followed up for 1 year during standard MT therapy. The efficiency of the treatment was evaluated using the ACR 20 / 50 / 70 criteria. The number of swollen and tender joints (SJ and TJ), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein levels, systemic disease activity and a need for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and glucocorticoids were determined. Results and discussion. After 1 month of therapy, the patients of both groups showed significant positive changes in all assessed parameters of RA activity. By this time, after <b>combination</b> <b>pulse</b> therapy with MT and dexamethasone, there was a more significant {{reduction in the number}} of SJ, total activity scores given by a patient and a physician, and pain intensity according to the visual analogue scale. By the end of 1 and 3 -month follow-ups, a 70 % improvement was significantly more frequently noted in the <b>combination</b> <b>pulse</b> therapy group than in the monotherapy group. During a subsequent follow-up, the number of TJ and SJ tended to further decrease; however, the group differences were leveled. Evaluation of X-ray progression trends at 12 months of follow-up revealed no significant differences between the patients of the study groups. There were neither differences in the rate of adverse reactions nor severe complications. Conclusion. <b>Combination</b> <b>pulse</b> therapy with MT and dexamethasone was an effective and well tolerated option, the use of which could lower RA activity considerably, accelerate the therapeutic effect of MT, and reduce symptomatic therapy volume in the shortest possible time...|$|E

It {{is characterized by}} two novel design parameters that provide additional degrees of freedom to minimize the intercarrier interference (ICI) power due to frequency offset.

Several Nyquist-I pulses were recently proposed to address the subject of high sensitivity to frequency offset and high PAPR in OFDM-based transmissions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of SPLCP in terms of ICI power, signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) power, bit error rate (BER), and PAPR. We additionally examine the behaviour of SPLCP with new design parameters for a certain roll-off factor,. We compare the performance of SPLCP with other well-known pulses.

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{femtosecond}} lasers, performance improvements have constantly impacted on existing applications and enabled novel applications. However, one performance feature bearing the potential of a quantum leap for high-field applications is still not available: the simultaneous emission of extremely high peak and average powers. Emerging applications such as laser particle acceleration require exactly this performance regime and, therefore, challenge laser technology at large. On the one hand, canonical bulk systems can provide pulse peak powers in the multi-terawatt to petawatt range, while on the other hand, advanced solid-state-laser concepts such as the thin disk, slab or fibre are well known for their high efficiency {{and their ability to}} emit high average powers in the kilowatt range with excellent beam quality. In this contribution, a compact laser system capable of simultaneously providing high peak and average powers with high wall-plug efficiency is proposed and analysed. The concept is based on the temporal coherent <b>combination</b> (<b>pulse</b> stacking) of a pulse train emitted from a high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser system in a passive enhancement cavity. Thus, the pulse energy is increased at the cost of the repetition rate while almost preserving the average power. The concept relies on a fast switching element for dumping the enhanced pulse out of the cavity. The switch constitutes the key challenge of our proposal. Addressing this challenge could, for the first time, allow the highly efficient dumping of joule-class pulses at megawatt average power levels and lead to unprecedented laser parameters...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{majority}} of Lyme disease patients can be cured, at least 10 - 20 % of the patients continue to suffer from persisting symptoms such as fatigue, muscular and joint pain, and neurologic impairment after standard 2 - 4 week antibiotic treatment. While the causes for this post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms are unclear, one possibility is due to B. burgdorferi persisters that are not effectively killed by current antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin used to treat Lyme disease. A previous study showed that four rounds of ceftriaxone pulse dosing treatment eradicated B. burgdorferi persisters in vitro using a relatively young late log phase culture (5 day old). In this study, we investigated if ceftriaxone pulse dosing could also eradicate B. burgdorferi persisters in older stationary phase cultures (10 day old) enriched with more resistant microcolony form of persisters. We found that ceftriaxone pulse dosing could only eradicate planktonic log phase B. burgdorferi spirochetal forms and round body forms but not more resistant aggregated biofilm-like microcolony persisters enriched in stationary phase cultures. Moreover, we found that not all drugs are suitable for pulse dosing, with bactericidal drugs ceftriaxone and cefuroxime being more appropriate for pulse dosing than bacteriostatic drug doxycycline and persister drug daptomycin. We also showed that drug <b>combination</b> <b>pulse</b> dosing treatment was more effective than single drug pulse dosing. Importantly, we demonstrate that pulse dosing treatment impaired {{the activity of the}} persister drug daptomycin and its drug combination against B. burgdorferi persisters and that {{the most effective way to}} kill the more resistant biofilm-like microcolonies is the daptomycin/doxycycline/ceftriaxone triple drug combination without pulse dosing. Our findings indicate pulse dosing may not always work as a general principle but rather depends on the specific drugs used, with cidal drugs being more appropriate for pulse dosing than static or persister drugs, and that drug combination approach with persister drugs is more effective at killing the more resistant microcolony form of persisters than pulse dosing. These observations may have implications for more effective treatment of Lyme disease. Future studies are required to validate these findings in animal models of B. burgdorferi persistence...|$|E

40|$|The shock {{impedance}} {{has become}} increasingly important in setting the optimal <b>combination</b> of <b>pulse</b> width and voltage for monophasic and biphasic shocks. However, many systems measure impedance using a 5 to 15 J synchronized shock in sinus rhythm. We examined {{the ability of a}} low current signal static impedance (imp) (2 mA, 15 microsec) via the shocking electrodes to predict the impedance during shock delivery. The static impedance (mean 36. 6 ± 11. 1 ohms) was not statistically significant from the shock impedance Imean 36. 9 ± 8. 6 ohms). The correlation (r= 0. 81) of the static impedance with the shock impedance in 83 patients during implantation of Telectronics 4210 implantable defibrillator is shown. These data suggest that the low current static impedance correlates well with shock impedance and that this method may provide useful information in setting the initial <b>combination</b> of <b>pulse</b> width and voltage, obviating the need for a test shock in sinus rhythm...|$|R

40|$|The giant {{magnetoresistance}} (GMR) was investigated for electrodeposited Co/Cu multilayers. In {{order to better}} understand the formation of individual layers and their influence on GMR, multilayers produced by two different deposition strategies were compared. One series of Co(2 nm) /Cu(tCu) multilayers with tCu ranging from 0. 5 nm to 6 nm was produced with the conventional two-pulse plating by using a galvanostatic/potentiostatic (G/P) <b>pulse</b> <b>combination</b> for the magnetic/non-magnetic layer deposition, respectively, whereby the Cu layer deposition was carried out at the electrochemically optimized potential. Another Co(2 nm) /Cu(tCu) multilayer series with the same tCu range was prepared {{with the help of a}} G/P/G <b>pulse</b> <b>combination.</b> In this latter case, first a bilayer of Co(2 nm) /Cu(6 nm) was deposited in each cycle as in the G/P mode after which a third G pulse was applied with a small anodic current to dissolve part of the 6 nm thick Cu layer in order to ensure the targeted tCu value. The comparison of the two series revealed that the G/P/G <b>pulse</b> <b>combination</b> yields multilayers for which GMR can be obtained even at such low nominal Cu layer thicknesses where G/P multilayers already exhibit bulk-like anisotropic magnetoresistance only. Surface roughness measurements by atomic force microscopy revealed that the two kinds of <b>pulse</b> <b>combination</b> yield different surface roughness values which correlate with the structural quality of the multilayers as indicated by the absence or presence of multilayer satellite reflections in the X-ray diffraction patterns. A separation of the superparamagnetic (SPM) contribution from the total observed GMR provided useful hints at the understanding of differences in layer formation between samples prepared with the two kinds of <b>pulse</b> <b>combination.</b> The results of multilayer chemical analysis revealed that mainly an increased Cu content of the magnetic layer is responsible for the onset of SPM regions in the form of Co segregations in the G/P/G multilayers with small Cu layer thicknesses.
