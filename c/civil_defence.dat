5|$|Fierce waves pushed {{large amounts}} of water to coastal areas in Fujairah of the United Arab Emirates, forcing roads to be closed and traffic diverted. <b>Civil</b> <b>defence</b> and police were on duty to manage the road closures, while {{municipal}} workers pumped the excess water off the roads. The road connecting Kalba and Fujairah was closed due to the road being submerged by water. The waves along the coastline were reported to be 10m (32ft) high, which destroyed about a dozen fishing boats. About 300boats were moved from the water or emptied of equipment, and overall damage to the port of Fujairah was reported as severe. A boat sank by the port, leaving its ten passengers missing.|$|E

5|$|Oman's National Committee for <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence</b> {{coordinated the}} country's {{preparations}} for Phet, utilizing a national disaster plan that organized the various ministries, and providing early warnings. Storm warnings were broadcast in seven languages, {{a response to}} there being only English and Arabic warnings during Cyclone Gonu, which struck Oman in 2007. Residents were advised to remain away from the rough seas during the storm. Businesses and schools were shut down in the areas the storm affected, with schools operating as emergency shelters near Muscat. About 85% of the isolated Masirah Island was evacuated; the passage of Phet and subsequent storms affecting the Arabian Peninsula influenced the Omani government's decision to build a fixed link with the island 40km (25mi) offshore. Nationwide, 12,870people evacuated, utilizing 91 government-opened shelters. Omani officials shut down the country's {{oil and gas production}} facilities during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Across Oman, Phet's {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at over 300million rials (US$780million). Strong winds knocked down billboards, trees, and power lines, causing power outages. Water pipes and desalination plants were also damaged. Storm flooding washed away hundreds of cars, while also damaging roads and bridges. Nationwide, the cyclone wrecked thousands of homes. On the offshore Masirah Island, Phet's storm surge damaged or wrecked some boats, while strong winds damaged tin roofs and satellite dishes. The roof and compound wall of a resort hotel were damaged. Across eastern and northern Oman, heavy rainfall from Phet flooded low-lying areas and produced landslides. The Royal Oman Police helped direct or traffic after many roads were inundated or blocked. The floodwaters entered homes in Al-Ghubra and Al Athaiba, {{as well as the}} Qurum market in Muscat. According to Oman's National Committee for <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence,</b> Phet killed 16people in the country, although the IMD reported the death toll at 24.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the earthquakes, the National Crisis Management Centre was activated through The Ministry of <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence</b> and Emergency Management to manage public response to the disaster; hundreds of police officers were accordingly dispatched to patrol the city streets. Authorities proposed to set up an outdoors emergency operations centre, as well as a public welfare centre to provide shelter to victims overnight. The Student Volunteer Army — which partook in silt shifting after the February 2011 quake — again prepared the recruitment of participants to initiate street clearing actions. A total of NZ$285,000 (US$230,000) was allocated for donations to nine charities, including NZ$40,000 (US$32,000) to both the Red Cross Christchurch earthquake appeal and the Canterbury Earthquake Appeal Salvation Army funds. At Westpac Bank, a public donation account was opened in order to provide financial assistance for earthquake victims. Chief executives from the Commonwealth Bank sponsored an exclusive dinner in Sydney to raise money for rebuilding costs; an initial A$700,000 (US$660,000) was allocated prior to the event, with entry costs of A$10,000 (US$9,500) per ticket.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-eight {{people were}} killed while on a relief mission to Leninakan when a Soviet Ilyushin Il-76 crashed on {{approach}} to the airport there. Nine crew and 69 military personnel were on board the plane that struck a helicopter in foggy conditions at the small airport that was overrun with rescue flights. In the days following the earthquake, the normally quiet airstrip was receiving up to 180 flights per day carrying food, medical supplies, and disaster management experts. Those who were killed on the plane were planning to join an estimated 20,000 soldiers and 85,000 <b>civil</b> <b>defence</b> workers in rescue efforts by searching for survivors, supplying food and water, and setting up sanitation facilities in the region. At the Yerevan airport, western pilots reported a breakdown in air traffic control communications, with flight controllers not delivering the necessary flight navigation instructions, allowing for a critical lack of separation as foreign planes {{made their way into}} the area.|$|E
5|$|The Oman Chairman of the National Committee for <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence,</b> General Malek Bin Sulaiman Al Ma'amari, remarked {{the nation}} had already {{developed}} a contingency plan, {{which included the}} activation of army and police personnel after the storm's passage. Significant damage was expected, especially in northeastern areas, along with up to 150mm (6in) of rainfall and very strong winds. Officials recommended citizens evacuate from potentially affected areas, and about 7,000people were forced to leave Masirah Island due {{to the threat of}} high surf and strong winds. Overall, more than 20,000people evacuated to emergency shelters. A state of emergency was declared for the nation. The Omani national weather service warned that the cyclone was expected to be worse than the destructive cyclone that hit Masirah Island in 1977. The Mina al Fahal oil terminal closed for over three days due to the threat of the storm. Omani officials closed government offices for two days and declared a five-day-long national holiday. Most businesses near the coastline were closed prior to the announcement. Authorities at the Muscat International Airport (then named as Seeb International Airport) canceled of all flights after 2000UTC on June 5 due to the cyclone.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the ship date back to 4 March 2005, in a {{proposal}} drafted by then-Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (which is now a nonexistent entity), Björn Bjarnason, regarding {{the purchase of a}} new vessel, in order to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn, and aircraft for the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Althing decided that this was an exigent matter, and so a high priority was placed upon the proposal. A needs analysis pertaining to the acquisition of a multi-purpose vessel and aircraft for the ICG was initiated on 31 September 2005. The main demands were that the vessel should be designed for rescue work and patrolling, pollution prevention, fuelling search and rescue helicopters in flight, and meeting <b>civil</b> <b>defence</b> requirements anywhere around the country. In addition, it was to be equipped for response to, and prevention of, terrorist threats and be suitable for operations involving the police or customs authorities, and for all types of rescue and salvage work. The bollard pull of the vessel was to take account of the greatly increased volume of passenger and cargo shipping in Iceland’s economic zone and coastal waters.|$|E
5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of desalinated water was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in oil exports. In the months after the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence</b> set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as water and electricity were gradually restored, and people returned to their homes. By two weeks after the storm's passage, most of those remaining in shelters were from Qurayat, one of the most severely affected villages.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May, Baroness Symons, {{a junior}} {{minister}} in the MoD, told the House of Lords that British forces would remain in Sierra Leone, mainly to ensure the security of Lungi airport while UNAMSIL brought in reinforcements. Soldiers also remained at the evacuation point in Freetown to ensure its security, while others patrolled the streets of Freetown {{in an attempt to}} reassure residents. HMS Illustrious, with her air group, and the ARG both arrived on 14 May, bringing the number of British personnel in the operational area to approximately 4,500. Harriers from Illustrious began flying reassurance patrols over Freetown and the ARG supplemented British firepower, particularly at Lungi, with the provision of artillery. In the field, the British forces divided their efforts between three lines of operation: support to UNAMSIL, support to the SLA, and preparation to provide humanitarian assistance, should it be necessary, though the expanded mandate only became formal government policy several days later. During the following week, the RUF began to remobilise in the north of the country. The UN and the Sierra Leonean government feared that UNAMSIL troops between the RUF and Freetown {{might not be able to}} stand up to an assault by the RUF, and so the RAF Chinooks—in the country to conduct the evacuation—were used to ferry reinforcements from Lungi as they arrived. Meanwhile, President Ahmad Kabbah formed an alliance of militia groups (including the self-styled <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence</b> Force and the West Side Boys) and the remnants of the SLA, totalling around 6,000 personnel, to assist UNAMSIL forces in blocking the RUF advance. The British also provided reconnaissance for UNAMSIL using ground-based signals and intelligence personnel and special forces as well as flights by Harriers and a Nimrod R1.|$|E
