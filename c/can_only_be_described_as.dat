5|$|His {{behaviour}} {{on campaign}} <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> perfectly honourable {{and at times}} humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured émigrés from {{the wrath of the}} Revolutionary radicals in the army. He also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men. As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that he displayed for the lives and well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} complete {{source of}} the Tristan material in English was Sir Tristrem, a romance of some 3344 lines written circa 1300. It is preserved in the famous Auchinleck manuscript at the National Library of Scotland. The narrative largely follows the courtly tradition. As is true with many medieval English adaptations of French Arthuriana, the poem's artistic achievement <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> average, though some critics have tried to rehabilitate it, claiming it is a parody. Its first editor, Sir Walter Scott, provided a sixty line ending to the story, which has been printed with the romance in every subsequent edition.|$|E

500|$|Mark Bozon of IGN {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the game's dated graphics, found the overall gameplay very slow, and found the garbled voice work unsettling while enjoying the soundtrack. He concluded that, even as a fan of old school and abstract gameplay design, he had not enjoyed his time with the game. Lark Anderson, writing for GameSpot said there was [...] "never a dull moment" [...] due to the eccentric cast and story, and found the puzzle elements to be an entertaining challenge. His main complaints were the poor graphics, unresponsive camera system, lack of direction during navigation and the constant need for backtracking. Nintendo World Report's Nick DiMola noted the dialogue for its humor, but generally faulted most other aspects of the game; he called its graphics and sound low-quality, felt the gameplay was shallow, and found the puzzle solving segments a chore. He found it hard to recommend the title for any but dedicated fans of Suda's work. PALGN reviewer Ben Chev called the script [...] "well-written in what <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a typical Suda 51 style", and praised the music for its unique take on classical music. However he generally faulted the gameplay and called the graphics the worst he had seen for the DS.|$|E

According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo!

500|$|Monteverdi is lauded {{by modern}} critics as [...] "the most {{significant}} composer in late Renaissance and early Baroque Italy"; [...] "one {{of the principal}} composers {{in the history of}} Western music"; and, routinely, as the first great opera composer. These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was largely unknown to the composers that followed him for three centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich and others have pointed out, the composers of the late 20th and 21st century that have identified with Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their own. Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by Monteverdi's reputation as [...] "a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority" [...] – although the composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, [...] "showing what <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for the purpose". In a letter dated 16 October 1633 Monteverdi appears to endorse the view of himself as a [...] "modern": [...] "I would rather be moderately praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary". However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but {{while at the same time}} protective of his status as a competent composer in the stile antico. Thus, says Chew, [...] "his achievement was both retrospective and progressive". Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing up much of the early Baroque. [...] "And in one respect in particular, his achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music." ...|$|E
500|$|Grant's [...] "immaculate comic performance" [...] (BBC) as the trust-funded womaniser, Will Freeman, in {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel About a Boy received raves from critics. Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) {{was determined by the}} Washington Post to be [...] "that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [...] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs," [...] while Roger Ebert observed that [...] "the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource." [...] Released a day after the blockbuster , About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129million globally. The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2006. [...] "His performance <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> revelatory," [...] wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that [...] "Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness." [...] The New York Observer concluded: [...] " [...] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance." [...] About a Boy also marked a notable change in Grant's boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it [...] "looked good on him." [...] He added that Grant's [...] "pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency." ...|$|E
