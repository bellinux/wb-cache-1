5|$|Outside {{the walls}} skirmishes between the Chinese rebels and the Dutch continued. On 25October, after {{almost two weeks}} of minor skirmishes, 500 armed Chinese {{approached}} Cadouwang (now Angke), but were repelled by cavalry {{under the command of}} Ridmeester Christoffel Moll and Cornets Daniel <b>Chits</b> and Pieter Donker. The following day the cavalry, which consisted of 1,594 Dutch and native forces, marched on the rebel stronghold at the Salapadjang sugar mill, first gathered in the nearby woods and then set the mill on fire while the rebels were inside; another mill at Boedjong Renje was taken in the same manner by another group. Fearful of the oncoming Dutch, the Chinese retreated to a sugar mill in Kampung Melayu, four hours from Salapadjang; this stronghold fell to troops under Captain Jan George Crummel. After defeating the Chinese and retaking Qual, the Dutch returned to Batavia. Meanwhile, the fleeing Chinese, who were blocked to the west by 3,000 troops from the Sultanate of Banten, headed east along the north coast of Java; by 30October it was reported that the Chinese had reached Tangerang.|$|E
5|$|Vocal {{communication}} among superb fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds {{in a social}} group and for advertising and mobbing, or defending a territory. The basic, or Type I, song is a 1–4 second high-pitched reel consisting of 10–20 short elements per second; it is sung by both males and females. Males also possess a peculiar song-like Type II vocalization, which is given {{in response to the}} calls of predatory birds, commonly grey butcherbirds (Cracticus torquatus). The purpose of this behaviour, which does not elicit a response from other nearby wrens, remains unknown. It is not a warning call, but in fact gives away the location of the vocalizing male to the predator. It may serve to announce male fitness, but this is far from certain. Superb fairywrens' alarm call is a series of brief sharp <b>chits,</b> universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators. Females also emit a purr while incubating. The bird appears to also use vocalisations as a password for its chicks to give it a chance to avoid cuckoo parasites.|$|E

500|$|World War I {{broke out}} in 1914. Although Whale had little {{interest}} in the politics behind the war, he realized that conscription was inevitable so he enlisted in the army. Considered because of his age a good candidate for officer training, he joined the Inns of Court Officer Training Corps in October 1915 and was stationed in Bristol. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Worcestershire Regiment in July 1916. He was taken prisoner on the Western Front in Flanders in August 1917 and was held at Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp, where he remained until December 1918. While imprisoned he became actively involved, as an actor, writer, producer and set-designer, in the amateur theatrical productions {{that took place in the}} camp, finding them [...] "a source of great pleasure and amusement". He also developed a talent for poker, and after the war he cashed in the <b>chits</b> and IOUs from his fellow prisoners to serve as a nest egg.|$|E
500|$|When Howard Hughes {{purchased}} {{the hotel in}} the mid-1960s for $14.6 million, the architect Martin Stern, Jr. added a 500-room circular tower, which opened in 1967, and the hotel became a Las Vegas landmark. Hughes grew particularly annoyed every time the Rat Pack were in his hotel, due to a hatred of Frank Sinatra which stemmed {{from the fact that}} he had been in love with Ava Gardner in the 50s and she had run off to marry him. The ill feeling was reciprocated by Sinatra. Hughes plotted to oust Sinatra from the Sands for good, and asked Robert Maheu to draw up a plan shortly after the new hotel opened in 1967. The hotel imposed restrictions on what Sinatra could gamble in the casino, to just $3,000 a night. Under previous management, Sinatra had no limits on the amount of credit extended to him by the Sands casino. [...] His IOUs, <b>chits</b> or [...] "markers" [...] were torn up at the end of Sinatra's engagements because he was considered to be good for business-bringing the hotel more monetary value than the worth of his gambling losses. Hughes put a stop to this system, telling Jack Entratter to inform Sinatra of the new policy; Entratter did not do so because he was afraid.|$|E

40|$|Human chitotriosidase (<b>Chit),</b> a chitinolytic enzyme, is {{a member}} of the {{chitinase}} family. In human plasma, <b>Chit</b> activity has been proposed as a biochemical marker of macrophage activation in several lysosomal diseases. Recently we found that <b>Chit</b> activity is higher in patients affected by Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection, suggesting that <b>Chit</b> may reflect induction of an immunological response. To assess this hypothesis, we evaluated the <b>CHIT</b> 1 mRNA levels in human monocytes/macrophages (HMMs) following treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN&# 978;), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&# 945;), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Stimulation of macrophages with INF-&# 978;, TNF-&# 945;, and LPS resulted in an increase in <b>Chit</b> activity as well as the levels of <b>CHIT</b> 1 mRNA as measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The data presented in this article show that <b>Chit</b> plays a role in the response to the activation of INF-&# 978;-, TNF-&# 945;-, and LPS-driven macrophages, suggesting that the production of <b>Chit</b> by macrophages could have biological relevance in the immune-response...|$|R
