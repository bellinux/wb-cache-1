2500|$|Jolson's {{physical}} expressiveness {{also affected}} the music styles of some black performers. Music historian Bob Gulla writes that [...] "the most critical influence in Jackie Wilson's young life was Al Jolson." [...] He {{points out that}} Wilson's ideas of what a stage performer <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their act an [...] "exciting" [...] and [...] "thrilling performance" [...] was shaped by Jolson's acts, [...] "full of wild writhing and excessive theatrics". Wilson felt that Jolson [...] "should be considered the stylistic forefathers of rock and roll." ...|$|E
60|$|I nodded my head again. It was all I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> myself {{standing}} upright.|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{could answer}} that question. Just {{now they had}} all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> warm.|$|E
5000|$|Russo {{said there}} was nothing WFAN <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him, [...] after Sirius XM {{provided}} him his own channel, hosting American sports talk personalities. [...] Russo's 5-year deal was worth about $3 million per year and Russo runs the channel himself, and hires the on-air staff.|$|R
5000|$|John Yarborough, {{director}} of Lee County Parks and Recreation, met with Jeff Mudgett, a Fort Myers architect who was volunteering {{his time to}} brainstorm ideas on what <b>could</b> be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Red Sox in Fort Myers. [...] "I'd {{like to have a}} project by 2012," [...] Yarborough said after the meeting.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no poor sister--this can {{no longer}} be. Two girls would not be safe here, even should these Hurons fail in getting us into their power. Even father had {{as much as he}} <b>could</b> {{sometimes}} <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> peace upon the lake, and we should fail altogether. We must quit this spot, Hetty, and remove into the settlements." ...|$|R
60|$|So I wilted {{right down}} {{on to the}} planks then, and give up; {{and it was all}} I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> from crying.|$|E
60|$|While it {{was going}} on, we had {{as much as we}} <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the doctor from rushing forward and seizing a partner.|$|E
60|$|It was all I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a {{straight}} face. I'd {{a pretty good}} idea where she 'ad gorn; and it wasn't Dalston.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They're the board's choosing, sir,' {{returned}} the matron. 'The least they <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> would be <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> us pretty warm: for our places are hard enough.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Would it be well if I {{tried to}} help him to recover his idea? or would it be wiser (if I <b>could</b> only <b>do</b> it) <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> silence? ...|$|R
60|$|The storm {{continued}} {{all that}} day, the wind, if anything, increasing in violence. All the boys <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the fire going and make themselves {{as comfortable as}} possible inside the Lodge. They read, wrote letters, and played games, and also tried their hands at more candy-making, and also the baking of some pies and cookies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, Dick has {{the only}} map we possess." [...] And Tom grinned, while Sam had all he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> from {{laughing}} outright.|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{in spite}} of all I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him, he went, muttering: [...] "Strange! Exceeding strange!" [...] and leaving me quite unfit for prayer.|$|E
60|$|Poor Sam {{could not}} speak, for a wave had struck him {{full in the}} mouth, and he had all he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> from being washed overboard.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, {{the newly}} elected Commonwealth Attorney in Harrisonburg, Ms. Marsha Garst, asked Brownlee to review the case. Garst hoped that federal {{authorities}} <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Simmons from being released. After careful study, Brownlee developed a novel legal theory by using the Violence Against Womenâ€™s Act, which had been enacted only 13 days prior to the murders, and federal firearms charges.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I shall, John," [...] said she, smiling. [...] "You {{would hardly}} wish <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> me a prisoner, {{and the worst}} you <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would be <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my luggage from me." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{uncle was}} too busy to devote any time to the dog for the next day or so, and all that <b>could</b> be <b>done</b> was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the animal {{carefully}} confined to the house.|$|R
60|$|It was all I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> awake, but I {{managed to}} do so {{with the aid of}} an early morning paper I bought on the train.|$|E
60|$|By {{the middle}} of the {{afternoon}} it was snowing again and they had all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> to the trail. The old miner shook his head dubiously.|$|E
60|$|Josiah Crabtree {{was running}} {{with all the}} speed of his long legs, and the two lads soon found that they had all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him in sight.|$|E
6000|$|Maxwell found strength, if not heart, {{to speak}} first. [...] "I suppose I am {{to blame for}} not going to Chicago for the rehearsals." [...] Louise {{said she did not}} see what that <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the play from failing, and he {{answered}} that it might have kept Godolphin from losing courage. [...] "You see, he says he had to take the brunt of public opinion alone. He was sore about that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Resigned! What of that? I held my tongue! It was all I <b>could</b> <b>do!</b> I {{never knew}} {{things could be}} worse till I saw it was killing him, and then all I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was still <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> silence.' ...|$|R
50|$|The brigade supports, 21st Londons, and the 20th Londons from divisional reserve, {{were brought}} up and desperate {{attempts}} made to extend the brigade's gains, 'but tremendous losses were suffered by the men crowded in the captured trenches. Nothing <b>could</b> be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> down this enfilading fire, and by the following morning much of the captured trenches had been knocked to bits {{and had to be}} abandoned, but a considerable part of their front line was retained and taken into our own trench system'.|$|R
60|$|The twins cut up so {{that the}} others had all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> from laughing. One boy began to snicker, but {{promptly}} clapped {{his hand over his}} mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't say I pushed you over. It was Toglet, and {{directly}} after you disappeared {{he turned on}} me and I had all I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him at bay." ...|$|E
60|$|The way now {{became so}} rough {{that they had}} all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on the horses, and they {{wondered}} at {{the men in the}} automobile traveling such a road.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} Margaret to consider, and at {{thought of her}} I cursed the Egyptian aloud. What <b>could</b> I <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Gavin and the woman apart? I could tell him the secret of his mother's life. Would that be sufficient? It would if he loved Margaret, as I did not doubt. Pity for her would make him undergo any torture rather than she should suffer again. But to divulge our old {{connection}} would entail her discovery of me. and I questioned if even the saving of Gavin could destroy the bitterness of that.|$|R
60|$|On and on {{went the}} white {{members of the}} party, <b>doing</b> their best <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the sturdy Indian pack-carriers well in sight. But the red people, with their hideously painted faces, knew every foot of the way, and made rapid progress, {{and it was all}} the others <b>could</b> <b>do</b> at times <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up.|$|R
6000|$|... "The court, {{although}} powerful influences were at work, {{found itself}} unable to pronounce the decree which those in authority so much desired. All {{that those who}} were behind the scenes <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the case open, hoping that while living apart from her husband some trifling indiscretion {{on the part of}} Madame would afford them a pretext for giving the desired verdict. I need not say that, up to the present, no such indiscretion has occurred. But {{all the time we have}} been on the brink of a volcano!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Putney laughed. [...] "It was all I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Ellen {{from getting}} up and going out of church too, when Brother Gerrish set the example. She's a Gerrishite at heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My sweetheart, when I saw {{you doing}} that Dream of What's-the-girl's-bally-name dance just now, it was all I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> from rushing out on {{to the floor and}} hugging you.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{boys had}} all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the girls quiet, and Grace {{was on the}} point of {{becoming}} hysterical, which was not to be wondered at, considering the tremendous excitement.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, while Russo left WFAN, Francesa signed a five-year deal {{to stay at}} WFAN and {{continue}} to host the afternoon drive-time show. On August 19, 2008, Russo signed a five-year contract worth about 3 million per year with Sirius XM to headline a new sports talk channel called Mad Dog Radio on both Sirius and XM satellite radio. Russo said there was nothing WFAN <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him [...] after Sirius XM provided him an opportunity <b>to</b> not only <b>do</b> a show, but have his own channel, which he could not pass up.|$|R
60|$|They moved faster; the log {{grinding}} heavily {{across the}} snow behind. Then {{the strain on}} the chain slackened, and he dragged at the bridle {{as he began to}} run. The log could not be stopped now; it was moving faster than he had thought, and all that he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the team in front. His feet slipped on the icy trail, and the horses floundered, but they knew the danger and broke into a clumsy trot. It was hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up, but Festing must hold them to the track and steer them round a bend ahead.|$|R
60|$|So {{they moved}} on again--aimlessly--simply at random--all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> move, <b>keep</b> moving. For a little while, hope {{made a show}} of reviving--not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and {{familiarity}} with failure.|$|R
