2500|$|Chugg {{moved to}} Melbourne in 1967 {{where he worked}} for the Australian Musicians Booking Agency (AMBO), run by Gary Spry, Jeff Joseph and Darryl Sambell. At AMBO he met a 16-yr old, Michael Gudinski, whom Chugg {{described}} as [...] "this young guy there with red hair and a big nose who was booking all these new bands", they became friends, business associates and sometime rivals. In the late 1960s Gudinski, together with Michael Browning, set up the <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Rock</b> Agency, Chugg started working for them.|$|E
50|$|Much of the New England province's bedrock {{aquifers}} are in <b>consolidated</b> <b>rocks</b> of sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic origin. Some {{of these}} aquifers, {{mainly in the}} western portion of Vermont, consist of carbonate rocks (primarily limestone, dolomite, and marble). These <b>consolidated</b> <b>rocks</b> yield water primarily from bedding planes, fractures, joints, and faults, rather than from intergranular pores.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Consolidated</b> <b>rocks</b> (e.g., sandstone, shale, granite or limestone) {{potentially}} {{have more}} complex [...] "dual" [...] porosities, {{as compared with}} alluvial sediment.

The paragneisses have been called Grenville by earlier workers. [ [...] . ...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1974 their fanbase in New Zealand, {{although}} small, {{was extremely}} strong and very dedicated, but the chances of further progress in that small market were obviously limited. In March 1975, the band issued its third single, [...] "No Bother To Me", on the independent White Cloud label, and a few weeks later, Split Enz became {{the latest in a}} string of successful NZ groups and solo artists who moved to Australia to further their career. Although their highly unusual visual presentation and complex music were markedly {{out of step with the}} blues-based [...] "pub rock" [...] that was currently dominating Australian music, and many concert-goers were puzzled by them, the band's powerful performances and the quality of their material impressed and as in New Zealand they soon acquired a small but fiercely loyal fan base. After nine months on the Australian pub and concert circuit they were spotted by Melbourne-based entrepreneur Michael Gudinski, who signed them to his new Mushroom Records label, which was then enjoying unprecedented success with the band Skyhooks, whose 1974 debut album had shot to the top of the charts, spawning a string of hit singles and becoming the highest-selling Australian LP ever released up to that time. Thanks to Gudinksi's associated booking agency (<b>Consolidated</b> <b>Rock)</b> Split Enz were soon touring nationally and gaining valuable exposure playing prestigious support slots for several major international acts including Flo & Eddie, Lou Reed and Roxy Music.|$|E

Their clients included Sherbet. It became a national company when it joined with Phillip Jacobsen's Melbourne-based, Let It Be agency, which handled Daddy Cool and Spectrum. When Davies left in 1975, to continue his career in the United States, Chugg was invited to join Gudinski's Premier Artists agency. At the same time, Chugg was managing acts and working as a freelance tour coordinator with Paul Dainty Corporation. He also spent time overseas, including the United Kingdom, managing Richard Clapton, and Kevin Borich.|$|E

40|$|An {{instrument}} {{designed to}} measure thermal conductivity of <b>consolidated</b> <b>rocks,</b> dry or saturated, using a transient method is presented. The instrument measures relative values of the thermal conductivity, and it needs calibration to obtain absolute values. The device {{can be used as}} heat pulse line source and as continuous heat line source. Two parameters to determine thermal conductivity are proposed: TMAX, in heat pulse line source, and SLOPE, in continuous heat line source. Its performance is better, and the operation simpler, in heat pulse line-source mode with a measuring time of 170 s and a reproducibility better than 2. 5 %. The sample preparation is very simple on both modes. The performance has been tested with a set of ten rocks with thermal conductivity values between 1. 4 and 5. 2 W m¿ 1 K¿ 1 which covers the usual range for <b>consolidated</b> <b>rocks...</b>|$|R

30|$|Most of the {{published}} work {{was concerned with}} coarse unconsolidated material with water as the working fluid. Petroleum reservoirs consist of <b>consolidated</b> <b>rocks.</b> In this study, authors carried out experiments on consolidated porous media with an organic (Soltrol- 130) fluid to match real field reservoir rock/fluid system. Use of consolidated samples also avoids the errors due to solids movement associated with unconsolidated samples. Organic fluid was chosen to observe the pre-Darcy effect without the polar interaction effects associated with aqua based fluids.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{steady-state}} {{techniques are}} useful {{when the temperature}} of the material does not change with time. This makes the signal analysis straightforward (steady state implies constant signals). The disadvantage is that a well-engineered experimental setup is usually needed.

Geological factors that will control the rock physics and seismic properties include clay content, sorting, diagenesis, mineralogy, and bedding configuration. The various geologic factors {{will affect the}} fluid and stress sensitivity in these rocks. We investigate the interrelationships between various geological factors and seismic fluid and stress sensitivity, by combining well log data and rock physics models. Finally, we determine inter-well characteristics in terms of varying geological factors at different locations and discuss the results in terms of expected seismic signatures in the area. </p...|$|R
40|$|The mountainous {{masses of}} Thessaly basin exhibit great hydrogeological {{interest}} {{due to their}} geological structure and their lithological composition. In this paper the hydrogeological characteristics of the <b>consolidated</b> <b>rocks</b> and the water type of their springs are described. According to the lithological type permeable, semi-permeable and impermeable formations occur in the study area. The karstified formations concentrate the greatest hydrogeological interest. Locally ophiolites and strongly tectonized metamorphic formations are also interesting hydrogeological features. With the use of hydrochemical analyses the spring water quality character is described as follows: Ca-HCO 3 for the karst water, Mg-HCO 3 for the ophiolite spring water, Ca-Mg-HCO 3 and Ca-Mg-Na-HCO 3 for the metamorphic formations water...|$|R

5000|$|In 1959 a {{trial court}} held that the city had no {{authority}} to refuse a zoning variance to <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Rock</b> Company to continue operating a gravel pit in the Big Tujunga Wash, An appellate court overturned that decision, but in 1962 the California Supreme Court upheld the right of the city to ban the pit. The decision was a victory for local people who had battled the project for more than three years: They contended that the dust from the existing pit affected the area's reputation as a [...] "haven for asthma sufferers."

50|$|In geology and geophysics, {{the most}} common method for <b>consolidated</b> <b>rock</b> samples is the divided bar. There are various {{modifications}} to these devices depending on the temperatures and pressures needed as well as sample sizes. A sample of unknown conductivity is placed between two samples of known conductivity (usually brass plates). The setup is usually vertical with the hot brass plate at the top, the sample in between then the cold brass plate at the bottom. Heat is supplied {{at the top and}} made to move downwards to stop any convection within the sample. Measurements are taken after the sample has reached to the steady state (with zero heat gradient or constant heat over entire sample), this usually takes about 30 minutes and over.|$|E
40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] human impacts and demands for ocean space increase (fisheries, aquaculture, marine reserves, renewable energy), identification of marine habitats hosting sensitive biological assemblages has become a priority. Epifaunal invertebrates, especially the structure-forming species, are an increasing conservation concern as many traditional (bottom-contact fishing) and novel (marine renewable energy) ocean uses have the potential to displace or otherwise impact these slow-growing organisms. The differences in mega-invertebrate species assemblages between high-relief rocks and low-relief sediments are well documented and likely hold for most marine environments. In anticipation of potential development of marine renewable energy faculties off Oregon and Washington (USA), a survey of the benthic invertebrate assemblages and habitats was conducted on the continental shelf of the Pacific Northwest, using video footage collected by ROV, to more finely characterize these assemblage-habitat associations. Four main associations were found: pure mud/sand dominated by sea whips and burrowing brittle stars; mixed mud-rock (which may be further divided based on size of mixed-in rocks) characterized by various taxa at small densities; <b>consolidated</b> <b>rocks</b> characterized by high diversity and density of sessile or motile mega-invertebrates; and rubble rocks showing less diversity and density than the <b>consolidated</b> <b>rocks,</b> possibly due to the disturbance generated by movement of the unconsolidated rocks. The results of this study will help classify and map the seafloor in a way that represents benthic habitats reflective of biological species assemblage distributions, rather than solely geological features, and support conservation and management planning...|$|R
30|$|In general, for {{upstream}} reservoir modeling processes, reservoir geomechanical {{properties are}} determined either by (1) analysis of seismic data (S-wave and P-wave velocities) or (2) by laboratory measurement of core plugs or (3) {{a combination of}} both techniques. These are conventional laboratory methods which may not be representative of the entire elastic regime existing in the reservoir as in most cases these small samples are taken from <b>consolidated</b> <b>rocks</b> and used to measure geomechanical properties. Furthermore, these measurements are performed on a well-by-well basis on core samples. Measurements taken at the core samples are often used in geomechanical analysis as calibration points to convert the 3 D seismic data (if available) to 3 D volumes of geomechanical properties.|$|R

50|$|Thermal inertia {{values for}} most of the Martian surface are {{inversely}} related to albedo. Thus, high albedo areas have low thermal inertias indicating surfaces that are covered with dust and other fine granular material. The dark gray, low albedo surfaces have high thermal inertias more typical of <b>consolidated</b> <b>rock.</b> However, thermal inertia values are not high enough to indicate widespread outcroppings are common on Mars. Even the rockier areas appear to be mixed with a significant amount of loose material. Data from the Infrared Thermal Mapping (IRTM) experiment on the Viking orbiters identified areas of high thermal inertia throughout the interior of Valles Marineris and the chaotic terrain, suggesting that these areas contain a relatively large number of blocks and boulders.|$|E
