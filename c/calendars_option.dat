40|$|The {{onset of}} rains during dry to wet {{transition}} fallow periods in rice-wheat production systems in Nepal cause substantial losses of soil nitrogen {{if the system}} is improperly managed. To make use of available nutrients and water, this transition period can either be shortened by early rice planting, or be extended by late planting, allowing a third crop to be grown. Shifting planting dates would require rice genotypes adapted to the different environments. Crop duration is influenced by both vegetative and reproductive development, {{which in turn is}} influenced by the photo-thermal environment and genotypic responses to it. An experiment was conducted to derive genotypic photo-thermal constants from phenological observations on diverse rice cultivars, which were then applied to the concept of the phenological model RIDEV to design cropping <b>calendar</b> <b>options.</b> Environmental effects on variation of crop duration were determined by planting at different dates. The risk of yield losses to sterility caused by low temperatures was estimated by simulation. Thirty-one different genotypes of rice were planted at 8 dates in 15 -day intervals starting 27 April 2004 at the experimental field of the Regional Agriculture Research Station, Lumle, Nepal. The shortest duration to flowering was observed for planting dates in late May and early June. Simulation of flowering dates with RIDEV yielded correct results only for the early planting dates. For later planting dates simulated flowering dates showed an increasing deviation from the observed. In most cultivars, minimum air temperature below 18 ?C during booting to heading stages caused near-total spikelet sterility and a specific delay in flowering. However, the chilling tolerant cultivars Chomrong and Machhapuchre- 3 cultivated at high altitude showed less than 30 % spikelet sterility even at 15 ?C. Simulating crop durations with the derived thermal constants allowed evaluating the different <b>calendar</b> <b>options</b> for high altitude systems. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This paper {{reviews the}} {{existing}} research and {{literature on the}} school calendar - its history, purpose, contemporary issues, and potential alternatives - and analyzes the feasibility of altering the calendar model as an educational reform. In the first chapter, it addresses the formation and endurance of the standard school calendar, looking specifically at the intentions behind its origins. It also offers examples of the occasional attempts at modifying that calendar throughout the decades. The second chapter examines the contemporary research {{on the effects of}} summer vacation on learning rates, the role of time in schools, and international comparisons of time use. The third chapter offers an explanation of alternative calendar models, such as year-round education (YRE) and extended year systems (EY), along with a literature review of the effectiveness of the various calendars. The fourth chapter attempts a policy analysis of the three <b>calendar</b> <b>options</b> - maintaining the traditional calendar, extended year calendars, and redesigned calendars - including a discussion of their marginal benefits and deficiencies, and their political feasibility. The conclusion of the paper attempt to contextualize these four aspects - the origins of the school calendar, the contemporary research on its effects, alternative models, and the effects and potential the various models - and balance those aspects (Green, 1994) in terms of public versus private good (Labaree, 1997).

40|$|One {{distinguishable}} {{feature of}} storable commodities {{is that they}} relate to two markets: cash market and storage market. This paper proves that, if no arbitrage exists in the storage-cash dual markets, the commodity convenience yield has to be non-negative. However, classical reduced-form models for futures term structures could allow serious arbitrages due to the high volatility of the convenience yield. To avoid negative convenience yield, this paper proposes a semi-affine arbitrage-free model, which prices futures analytically and fits futures term structures reasonably well.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to compare the opinions of superintendents and their perceptions of community attitudes in Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s K- 12 school districts concerning procedural changes designed to conserve energy and to relate selected variables to the assessment values. ^ On the basis of the literature review, a questionnaire was developed. Participants were superintendents in Nebraska school districts who were asked to identify their own attitudes and also to estimate community attitudes toward selected procedural changes. Data were analyzed primarily through crosstabulation procedures. ^ Findings from the literature review suggested that communities objected less to operational changes than school administrators; energy conservation through mid-winter school closing found widest acceptance among administrators. ^ Data from the study indicated that there was little support for the suggested procedural changes. Conclusions from the study were as follows: (1) Superintendents believed that communities were very concerned about energy costs but were reluctant to individually provide transportation for after-school activities. (2) Superintendents from school districts with fewer than 500 students were more inclined to accept the four-day week than superintendents from schools with higher enrollments. (3) Superintendents felt that the community would prefer a seasonal adjustment in the start of the school day rather than other alternatives, whereas the superintendents accorded this <b>calendar</b> <b>option</b> only a fourth place ranking. (4) Superintendents favored the mid-winter closing; their second choice was the calendar with the four- or five-day school week dependent on the season of the year. (5) Superintendents believed that nearly 21 percent of the community or parents supporting after-school activities would be willing to provide after-school transportation in order to conserve energy. (6) Superintendents who agreed that a change in the existing school calendar would lead to a reduction in energy consumption preferred the mid-winter closing; their second choice was the seasonal change in the start of the school day. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a multi-factor stochastic volatility model {{based on the}} CIR/Heston volatility process that incorporates seasonality and the Samuelson effect. First, we give conditions on the seasonal term under which the corresponding volatility factor is well-defined. These conditions appear to be rather mild.

Finally, we provide numerical illustrations in terms of implied volatility and correlation produced by the proposed model with five different specifications of the seasonality pattern.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a multi-factor stochastic volatility model {{based on the}} CIR/Heston stochastic volatility process. In order to capture the Samuelson effect displayed by commodity futures contracts, we add expiry-dependent exponential damping factors to their volatility coefficients. The pricing of single underlying European options on futures contracts is straightforward and can incorporate the volatility smile or skew observed in the market. We calculate the joint characteristic function of two futures contracts in the model in analytic form and use the one-dimensional Fourier inversion method of Caldana and Fusai (JBF 2013) to price <b>calendar</b> spread <b>options.</b> The model leads to stochastic correlation between the returns of two futures contracts. We illustrate the distribution of this correlation in an example. We then propose analytical expressions to obtain the copula and copula density directly from the joint characteristic function {{of a pair of}} futures. These expressions are convenient to analyze the term-structure of dependence between the two futures produced by the model. In an empirical application we calibrate the proposed model to volatility surfaces of vanilla options on WTI. In this application we provide evidence that the model is able to produce the desired stylized facts in terms of volatility and dependence. In a separate appendix, we give guidance for the implementation of the proposed model and the Fourier inversion results by means of one and two-dimensional FFT methods.

Major new features in the VIC 5 series, compared to VIC 4 "vic_run" (GH# 7) Although the physics and model behavior of VIC 5. 0. 0 should be nearly identical to VIC 4. 2, the source code has undergone a major cleanup and reorganization. We have separated the physical core ("vic_run") from the driver source code. This work has improved the extensibility and readability of the model. Classic Driver (GH# 7) The Classic Driver provides similar functionality as VIC 4, including ASCII and binary I/O, and a time-before-space evaluation loop order. The Classic Driver is maintained for two main reasons: to provide some level of backward compatibility for existing VIC users that wish to continue using VIC using a traditional approach, and, to allow VIC to be run at individual grid cells, without requiring the infrastructure needed by the Image Driver. Documentation for the Classic Driver can be found here. Image Driver (GH# 7) The Image Driver adds a number of features to the user interface of the VIC model. Most notably, it uses a space-before-time evaluation loop order, netCDF I/O, and parallelization using MPI. Image Driver specific documentation can be found here. Constants File (GH# 192) Earlier versions of VIC included many hard-coded parameters and constants. We have consolidated these constants into a single structure and developed an input file that allows users to modify parameters at run-time. See here for more information. Logging (GH# 173) A set of logging Macros {{have been added to}} all drivers and vic_run. The logging level can be set in the driver Makefile via the LOG_LVL variable. The logging Macros provide the filename and line number in the source code to aid in debugging. Additionally, when compiler support is available, a traceback is printed when VIC exits during runtime. When the LOG_DIR variable is provided in the global parameter file, VIC will write its log(s) to log files instead of printing to stdout. Sub-hourly Timestep (GH# 188) Previous versions of VIC were limited to a minimum timestep of one hour. The units of the VIC timestep have been changed from hours to seconds and the minimum timestep is now one second. If you intend on running VIC at a timestep less that one hour, we suggest significant testing. Calendar Support (GH# 188) Earlier versions of VIC used the standard Gregorian calendar.

A small subset of the test platform is run on Travis-CI, which facilitates continuous integration of the VIC test platform. More information on the test platform is here. 	 	 	Run-time profiling and timing (GH# 442) 	A timing module has been added to VIC in order to assess the computational cost and throughput of the VIC model. New output variables (OUT_TIME_VICRUN_WALL and OUT_TIME_VICRUN_CPU) document the time spent in vic_run for each variable. Additionally, a timing table is printed to LOG_DEST {{at the end of each}} simulation. 	 Backwards Incompatible Changes: 	 	Classic Driver I/O Formatting (GH# 18, GH# 204, GH# 227) 	The format of ASCII forcing and output files has changed in VIC 5. These changes were motivated by the desire to improve simulation metadata tracking and reproducibility of VIC simulations. 	 		Output files now include a header with simulation metadata and variable names. The PRT_HEADER option has been deprecated. 	 	 	 	Classic Driver Global Parameter Options 	A number of global parameter options have changed for the Classic Driver, relative to VIC 4. 	 		TIME_STEP (int, units: hours) has been changed to MODEL_STEPS_PER_DAY (int) 		SNOW_STEP (int, units: hours) has been changed to SNOW_STEPS_PER_DAY (int) 		OUT_DT (int, units: hours) has been changed to OUTPUT_STEPS_PER_DAY (int) 		FORCE_DT (int, units: hours) has been changed to FORCE_STEPS_PER_DAY (int) 		BINARY_STATE_FILE (TRUE or FALSE) has been changed to STATE_FORMAT (BINARY or ASCII) 		BINARY_OUTPUT (TRUE or FALSE) has been changed to OUT_FORMAT (BINARY or ASCII) 	 	 	 	State files now include seconds (GH# 464) 	 		There is a new global parameter option, STATESEC. This specifies the time step at the end of which state will be saved, in units of seconds. In other words, if you have an hourly time step (3600 sec) and you want to save state at the end of the final time step of the day (which is 86400 seconds long), subtract 3600 from 86400 to get a STATESEC of 82800. This corresponds to the first second of the final time step. State will be saved at the end of that time step. 		When the state save date is appended to state filenames, STATESEC will be included so that the date will have the format YYYYMMDD_SSSSS. 	 	 	 	Classic Driver Output Variables (GH# 352) 	Computation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) has been simplified, reducing the number of output variables from 6 to 1. The following output variables have been removed: 	 		OUT_PET_SATSOIL (potential evapotranspiration from saturated bare soil) 		OUT_PET_H 2 OSURF (potential evapotranspiration from open water) 		OUT_PET_SHORT (potential evapotranspiration (transpiration only) from short reference crop (grass)) 		OUT_PET_TALL (potential evapotranspiration (transpiration only) from tall reference crop (alfalfa)) 		OUT_PET_NATVEG (potential evapotranspiration (transpiration only) from current vegetation and current canopy resistance) 		OUT_PET_VEGNOCR (potential evapotranspiration (transpiration only) from current vegetation and 0 canopy resistance) 	 	These have been replaced by: 	 		OUT_PET (potential evapotranspiration, which = area-weighted sum of potential transpiration and potential soil evaporation; potential transpiration is computed using the Penman-Monteith equation with architectural resistance and LAI of the current veg cover) 	 	 Deprecated Features: 	Removed unused global parameter option MEASURE_H (GH# 284) 	 	Removed MTCLIM (GH# 288) 	Previous versions of VIC used MTCLIM to generate missing forcing variables required to run VIC. This led to confusion by many users and considerably more complex code in the Classic Driver. VIC forcings are now required to be provided at the same time frequency as the model will be run at (SNOW_STEPS_PER_DAY). 	As part of this change, the following options have been removed from the Classic Driver: 	 		LW_TYPE 		LW_CLOUD 		MTCLIM_SWE_CORR 		VP_INTERP 		VP_ITER 		OUTPUT_FORCE 	 	As part of this change, the following output variables have been removed from the Classic Driver: 	 		OUT_COSZEN 		OUT_TSKC 	 	In the future, we would like to provide a stand-alone version of MTCLIM that produces subdaily meteorological forcings. We are looking for community support for this feature (GH# 17) 	 	 	Removed LONGWAVE and SHORTWAVE forcing types (GH# 379). 	Previous versions of VIC allowed users to specify either LONGWAVE or LWDOWN to denote the incoming longwave radiation flux and SHORTWAVE or SWDOWN to denote the incoming shortwave radiation flux. We have removed these duplicate options, standardizing on the more descriptive LWDOWN and SWDOWN. 	Similarly, output variables OUT_NET_LONG and OUT_NET_SHORT have been replaced with OUT_LWNET and OUT_SWNET, respectively. 	 	 	Changed the name of the variable VEGCOVER to FCANOPY, since this more accurately captures the meaning of the term (i. e., the fractional area of the plant canopy within the veg tile). Similarly changed OUT_VEGCOVER to OUT_FCANOPY. 	Similarly, changed the names of the following global parameter file options: 	 		VEGLIB_VEGCOVER [...] > VEGLIB_FCAN 		VEGPARAM_VEGCOVER [...] > VEGPARAM_FCAN 		VEGCOVER_SRC [...] > FCAN_SRC 	 	 Bug Fixes: 	 	Miscellaneous fixes to lake module (GH# 425) 	Several lake processes (aerodynamic resistance, albedo, latent/sensible heat fluxes, net radiation, etc) were reported incorrectly or not at all in output files. This has been fixed. In addition, in the absence of an initial state file, lake temperatures were initialized to unrealistic temperatures (the air temperature of the first simulation time step). To fix this, we now initialize the lake temperature to annual average soil temperature. 	 	 	Fix for computation of soil layer temperatures when soil thermal nodes do not reach the bottom of the soil column. (GH# 467) 	Previously, if the soil thermal damping depth was shallower than the bottom of the deepest soil layer, and FROZEN_SOIL==TRUE, VIC would abort when estimating layer ice contents because it could not estimate a layer temperature if the thermal nodes did not completely span the layer. Now, a layer temperature is estimated even when thermal nodes do not completely span the layer, and the error no longer occurs. 	 	 	Fix related to exact restart (GH# 481, GH# 507, GH# 509) 	Previously, VIC did not produce the same results (fluxes and states) if a simulation was separated into multiple shorter-period runs by saving the state variables and restarting. This was due to: 	 		 		The MTCLIM algorithm resulted in slightly different sub-daily meteorological variable values for different lengths of forcings (MTCLIM is deprecated in the current version) 		 		 		A few bugs resulting in inexact restart. The following bugs have been fixed: 		 			The prognostic state variable energy. Tfoliage (foliage temperature) is now saved to the state file 			 			Two flux variables energy. LongUnderOut and energy. snow_flux are now saved to the state file. 			!!!Note This is a temporary solution to ensure exact restart.

40|$|A typical {{natural gas}} {{derivatives}} book within an energy trading business, bank, or even large utility will generally {{be exposed to}} two broad categories of market risk. The first being outright price volatility, where contracts such as caps/floors, options and swing, will have a non-linear exposure to the variability of the gas price level. The second, although equally as prominent, is time-spread volatility where gas storage, take-or-pay contracts, and <b>calendar</b> spread <b>options</b> will {{be exposed to the}} realized variability of different time-spreads. Developing a market consistent valuation framework capable of capturing both risk exposures, and thus allowing for risk diversification within a natural gas trading book, is the primary goal of this thesis. To accomplish this, we present a valuation methodology which is capable of pricing the two most actively traded natural gas derivative contracts, namely monthly options and storage, in a consistent manner. The valuation of the former is of course trivial as the prices are set by the market, therefore the primary focus of this thesis is in obtaining market-based pricing measures for the purpose of storage valuation. A consistent pricing and risk management framework will, by definition, accurately reflect the cost of hedging both outright and spread volatility and thus our work {{can be viewed as a}} basis capable of incorporating the other less actively traded contracts listed above. Further, we develop a methodology for estimating the model risk for general energy derivative pricing models. Such an analysis is a necessary pre-requisite to a model being used to manage the risk associated with a derivatives business. We begin by introducing the modeling framework and valuation methodology used throughout this thesis. Whilst there is general agreement on the main drivers of storage value, namely the volatility and correlation of the forward curve, there is no industry standard approach to price modeling. Models proposed in the literature to date focus heavily on replicating the statistical properties of the gas price and fail to address both the desire of storage traders to monetize their gamma exposure through hedging in the vanilla options market and also the constraint that they mark these products to observable volatilities. The primary goal of this work is to demonstrate how one can attain general consistency with the natural gas options market using Lévy-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes rather than traditional Gaussian models, and also analyze the impact of model choice on storage value. We provide a forward curve consistent Fourier-based pricing and calibration tool-kit which relies only upon knowledge of the conditional characteristic function of the underlying Lévy driven OU-process. Analytical solutions for such characteristic functions are generally not known and to date the only non-trivial example in the literature is the jump diffusion of Deng (2000). We derive a solution for the mean-reverting Variance Gamma process and demonstrate its effectiveness in both modeling the implied volatility smile and term structure present in the natural gas options market. One of the main benefits of choosing this process as the source of randomness in our modeling framework is parsimony. The model contains just a single parameter more than the more common mean-reverting diffusion model, and this parameter is entirely responsible for matching the implied volatility smile. We next move on to extending these results to a multidimensional setting in order to further capture the rich dynamics of the underlying forward curve whilst still maintaining consistency with the options market. The proposed framework is thus a specific case of the general Cheyette, Cheyette (2001), model class uniquely specified to meet the needs of a storage trader. Whereas the single factor modelling framework relies entirely upon the implied volatility surface to determine the level of extrinsic value accruing to a storage position, this more general family of models allows one to utilize other sources of information to estimate the value. We demonstrate how a traditional PCA based analysis can be used in informing model specification and provide several examples of such. We extend the Fourier based pricing and calibration methods developed for the single factor models to a multidimensional setting, and for the latter derive an efficient implied moment based calibration routine which is independent of the number of factors in the underlying model. We go on to provide numerical examples of storage valuations under a range of multifactor model specifications and also, analysis on how the model implied forward curve dynamics impact the value of storage. We finish by providing a storage model risk framework, with an emphasis on parameter risk, which will aid in analyzing the risk inherent in adopting this innovative market consistent modeling framework. The proposed approach extends the current model risk literature by providing a methodology for incorporating both market based model calibration and statistical parameter estimation in a consistent manner. The potential benefit of such a framework will impact equally trading, risk and regulatory stakeholders within a storage business, from model validation through to deriving appropriate bid-offer levels. We provide detailed numerical examples, based upon the models specified previously, demonstrating how model prices can be adjusted to incorporate model risk and also how different models can be ranked depending upon the model risk implicit in their estimation...|$|R
