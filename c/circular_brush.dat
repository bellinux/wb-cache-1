60|$|Generative System.--The penis (Pl. IV, fig. 9 a) is very {{singular}} in structure; {{it is of}} {{the ordinary}} length, but of small diameter; it tapers but little; it consists of a moveable articulated, and a fixed unarticulated portion; this latter is smooth, much flattened, not divided into segments, and projects straight out under the caudal appendages; it is about {{one third of the}} length of the entire penis; it corresponds with a part present in all Cirripedes, but here surprisingly elongated. The articulated portion consists of separate segments, twenty in number, quite as distinct as those of the cirri; each one is oblong, being longer by about a third part than broad; each has a few short bristles round its upper margin; the terminal segment has a <b>circular</b> <b>brush</b> of bristles. The vesiculæ seminales are easily seen, though they are narrow; they are slightly tortuous; they enter the prosoma, and lie {{on each side of the}} stomach; their outer case has a ringed structure, but is not fibrous; the contents in the best specimen consisted of a mass of spermatozoa, which I saw with perfect distinctness. The testes are unusually large and egg-shaped.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this work}} we present basic {{methodology}} for interactive volume editing on GPUs, and we demonstrate {{the use of}} these methods to achieve a number of different effects. We present fast techniques to modify the appearance and structure of volumetric scalar fields given on Cartesian grids. Similar to 2 D <b>circular</b> <b>brushes</b> as used in surface painting we present 3 D spherical brushes for intuitive coloring of particular structures in such fields. This paint metaphor is extended to allow the user to change the data itself, and the use of this functionality for interactive structure isolation, hole filling, and artefact removal is demonstrated. Building on previous work in the field we introduce high-resolution selection volumes, which {{can be seen as a}} resolution-based focus+context metaphor. By utilizing such volumes we present a novel approach to interactive volume editing at sub-voxel accuracy. Finally, we introduce a fast technique to paste textures onto iso-surfaces in a 3 D scalar field. Since the texture resolution is independent of the volume resolution, this technique allows structure-aligned textures containing appearance properties or textual information to be used for volume augmentation and annotation. Index Terms—Volume editing, GPU, painting, carving, annotations. ...|$|R

For these cases, some programs allow an object to be selected by color/outline so other areas are not affected. Other programs allow edge/color sensitive brushes to deal with such objects.|$|E

Basic elements of superflywheels are thin rods assembled in pregrooved hub lamina {{so that they}} fan out in radial orientation. Adjacent layers of hub lamina are assembled 90 degree in rotation to each other so as to form a <b>circular</b> <b>brush</b> configuration. Thus stress concentrations and rod failure are minimized and realistic failure containment for a high performance flywheel is obtained...|$|E

Turbine-and-brush assembly inserted in pipe with cable trailing upstream and brush facing downstream. Water or cleaning solution pumped through pipe. Cable held at upstream end, so it holds turbine and brush in pipe at location to be cleaned. Flow in pipe turns turbine, which turns wheel, producing desired cleaning action. In addition to brushing action, device provides even mixing of cleaning solution in pipe...|$|E
50|$|As the {{geometry}} of the brush is also distorted from circular by the accelerator bar, the contact angle of the bristle tips with the surface is also nearer to perpendicular than the tangential contact of the <b>circular</b> rotary <b>brush.</b> This encourages a cleaning action and reduces the burnishing action {{that can be a}} problem with rotary brushes, where a surface is increasingly polished, but not truly cleaned of surface adherrents. The steeper action of the tips encourages a pitting effect on the surface, which may be considered useful for further painting.|$|R
40|$|Objectives The aims of {{this study}} were firstly to {{describe}} the dental history and oral hygiene practises in a cluster random sample of 14 -year-old children in Birmingham, UK. The second aim was to determine whether the oral hygiene practises are associated with dental erosion. Method A total of 418, 14 -year-old schoolchildren from a cluster random sample in Birmingham, UK were assessed for dental erosion (209 males and 209 females). Data on the dental history and oral hygiene practises were obtained from a self-reported questionnaire supplemented by a structured interview. The data were analysed using SPSS with Mann-Whitney U analyses and odds ratios. Results 74 % of the teenagers claimed to attend the dentist on a six-monthly basis; 60 % brushed their teeth twice a day ie before breakfast and last thing at night, 25 % once a day, 12 % three times or more a day and 3 % less than once a day. It was also found that 28 % of the children brushed their teeth after meals; 92 % of the children used a manual toothbrush and 56 % of them replaced their toothbrush every three-months. The most common technique used by the children was a <b>circular</b> <b>brushing</b> movement; 44 % of them used a mouthwash and 40 % used other interdental cleaning. Girls brushed their teeth more frequently than boys. Associations were found between dental erosion and brushing teeth last thing at night, after meals, techniques of brushing teeth, and type of toothbrush and frequency of brushing. Conclusion It was concluded that reported oral hygiene practises in teenage schoolchildren in Birmingham, UK complied with generally recommended guidelines. However, there was an association between dental erosion and some of these oral hygiene practises. Advice concerning the impact of some oral hygiene procedures needs to be given to those who are susceptible to dental erosion. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Brushing {{tools are}} widely used in {{numerous}} surface finishing applications such as deburring, polishing and surface cleaning operations. Previous research has examined the filament forces, stresses and deformation which are associated with slowly-rotating <b>circular</b> <b>brushes</b> (i. e., quasi-static brushing conditions). In order to develop an improved understanding of the actual machining force generated during the brushing process, dynamic properties of the filament must be examined. In this research, an idealized discrete system is utilized to model dynamic properties of the filament. Governing equations of the system are formulated {{on the basis of}} an Euler-Lagrange approach in conjunction with the appropriate geometric constraints. This formulation is shown to automatically yield Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAE) of index-three, and such system of equations generally require sophisticated solution strategies. Initial velocity of the filament after sudden impact/contact with a flat, rigid workpart is computed by employing an inelastic impact mechanics analysis. A modified constraint method is proposed in order to transform the relationship between workpart forces into a constraint equation, leading to a matrix with banded-symmetric form. The index-three system of equations is reduced to an index-two system which is ultimately solved by employing a predictor-corrector iteration with constant step-size Backward Difference Formula (BDF). Overall brush response is calculated by a superposition of the response of all filaments which are in contact with the workpart surface. Numerical results are compared with existing solutions of (1) large deformation of a cantilever beam, (2) damped and undamped free vibration of a cantilever beam, and (3) quasi-static brush/workpart contact problem. A thorough parametric study is reported in order to reveal the effects of both design and operational parameters on the filament and overall brush responses. In addition, numerical results are compared with experimentally obtained data for an actual brush...|$|R
40|$|Brush seals have {{established}} a niche in the gas-to-gas sealing against leakage in modern turbine engines. The variable nature of the brush during operation makes leakage prediction difficult. A simple semi-empirical model based on an effective brush thickness parameter has been successfully used to correlate and predict brush seal leakage in engine environments. The model was extended to correlate a range of brush densities using a physically realistic brush thickness. Later, the model was based on mean diametric brush properties for a large range of <b>circular</b> <b>brush</b> seal geometries. However, the best basis for modeling bristle distribution was unknown. This paper proposes {{a solution to the}} distribution problem by assuming a randomly distributed bristle bed. A random distribution leads to a rectangular array model that is supported by the quality of leakage data generalization. Applying the resultant effective thickness parameter to predict brush seal performance in turbine engines is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{met them}} in a {{sheltered}} place, these visitors from far away. They were unsure {{what to do with}} our outstretched arms and had no replies to our greetings. Wordlessly, they unravelled from their packs tools of wood and metal, musical instruments as it turned out, and began to assemble them - tiny tubes with switches, a disc with a <b>circular</b> <b>brush,</b> a sea shell with a row of mouthpieces, and a patchwork quilt of shakers, I believe. Once fully rigged, the contraptions were hoisted onto their shoulders and they began to play. As they made their sounds, they rocked back and forth and their eyes begged us for appreciation. At the time, we took this gentle cacophony to be their music though later deduced that it was the gift of a parody of our own. Yet how insensitive to pitch they surely are for these simple melodies to seem like ours? Why cloud the texture with such relentless rattling? And what a confusing current must their experience of time be to replace the God-given steadiness of breath and pulse with mere ebb and flow, as if rhythm were for sounding longing rather than the swing of a limb...|$|E
40|$|Assemblies are {{disclosed}} for cleaning the inside walls of pipes and tubes. A first embodiment includes a small turbine with angled blades axially mounted {{on one end}} of a standoff support. An O-ring for stabilizing the assembly within the pipe is mounted in a groove within the outer ring. A replaceable <b>circular</b> <b>brush</b> is fixedly mounted on {{the opposite end of the}} standoff support and can be used for cleaning tubes and pipes of various diameters, lengths and configurations. The turbine, standoff support, and brush spin in unison relative to a hub bearing that is fixedly attached to a wire upstream of the assembly. The nonrotating wire is for retaining the assembly in tension and enabling return of the assembly to the pipe entrance. The assembly is initially placed in the pipe or tube to be cleaned. A pressurized water or solution source is provided at a required flow-rate to propel the assembly through the pipe or tube. The upstream water pressure propels and spins the turbine, standoff support and brush. The rotating brush combined with the solution cleans the inside of the pipe. The solution flows out of the other end of the pipe with the brush rotation controlled by the flow-rate. A second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment but instead includes a circular shaped brush with ring backing mounted in the groove of the exterior ring of the turbine, and also reduces the size of the standoff support or eliminates the standoff support...|$|E

It is seven feet high at the center and approximately eight feet in diameter. To build it, long fresh poles of oak or willow are driven into the ground or placed in holes made with a digging stick. These poles, which form the framework, are arranged at one-foot intervals and are bound together at the top with yucca-leaf strands. Over them a thatching of bundles of big bluestem grass or bear grass is tied, shingle style, with yucca strings. A smoke hole opens above a central fireplace. A hide, suspended at the entrance, is fixed on a cross-beam so {{that it may be}} swung forward or backward. The doorway may face in any direction. For waterproofing, pieces of hide are thrown over the outer hatching, and in rainy weather, if a fire is not needed, even the smoke hole is covered. In warm, dry weather much of the outer roofing is stripped off. It takes approximately three days to erect a sturdy dwelling of this type.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{visualize}} and characterize the complex flow fields in simulated brush seals is presented. The brush seal configuration was {{tested in a}} water and then in an oil tunnel. The visualization procedure revealed typical regions that are rivering, jetting, vortical or lateral flows and exist upstream, downstream or within the seal. Such flows are engendered by variations in fiber void that are spatial and temporal and affect changes in seal leakage and stability. While the effects of interface motion for linear or cylindrical configurations have not been considered herein, {{it is believed that}} the observed flow fields characterize flow phenomenology in both <b>circular</b> and linear <b>brush</b> seals. The axial pressure profiles upstream, across and downstream of the brush in the oil tunnel have been measured under a variety of inlet pressure conditions and the ensuing pressure maps are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fibers can {{be readily}} {{fabricated}} {{into a variety of}} seal configurations that are compliant and responsive to high speed or lightly loaded systems. A linear, <b>circular,</b> or contoured <b>brush</b> seal system is a contact seal consisting of the bristle pattern and hardened interface. When compared to a labyrinth seal, the brush seal system is superior and features low leakage, dynamic stability, and permits compliant structures. But in turn, the system usually requires a hardened smooth interface and permits only limited pressure drops. Wear life and wear debris for operations with static or dynamic excitation are largely undetermined. A seal system involves control of fluid within specific boundaries. The brush and rub ring (or rub surface) form a seal system. Design similitudes, a bulk flow model, and rub ring (interface) coatings are discussed. The bulk flow model calculations are based on flows in porous media and filters. The coatings work is based on experience and expanded to include current practice...|$|R
