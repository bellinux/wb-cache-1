5|$|To {{the south}} of the church there are the {{remnants}} of a stone preaching cross. The cross was originally situated on Poulton's boundary and marked a resting place for mourners travelling long distances to bury corpses at St Chad's. Only the two circular steps into which the original structure was set remain; the <b>cross</b> <b>shaft</b> has been replaced by an octagonal pillar. The pillar was used as a sundial until the early 20th century when the gnomon was stolen. The steps function as a memorial for present-day mourners at St Chad's, in a small garden of remembrance. The churchyard is noted locally for its display of crocuses and other flowering bulbs in early springtime.|$|E
5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes {{in the top of the}} stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon <b>cross</b> <b>shaft.</b> A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing of}} the {{original}} church—built {{on the site of}} a wooden Saxon church—remains, apart from unique examples of Celtic stonework, including a plait interweave and a bas-relief of the Virgin and Child, which was carved around 1000 AD. The current building still has a quoin, which was probably a re-cycled Anglo-Saxon <b>cross</b> <b>shaft.</b> The stone southern entrance to the church still stands; it was built in the 12th century and is a typical example of Norman stonework. The church was re-consecrated in 1287 by the bishop of Candida Casa under the direction of John le Romeyn, Archbishop of York. The tall windows set in the church wall both north and south of the nave can be dated to approximately 1320 to 1330, and in the top sections of two of the windows, small fragments of medieval glass can be found. A sideways orientated tombstone can be found under a low arch {{on the inside of the}} southern wall, generally believed to be that of Sir Richard Pickering (d. 1441), a member of the Pickering family who ruled the village of Oswaldkirk from the 14th century into the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|Meigle 1 is a cross-slab. The {{stone was}} {{originally}} {{used as a}} standing stone two millennia before it was sculpted by the Picts, it has cup and ring marks low down {{on the back of}} the stone. The cross is Greek in style, with full circles at each of the four andles between the shaft and the arms. The inside of the cross is decorated with interlace patterns, the cross-point being decorated with spirals. The <b>cross</b> <b>shaft</b> itself is flanked by images of mythical beasts. It has an uncoordinated jumble of symbols arranged around a hunting scene on the other side. Among these are images of a winged figure that perhaps represents a Persian deity and of a kneeling camel, as well as a Pictish Beast, salmon, a serpent and Z-rod, a mirror, a comb, a dog's head, animals and horsemen. This stone originally stood on the west side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 2. Meigle 1 may be the oldest stone at Meigle, possibly carved in the late 8th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in limestone rubble, with some ironstone banding, and ashlar dressings. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave with a clerestory and north and south aisles, a chancel, and a west tower. The tower dates from the 12thcentury and is in three stages. Its parapet is embattled, and has pinnacles and gargoyles at the corners. Pieces of stone decorated with chevrons have been incorporated {{in the fabric of}} the tower. In the top stage are paired bell openings on the north, west and south sides. In the middle stage is a round-headed window on the south side, and a lancet window on the west. A large vertical stone, possibly a former <b>cross</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{has been used as a}} quoin in the northwest corner of the nave. In the west wall of the north aisle is a small 12th-century round-headed window. Its north wall contains a blocked doorway and two 13th-century lancet windows; there is another lancet window in the east wall. In the north wall of the chancel is a blocked doorway which formerly led to a north chapel. The east wall contains a 19th-century two-light window, and outside the east wall are the foundations of a former apse. In the south wall of the chancel is a 14th-century two-light window with a cinquefoil above it. The south aisle has two-light windows with ogee heads in its east and south walls. The south doorway has a pointed arch. In both the north and south sides of the clerestory are two windows with paired lights.|$|E

2500|$|The west {{face of the}} <b>cross</b> <b>shaft</b> {{depicts the}} {{presentation}} of the John the Baptist in the Temple. The central figure holds a child in their arms and is accompanied by a figure either side. Above this carving is the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist with the River Jordan [...] flowing between their feet. The East face of the <b>cross</b> <b>shaft</b> depicts Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden together with a tree and serpent who is looking at one of the figures. The accompanying socketed base of red sandstone in which the shaft rests measures 90 x 88cm at ground level and 62cm in height. There is conjecture that the [...] base of the cross is a bullán which men would resort to in cases of childless marriages. The existing doorway of the nearby Church of Ireland at Farnaconnell is thought to have originated from the pre-reformation church at Toneel North.|$|E

2500|$|... 1925: On 21 August, the Ilkley Gazette {{received}} a letter of complaint that the collection was just a curiosity shop, and {{this led to the}} reduction of the collection in favour of its local heritage items. [...] However the letter did include a description of the exhibits of the time. [...] There was the Ellison collection of classified geological specimens. [...] There were photographs of the local great and good, a stuffed albatross and Japanese armour. There were valuable coins, a Queen Victoria mug, and the Anglo-Saxon <b>cross</b> <b>shaft</b> carvings, unlabelled. [...] The [...] "famous Roman triple vase [...] found near the Assembly Hall in Weston Road" [...] was still there with a serpent, boomerangs and a sawfish. The existence of superfluous paintings was bemoaned, with special attention being paid to the portraits of the Rombalds Moor hermit, and of James Fletcher (his name now changed to Metcalfe) the local 18th century blind fiddler - this latter was in the Museum's foundation collection, and possibly held some sentimental value for Ilkley residents. [...] It might also be worth noting that Mr Woodward, the classifier of the Roman artefacts, was absent in Greece when this article was written - so there may have been some political element involved in the publication of this piece. [...] The primary complaint is that items were intermixed and were not all labelled or classified, and the secondary complaint is that there was insufficient space to separate and classify them all properly. It appears well-intentioned, but there are possibly intimations of an administrative power-struggle in the background.|$|E
2500|$|The church’ north aisle {{dates from}} the late 13th century, its north windows being of Perpendicular style. There are north and south arcades. The north is in two parts that {{comprise}} two bays each; the south has four bays with octagonal piers [...] the pier details could be of an earlier date than the exterior. The windows in the aisles are of Decorated style. In the earliest part of the chancel is a 13th-century priests’ door, the chancel itself having Decorated and Perpendicular windows. In the chancel’s outer wall {{is part of an}} interlaced pattern, probably Anglo-Saxon, and probably taken from a <b>cross</b> <b>shaft.</b> The porch is 15thcentury and contains stone benches. A 13th-century piscina and three sedilia, restored in the 19thcentury, are on the interior south side. The font is octagonal and Perpendicular, with two-light windows in its stem, through which can be seen the image of a devil. The bowl itself has eight three-light windows. The screen too is Perpendicular. The octagonal oak pulpit is 19thcentury, possibly constructed with old wood taken from the previous rood screen. Pevsner notes a 1696 chalice and paten, and an 1808 alms basin by PeterandWilliamBateman. There are brasses to Nicolas Deen(d. 1479), and the wife(d. 1508) of James Deen, and a tablet to the family of DrHurst, Chaplain to CharlesI, dated 1674. The Hurst tablet inscription reads: [...] "DrHurst hath Iyeing within this chancel seven children namely, Anne, Lewis, Mary, Elizabeth, Charles, Sarayh, and Anna. This is to their memory 1675".|$|E
6000|$|All {{these four}} {{examples}} {{belonging to the}} oblique or Northern system, the curious trefoil plan, 3, lies between the two, as the double quatrefoil next it unites the two. The trefoil is from the Frari, Venice, and has a richly worked capital in the Byzantine manner,--an imitation, I think, of the Byzantine work by the Gothic builders: 1 is to be compared with it, {{being one of the}} earliest conditions of the <b>cross</b> <b>shaft,</b> from the atrium of St. Ambrogio at Milan. 13 is the nave pier of St. Michele at Pavia, showing the same condition more fully developed: and 11 another nave pier from Vienne, on the Rhone, of far more distinct Roman derivation, for the flat pilaster is set to the nave, and is fluted like an antique one. 12 is the grandest development I have ever seen of the <b>cross</b> <b>shaft,</b> with satellite shafts in the nooks of it: it is half of one of the great western piers of the cathedral of Bourges, measuring eight feet each side, thirty-two round.[46] Then the one below (15) is half of a nave pier of Rouen Cathedral, showing the mode in which such conditions as that of Dijon (9) and that of Bourges (12) were fused together into forms of inextricable complexity (inextricable I mean in the irregularity of proportion and projection, for all of them are easily resolvable into simple systems in connexion with the roof ribs). This pier of Rouen is a type of the last condition of the good Gothic; from this point the small shafts begin to lose shape, and run into narrow fillets and ridges, projecting at the same time farther and farther in weak tongue-like sections, as described in the [...] "Seven Lamps." [...] I have only here given one example of this family, an unimportant but sufficiently characteristic one (16) from St. Gervais of Falaise. One side of the nave of that church is Norman, the other Flamboyant, and the two piers 14 and 16 stand opposite each other. It would be useless to endeavor to trace farther the fantasticism of the later Gothic shafts; they become mere aggregations of mouldings very sharply and finely cut, their bases at the same time running together in strange complexity and their capitals diminishing and disappearing. Some of their conditions, which, in their rich striation, resemble crystals of beryl, are very massy and grand; others, meagre, harsh, or effeminate in themselves, are redeemed by richness and boldness of decoration; and I have long had it in my mind to reason out the entire harmony of this French Flamboyant system, and fix its types and possible power. But this inquiry is foreign altogether to our present purpose, and we shall therefore turn back from the Flamboyant to the Norman side of the Falaise aisle, resolute for the future that all shafts of which we may have the ordering, shall be permitted, as with wisdom we may also permit men or cities, to gather themselves into companies, or constellate themselves into clusters, but not to fuse themselves into mere masses of nebulous aggregation.|$|E
