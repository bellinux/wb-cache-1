25|$|Prolonged {{exercise}} such as marathons {{can increase}} cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and ischemia-modified (aka MI) albumin. This can be misinterpreted by medical personnel {{as signs of}} myocardial infarction, or <b>cardiac</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> In these clinical conditions, such cardiac biomarkers are produced by irreversible injury of muscles. In contrast, the processes that create them after strenuous exertion in endurance sports are reversible, with their levels returning to normal within 24-hours (further research, however, is still needed).|$|E
25|$|Hyperkalemia (high {{concentration}} of potassium in the blood) is another possible complication of treatment with an ACE inhibitor {{due to its}} effect on aldosterone. Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone levels. Since aldosterone is responsible for increasing the excretion of potassium, ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium. Some people, however, can continue to lose potassium while on an ACE inhibitor. Hyperkalemia may decrease the velocity of impulse conduction in the nerves and muscles, including cardiac tissues. This leads to <b>cardiac</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and neuromuscular consequences, such as muscle weakness, paresthesia, nausea, diarrhea, and others. Close monitoring of potassium levels is required in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors {{who are at risk}} of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) {{deficiency}} can {{be detrimental}} to the vascular function after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMIs can lead to <b>cardiac</b> <b>dysfunction</b> through two distinct changes; increased oxidative stress via free radical accumulation and decreased NO bioavailability. Free radical accumulation occurs due to increased electron transport uncoupling at the active site of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an enzyme involved in converting L-arginine to NO. During an AMI, oxidative degradation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor in NO production, limits BH4 availability and limits NO productionby eNOS. Instead, eNOS reacts with oxygen, another cosubstrates involved in NO production. The products of eNOS are reduced to superoxides, increasing free radical production and oxidative stress within the cells. A H2S deficiency impairs eNOS activity by limiting Akt activation and inhibiting Akt phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site. Instead, Akt activity is increased to phosphorylate the eNOST495 inhibition site, downregulating eNOS production of NO.|$|E

In the present study, we examined the effects of saxagliptin on in situ cardiac DPP- 4 activity. We also examined the effects of saxagliptin on isoproterenol-induced the changes in the early stage such as, myocardial remodeling and <b>cardiac</b> diastolic <b>dysfunction.</b> Male SD rats treated with isoproterenol (1  mg/kg/day via osmotic pump) received vehicle or saxagliptin (17. 5  mg/kg via drinking water) for 2 weeks. In situ cardiac DPP- 4 activity was measured by a colorimetric assay. Cardiac gene expressions were examined and an echocardiographic analysis was performed. Saxagliptin treatment significantly inhibited in situ cardiac DPP- 4 activity and suppressed isoproterenol-induced myocardial remodeling and the expression of related genes without altering the blood glucose levels. Saxagliptin also significantly ameliorated <b>cardiac</b> diastolic <b>dysfunction</b> in isoproterenol-treated rats. In conclusion, the inhibition of DPP- 4 activity in cardiac tissue by saxagliptin was associated with suppression of myocardial remodeling and <b>cardiac</b> diastolic <b>dysfunction</b> independently of its glucose-lowering action in isoproterenol-treated rats.
