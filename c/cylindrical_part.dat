40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{different approaches}} to creating mathematical models to provide abrasive finishing. It highlights the features of abrasive finishing of precision parts at the final processing stages. The paper persuasively argues {{that it is necessary}} to take into consideration the law of size distribution in the batch of simultaneously treated work-pieces with double-sided lapping of precision plane-parallel and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>parts,</b> such as end bars and cylinders for measuring the pitch diameter. The paper also proposes geometric models of the batch of simultaneously treated work-pieces for plane-parallel and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>parts</b> when lapping them in a double-disk lapping machine as a "general work-piece". On the basis of geometrical models an expression is created to calculate the change of a working pressure or the distributed load (for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>parts)</b> in the process of abrasive finishing. The paper presents the experimental study results of changing geometrical dimensions in the batch of work-pieces of the end measures of length in abrasive process thereby confirming the validity of the proposed approach to creating model. There is a justification that in the mathematical model should be introduced expressions describing the change of abrasiveness of the abrasive used for different kinds of lapping, including that of applied to the final lapping. A mathematical model is presented in the form of integrodifferential equations describing how the rate of linear material removal in double-sided finishing depends on the speed of relative movement of the work-pieces on the lap (sanding block), as well as on the pressure or distributed load (for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>parts),</b> and acceleration of relative motion, with appropriate exponents. The expression taking into account the change of the abrasiveness of the abrasive used is introduced in the differential equation. The model is presented in a generalized form, taking into account all possible processing factors. In specific cases it can be significantly simplified. The model can be used to calculate the finishing machine rates of processing the batches of work-pieces...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a calculation algorithm for verifying on-line {{of the manufacturing}} process stability in large and mass series of some <b>cylindrical</b> <b>parts</b> from axes type. Through experimental investigations, we conducted a statistical control on a sample parts batch to determine the machining accuracy of some checking turret lathes. In the first phase, we performed a statistical analysis of the technological process preceding the manufacture of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>parts</b> in large and mass series. For checking the normality assumption of the deviations for parts machined, we established the main statistical parameters as being arithmetic mean and standard deviation. With these parameters, I could calculate the fraction of probable defective parts. In the second phase, we determined the control limits for the arithmetic mean and standard deviation. With these parameters I could pursue in chronological order the actual achievement of the workpiece size. In this way, I could check the technological process stability on-line for well-defined period's time, between two successive adjustments of the machine-tools. Introduction. Following the actual technological manufacturing process of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>parts</b> from the axes type, these will have deviations from the dimensional accuracy and geometric shape [2 and 7]. The main factors contributing to the processing deviations emergence are [1, 6, 8 and 9]: the geometrical inaccuracy of machine-tools; the imprecision of the measuring instruments used; the fastener imprecision of workpiece and of the cutting tools; the wear of cutting tools; the variation and modification during the cutting process the thermal parameters for machine tools, fastener devices, workpiece and cutting tools; the elastic deformation of the technological system; the unevenness of cutting depth; the variation of internal stresses into the processing material...|$|R

40|$|Aluminum {{die casting}} is an {{important}} manufacturing process for mechanical components.

In the proposed method, the shape of cast aluminum made with the initial metal molds is measured by 3 D scanning. The 3 D scan data includes information about deformations that occur during casting.

We corrected planar and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>parts</b> of the CAD data for the mold. In addition, we corrected the planar part of the metal mold using the corrected mold data.

The capacitors are arranged so that they act as rests on which the motor shaft (acting as the 'wheel' for this robot) is balanced out on two other skids.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the heat treatment operation in a manufacturing plant that produces {{different types of}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>parts.</b> The immediate prior process to heat treatment is furnace-loading, where parts are loaded into baskets. The furnace-loading process is complex and involves issues relating to geometry, and heterogeneity in the parts and in their processing requirements. Currently, furnace-loading is accomplished by operator ingenuity; consequently, the parts loaded in heat treatment often do not use furnace capacity adequately. Efficiency in furnace operation {{can be achieved by}} improving basket utilization, which is determined by the furnace-loading process. This paper describes the development of integer and mixed integer LP models for 3 D loading of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>parts</b> into furnace baskets. The models consider the exact location of parts to be loaded on the basket and incorporate three models with different objectives; the first {{addresses the}} nesting of parts within one another, the second addresses the number of basket layers used, and the third addresses the number of baskets used.
