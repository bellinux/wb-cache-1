5|$|The velites {{were placed}} {{at the front of}} the maniples, so that the velites had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> {{themselves}} and win glory by seeking out single combat with an enemy. This is also why they wore highly identifiable wolfskin headdresses.|$|E
5|$|Anitha {{tells the}} king {{that she is}} the {{messenger}} sent from the homeland. Muthu and Lavanya are enslaved while Anitha is given a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> herself. She tries to seduce and convince the Chola king to march towards the homeland in two days so he can be crowned properly as a king. He suspects her bona fides since none of her actions match those described by the king's ancestors. The ancestors wrote that the messenger will be preceded by hail and following his ill-treatment will eventually help the tribe.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully learns that she, but not Mulder, is being given a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> her worth at the FBI, and—paired with a new partner—she investigates a crime scene photographer with an uncanny knack for arriving {{just in time to}} see his victims' final moments. What she does not expect, however, is for Death to play a role himself.|$|E
25|$|The team's general {{philosophy}} {{at the time}} was to concentrate on its improving defense and play conservatively on offense until it could be made more competitive. Players on the Giants' offense became frustrated over this decision and wanted more <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> themselves.|$|R
5000|$|His {{best wins}} were the Rosehill Guineas and the Australian Derby in 2005, and the Ranvet Stakes, BMW and AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2006.

5|$|In 1998, Ann Romney {{learned that}} she had {{multiple}} sclerosis; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as {{the worst day of}} his life. After experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease, she found– while living in Park City, Utah, where the couple had built a vacation home– a combination of mainstream, alternative, and equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations. When her husband received a job offer to take over the troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; eager for a new challenge, as well as another <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself in public life, he did. On February 11, 1999, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed {{her final}} scenes for the series, {{along with two}} fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher). She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she {{was looking forward to}} {{pursuing}} other projects. Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future. Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character, he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline. However, she also felt like she deserved another <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> herself.|$|E
5|$|Partly due {{to these}} events, and {{partly due to}} the major losses in {{manpower}} Gallia suffers {{towards the end of the}} war with the Empire, the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force. This is short-lived, however, as following Maximilian's defeat, Dahau and Calamity Raven move to activate an ancient Valkyrian super weapon within the Empire, kept secret by their benefactor. Without the support of Maximilian or the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> themselves in the war with Gallia, it is Dahau's last trump card in creating a new Darcsen nation. As an armed Gallian force invading the Empire just following the two nations' cease-fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace, Kurt decides to once again make his squad the Nameless, asking Crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed-in-action. Now owing allegiance to none other than themselves, the 422nd confronts Dahau and destroys the Valkyrian weapon. Each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew.|$|E
50|$|Fareez didn't {{have much}} <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his worth {{for the team}} {{due to the lack}} of playing fixture of the league and lacked of top level experienced.

50|$|The {{lack of any}} <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself led Compton to {{part with}} Manchester {{during the summer of}} 2007. He chose to return to the team where he had made his name, signing again for the Flintshire Freeze. Compton has again been playing for the Freeze but has shared the goaltending duties with Dave Clancy and Phil Crosby. Compton would {{continue}} his association with the Freeze during the 2008/09 season, making 12 appearances in league and cup competition.|$|R
50|$|In the team's first season, {{young players}} such as goaltender Billy Smith (the team's second pick in the {{expansion}} draft) and forwards Bob Nystrom and Lorne Henning were given <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> themselves in the NHL. However, this young and inexperienced expansion team posted a record of 12-60-6, {{one of the worst}} in NHL history. The lone highlight of the season came on January 18, when the lowly Islanders upset the defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins on the road 9-7.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} idea behind Slackers first occurred in 1990. Along with some friends, Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias {{went to a}} Don Henley concert, and began thinking about owning their own music store. At the time, the two were undergraduate students, and decided to focus their studies on business management and becoming entrepreneurs. Slackers CDs and Games was officially founded in 1993, by Jellinek and Zacharias, in Columbia, Missouri. Jellinek and Zacharias opened the store after graduating from Saint Louis University, using only their own collection of 1,500 music CDs. The name originated from their generation being considered slackers before being given a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> otherwise. Although business was slow at first, with the store sometimes only making US$30 in a day, business eventually increased. After 2years {{they were able to}} open a second location in O'Fallon, Illinois. As of 2009, there are 10 locations in the states of Missouri and Illinois, eight of which are in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, and two of which are in Mid-Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{discovering}} her pregnancy, Quinn convinces Finn {{that he is}} the father, {{despite the}} fact that they never actually had a sexual encounter. Quinn claims that due to his premature ejaculation problem, and during their time in a hot-tub, Finn had ejaculated in the tub and Quinn had received the sperm. The real father is Finn's best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who offers to support Quinn and the baby, but is rejected for his irresponsibility. Quinn decides to have the baby adopted, and agrees to give it to Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), who is faking a pregnancy. When news of her pregnancy is revealed to the school, Quinn is cut from the cheerleading squad and her popularity declines. Her parents evict her, and Quinn moves in with Finn and his mother. She begins to reconsider having the baby adopted, and gives Puck a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself, but he is not reliable so she returns to her plan of giving the baby to Terri. Quinn blackmails Sue into letting her rejoin the Cheerios, but ultimately decides against it, preferring to remain with the glee club, where she feels accepted. Finn learns the truth about the baby's paternity from Rachel, and breaks up with Quinn. Puck again offers to support her, but she turns him down and tells him that she wants to handle the pregnancy by herself. She moves in with Puck's family, but after forming a friendship with fellow New Directions member Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Quinn lives with her family instead. She gives birth to a daughter, named Beth by Puck, who is adopted by Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline and Rachel's biological mother.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1995–96, Australia played home series against Pakistan and Sri Lanka. He took 11 wickets in the first Test against Pakistan but broke his toe in the second. Selectors {{included}} him in the squad for the third Test just days later {{to give him the}} <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his fitness; he did so by taking four wickets in Pakistan's first innings and another four in their second to be named the player of the series.|$|E
5|$|The missed <b>chance</b> was <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> costly. The pattern {{established}} in the first Test recurred, as England let the West Indies recover, with Gus Logie and Jeff Dujon scoring 81 and 53 as the team passed 200.|$|R
50|$|Born in Eeklo Maarten Martens {{took his}} first steps in {{football}} in Klauwaerts Bassevelde. At the age of eight young Martens joined the youth team of RSC Anderlecht. There, {{over the years he}} was a teammate of, among others, Urko Pardo, Mark De Man and Xavier Chen. In 2003 Roda showed interest in the young midfielder, but he decided to stay in the team of his heart. In the 2003/04 season, Martens joined the first team, but he did not have many <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself. Only once under the coach Hugo Broos played at the highest level.|$|R
25|$|With the {{previous}} year’s successes established, {{it looked like}} Korolyov would have another <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>prove</b> himself on the world’s biggest stage, the Olympics, but fate adversely intervened again when he injured his Achilles tendon, making his bid for the 1988 Seoul Olympics impossible.|$|R
25|$|That season, Smith {{broke his}} ankle in training, {{and missed the}} {{majority}} of the season. However, by the time he made his return to first team action, manager Jim Magilton had left the club and been replaced by Roy Keane. Smith featured heavily in Keane's early games as Ipswich manager, with the former Manchester United midfielder opting to give some of the club's younger talent – such as Connor Wickham and Smith – a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> themselves.|$|E
25|$|Many of the 'against-the-clock' {{fraternity}} in the United Kingdom sincerely {{believed that}} the British time triallists were as good as, if not better than, their Continental counterparts and here was the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> it. When the final result was known the British fans were disappointed and saw the race as a total failure for Britain as both Englishman had finished nearly 20 minutes down. To rub salt in the wounds, the event had been won by an unknown, curly-haired teenager from Normandy.|$|E
25|$|Wigan later made a third for the player, {{a revised}} figure of £700,000. Again the Burnley board turned down this offer and no further bids {{were made by}} the Latics. In his final game of his first spell at Burnley he scored what is {{possibly}} the best goal of his Burnley career leathering in a stunning free kick from 35 yards in a local derby against Preston North End. Eventually a successful bid of £1.25 million was made by Birmingham City and Blake once again had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself in the top league.|$|E

50|$|When Prabasi first appeared, it pioneered {{a mix of}} book excerpts, {{poetry and}} one-act plays, {{alongside}} reviews and essays. It also included serialized fiction, including Rabindranath Tagore's Gora (1907-1909). It also included articles on history, art, archaeology, sociology, education, literature and literary theories, scientific topics, and travelogues. The magazine was known for its art and illustrations. It was the first ever periodical in Bengali to feature a reproduction of a photograph on its cover purely {{for the sake of}} illustration.

25|$|Bader got his <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that {{he could}} still fly when, in June 1932, Air Under-Secretary Philip Sassoon {{arranged}} {{for him to take}} up an Avro 504, which he piloted competently. A subsequent medical examination proved him fit for active service, but in April 1933 he was notified that the RAF had decided to reverse the decision on the grounds that this situation was not covered by King's Regulations. In May, Bader was invalided out of the RAF, took an office job with the Asiatic Petroleum Company (now Shell) and, on 5 October 1933, married Thelma Edwards.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to reinvigorate}} the Venetian cause, Morosini himself {{returned}} to the Morea in 1693. His advanced age denied him the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his abilities again, however, and on 16 January 1694, he died at Nafplion. His successor Zeno, {{against the advice of}} his officers, led an expedition against the rich island of Chios, off the coast of Asia Minor. The island was taken easily, but the Turkish response was swift and massive. A double naval battle near the Oinousses Islands in February 1695 resulted in a Venetian defeat, and forced a humiliating Venetian withdrawal from Chios.|$|E
25|$|Aging Gonzaga {{gradually}} {{became more and}} more dissatisfied with his work, that of producing ephemeral follies that rarely lasted longer than a single theatrical season. He suffered depression, feeling that his life was spent in vain, and begged his patrons to offer him a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself in architecture and leave a tangible trace of his talent. He applied to all available vacancies and architectural contests, and was always rejected. By 1827, when emperor Nicholas awarded him an honorary title of court architect Gonzaga was already too old for practical construction. Nestor Kukolnik suggested that earlier, in 1810s, Gonzaga designed and built Yusupov's private theatre in Arkhangelskoye Estate, but his attribution was later discarded.|$|E

On Baa’s request Sunaina talks to Chandan about joining his father’s business. Chandan gets furious. Kunika wants to invite the Kotak family to celebrate Baa’s birthday at the farmhouse mainly to bury the hatchet. Kotak family accepts their invitation. Chandan also accompany’s her mother to Kotak house so that he can apologize to Sunaina for his behaviour. Sujata is caught by Harsha Bua while talking to Gaurav on the phone.|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} of The Rescuers signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), the animation for which was directed by Don Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation {{in the development of the}} art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s.|$|R

25|$|Since Pedro II {{would only}} be 18 in 1843, an elected regency was created to replace the emperor during his minority. The country became {{in all but the}} name a republic. Joaquim Nabuco, writing in the 1890s, remarked that the Brazilian {{republicans}} saw this period as their <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that the country could survive in peace without a monarch as superior arbiter, as a neutral character above rival parties. However, this republican experience proved itself to be a complete disaster: as a republic, Brazil was no better than its Hispanic-American neighbors. The regency had little effective authority which resulted in nine years of chaos during which the country was plagued by rebellions and coup attempts initiated by unruly political factions.|$|E

Initially Wilkinson was {{left out of the}} 44-strong squad which was announced by Clive Woodward on 11 April 2005. However, on 8 May Woodward announced he had added the fly-half to the squad after Wilkinson had proved he was injury-free and fit. Wilkinson made his first international appearance since the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final on 23 May at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff as the Lions played Argentina. Wilkinson, {{along with the rest of}} the team, played poorly, but kicked a conversion and six penalties; he salvaged a 25–25 draw with the last kick of the game.|$|E
25|$|Aerts {{continued}} his win-streak when he knocked out Andrew Thomson in fifty-six seconds at K-1 King of the Ring 2000 in Bologna, Italy on May 12, 2000. This run {{came to an}} end, however, {{when he came up}} against Cyril Abidi, a promising young French fighter, at K-1 Spirits 2000 on July 7, 2000. Abidi managed to drag Aerts into a brawl and caused a huge upset by KOing him in round one. Aerts was then given the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> this loss was simply a fluke when he rematched Abidi in the quarter-finals of the K-1 World Grand Prix 2000 in Yokohama, a qualifying tournament for the 2000 World Grand Prix. He was unable to do so, however, and Abidi stopped him en route to the final.|$|E

Like half {{the rest of the}} world, if more than half there be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. She expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her own weakness, it <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> a source of fresh pain to herself, though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.|$|R
