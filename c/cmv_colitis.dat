40|$|Background and aim]Cytomegalovirus (<b>CMV)</b> exacerbates {{ulcerative}} <b>colitis</b> (UC) refractory to immunosuppressive therapies. The {{conditions under}} which CMV reactivation occurs in patients with UC, however, is unclear. In addition, the diagnostic and treatment strategies for UC positive for CMV have not been established. Granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMAA) is natural biological therapy for UC in which the granulocytes/macrophages producing inflammatory cytokines are removed. We investigated the rate of colonic CMV reactivation and the efficacy of GMAA in active UC patients positive for CMV without concomitant corticosteroid (CS) therapy. [Methods]Fifty-one active UC patients without concomitant CS therapy were enrolled. Colonic CMV reactivation was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using biopsy specimen and/or histological examination. All patients were treated with intensive GMAA (twice per week). Rates of clinical remission and mucosal healing were compared between UC patients positive and negative for CMV. [Results]Of 51 patients, 15 (29. 4 %) were diagnosed as CMV positive. The clinical remission rates following intensive GMAA did not differ between UC patients positive and negative for CMV (73. 3 % vs 69. 4 %, p = 0. 781). Proportion of patients achieving mucosal healing was also similar between these two groups. CMV-DNA became negative in all UC patients positive for CMV who achieved clinical remission 1 week after completion of intensive GMAA. [Conclusions]Intestinal inflammation might trigger CMV reactivation in a subpopulation of active UC patients without CS treatment.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} outcome of cytomegalovirus (<b>CMV)</b> -positive ulcerative <b>colitis</b> (UC) patients {{with and without}} antiviral therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective case-controlled study. The database of UC patients in our institution was scanned for documented presence of CMV on colonic biopsies. Demographics, clinical data, endoscopy findings and pathology reports were extracted from the patients&#x 2019; charts and electronic records. When available, the data from colonoscopies preceding and following the diagnosis of colonic CMV infection were also extracted. The primary outcomes {{of the study were}} colectomy/death during hospitalization and the secondary outcomes were colectomy/death through the course of the follow-up. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included in the study, 7 (53. 5 %) of them were treated with gancyclovir and 6 (46. 5 %) were not. Patients treated with antivirals presented with a more severe disease and 57 % of them were treated with cyclosporine or infliximab before initiation of gancyclovir, while none of the patients without antivirals required rescue therapy. One patient died and another patient underwent urgent colectomy during hospitalization, both of them from the gancyclovir-treatment group. For the entire follow-up time (13 1; 13 mo), a total of 3 colectomies and one death occurred, all among the antiviral-treated patients (for colectomy: 3 / 7 vs 0 / 6 patients, P = 0. 19; for combined adverse outcome: 4 / 7 vs 0 / 6 patients, P = 0. 07). In 9 / 13 patients, immunohistochemistry for CMV was performed on biopsies obtained during a subsequent colonoscopy and was positive in one patient only. CONCLUSION: Gancyclovir-treated patients had a more severe disease and outcome, probably unrelated to antiviral therapy.

40|$|AbstractCytomegalovirus (<b>CMV)</b> <b>colitis</b> usually {{occurs in}} immunocompromised {{patients}} with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} infection, organ transplantation, and malignancy receiving chemotherapy or ulcerative colitis receiving immunosuppressive agents. However, <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis</b> is increasingly recognized in immunocompetent hosts. Notably, <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis</b> coexisting with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in apparently healthy individuals has been published in recent years, which could result in high morbidity and mortality. <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis</b> is a rare but possible differential diagnosis in immunocompetent patients with abdominal pain, watery, or especially bloody diarrhea, which could be refractory to standard treatment for CDI. As a characteristic of CDI, however, pseudomembranous colitis may be only caused by CMV infection. Real-time CMV-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for blood and stool samples may be a useful and noninvasive diagnostic strategy to identify CMV infection when treatment of CDI eventually fails to show significant benefits. Quantitative CMV-PCR in mucosal biopsies may increase the diagnostic yield of traditional histopathology. <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis</b> is potentially life-threatening if severe complications occur, such as sepsis secondary to colitis, massive colorectal bleeding, toxic megacolon, and colonic perforation, so that may necessitate pre-emptive antiviral treatment {{for those who are}} positive for CMV-PCR in blood and/or stool samples while pending histological diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of cytomegalovirus intestinal disease {{in patients with}} HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection frequently raises diagnostic problems {{in view of the}} absence of definite pathological, serological or virological markers of active CMV infection.

40|$|Background: CMV-Colitis is {{a severe}} {{complication}} {{in patients with}} inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) {{and can lead to}} higher morbidity and mortality if unrecognized. On the other hand non-relevant or asymptomatic reactivation of CMV is also highly prevalent in IBD patients. The aims of this study were: We wanted to calculate sensitivity and specificity of common diagnostic tests to find a reliable tool in proving a clinically relevant <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis.</b> Furthermore we looked for clinical parameters and situations in which a <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis</b> is considered to be more likely. Methods: In a retrospective clinical study we extracted data from all patients between 09 / 2006 and 09 / 2009 at the Charité – Campus Benjamin Franklin (CBF) and between 09 / 2006 – 12 / 2009 at the Charité – Campus Mitte (CCM) with ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease or colitis unclassified who were tested for CMV infection with {{at least one of the}} following tests: CMV-PCR, pp 65 FACS assay, CMV-IgG/IgM or H&E stain and immunohistochemistry. This included all patients with moderate to severely active colitis, with steroid-refractory or -dependent disease. In the absence of a true gold standard we defined clinically relevant <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis</b> using clinical outcome in addition to common diagnostic tests. This included long term course and especially response to antiviral treatment – taking advantage of standard procedures at our department to immediately reduce immunosuppressive treatment and to start antiviral treatment after diagnosis of CMV infection. Results: We looked through the charts of 314 patients. We were able to include 109 patients in this study. 16 patients were tested CMV positive in at least one test. Nine patients were considered to have a clinically relevant <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis</b> and seven patients were considered to be false positive. Patients with <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis</b> received significantly more often steroids or other immunosuppressive agents. They were significantly more often steroid refractory. They presented with more weight-loss, fever or splenomegaly. Regarding laboratory tests they had more often low or normal leukocytes but a high CRP. CMV-PCR is the most sensitive test in detecting a clinically relevant CMV-colitis with a sensitivity of 100 % Conclusion: CMV-PCR is the most sensitive test in diagnosing a clinically relevant CMV-colitis. IBD patients with colitis and clinical signs such as fever and splenomegaly, 10 steroid- refractory disease or lack of leukocytosis have a high pre-test probability for <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis.</b> This is the first study regarding CMV in IBD that allows calculation of sensitivity and specificity of common CMV tests regarding the clinical context...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} {{presentations and}} endoscopic features of cytomegalovirus(CMV) {{infection in the}} gastrointestinal (GI) tract are diverse, and can mimicother inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases. Methods: From 1987 to 2003 at Chang-Gung Medical Center, 20 patients with CMVinfections of the GI tract who were assessed using endoscopic examinationsand diagnosed via pathologic studies were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Most of the patients were adults with immunocompromised conditions(10 / 20). GI tract bleeding {{was the most common}} clinical manifestation(11 / 20). Five patients presented with abdominal pain, and two patients presentedwith diarrhea. Fifteen patients suffered from fever. The endoscopicabnormalities could be classified into four main groups: inflammatorymucosa alone (3 / 20), ulceration alone (7 / 20), inflammatory mucosa associatedwith ulcer (9 / 20) and sub-mucosal tumor with ulcer (1 / 20). Of the 17 patients with ulcer lesions, ten had multiple ulcers and 12 had large ulcersexceeding 2 centimeters in diameter. Of the six patients followed up withcolonoscopy, one was free of disease, one had a single ulcer, and four hadcolitis and were CMV positive on repeat biopsy.

Objective: The predictors of mortality {{and the differences}} between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients with this disease remain unknown. Thus, {{the aim of this}} retrospective cohort study was to clarify these issues. Patients and methods: We enrolled all patients who were histologically diagnosed with <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis</b> between April 2002 and December 2016 in the Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Patients were divided into two groups: immunocompetent and immunocompromised, and the differences between them were analyzed to develop in-hospital mortality predictors. Results: A total of 69 patients (42, immunocompetent; 27, immunocompromised) were enrolled. The most common symptoms were melena in the immunocompetent group and diarrhea in the immunocompromised group. The in-hospital mortality rate showed no statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} (26. 2 % vs 25. 9 %, P= 0. 981). Early diagnosis was the only significant independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1. 075, 95 % CI 1. 005 – 1. 149, P= 0. 035). The cutoff of diagnostic timing was 9  days from admission, derived from the receiver operating characteristic curve using the Youden index. Conclusion: <b>CMV</b> <b>colitis</b> in immunocompetent patients is markedly more common and fatal than has generally been acknowledged.
