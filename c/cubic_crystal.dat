5|$|Thorium is a {{moderately}} hard, paramagnetic, bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the periodic table, it lies {{to the right}} of actinium, to the left of protactinium, and below cerium. Pure thorium is very ductile and, as normal for metals, can be cold-rolled, swaged, and drawn. At room temperature, thorium metal has a face-centred <b>cubic</b> <b>crystal</b> structure; it has two other forms at exotic conditions, one at high temperature (over 1360°C; body-centred cubic) and one at high pressure (around 100GPa; body-centred tetragonal).|$|E
5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the <b>cubic</b> <b>crystal</b> allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost.

5|$|Meitnerium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a face-centered <b>cubic</b> <b>crystal</b> structure, similarly to its lighter congener iridium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37.4g/cm3, which would be the second-highest of any of the 118 known elements, second only to that predicted for its neighbor hassium (41g/cm3). In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from meitnerium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough meitnerium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. Meitnerium is also predicted to be paramagnetic.|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a body-centered <b>cubic</b> <b>crystal</b> structure, similar to its lighter congener tungsten.

In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from seaborgium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough seaborgium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{alkali metals}} are all silver-{{coloured}} metals except for caesium, {{which has a}} pale golden tint: {{it is one of}} only three metals that are clearly coloured (the other two being copper and gold). Additionally, the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, and barium, as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, are pale yellow, though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium. Their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation. They all crystallise in the body-centered <b>cubic</b> <b>crystal</b> structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. Indeed, these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble.|$|E

5|$|Ytterbium {{has three}} allotropes labeled by the Greek letters alpha, beta and gamma; their {{transformation}} temperatures are −13°C and 795°C, although the exact transformation temperature {{depends on the}} pressure and stress.

The high-temperature gamma allotrope (6.57 g/cm3) has a body-centered cubic crystalline structure. The alpha allotrope (6.903 g/cm3) has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is stable at low temperatures. The beta allotrope has a metallic electrical conductivity at normal atmospheric pressure, but it becomes a semiconductor when exposed to a pressure of about 16,000 atmospheres (1.6GPa). Its electrical resistivity increases ten times upon compression to 39,000 atmospheres (3.9GPa), but then drops to about 10% of its room-temperature resistivity at about 40,000atm (4.0GPa).|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{crystallize}} in {{the diamond}} <b>cubic</b> <b>crystal</b> system (space group Fdm) and consist of tetrahedrally, covalently bonded carbon atoms. A second form called lonsdaleite, with hexagonal symmetry, {{has also been}} found, but it is extremely rare and forms only in meteorites or in laboratory synthesis. The local environment of each atom is identical in the two structures. From theoretical considerations, lonsdaleite {{is expected to be}} harder than diamond, but the size and quality of the available stones are insufficient to test this hypothesis. In terms of crystal habit, diamonds occur most often as euhedral (well-formed) or rounded octahedra and twinned, flattened octahedra with a triangular outline. Other forms include dodecahedra and (rarely) cubes. There is evidence that nitrogen impurities {{play an important role in}} the formation of well-shaped euhedral crystals. The largest diamonds found, such as the Cullinan Diamond, were shapeless. These diamonds are pure (i.e. type II) and therefore contain little if any nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The {{lanthanides}} and actinides, in {{the metallic}} state, can exist as either divalent (such as europium and ytterbium) or trivalent (most other lanthanides) metals. The former have fnd1s2 configurations, whereas the latter have fn+1s2 configurations. In 1975, Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted {{values for the}} cohesive energies (enthalpies of crystallization) of the metallic lanthanides and actinides, both as divalent and trivalent metals. The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the 5f126d17s2 configuration over the 5f137s2 configuration for mendelevium {{was not enough to}} compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d, as is true also for the very late actinides: thus einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals. The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number. Thermochromatographic studies with trace quantities of mendelevium by Zvara and Hübener from 1976 to 1982 confirmed this prediction. In 1990, Haire and Gibson estimated mendelevium metal to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 134 and 142kJ·mol−1. Divalent mendelevium metal should have a metallic radius of around (194±10)pm. Like the other divalent late actinides (except the once again trivalent lawrencium), metallic mendelevium should assume a face-centered <b>cubic</b> <b>crystal</b> structure. Mendelevium's melting point has been estimated at 827°C, the same value as that predicted for the neighboring element nobelium. Its density is predicted to be around 10.3±0.7g·cm−3.|$|E
