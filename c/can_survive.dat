5|$|Depending on {{the species}} {{and where it}} lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> for long periods without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E
5|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri is {{the only}} species of Hemilepistus to have {{developed}} parental care of its offspring, {{and it is only}} because of this development that the species <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> in the desert. It is monogamous, and, unusually, both parents tend the young.|$|E

5|$|Millipedes {{occur on}} all continents except Antarctica, and occupy almost all {{terrestrial}} habitats, ranging {{as far north}} as the Arctic Circle in Iceland, Norway, and Central Russia, and as far south as Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. Typically forest floor dwellers, they live in leaf litter, dead wood, or soil, with a preference for humid conditions. In temperate zones, millipedes are most abundant in moist deciduous forests, and may reach densities of over 1,000 individuals per square metre. Other habitats include coniferous forests, deserts, caves, and alpine ecosystems. Some species <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> freshwater floods and live submerged underwater for up to 11 months. A few species occur near the seashore and <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> in somewhat salty conditions.|$|E
5|$|The pudús are herbivorous, {{consuming}} vines, {{leaves from}} low trees, shrubs, succulent sprouts, herbs, ferns, blossoms, buds, tree bark, and fallen fruit. They <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> without drinking water {{for long periods}} due to the high water content of the succulent foliage in their diets.|$|E
5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> long enough to mate. Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E

5|$|A sungrazing comet is a comet {{that passes}} {{extremely}} {{close to the}} Sun at perihelion, generally within a few million kilometres. Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> many perihelion passages. However, the strong tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation.|$|E
5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E

5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease.

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is {{native to}} the Northern Hemisphere, and {{distributed}} across Eurasia, North America and the British Isles, where there is open bog, heath, wetland and moorland, with standing water and calcareous peat or acidic soil.

However, despite {{high levels of}} bacteria being found on ready-to-eat lettuce products, a 2008 study found no incidences of food-borne illness related to listeriosis, possibly due to the product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the Listeria bacteria or inhibition of bacteria to cause listeriosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid may have {{originated}} in Europe and Asia {{but it is}} now one of the most widely distributed species of aphids. It is found throughout temperate areas of Western Europe, Asia and North America and in the cooler parts of Africa, the Middle East and South America. In the warmer parts of its range, apterous individuals <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> the winter and they may continue to reproduce asexually all year round.|$|E
5|$|Adults are in {{reproductive}} diapause and overwinter in {{protected sites}} such as under tree barks, particularly of old, standing trees, hedgerows, lichen, and in forests or leaf litter.

Some B. rufimanus <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> during winter in larval or pupal diapause inside the seeds and terminate their diapause, finish their post-embryonic growth and emerge from the seeds after sowing.|$|E

5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees <b>can</b> <b>survive.</b> The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, four strains of equine encephalitis, and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens <b>can</b> <b>survive</b> infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E
