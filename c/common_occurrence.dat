5|$|Beagles may {{exhibit a}} {{behaviour}} known as reverse sneezing, {{in which they}} sound {{as if they are}} choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a <b>common</b> <b>occurrence</b> and is not harmful to the dog.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{cratering}} is a <b>common</b> <b>occurrence</b> on many Solar System bodies. Much of Enceladus' {{surface is}} covered with craters at various densities and levels of degradation. This subdivision of cratered terrains {{on the basis of}} crater density (and thus surface age) suggests that Enceladus has been resurfaced in multiple stages.|$|E
5|$|The Balfour estate {{sold its}} farms on Shapinsay between 1924 and 1928.

5|$|This {{species is}} {{responsible}} for more snakebite fatalities than any other African snake.

5|$|Flash floods {{resulting}} from glacial lake outburst flooding {{in the upper}} reaches of the valley, are a <b>common</b> <b>occurrence</b> in the Mo Chu and Pho Chu rivers, and in the past caused flooding and damage to the dzong, especially in 1957, 1960 and 1994. Fires and earthquakes have also further added to the problem. In 1996, flash floods in the Pho Chu river damaged the large stupa and caused several deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of Ypresiomyrma queens collected {{suggests that these}} ants mated in swarms, but the alates were poor flyers due to their large size. The morphology of the mandibles indicate they were specialised tools for excavating chambers in soil or wood during colony foundation; their large size and <b>common</b> <b>occurrence</b> in their geographical range would mean they were an important food source {{to a variety of}} birds and Paleogene animals that predominately fed on insects.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of remains of First and Second World War casualties remains a <b>common</b> <b>occurrence,</b> with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually. For example, in 2006 eight bodies of Canadian {{soldiers from the}} 78th Battalion (Winnipeg Grenadiers), CEF were discovered in a backyard in Hallu, France. In April 2013, the remains of four British soldiers discovered by a French farmer clearing land with a metal detector in 2009 were re-interred at H.A.C. Cemetery near Arras, France. In March 2014, the remains of 20Commonwealth and 30German soldiers were discovered in Vendin-le-Vieil, France, with the Commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied at Loos British Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} <b>common</b> <b>occurrence</b> in the lake. Warnings about coming {{into contact with}} the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{became one}} of many {{officers}} holding wartime commissions to receive a commission in the Regular Army, into which he was commissioned as a first lieutenant on 1 July 1920, but was subsequently reduced in rank to second lieutenant on 15 December 1922, another <b>common</b> <b>occurrence</b> {{in the aftermath of}} World War I when the wartime army was demobilized. Already a command pilot, he also qualified as a combat observer in 1922. He was promoted to first lieutenant again on 24 July 1924.|$|E

5|$|According to Richard Hoggett, the {{practice}} of being ruled {{by more than one}} individual may have been a <b>common</b> <b>occurrence</b> in East Anglia as it was for the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Kent and Northumbria. Ecgric and Sigeberht may have simultaneously ruled the peoples known as the North-folk and South-folk, who lived in the parts of their kingdom that would later become the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. However, Carver notes that Ecgric may not have reigned jointly with Sigeberht, but could just have plausibly ruled as a sub-king or served as an administrator within a region under East Anglian hegemony, only rising as king of the East Angles after Sigeberht's abdication.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a <b>common</b> <b>occurrence</b> in their feral state.|$|E
5|$|Kill the Irishman {{had been}} in {{development}} since 1997. Producer Tommy Reid heard that Rick Porrello, an Ohio policeman, was about to publish a book about Greene called To Kill the Irishman. Reid flew to Ohio and met with Porrello, who told Reid his grandfather was a high-ranking Mafia figure in Cleveland during the prohibition era. The meeting went well, and on March 17, 1998, they signed a deal for the film rights to the book. Getting Kill the Irishman produced was difficult. Reid frequently left deals unconcluded, and discovered that the script he’d commissioned was attached to a cover with another screenwriter and producer’s name listed. According to Reid, this was a <b>common</b> <b>occurrence</b> in Hollywood, and {{he claims to have}} spent over $1 million to ensure the film was made.|$|E

5|$|Poison was {{discovered}} in ancient times, and was used by ancient tribes and civilizations as a hunting tool to quicken and ensure {{the death of their}} prey or enemies. This use of poison grew more advanced, and many of these ancient peoples began forging weapons designed specifically for poison enhancement. Later in history, particularly {{at the time of the}} Roman Empire, one of the more prevalent uses was assassination. As early as 331 BC, poisonings executed at the dinner table or in drinks were reported, and the practice became a <b>common</b> <b>occurrence.</b> The use of fatal substances was seen among every social class; even the nobility would often use it to dispose of unwanted political or economic opponents.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is a bat in {{the genus}} Triaenops found on Madagascar, {{mainly in the}} drier regions. It was known as Triaenops rufus until 2009, when it was {{discovered}} that that name had been incorrectly applied to the species. Triaenops rufus is a synonym of Triaenops persicus, a Middle Eastern species closely related to T.menamena— the Malagasy species had previously been placed as a subspecies of T.persicus by some authors. Triaenops menamena is mostly found in forests, but also occurs in other habitats. It often roosts in large colonies and eats insects such as butterflies and moths. Because of its wide range, <b>common</b> <b>occurrence,</b> and tolerance of habitat degradation, it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E
5|$|While Cagney was in New York, his brother, who had {{effectively}} {{become his}} agent, angled {{for a substantial}} pay raise and more personal freedom for his brother. The success of The Public Enemy and Blonde Crazy forced Warner Bros.' hand. They eventually offered Cagney a contract for $1000 a week. Cagney's first film upon returning from New York was 1932's Taxi!. The film is notable for not only being {{the first time that}} Cagney danced on screen, but it was also the last time he allowed himself to be shot at with live ammunition (a relatively <b>common</b> <b>occurrence</b> at the time, as blank cartridges and squibs were considered too expensive and hard to find to use in most motion picture filming). He had been shot at in The Public Enemy, but during filming for Taxi!, he was almost hit.|$|E
