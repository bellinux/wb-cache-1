She also manages the Mrs Gaskell trick of making the town itself the main character ... The result (and of course I mean this as a compliment) sharply recalls another TV portrait of life in a town near Manchester. Admittedly, Cranford features more Annie Walkers and fewer Elsie Tanners than early Coronation Street. Otherwise, the power of the matriarchs, the centrality of gossip and - when <b>the</b> <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> <b>down</b> - <b>the</b> touching sense of community, are all winningly similar. So too is the ability to subject the characters to clear-eyed scrutiny, while still retaining an obvious affection for them." ...|$|R

40|$|Open {{source and}} peer {{production}} have been praised as organisational models {{that could change}} {{the world for the}} better. It is commonly asserted that almost any societal activity could benefit from distributed, bottom-up collaboration — by making societal interaction more open, more social, and more democratic. However, we also need to be mindful of the limits of these models. How could they function in environments hostile to openness? Security is a societal domain more prone to secrecy than any other, except perhaps for romantic love. In light of the destructive capacity of contemporary cyber attacks, how has the Internet survived without a comprehensive security infrastructure? Secrecy vs. openness describes the realities of Internet security production through the lenses of open source and peer production theories. The study offers a glimpse into the fascinating communities of technical experts, who played a pivotal role when <b>the</b> <b>chips</b> <b>were</b> <b>down</b> for <b>the</b> Internet after large-scale attacks. After an initial flirtation with openness in the early years, operational Internet security communities have put in place institutional mechanisms that have resulted in less open forms of social production.

5000|$|After the belated {{start to}} his {{representative}} career, Thorp had racked up an amazing fourteen {{appearances in the}} Big V in only six years. Heading into the 1925 season aged 34, Thorp played every week and then decided to retire, still {{on top of his}} game. In sixteen seasons, he had missed just ten matches, with his worst injury a broken wrist that cost him three games in 1914. Overall, it was a tribute to his sportsmanship and integrity as a player. During his career he had played a major part in the Tigers' rise from mediocrity to the dizzy heights of winning successive premierships that cemented their place as one of the powerhouses of the competition. Thorp appeared in every big game and final the Tigers played, and was always a steady influence when <b>the</b> <b>chips</b> <b>were</b> <b>down.</b> Unfortunately for <b>the</b> Tigers, they couldn't find an adequate replacement for him until the early 1930s, by which time they had lost a succession of Grand Finals when the weakness at full back was often exposed.|$|R
40|$|The {{compromise}} {{for achieving}} this efficiency is the dependency {{of the programs}} length {{on the length of}} the transform, i. e., for longer transforms longer programs are generated. But the com-plexity order of the program length is N loglog N, and the propor-tionality constant is small, resulting in the program lengths shown in Table IV. These results are of real practical significance and can be immediately applied to create digital signal processing software of very high time efficiency. Since the cost of memory <b>chips</b> <b>is</b> going <b>down</b> rapidly, <b>the</b> concept of variable length of programs will become important for efficiency even if they occupy more space than programs of fixed size do.

40|$|Abstract. A {{successful}} {{detection of}} the stealthy dopant-level circuit (trojan), proposed by Becker et al. at CHES 2013 [1], is reported. Con-trary to an assumption made by Becker et al., dopant types in active region are visible with either {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) or focused ion beam (FIB) imaging. The successful measurement is ex-plained by an LSI failure analysis technique called the passive volt-age contrast [2]. The experiments are conducted by measuring a ded-icated chip. The chip uses the diffusion programmable device [3]: an anti-reverse-engineering technique by the same principle as the stealthy dopant-level trojan. <b>The</b> <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> delayered <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> contact layer, and images are taken with (1) an optical microscope, (2) SEM, and (3) FIB. As a result, the four possible dopant-well combinations, namely (i) p+/n-well, (ii) p+/p-well, (iii) n+/n-well and (iv) n+/p-well are dis-tinguishable in the SEM images. Partial but sufficient detection is also achieved with FIB. Although the stealthy dopant-level circuits are visi-ble, however, they potentially make a detection harder. That is because the contact layer should be measured. We show that imaging the contact layer is at most 16 -times expensive {{than that of a}} metal layer {{in terms of the number}} of images 3...|$|R
40|$|My journey as a {{graduate}} student started with an end goal of earning a doctoral degree. But, now, it is the journey that I cherish more than the achieved goal. First, I must thank my advisor Mike Dahlin the most. He not only helped me in setting my research direction but also {{played a major role in}} shaping me as a researcher. I am really glad that he has given me ample freedom to work on problems that interested me while ensuring that I produced the best work by critiquing dispassionately about various aspects of the problems that I worked on. His sermons on clear presentation, implementation, and evaluation of ideas in experimental software systems has influenced the way I approach, think about, and present problems in systems research. It was a great experience working with Mike who understands and appreciates the importance of building practical systems. I am really fortunate to work closely with Lorenzo Alvisi in the LASR lab. I am impressed as well as influenced by his research style with emphasis on attention for details which adds scientific rigor to system research. He is a great mentor who can boost your morale when <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> <b>down</b> and makes <b>the</b> LASR lab a fun place to work at. I would like to thank Harrick Vin for introducing me to the LASR lab and for giving me an opportunity to work on interesting problems. Although we did not closely collaborate over the years, we discussed on the problems that I was working on when possible. I must thank Adnan Aziz who served as my adviso...|$|R
