40|$|Dodge (1943) {{introduced}} a single level attribute <b>continuous</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> designated as CSP- 1 {{for the application}} of continuous production processes. Govindaraju & Kandasamy (2000) developed a new single level <b>continuous</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> whose sampling inspection phase is characterized by a maximum allowable number of non-conforming units c, and a constant sampling rate f and was designated as CSP-C. In this paper, a modification is proposed on the CSP-C <b>continuous</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan.</b> In this modified plan, sampling inspection is continued until the occurrence of c+ 1 non-conforming units, provided the first m sampled units have been found conforming during the sampling phase. Using a Markov chain model, expressions for the performance measures of the modified CSP-C plan are derived. The main advantage of the modified plan is {{that it is possible to}} lower the average outgoing quality limit. Csp-C Continuous Sampling, Production Processes, Consumer Protection,...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In 1986 Taguchi {{presented}} the quadratic function for describing {{the loss of}} quality due to deviation from the production value. The objective then is to improve quality by minimizing the quadratic loss function which reflects the loss of both, the producer and the consumer. Subsequently, Kapur et al. (1987, 1988, 1994) addressed the problem of deriving a loss function to be applied for determining the design of specification limits. This article further explores the problem of determining an integrated design of a Type I <b>continuous</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> (CSP- 1) and the specification limits. By modifying Kapur and Wang’s (1987) model, we not only obtain economic specification limits, but also obtaib an optimal CSP- 1 plan for inspection.

(1957) with two sampling levels. A modified tightened two-level <b>continuous</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> is considered, for which the rules concerning partial inspection depend, in part, on the length of time it takes to decide that the process quality is good enough that 100 % inspection may be suspended (e. g. the time required to find i consecutive items free of defects). Using a Markov chain model, expressions for the performance measures of the modified MLP-T- 2 plan are derived. The modified MLP-T- 2 plan is shown to be identical to the MLP-T- 2 plan. Tables are also presented for the selection of the modified MLP-T- 2 plan when the AQL or LQL and AOQL are specified. ...|$|E

Thus, the main objective of the industry achieving higher quality with less cost is essential and extremely difficult to obtain.

Unequal subgroups are also included, in order to help the user to construct the standardisation control charts. The package is friendly, flexible and interactive in nature.
