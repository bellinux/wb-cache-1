25|$|Craniofacial {{anomalies}} - Includes <b>craniosynostosis,</b> plagiocephaly, and syndromes {{associated with}} these defects. In cases of <b>craniosynostosis</b> where surgical intervention is necessary, the involvement {{of a team of}} multi-disciplinary professionals is of utmost importance. Team members often come from departments of plastic surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, neurosurgery, audiology, dentistry, orthodontics, and speech and language pathology. These professionals often assist not only in operational procedures, but in developing coordinated care plans for the child throughout their life.|$|E
25|$|Trigonocephaly {{seems to}} be the most {{compliant}} form of <b>craniosynostosis</b> for surgery. Because of standardization of current surgical approaches there is no surgical mortality and complications are few to none.|$|E
25|$|Various other diseases, invoked as {{possible}} explanations to his early demise, included Marfan syndrome, Wilson-Turner X-linked mental retardation syndrome, Fröhlich syndrome (adiposogenital dystrophy), Klinefelter syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, aromatase excess syndrome {{in conjunction with}} sagittal <b>craniosynostosis</b> syndrome, Antley–Bixler syndrome or one of its variants, and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Craniofacial {{surgery is}} divided into {{pediatric}} and adult craniofacial surgery. Pediatric craniofacial surgery mostly revolves around the treatment of congenital anomalies of the craniofacial skeleton and soft tissues, such as cleft lip and palate, <b>craniosynostosis,</b> and pediatric fractures. Adult craniofacial surgery deals mostly with fractures and secondary surgeries (such as orbital reconstruction) along with orthognathic surgery. Craniofacial surgery {{is an important part}} of all plastic surgery training programs, further training and subspecialisation is obtained via a craniofacial fellowship. Craniofacial surgery is also practiced by Maxillo-Facial surgeons.|$|E
25|$|Posada's son, Jorge Luis, {{suffers from}} <b>craniosynostosis,</b> {{which he was}} {{diagnosed}} with 10 days after he was born. Posada established the Jorge Posada Foundation, which helps fund research and offers family support. Jorge released a charity wine in 2008 called Jorge Cabernet to raise funds for his foundation. In June 2011, his son underwent what Posada hoped would be the final surgery for the condition. During his all-star appearances, Jorge would have Jorge Luis at his side during the player introductions. One time during the intro of the 2002 game – the game where he started – Jorge Luis jogged out for his father, but nearly ran all {{the way out of the}} park – only to be quickly picked up by AL teammate Manny Ramirez.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Craniosynostosis</b> – Much less common, but {{potentially}} {{much more serious}} than plagiocephaly is <b>craniosynostosis.</b> <b>Craniosynostosis</b> is a congenital abnormality originating from {{the central nervous system}} in which {{one or more of the}} fibrous joints in the skull close [...] prematurely. This fusion often requires surgical intervention to reconstruct the skull (see craniofacial surgery) either to bring it back to its normal position or to give it a more natural shape. It is believed that <b>craniosynostosis</b> occurs in 1 out of 1,800 to 2,200 live births, and is often a side effect of an associated syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|All cytostatics {{are strong}} teratogens, {{abortion}} is usually recommended when pregnancy is found during or before chemotherapy. Aminopterin, a cytostatic drug with anti-folate effect, was {{used during the}} 1950s and 1960s to induce therapeutic abortions. In some cases the abortion didn´t happen, but the newborns suffered a fetal aminopterin syndrome consisting of growth retardation, <b>craniosynostosis,</b> hydrocephalus, facial dismorphities, mental retardation and/or leg defomities ...|$|E
2500|$|Distraction osteogenesis (DO) {{is used in}} [...] {{orthopedic}} surgery and oral and maxillofacial surgery to repair skeletal deformities and in reconstructive surgery. It was originally used to treat problems like unequal leg length, but since the 1980s is most commonly used to treat issues like hemifacial microsomia, micrognathism (chin so small it causes health problems), craniofrontonasal dysplasias, <b>craniosynostosis,</b> as well as airway obstruction in babies caused by glossoptosis (tongue recessed too far back in the mouth) or micrognathism.|$|E
2500|$|Posada is {{only the}} fifth MLB catcher with at least 1,500 hits, 350 doubles, 275 home runs, and 1,000 RBIs in a career. From 2000 to 2011, he {{compiled}} more RBIs and home runs than any other catcher in baseball. He is the only MLB catcher to ever bat [...]330 or better with 40 doubles, 20 home runs, and 90 RBIs in a single season. Away from baseball, Posada {{is the founder of}} the Jorge Posada Foundation, which is involved with research for <b>craniosynostosis,</b> a birth defect that impacts his son.|$|E
2500|$|Several trials on {{the safety}} and {{teratogenicity}} of nitrofurantoin in pregnancy have shown mixed results. A retrospective study in 2009 claimed that several birth defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, ophthalmic malformations, cleft lip and cleft palate, and atrial septal defect, were more common in neonates exposed to nitrofurantoin during pregnancy. A meta analysis of four out of twenty-two available studies {{on the safety}} of nitrofurantoin found no increased risk. A case-control study in 1998 found {{an increased risk of}} <b>craniosynostosis</b> after exposure to [...] "nitrosatable" [...] drugs. A more recent 2013 population-based cohort study which used women registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database and linked the subjects to a birth outcomes database, however, found no increased risk of major malformations in neonates born to women who took nitrofurantoin in early pregnancy. Many of the studies showing increased risk of nitrofurantoin had limitations and relied on patients' recall of the antibiotics they took during pregnancy rather than objective data, which may have led to recall bias. Nevertheless, in light of these conflicting data, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends using antibiotics only for appropriate indications and for the shortest effective duration.|$|E
5000|$|For example, one can {{consider}} {{the number of}} closed sutures. If {{only one of the}} four sutures is prematurely closed (single suture <b>craniosynostosis),</b> the <b>craniosynostosis</b> is referred to as 'simple' (or 'isolated'). Whereas when two or more sutures are no longer open, the <b>craniosynostosis</b> is 'complex'.|$|E
5000|$|A third {{classification}} {{involves the}} presence or absence of an identified craniofacial syndrome. <b>Craniosynostosis</b> where no extracranial deformations are present, is called non-syndromic or 'isolated' <b>craniosynostosis.</b> When there are extracranial deformations present, for instance involving the limbs, heart, central nervous system or the respiratory tract, you may speak of a syndromic form of <b>craniosynostosis.</b> More than 180 identified syndromes show deformations due to <b>craniosynostosis.</b> The following syndromes are associated with fibroblast growth factor receptors: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Craniosynostosis</b> {{occurs in}} one in 2000 births. <b>Craniosynostosis</b> {{is part of}} a {{syndrome}} in 15 to 40% of the patients, but it usually occurs as an isolated condition.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Craniosynostosis</b> - Much less common, but {{potentially}} {{much more serious}} than plagiocephaly is <b>craniosynostosis.</b> <b>Craniosynostosis</b> is a congenital abnormality originating from {{the central nervous system}} in which {{one or more of the}} fibrous joints in the skull close prematurely.

50|$|New {{insights}} {{have given}} fuel to a debate whether {{there might be}} an intrinsic factor causing the premature fusion of the sutures. Brain structures of children with <b>craniosynostosis</b> were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. Differences were seen compared with the brain structures of normal children. The question now is whether these differences are caused by the <b>craniosynostosis,</b> or are the cause of <b>craniosynostosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{diagnostic}} {{factor is}} a malformation of the skull. The two most common types of <b>craniosynostosis</b> are sagittal and bicoronal. Sagittal <b>craniosynostosis</b> manifests itself by causing a long narrow skull, resembling a football. It is quantitatively determined {{by measuring the}} anterior to posterior (front to back) diameter of the skull. An increased A-P diameter indicates a malformed fusion of the sagittal suture. Individuals affected with sagittal <b>craniosynostosis</b> have narrow, prominent foreheads {{and the back of}} the head is much larger than normal. The “soft spot” is very small or missing altogether with this particular type of <b>craniosynostosis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Not all cranial {{abnormalities}} seen {{in children}} with <b>craniosynostosis</b> are solely {{a consequence of the}} premature fusion of a cranial suture. This is especially true in the cases with syndromic <b>craniosynostosis.</b> Findings include elevation of the intracranial pressure; obstructive sleep apnoea(OSA); abnormalities in the skull base and neurobehavioral impairment.|$|E
