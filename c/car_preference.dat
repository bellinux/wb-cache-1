40|$|ABSTRACTComparing <b>car</b> <b>preference</b> and ownership: {{predictions}} {{based on}} human values, product attributes and socio-demographic variablesSome consumers can own a particular vehicle while preferring {{another type of}} vehicle. This {{might be due to}} differences in attributes between vehicle types, as well as to differences between socio-demographic or motivational human values {{associated with the use of}} this product. The identification of what are the predictors of preference and ownership can shed light on what are the most appropriate variables to be used in the strategy of automotive market segmentation. The purpose of this empirical research study was to compare the influence of human values, the attributes of the car and socio-demographic variables on preference and ownership by car type. The sample consisted of 209 car users, reflecting a 0. 87 power in this study. Data were collected using the survey method and logistic regressions for each type of car were conducted. The results showed that there are different motivations that predict preference for type of car ownership and that vehicle attributes are stronger predictors than the motivations or socio-demographic variables, regarding both <b>car</b> <b>preference</b> and ownership...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} study analyses {{travel mode}} choice {{in a student}} sample on four frequent trips: To the university, to work, to the favourite leisure activity, and to the favourite shop. The decision to use the car in contrast to alternative travel modes is modelled for each individual trip using a two-level structural equation model with trip specific attributes on Level 1 and person specific attributes on Level 2. Data was gathered in an online travel survey on a student sample of the Ruhr-University in Bochum. Three thousand five hundred and sixty students reported their mode choice for 26, 865 individual trips. On the person level a comprehensive action determination model was applied to explain variation in person specific <b>car</b> <b>preference,</b> whereas on the situation level car availability, trip duration, day of travel, disruption in public transportation, weather, daylight, and purpose of the trip were included as predictors. The proposed two-level model {{is supported by the}} data, Level 1 predictors explain 62 % of Level 1 variation, the Level 2 model explains 48 % of Level 2 variance. The intraclass-correlation of <b>car</b> <b>preference</b> is. 535. In a final step, interactions between person and trip specific variables were explored. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|After nearly 80 {{years since}} the {{construction}} of its core, represented today by the city’s central area, Londrina, located {{in the state of}} Parana, has the appearance of a new city but its features and trends of planning policies depict the bad examples of Brazilian cities. With a booming urban growth, from north to south of the county, the urban interstices represented by big voids {{in the middle of the}} city created speculation and the concept of an ideal city slowly disappeared. With a metropolitan appearance and, at the same time, with small town aspects, Londrina stands out as an automobile-oriented city, a fact that has impacted the livelihood of the population, generating environmental impacts for all social classes. This paper discusses how the form of occupation in Londrina, characterized by the sprawl phenomenon and its relation to <b>car</b> <b>preference</b> as a mode of transporta-tion has generated urban environmental impacts. It was concluded that the choice of using cars in Londrina, as well in other medium-sized Brazilian cities studied by the comparative method, has increased and has generated bottlenecks in traffi c.

40|$|In 1991, a {{representative}} survey of drivers {{was conducted in}} 15 European countries. This project was named `SARTRE' which stands for 'Social Attitudes to Road Traffic Risk in Europe'. The survey focused on drivers' road behaviour, attitudes and opinions concerning drinking and driving, speeding and seat belt use, opinions on accident causation and on traffic measures, experiences with police enforcement, perceptions of behaviours of other drivers, <b>car</b> <b>preferences,</b> experiences with driving in foreign countries, and risk perception. Altogether more than 17. 000 European car drivers participated in the survey. One of the aims of SARTRE was to monitor car drivers' changes in opinions, attitudes and norms over time. Therefore the survey was held again in 1996, this time in 19 European countries and with an improved questionnaire. The new project was termed "SARTRE- 2 ". In the paper {{the focus is on}} the following research questions: 1) How have opinions about road safety measures changed in EU; 2) Are there important national differences in opinions and norms concerning road safety measures; and 3) How can we describe the general dimensions along which EU-car drivers differ? To study European differences a non-linear canonical correlation analysis was performed. Canonical correlation analysis (hereafter abbreviated as CCA) can be applied when we are dealing with two sets of variables. Our research problem also involves two sets of variables indicating different nationalities and another set of variables indicating opinions and norms concerning road safety measures.

30|$|In this study, {{we present}} {{results from a}} moderate-sample survey of the public’s {{priorities}} for automated <b>cars</b> and <b>preferences</b> for their specific attributes {{in the context of}} a stated-preference survey. The context of the stated-preference survey is long-distance travel (specifically to visit relatives), and a novel result is that travelers appear to value both their ‘effective’ or average speed and their maximum speed (i.e., their ‘cruising speed’ under free-flow conditions). Results regarding the public’s priorities demonstrate that safety appears to clearly be a higher priority than congestion reduction, a finding which has consequences for the car-following distances that are programmed into the control algorithms of automated cars. Documenting this finding is important, as decisions must be made in the near future by driving-algorithm designers, public-sector regulators, and ultimately the judiciary regarding the guidelines for acceptable automated driving-behavior instructions.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{treats the}} topic of environmentally unfriendly consumption behaviour in relation to air pollution {{and the use of}} automobiles in Mexico City by analyzing three related aspects: i) relevant factors of driving patterns, ii) differences in the extent of pollution arising from environmentally friendlier vehicle use, and iii) the attitude of private motorists regarding the adoption of environmentally friendlier behaviour. The research includes not only economic but also social considerations. The specific objectives are to a) determine driving patterns specific to the Distrito Federal (core of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area), b) assess the behaviour of the driver regarding vehicle use and c) assess the conditions under which a switch to environmentally friendly alternatives related automobile use is possible. These objectives are analyzed using the approach of the Lancaster model of consumer behaviour with quantitative (the Distrito Federal’s Vehicle Verification Program 2003 - 2004 information) and qualitative (a Mexico City’s 2006 survey about consumers’ <b>car</b> <b>preferences)</b> data in three regression models: linear, logit and multinomial logit. The findings of the research are compared with the results of other related studies and with programs that have been implemented to date. The study demonstrates that several structural and behavioural factors determine the level of impact that private motorists have on urban air pollution. Also, it is demonstrated that the relation that motorists have with their vehicles revolves around function and use rather than simple ownership. In this sense, the more important results are that factors like income or purchase price do not explain automobile use; attitudes or personal attributes explain the behaviour much better than purely economic factors or the vehicle itself. One main conclusion is that the program implemented thus far to control vehicle use and alleviate air pollution in Mexico City has actually contributed to increased automobile use. In general, the approach applied demonstrates that sociological context is an intrinsic part of motorist choices regarding vehicle use, and that perceptions and attitudes influence motorists decisions. ...|$|R

Depending on chain length they provide potential for evaluating different sources of C in soil: shoots, roots and microorganisms. This, {{together with their}} fast turnover and transformation in living and decaying plant tissues, suggests the use of FA molecular ratios as source indicators in soil. To evaluate the applicability of FAs as source indicators, their dynamics in plant tissue and soil were traced during a laboratory experiment using the highly productive perennial C 4 energy grass Miscanthus x giganteus (Greef et Deu.). For the comprehensive use of FAs as source indicators various ratios were calculated: fatty acid ratio (originally defined as carboxylic acid ratio: <b>CAR),</b> carbon <b>preference</b> index (CPI), average chain length (ACL) and unsaturated vs. saturated C 18 acids. The FA composition was specific for individual plant tissues {{as indicated by the}} CAR, with high values in roots and lower ones in the above ground plant tissue.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess patients' {{satisfaction}} with out of hours care by a general practice cooperative {{compared with that}} by a deputising service. DESIGN: Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING: A general practice cooperative in London and a deputising service operating in an overlapping area. SUBJECTS: Weighted samples of patients receiving telephone advice, a home visit, or attending a primary care centre after contacting either service in an eight week period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' overall satisfaction and scores for specific aspects of satisfaction. Satisfaction with telephone advice or attendance at centre compared with home visit. Relation between satisfaction and patient's age, sex, ethnic group, <b>car</b> ownership, <b>preference</b> for consulting own doctor, and expectation of a visit. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 67 % (1555 / 2312). There was little difference in overall satisfaction between patients contacting the cooperative or the deputising service, but patients contacting the latter were less satisfied with the explanation and advice received and the wait for a visit. There were significant differences between patients in different age and ethnic groups, with white patients and those aged over 60 years being more satisfied. Lower scores for overall satisfaction were reported by patients who received telephone advice, those who {{would have preferred to}} see their own doctor or who originally wanted a home visit, and those who waited longer for their consultation. Overall levels of patients' satisfaction seemed to be lower than previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: There were larger differences in satisfaction between different groups of patients than between different models of organisation for out of hours care. A shift to a service based predominantly on telephone advice may lead to increased patient dissatisfaction...|$|R

40|$|As bounded {{rational}} agents, consumers face many uncertainties {{during the}} process of innovation adoption. The consumers that face most uncertainties are the ones that first adopt new products. These so-called ‘innovators’ are important for the innovation diffusion process. They take the risks for others by adopting early, they partly test the products’ functionality, they contribute to further improvement of the product, they familiarize others with the product and they can contribute to the build-up of sufficient critical mass for the diffusion process to become self sustaining. To reduce the uncertainties that are attached to innovation adoption, consumers engage in a search for information prior to adoption. When searching, consumers can consult multiple information sources. Since innovative individuals are the ones that first take the risk of innovating, it is crucial to understand how their information search patterns using various channels differ from other individuals. Based on a literature review and empirical findings four external sources of information are identified: interpersonal sources, mass media, the World Wide Web (WWW) and retailers. Until now the link between innovativeness and the use of information sources was only poorly understood. To improve this understanding, this thesis consists of five empirical studies that investigate the relationship between consumer innovativeness and the use of information sources in two product domains: consumer electronics and automobiles. In the first two studies, based on qualitative and quantitative survey data, it is found that consumer electronics is a low risk multiple product domain f in which several clusters of products can be identified that are owned in combination together. Automobiles are considered to be a high risk single product domain. In the third study it is found that in a low risk domain such consumer electronics, innovative consumers get their information from outside a social system through specialized channels such as mass media and the WWW. In the fourth study it found that in a high risk domain such as cars consumers balance their search effort among the different information sources. A final study reveals that within the domain of automobiles three types of <b>preferences</b> for <b>cars</b> be identified: <b>preferences</b> for environmental friendly cars, for high performing cars and for convenient <b>cars.</b> These <b>preferences</b> were found to be related to consumer innovativeness and use of information sources: consumers with strong preferences for a high performance car are more innovative and make more use of mass media and WWW when searching for information. These media can be used to target the specific segment of consumers with a preference for high performance (and often more polluting) cars, using communication campaigns, in order to influence their preferences. The result further demonstrates that the preferences of innovators are not always representative for the entire population. For more successful innovation development it is recommended that, explicit attention is paid to the preferences of non-innovative consumers in the innovation process...|$|R
40|$|Costs of car {{ownership}} {{for company}} cars drivers and private car owners are very different. Car use, car choice decisions and <b>preferences</b> for <b>car</b> characteristics may therefore differ substantially {{between these two}} markets. In this paper, we present results of {{a study on the}} <b>preferences</b> of company <b>car</b> drivers for alternative fuel vehicles and their characteristics, based on data from an online stated choice experiment in the Netherlands. Results show that, assuming current <b>car</b> characteristics, <b>preferences</b> for alternative fuel vehicles, and for electric and fuel cell cars in particular, are substantially lower than those for the conventional technology. Limited driving ranges, long recharge/refuelling times and limited availability of refuelling opportunities, are to a large extent responsible for this. Preferences for alternative fuel vehicles increase considerably with improvements on these aspects, especially for the hybrid and flexifuel car. Under the current company car tax system in the Netherlands, which favours cleaner technologies, these two car types are even preferred to the conventional technology, assuming equal catalogue prices and personal monthly cost contributions. Comparing results with those from a similar choice experiment among private car owners shows that willingness to pay patterns for AFV improvements regarding driving range, recharge and refuelling times, fuel availability and diversity in AFV supply, are considerably different for company car drivers than for private car owners. Company and private car drivers may therefore react (very) differently to future improvements in AFV technology and fuel availability. We finally show that <b>preferences</b> of company <b>car</b> drivers for fuel cell and electric cars depend to a large extent on annual mileage. Market share simulations show that potential early adopters of electric and fuel cell cars can be found among people with a relatively low annual mileage...|$|R
