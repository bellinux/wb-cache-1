5000|$|The {{creation}} of the Gipton estate {{can be traced back}} to the work of Charles Jenkinson, the vicar of a poor city-centre parish. Jenkinson was familiar with the poor housing conditions of the local parishioners and was determined to help alleviate them. He finally got his chance in 1933 after the Labour Party won the municipal elections and set up a Housing Committee to oversee his programme and appointed him <b>chair.</b> <b>Work</b> began on the Gipton estate in April 1934 and involved the construction of a [...] "Garden suburb" [...] for the working classes with 2,750 houses with accommodation for around 13,000 people. The project was to take two years with the original programme calling for two roads 150 and 125 feet wide with tram tracks in the centre and grass verges at the side. The tracks were to link the estate to the city and other centres. There would be a large shopping centre with 40 shops at the heart of the estate and secondary shopping centres at other points. In addition, sites would be reserved for churches, schools, playing fields, medical practitioners, dentists, and other public facilities and the whole plan would cost £12 million. When complete the estate took on a structural character which, while not specific to the final plan, remains fundamentally unchanged today.|$|E

Possible role definitions included seeing department <b>chair</b> <b>work</b> as leader, scholar, faculty developer, or manager. The study surveyed 800 department chairs from 100 higher education institutions with a 36 -item questionnaire. Of those, 539 were returned. Analysis of the results indicated that chairs view those items which are of immediate benefit to the faculty and departments they chair as more important than activities which may benefit the university as a whole. Specifically, of the 10 chair duties selected as most important, eight describe aspects of faculty development, suggesting that chairs see assisting colleagues as of primary importance in their job.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} I {{summarise}} the main findings {{from more than}} 60 years of research of Person-Centred-Experiential (PCE) psychotherapies. I begin by pointing out the pioneering contributions of Carl Rogers to this literature. The body of the chapter summarises three main areas of research: First, the highly promising evidence on the quantitative effects of PCE therapies, drawing on a large meta-analysis (Elliott et al., 2013); second, research on client in-session processes, particularly the various attempts to capture the sequence by which clients change over time in therapy and the relation of these processes to outcome; third, the contribution of therapists and therapy methods to client change, including the sometimes-controversial research on therapist process guiding (e. g., <b>chair</b> <b>work).</b> I conclude with an account of how PCE therapists can become more involved in research and describe a research pathway aimed at helping their approach find a more secure place in mental health care policy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Both {{eating and}} weight {{disorders}} are prevalent {{in our society}} but many sufferers {{do not have access}} to specialist treatments, especially those living in remote and rural areas. Video therapy is proposed as a potential solution, allowing therapists to deliver psychological treatments without the costs associated with travel. Furthermore, there is a gap in the evidence base for those with co-morbid obesity and atypical eating disorders, but it is likely that treatments which focus on linking past and present patterns of behaviour and emphasise cognitive, behavioural and emotional change will be most effective. A naturalistic single case design was used to pilot the feasibility of providing video therapy using the schema therapy mode model, which involves a range of ‘active ’ techniques including <b>chair</b> <b>work</b> and imagery. Results suggest that videoconferencing may be well suited to the delivery of experiential psychotherapy, leading to change across several domains. Scores on the EDE-Q showed a 77 % improvement and the client was abstinent from vomiting during the last 28 days of treatment. The findings from this study indicate that video therapy may be effective for this co-morbid diagnostic group and highlight the need for further larger scale research...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{explanation}} and empirical research on work stress {{conducted by the}} scholars in the field shows {{that it is an}} unignorable workplace problem. Most of the researchers agree that work stress is caused by the workstation design or workplace environment. An optimal workstation design is where the workplace environment supports the needs of the workers and where a worker operates in a conducive environment to the individual’s abilities. It is important for organization to match the work place environment and the individual who performs the tasks. This is the goal of ergonomics. The discussion of ergonomics workstation design in this paper inclusive of working chairs, work area design, acoustic, lighting, working hours and humidity level. The stress outcomes include somatic complaints, fatigue, job dissatisfaction and intention to quit. This paper presented a study on 35 manufacturing operators in one multinational electronic company. Multiple regression analysis indicated that 62. 9 % of the variance in stress outcomes is accounted by the independent variables i. e., <b>chair,</b> <b>work</b> area, acoustics, lighting, working hours and humidity. Chair/office seating, working hours and humidity were found to have significant relationship with the outcomes of work stress. Work area design, acoustics and lighting, however were found not significant. This finding supports a better evaluation of policies ’ development of workplace ergonomics by management. In the long term such action taken by management authorities to enhance workplace ergonomics would produce benefits for the institution in terms of minimizing the outcomes of work stress...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to justify urgency and efficiency of teachers’ collective work of the chair on formation of integrated special professional competences of trainees. Methods. Teamwork is considered as a leading method of aim realisation; it is suggested to carry this method in practice {{on the basis of}} a situational technique of intra-chair structure formation – composite staff-clusters, whose activity is based on synergetic interaction of educational process participants. Results. Described innovations will give the chance to carry out necessary integration of educational processes content; will promote natural interaction of teachers on the basis of the generated complete integrated subsystem – composite staff-clusters. The innovation vector can be connected with more dimensional field of integration, i. e. generating not only special professional competences, but also general professional and common cultural ones. Scientific novelty. Activity of pedagogical composite staff-clusters is offered to consider in the complete block of scientific-theoretical and practice-pedagogical aspects: scientifically-organizational, academic, practice-organizational, educational, etc. Scientific novelty of article is connected with expansion of some content positions which are based on scientific-theoretical conclusions of researches pedagogic-collective (by V. A. Suhomlinsky, etc.) and organizational-psychological (by K. Rogers, etc.) processes, and also ideas of synergetics extrapolated into organizational-pedagogical processes. It is shown that efficiency of educational process can be reached under a condition of organizational and methodical work interrelatedness; synthesis of administrative and performing activity on the basis of the whole educational process interaction. Necessity of composite pedagogical creativity is proved by synergetic processes and motivation-emotional characteristics. Practical significance. Authors give specific proposals concerning actual problems solution in higher school: problem overcoming of “disciplinary step-type behaviour” of <b>chair</b> <b>work,</b> a stereotype of “formal interdisciplinary interaction” by re-structuring of chairs on a scientific basis of staff creativity. The authors suggest that creation of similar new (innovative) pedagogical working conditions of high school chairs is necessary in the nearest future. Such organisation will give the chance to carry out real communication of a science with practice and as a whole will raise quality and productivity of educational processes in higher educational institutions. </p...|$|E
