40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThis {{doctoral}} thesis comprises a critical {{comparison of the}} theme <b>of</b> <b>concursus,</b> {{the way in which}} God and humanity interact, in the Pentecostal-Charismatic and Process-Relational traditions. The comparison is literature-based; similarities and differences in the theological literature of each tradition are compared {{in order to determine the}} extent of compatibilities and incompatibilities. The hypothesis is that similarities in the literature sufficiently leverage differences. The first chapter includes a statement of the problem, namely that the global expansion of the Pentecostal-Charismatic movements necessitates interaction with more academically and philosophically oriented theological traditions such as Process- Relational theology. The second chapter comprises an historical survey of the Pentecostal-Charismatic movements, including key dogmas and practices. Chapter three comprises an historical survey of Process-Relational theology, including its philosophical, metaphysical, and scientific orientations. Seminal Process- Relational theists such as Whitehead, Hartshorne, and Cobb are surveyed. Chapter four consists of a broad historical survey of the theological theme <b>of</b> <b>concursus,</b> including the notions of causation, free will, and determinism in both philosophy and theology. Further, the fourth chapter includes a broad historical survey of pneumatology, which is framed as the basis for a comparison <b>of</b> <b>concursus.</b> Chapters five and six comprise surveys <b>of</b> <b>concursus</b> in the Pentecostal- Charismatic and Process-Relational traditions respectively. Chapter seven entails an extensive analysis of differences and synthesis of similarities between the Pentecostal-Charismatic and Process-Relational notions <b>of</b> <b>concursus.</b> Four differences and four similarities are identified. Differences and similarities are ranked and compared for compatibility. Ultimately, the research question is answered affirmatively and conditionally: yes, according to the literature of both traditions, similarities sufficiently leverage differences, but socio-linguistic barriers may obstruct meaningful mutual transformation. Chapter eight concludes with a brief exploration of ecclesial and social implications. South Afric...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} forecasting the number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> incurred. After subtracting the number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> reported to date, the number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> incurred but not reported (IBNR) can be forecasted. The basic model assumes that the number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> per accident period follows an autoregressive moving average time series process. Instead of assuming the data {{are available in the}} usual claim run-off triangle format, we assume that the only data available are the number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> reported at the valuation date for each accident interval of an observation period. Box-Jenkins methods are used to forecast the ultimate number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> incurred and to obtain approximate confidence intervals for the number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> incurred. The forecast of the ultimate number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> incurred is used to derive the IBNR forecast. We show how additional information on the number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> reported by the valuation date can be incorporated in the 2 ̆ 7 model when the process is autoregressive...|$|R

40|$|Revised in May 2016 The <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> {{a patent}} defines {{the scope of}} patent right and {{provides}} crucial information on patent value. However, most empirical research uses only the number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> {{as an indicator of}} patent value. We show that the breadth <b>of</b> a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> Japanese patents, measured by the inverse <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> length, has significant explanatory power for patent value measured by applicant forward citations. Indeed, the explanatory power <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> breadth is comparable with that of the number <b>of</b> <b>claims.</b> The predictive power <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> breadth is stable for all quantiles in the discrete technology area, while it is far more significant for top-ranked patents in the complex technology area...|$|R
