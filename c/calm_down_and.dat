The Ohm and Tolmekians leave the Valley, and the Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them to rebuild. Deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a non-toxic tree sprouts next to Nausicaä's lost aviation goggles.|$|E
5|$|Karofsky {{is elected}} prom king, and non-candidate Kurt is elected prom queen. Kurt {{runs from the}} gym in humiliation and is consoled by Blaine. Distressed at having lost, Quinn slaps Rachel, though she {{immediately}} regrets it, while Santana is comforted by Brittany, who tells her to be herself rather than hide her lesbian identity. Kurt is able to <b>calm</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. Karofsky, abruptly faced with having to publicly dance with another boy in the traditional dance between King and Queen, cannot do it; rejecting Kurt's suggestion that he come out then and there, he instead leaves Kurt alone on the dance floor. Blaine asks Kurt to dance with him, and they are soon joined {{by the rest of}} the student body.|$|E

Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) helps Sam to <b>calm</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> they discuss Tom. Moments later, Sam publicly accepts and supports Tom and his sexuality, which local newspapers report on their front pages. The next day, as they read the newspaper, the bar's regular patronsincluding Norm (George Wendt)express their disdain toward homosexuals and their worries that Sam's support for his old friend will turn Cheers into a gay bar. Diane criticizes their homophobia and says that there are actually two gay men in the bar.|$|E
25|$|As {{it could}} be expected, when they arrived on 13 August, Marie was disillusioned. The house, {{contained}} within {{the ruins of a}} former monastery, was in disrepair, damp and rat-infested. Her in-laws were peasants who disgusted her and regarded her with deep distrust. Instead of the wealth she expected, she was faced with considerable debt. In her despondency, she locked herself in her room the first night and wrote a letter to her husband, imploring him to release her from their marriage, while threatening to take her life with arsenic. Lafarge, whose affairs were desperate, agreed to make concessions except to release her from the marriage. He promised not to assert his marital privileges until he restored the estate to its original condition. She appeared to <b>calm</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> their relationship appeared to have improved in the ensuing weeks.|$|E
25|$|Three {{years have}} passed, and George and Emily prepare to wed. The day {{is filled with}} stress. Howie Newsome is {{delivering}} milk in the pouring rain while Si Crowell, younger brother of Joe, laments how George's baseball talents will be squandered. George pays an awkward visit to his soon-to-be in-laws. Here, the Stage Manager interrupts the scene and takes the audience back a year, {{to the end of}} Emily and George's junior year. Emily confronts George about his pride, and over an ice cream soda, they discuss the future and their love for each other. George resolves not to go to college, as he had planned, but to work and eventually take over his uncle's farm. In the present, George and Emily say that they are not ready to marry—George to his mother, Emily to her father—but they both <b>calm</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> happily go through with the wedding.|$|E

This sends Ron into a panic, and he continually screams and fights {{with all his}} effort to save her, despite Harry's instruction that he <b>calm</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{think of a better}} plan. The trio and some other prisoners are rescued by Dobby, but the house-elf is killed by Bellatrix during the escape. Eventually, the trio returns to Hogwarts, hoping to find the last unknown Horcrux shown in Harry's vision. Having lost the Sword of Gryffindor to Griphook the goblin, Ron gets an idea to procure more Basilisk fangs and manages to speak enough Parseltongue to open the Chamber of Secrets, where Hermione destroys the Horcrux in Helga Hufflepuff's cup. He begins to worry about the fate of Hogwarts' elves. Upon hearing this, Hermione drops the basilisk fangs she was carrying and kisses him for the first time. He also takes part in the Battle of Hogwarts, witnessing the death of his brother Fred, and teams up with Neville to defeat Fenrir Greyback.|$|E
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to <b>calm</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E
25|$|Prayer {{appears to}} have health implications. Empirical studies suggest that mindfully reading and reciting the Psalms (from scripture) can help a person <b>calm</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> focus. Prayer is also {{positively}} correlated with happiness and religious satisfaction (Poloma & Pendleton, 1989, 1991). A study conducted by Franceis, Robbins, Lewis, and Barnes (2008) investigated the relationship between self-reported prayer frequency and measures of psychoticism and neuroticism according to the abbreviated form of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a negative correlation between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to neuroticism scores. Ladd and McIntosh (2008) suggest that prayer-related behaviors, such as bowing the head and clasping the hands together in an almost fetal position, are suggestive of “social touch” actions. Prayer in this manner may prepare an individual to carry out positive pro-social behavior after praying, due to factors such as increased {{blood flow to the}} head and nasal breathing. Overall, slight health benefits have been found fairly consistently across studies.|$|E

25|$|Codreanu {{had to go}} into hiding, {{waiting for}} things to <b>calm</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> delegating {{leadership}} to General Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul, who later assumed partial guilt for Duca's killing; Stelescu, who soon became Codreanu's adversary as head of the Crusade of Romanianism, later alleged that he had been given refuge by a cousin of Magda Lupescu, Carol's mistress, implying that the Guard was becoming corrupt ("She was a person adverse to your action. How did you get along so well?"). Codreanu's resurgence brought arrest and prosecution under the martial law imposed in the country; he was acquitted yet again. Despite Codreanu's attacks on the elite as hopelessly corrupt and self-serving, at his trial in 1934 a number of respected politicians like Gheorghe I. Brătianu, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu testified for Codreanu as character witnesses. The Iron Guard did have some links to the Nazi Party's foreign office under Alfred Rosenberg, but in 1933–34 the Romanian fascist that was the main beneficiary of financial support from Rosenberg was Codreanu's rival Octavian Goga who lacked Codreanu's mass following and thus was more biddable. A further issue for the Nazis was concern over Codreanu's statements that Romania had too many minorities for its own good, which led to fears that Codreanu might persecute the volksdeutsch minority if he came to power. But the connections between the NSDAP and the Iron Guard, as limited as they were, did add to the Legion's appeal as the Iron Guard was associated in the public mind with the apparently dynamic and successful society of Nazi Germany.|$|E

At 20:50, Keč stated [...] "I wish to release everyone and myself. Both Bosnians and Norwegians will understand this". After confirming his surrender would occur at 21:00, Keč stated that he was [...] "cold and calm" [...] and that he intended to surrender without any trouble.

500|$|Pistons coach Larry Brown {{was not yet}} very concerned, because {{fights in}} the NBA rarely lasted {{for more than a}} few seconds. During the altercation, Artest lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio {{broadcaster}} Mark Boyle. The microphone was not live. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest's personality and [...] "there was no way we were going to put an open mic in front of [...] in that situation". Pacers president Donnie Walsh later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to <b>calm</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> avoid trouble in a volatile situation. After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to eject various players before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Stephen Jackson should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if ejected, Wallace would have to walk past the Pacers bench, which could trigger another incident.|$|E
500|$|Kurt invites Blaine to the McKinley junior prom in [...] "Prom Queen". The {{attendees}} greet Karofsky's {{election as}} Prom King with great enthusiasm, but a stunned silence falls when Kurt is declared Prom Queen due to having received an {{overwhelming number of}} unwanted write-in votes in the secret balloting. Humiliated, Kurt flees in tears, but is able to <b>calm</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. The traditional dance between King and Queen is next, and Karofsky is faced with having to partner with a boy {{in front of his}} classmates. He rejects Kurt's suggestion to come out at the prom, and abandons Kurt on the dance floor as the music begins; Blaine dances with Kurt instead. At the end of the season, the glee club travels to the Nationals competition in New York City. Kurt and Rachel sneak into the Gershwin Theatre where Wicked is playing, and from the stage they sing [...] "For Good", a song from the musical. They both decide to come back to New York after graduation. New Directions finishes in twelfth place at Nationals, and upon Kurt's return to Ohio, he and Blaine declare their love for one another.|$|E

However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you get to know the person a little bit, and you <b>calm</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> then it's just work. And work is fun".

His first trial at Suzuka took place on 8–9 December 1999 {{attended}} by ex-Formula One driver Satoru Nakajima after Yoong set a lap that made him fifth fastest out of 12. Nakajima said of Yoong [...] "Alex is very much better than I originally thought". Yoong spent time at the Bukit Jalil institute with psychologist Michel Gagne and trainer Jorg Teichmann to recuperate from his injuries at Spa the previous year. His Formula Nippon career started disastrously at Suzuka after crashing his Reynard 99L Mugen at 250kph at the daunting 130R in qualifying and forced Yoong to miss the race. At Motegi, a mechanical failure was followed a stalled car at the start at Mine after starting seventh, where he proceeded to cause a multi-car pile-up in desperation to climb back up the field.
