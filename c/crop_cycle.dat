40|$|Multiple cropping, {{a common}} {{practice}} of intensive agriculture that grows crops multiple times in the agricultural land in one growing season, is {{an effective way to}} fulfill the food demand given limited cropland areas. Deriving <b>cropping</b> <b>cycles</b> from satellite data provides the spatial distribution of cropping intensities that allows for monitoring of the multiple cropping activities over large areas. Although efforts have been made to map <b>cropping</b> <b>cycles</b> at 500 m or coarser resolution, producing <b>cropping</b> <b>cycle</b> maps at high resolution remain challenging because data from single satellite sensor do not provide sufficient spatiotemporal observations. In this paper, we generate dense time series of satellite data at 30 m resolution by fusion of Landsat and MODIS data, and derive the <b>cropping</b> <b>cycles</b> from the fused time series data. The method achieves overall accuracies of 92. 5 % and 89. 2 %, respectively, for two typical regions of multiple cropping in China using samples identified based on satellite time series data, and an overall accuracy of 81. 2 % for four subregions using all samples identified based on multi-temporal high resolution images. The mapped <b>crop</b> <b>cycles</b> show to be reasonable geographically and agree with the national census data. The fusion approach provides a feasible way to map <b>cropping</b> <b>cycles</b> at 30 m resolution and enables improved depiction of the spatial distribution of multiple cropping...|$|R

Peanut is an important oil crop worldwide and shows considerable adaptability, but growth and yield are negatively affected by continuous cropping.

After four <b>cropping</b> <b>cycles,</b> the highest OM accumulation, the maximum root mass density (0 – 15 [*]cm soil depth), and the improved physical and chemical properties were recorded in the conservational tillage practices.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the agroindustrial production of sugarcane (millable stalks and sucrose yield) after successive nitrogen fertilizations of plant cane and ratoons in a reduced tillage system. The experiment was carried out at Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil, on a Rhodic Eutrustox soil, during four consecutive <b>crop</b> <b>cycles</b> (March 2005 to July 2009).

Seven practical harvesting strategies were simulated for a 27 year period. Annual gross margins were calculated and different criteria of maximum profit and minimum risk applied to identify optimal strategies. Results indicate that, for the irrigated Tala valley scenario, maximum profits would be achieved when 60 % of the total area under cane was harvested per annum. The optimal strategy identified for the rainfed Tongaat scenario was to harvest 52. 9 % per annum. This recommendation excludes the effect of the Eldana stalk borer. A sensitivity analysis showed that the recommendations at Tala valley were relatively stable and could absorb normal fluctuations in harvesting costs and the RV price.
