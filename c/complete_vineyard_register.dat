Pesticide applicators are at risk of permanently damaging their health from exposure to pesticides. In order to ensure that these employees have the proper information to protect themselves, they are required to pass a state certification test. Agriculture, in certain states, relies on a high number of immigrant workers having varying degrees of education, thus making it difficult to efficiently and effectively train each employee in the needed areas. A computer-based training program for pesticide applicators was developed to be used by agricultural workers preparing for the state certification exam. The training program was designed to be effective for people with varying degrees of knowledge and computer experience. Similarly, its design has allowed for a method of training employees in their native tongue. Agricultural workers from a <b>vineyard</b> <b>completed</b> the computer-based training, in their native language of Mexican Spanish, prior to taking the state certification test.

Wine is a {{beverage}} {{that accompanies}} and enhances {{a wide range}} of occasions, cuisines and even religious ceremonies in many cultures. It claims health benefits and brings wonderful memories to mind. We all have our own story to tell when it comes to wine. This however represents the consumer's experience. What is the producer's experience? Situation Wine markets across the globe are under pressure. According to Nielsen, over 3300 wine brands have flood grocery stores since 1999 and they now represent about 70 % of active brands. South Africa owns 2. 4 % of the world's export market share, the 9 th biggest, while wine production ranks 8 t 1, the world, producing 855, 3 million liters for 1. 7 % of the worlds total production. Wine producers receive only 2 % of the average R 24 shelf price per 750 m 1 bottle of wine sold in supermarkets and at other retail outlets. On top of this the VinPro agricultural economist says wine production costs have increased by 17 % but producers' incomes have risen only by an average of 3 %. The industry had to deal with many challenges in its more than 300 year history e. g. the <b>complete</b> destruction of <b>vineyards</b> in 1890 's due to phylloxera, single channel marketing, etc. but the economic reality of income not keeping pace with rising production costs brings {{one of the biggest challenges}} yet to the industry.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of the development perspectives of the new grape varieties, resistant to fungal diseases, promoting therefore the reduction or the suppression of phytosanitary treatments. Based on a direct survey with researchers, stakeholders, a synthesis of the scientific literature and edited research programs, we propose an overview of {{the current state of the}} art of the supply of technology, and a presentation of the main stakeholders strategy involved in the innovation chain, a synthesis of the current scientific and technical controversies, and an analysis of the undertaking of the institutions and of the legislation. Further, we provide an evaluation of the previous research program on new grape varieties of the French National Institute for Research in Agronomy (INRA) and the results of the diffusion achieved in Languedoc-Roussillon. This analysis will allow us to discuss the conditions for the success of this innovation as a competitiveness factor. Obtaining a new grape variety is a long term process that can last up to 20 or 30 years. According to the evolutionary approach (Nelson and Winter, 1982), it is the technological paradigm of the research programs intending to improve the proprieties of the plant that defines the technological trajectory. In relation with this delay for the obtaining new grape varieties, the success of the diffusion of the new varieties faces three main difficulties: (1) Professionals need to agree on the relevance of the paradigm, In other words on the characteristics of the research program; (2) A gap appears between the characteristics of new varieties proposed for diffusion and the new perception of the needs of those professionals or their market, broadly different 25 years later, and (3) the rhythm of the diffusion of these innovations, approximately 2. 5 %/year, related to the life-cycle of the vine plant. In France, the awareness of obtaining grape varieties resistant to diseases emerged quite late, except in the case of the work of one research director from INRA, starting the improvement of the varieties in that direction in the 1980 s. His work was merely recently resumed. Since World War II, those working in Europe on the new grape varieties have been mainly public researchers. However, the contractual relationships with stakeholders in charge of spreading those varieties – the nurseries -vary considerably according to the countries, the size and the strategy of the grape nurseries. The issues related to licenses and royalties are an essential matter. The industry is therefore characterized by the presence of various resistant grape varieties created in several countries in Europe by researchers or grape nurseries. In each country where the new varieties were created, new varieties were registered in every national catalogue, but registration of those foreign varieties were not, until today, extended to the French national catalogue. Therefore, it excludes those varieties from potential CAP subsidies. Some innovative grape growers anticipated the social demand and adopted those resistant varieties without the support of public subsidies. In addition, those grape growers processed the grapes and established a label to highlight this environmental advantage. A scientific controversy adds to the environmental and social issues, which deals with the ‘stability of the resistance’ over time. In short, the first varieties obtained featured a ‘monogenic’ resistance, considered by some researchers as easily circumvented. These researchers block or try to slow down the availability of new resistant varieties, waiting for the registration at the French national catalogue of a ‘new wave’ of grape varieties whose resistance would be ‘polygenic’. This scientific controversy creates uncertainty for public officers and a standby position criticized by those wishing a faster diffusion of those innovations in the wine chain. Further, the wine production in Europe is traditionally characterized by quality designations of origin - PGI and PDO – which base their reputation on the main traditional grape varieties and therefore exclude new grape varieties. In France, those quality designations account for approximately 85 percent of the wine production and create most of the value in the wine chain. This exclusion inhibits significant extension. Finally, the issues allowing the rapid diffusion of resistant grape varieties excluding pesticides might include: fostering the rate of renewing <b>vineyards,</b> the <b>register</b> of new European grape varieties in the French national catalogue, the full or partial acceptation of the new grape varieties in PDO areas, the increase of the political pressure from ecologists and the civil society about the reduction of phytosanitary inputs, the integration of those varieties in the national endowment of the wine CMO for the restructuring of vineyards or, finally, the insertion of resistance genes in traditional varieties through faster means than classic genetics. However, the strategy consisting in the creation of new varieties through GMO methods seems not adapted to the Society, including at the research level...|$|R
40|$|Powdery mildew of grapevine, {{caused by}} the ascomycete Erysiphe necator (Schw.) Burr., is a {{polycyclic}} disease with primary infections caused by ascospores produced in the overwintered fruiting bodies (called chasmothecia), and secondary infections caused by asexual conidia produced in powdery mildew colonies during the grapevine growing season. Despite an initial controversy {{about the importance of}} the ascospores as a relevant source of inoculum for the disease, ascospores are now considered an important form of primary inoculum in many grape-growing areas. Sanitation, i. e. the interventions aimed at reducing the overwintering inoculum that triggers the disease epidemic in the following year, has been already tested in vineyards and is now considered a key part of the disease control strategy in the vineyards with severe attach of powdery mildew after harvest. Sanitation can be performed using different kinds of fungicides, natural compounds or the biocontrol agent Ampelomyces spp., which are all more effective when applied against developing chasmothecia, than on mature or dispersed ones. A model was therefore developed, based on the principles of the systems analysis, to predict the development and maturation of the E. necator chasmothecia in the vineyard. The model considers four state variables, which represent the four developmental stages of the chasmothecia: from the white ascocarp primordia to the yellow, brown and at the end black mature chasmothecia. Chasmothecia advance from one stage of development to the next at specific rates that depend on air temperature and are calculated based on the equations developed by Legler et al. (2012). Mature black chasmothecia are finally dispersed by rain splashes whenever there is a measurable rainfall. To validate the model, a total of 38 commercial vineyards were considered Northern Italy, Baden-Württemberg (Germany), and Riverland region (South Australia). In each vineyard, a plot was maintained untreated with fungicides against powdery mildew and disease severity was periodically assessed until leaf fall was <b>complete.</b> In 31 <b>vineyards,</b> the number of chasmothecia dispersed from the powdery mildew colonies were periodically trapped by using plastic trap funnels. The numbers of chasmothecia trapped per cm 2 of trap surface was enumerated and expressed as a cumulative proportion of the total chasmothecia trapped in each vineyard; these data formed the first dataset used for model validation. In 8 vineyards, the number of yellow, brown and black chasmothecia produced by powdery mildew colonies on vine leaves was enumerated as numbers/cm 2 leaf, and expressed as a proportion of the total number of mature chasmothecia; these data were used as the second dataset for model validation. Model predictions provided a good fit of the actual data collected in different vineyards and years: i) for the first dataset, the R 2 for the aggregate data of all the vineyard was 0. 95, the s. e. of estimate, which measures the accuracy of predictions, was 0. 097, the indexes of goodness-of-fit were close to 1 (NS= 0. 94,W= 0. 98,EF= 0. 94) and MAE was 0. 12; ii) for the second dataset, the R 2 for the aggregate data was 0. 91, the s. e. of estimate was 0. 091, the indexes of goodness-of-fit were all close to 1 (NS= 0. 90,W= 0. 98,EF= 0. 90) and MAE was 0. 18...|$|R
