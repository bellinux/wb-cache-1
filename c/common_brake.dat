Water which enters brake lines, even in small amounts, will react with most <b>common</b> <b>brake</b> fluids (i.e., those which are hygroscopic) causing the {{formation}} of deposits which can clog the brake lines and reservoir. It {{is almost impossible to}} completely seal any brake system from exposure to water, which means that regular changing out of brake fluid is necessary to ensure that the system is not becoming overfilled with the deposits caused by reactions with water. Light oils are sometimes used as hydraulic fluids specifically because they do not react with water: oil displaces water, protects plastic parts against corrosion, and can tolerate much higher temperatures before vaporizing, but has other drawbacks vs. traditional hydraulic fluids.|$|E

Such farm tractors are prone (much more than conventional ones) to the pitch of the body during either braking or traction. Such body movement can be reduced by setting the proper anti-dive or anti-lift characteristics of the suspension. In this paper, the analytical mathematical relations governing the anti-dive and anti-lift characteristic of the farm tractor are derived by considering both the <b>common</b> <b>brake</b> architecture and either the cases of two or four wheel drive systems. The effect of the very complex driveline of farm tractors on anti-dive and anti-lift characteristic is dealt with.

Due to the compressibility of the air, {{there is a time}} delay from the push-down of the brake pedal to the attainment of the desired brake effect. The time for the pressure in the brake cylinder to reach 75 % of its final pressure is subject to legal requirements, and this master thesis studies the possibilities to predict that time by simulation. The program GT-SUITE is chosen for the simulation, since it is shown to be suitable in a survey of potential software and an evaluation. Also, MATLAB is used to simulate an approximate system description. To support the modeling of brake system components, measurements are made on a simple brake rig, gradually extended with <b>common</b> <b>brake</b> components which then can be modeled. Finally, the models are verified with a measurement on a complete brake system. In the simple rigs, the simulations are accurate and able to predict the effect of new components. Verifying the models, though, the simulation is not accurate enough.

5000|$|The self-assist {{mechanism}} {{affects the}} water pump {{and the amount}} of fade. For example, the Ausco Lambert and Murphy brakes have self-assist roughly proportional to pad friction, so total braking is reduced as roughly the square of the loss in friction. Many other self-assist designs, such as band <b>brakes</b> and many <b>common</b> drum <b>brakes,</b> have exponential self-assist, described by , where [...] is the natural logarithm base, [...] is the coefficient of friction between shoes and drum, and [...] is the angle of engagement between shoes and drum. A small change in friction causes an exponential change in self assist. In many <b>common</b> <b>brakes,</b> a slight increase in friction can lead to wheel lockup with even light application. For example, on damp mornings, drum brakes can lock on first application, skidding to a stop even after the brake pedal has been released. Conversely, a slight decrease in friction can lead to severe brake fade.|$|R

For the second kind of robot, it could be a great improvement to add a break in each actuated joint, so it is not necesary to wasted energy during the stoped time. And not only that, thanks to the brake, it is possible to achive heavier loads using a speci c walking pattern in which you always place the center of mass on the three legs that are not moving in that moment (with the brake activated), while make the next step with the fourth leg.

40|$|Tread <b>braking</b> is a <b>common</b> <b>braking</b> {{system for}} railway {{vehicles}} {{which is used}} mainly on freight wagons {{but also as a}} component on trains with mixed braking systems. In general, railway wheels for tread braking are designed only by considering a maximum allowed braking power according to the wheel design standard EN 13979 - 1. The idea is to avoid derailment risks due to change of wheelset gauge or global wheel fracture caused by excessive tensile stresses in the wheel rim. In the present paper, the fatigue life of the wheel web is studied in detail when subjected to a combination of thermomechanical loading from tread braking and mechanical loading from wheel-rail contact forces. Two generic wheel designs are assessed where one represents the classical freight wheel with a slightly S-shaped web and the other is a so-called low-stress wheel, with a more elaborate shape of the wheel web, specifically designed for high thermal loads. The wheel designs are studied both with new rims and with fully worn down rims. The results show that railway wheels generally have sufficient fatigue lives for regular service with respect to thermomechanical loading. Moreover, it is shown that the studied wheels have different sensitivities to mechanical and thermomechanical loadings at some critical positions on the wheel web. Towards the wheel rim, the damage as induced by tread braking is dominating and towards the hub the damage from mechanical loading is more important. A general conclusion is that maintenance of the wheel webs is important for preserving a high safety of the railway system...|$|R

40|$|Tread (block) braking {{is still}} one of the most <b>common</b> <b>braking</b> systems on railway vehicles. The action is carried out by {{pressing}} brake blocks against the tread of a wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The extensive use of tread brakes in metro and suburban applications has created a need for design guidelines or standards for wheels exposed to repeated stop braking. The thermal capacity of the wheels puts a limit to railway tread braking systems. With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the thermal capacity limits for wheels. In the present work, an extensive literature survey has been made with special focus on the braking capacity of wheels. Several aspects of the tread braking system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, have been assessed, such as brake block materials and residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. Additionally, two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop braking. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. It was concluded that even though the same nominal routes were simulated in the brake rig tests as those the field tests, the braking efforts are different. Therefore, simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. Heat partitioning between wheel, block and rail has been numerically studied in a broad parametric study to investigate the influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution. By use of a plane model, the implication of temperature variations around the wheel circumference (hot spots) is studied in detail. Even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures, they were found to have only a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system. By use of an axisymmetric model, it was found that a presumed constant axial position of the wheel-rail contact towards the flange side of the tread leads to substantially higher maximum tread temperatures than a wheel-rail contact centred at the brake block position...|$|R
