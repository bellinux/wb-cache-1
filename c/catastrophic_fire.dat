5|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, with its {{significant}} rainfall, wildfires {{are relatively small}} and have rarely posed great risk to life and property. As white settlements moved further west into drier areas, the first large scale fires were encountered. Range fires on the Great Plains and forest fires in the Rocky Mountains were far larger and more destructive than what had ever {{been seen in the}} east. A number of <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire</b> events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{radioactive}} contamination from Rocky Flats came from three sources: a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire</b> in 1957, leaking barrels in an outdoor storage area in 1964-1968, and another less severe fire in 1969. Plutonium, {{used to construct}} the weapons' fissile components, can spontaneously combust at room temperatures in air. Additional sources of actinide contamination include inadequate pondcrete vitrification attempts and routine releases during the decades of plant operations.|$|E
5|$|Highgrove House, {{also known}} as High Grove House or High Grove, is a Grade II listed mansion in the {{suburban}} area of Ruislip, within the London Borough of Hillingdon. Originally built in 1750 by the Reverend John Lidgould, the house was rebuilt in 1881 by Sir Hugh Hume-Campbell following a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire.</b> Along with Haydon Hall and Eastcote House, Highgrove {{was one of the}} three main houses of Eastcote and eventually became a residential hostel for homeless families, run by the local council from the 1960s until 2007. An area of the estate was sold to the local council in 1935 by the then-owner Eleanor Warrender to become what is now Warrender Park. In 1975, the house was granted Grade II listed status on account of its special architectural character.|$|E

5|$|On 16 May 1289, the priory {{suffered}} a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire.</b> According to an account by Walter of Guisborough, a plumber soldering the lead roof forgot {{to put out}} his fire, causing the roof timbers to catch fire and molten lead ran down into the church below. Much of the building was destroyed and many effects, costly books, chalices and vestments were lost. The canons sought {{to raise funds for}} rebuilding. They petitioned the king to grant them the advowsons of the parish churches of Barnham, Easington and Heslerton, and in 1309 and 1311 the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Durham rewarded the priory's donors with indulgences granting remission of temporal punishment for sins. Most of the nave and chancel was rebuilt {{with the support of the}} de Brus family, whose coat of arms was displayed on its buildings.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 998, Dalassenos {{learned that a}} <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire</b> had broken out in Apamea and {{destroyed}} most of its provisions, so he marched towards the city. The Aleppines too endeavoured to seize Apamea and arrived there first, but withdrew at the approach of Dalassenos, who could not permit a vassal to grow too strong and intended to capture the town for the emperor. Although ostensibly allies with the Byzantines, the Aleppines left the provisions they had brought with them to be collected by the inhabitants of Apamea, aiding them in their resistance. Subsequent events are presented by several authors, including the brief narrative of John Skylitzes and the more extensive accounts of the Christian Arab Yahya of Antioch and the Armenian Stephen of Taron. Arab accounts also survive, all apparently drawing upon {{the work of the}} 11th-century historian Hilal al-Sabi; the most detailed version is preserved by Ibn al-Qalanisi.|$|E
25|$|Since 2013, the residents' {{organisation}} Grenfell Action Group {{had repeatedly}} {{expressed concern about}} fire safety, saying in November 2016 that only a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire</b> would force the block's management to adequately address fire precautions and maintenance of fire-related systems.|$|E
30|$|The {{significant}} differences in fire regime attributes suggest that land managers seeking to restore natural fire regimes and characteristic forest composition and structure must consider {{more than just the}} amount of area burned or fuels reduced. Prescribed fires, as currently implemented, and wildfires produce patch structures that are probably different from historic conditions. There are many tradeoffs between wildfires and wildland fire use, but paramount is the return to more natural fire regimes and more structurally heterogeneous forests that have less potential for large, <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fires.</b> More areas need to be treated by prescribed fire and wildland fire use to prevent the increase in high severity <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fires.</b> As more areas are treated with prescribed fires, the areas can be placed in the wildland fire use zone, and the incidence of wildfires will be reduced.|$|R

25|$|Standing {{near the}} castle, the Church of the Holy Rude {{is one of}} the town's most {{historically}} important buildings. Founded in 1129 it is the second oldest building in the city after Stirling castle. It was rebuilt in the 15th century after Stirling suffered a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire</b> in 1405, and is reputed to be the only surviving church in the United Kingdom apart from Westminster Abbey to have held a coronation. On 29 July 1567 the infant son of Mary, Queen of Scots, was anointed James VI of Scotland in the church. James' bride, Anne of Denmark was crowned in the church at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh. The Holy Rude congregation still meet and some 19th century parish records survive. Musket shot marks that may come from Cromwell's troops during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms are clearly visible on the tower and apse of the church.|$|E
25|$|A UNESCO World Heritage site since 2005, Tel Hazor {{has been}} {{excavated}} repeatedly since 1955. Other findings include an ancient Canaanite city, which experienced a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire</b> in the {{sometime in the}} 13th century BCE. The date and causes of the violent destruction of Canaanite Hazor have been an important issue ever since the first excavations of the site. One school of thought, represented by Yigael Yadin, Yohanan Aharoni and Amnon Ben-Tor, dates the destruction to the later half of the 13th century, tying it to biblical descriptions in Joshua which hold the Israelites responsible for the event. The second school of thought, represented by Olga Tufnell, Kathleen Kenyon, P. Beck, Moshe Kochavi and Israel Finkelstein, tends to support an earlier date {{in the first half}} of the 13th century, in which case there is no necessary connection between the destruction of Hazor and the process of settlement by Israelite Tribes in Cannan. Other findings at the site include a distinctive six chambered gate dating to the Early Iron Age, as well as pottery and administrative buildings dating to either the 10th century and King Solomon or, on a lowered chronology, to the Omrides of the 9th century.|$|E

25|$|On 23 June Burr, Hopewell, Swallow and Content arrived between Cape Corrientes and Cape San Antonio {{and soon}} sighted six sail.

Despite being heavily outnumbered the English stood formation and a long-range exchange commenced at 7:00 am. This lasted for the next three hours, after which the English formation scattered. During this time Burr exploded from a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire</b> in the magazine either from a stray Spanish shot or by complete accident. Irish and sixteen survivors were rescued by the Swallow which soon after withdrew from the area. Soon after the 100-ton galleys San Agustín and Brava then closed in on the two remaining English vessels and attempted to board by grappling. They were however repelled by heavy gunfire from Hopewell and Content in a defensive position. The Spanish galleys, unable to make an impression and suffering considerable damage then stood off and rejoined de la Ribera's galleons. Soon after the English ships departed and sailed to Cape San Antonio but sighted nothing of value. Content got lost during the night and was unable to find any other ships and may have headed all the way to Florida.|$|E

500|$|Increased {{population}} {{and the growth of}} suburban areas near parklands, has {{led to the development of}} what is known as Wildland Urban Interface Fire Management, in which the park cooperates with adjacent property owners in improving safety and fire awareness. This approach is common to many other protected areas. As part of this program, houses and structures near the park are designed to be more fire resistant. Dead and fallen trees are removed from near places of human habitation, reducing the available fuel load and the risk of a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire,</b> and advance warning systems are developed to help alert property owners and visitors about forest fire potentials during a given period of the year.

In Shoshone National Forest, the highest fire incidence is generally in the months of August and September. An average of [...] burns annually, with the worst year {{in the past century}} being 1988, when [...] burned from fires that had spread from the conflagration that engulfed Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding region. After the Yellowstone region fires of 1988, an effort to identify areas of similar fire potential was implemented. Fire managers at Shoshone National Forest work with a number of outside agencies to incorporate fire restrictions, fuels management, and a controlled burn plans to reduce the chances of a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fire.</b> The dead and dying trees which have been killed by various species of bark beetle may have a great impact on future forest fires.

40|$|Abstract. Understanding of {{long-term}} forest landscape dynamics under fire exclusion, {{which have not}} been studied in north-eastern China, is increasingly needed for designing sound forest management and protection plans. In the present study, we examine whether long-term fire exclusion leads to <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fires</b> and whether the fire regimes altered by fire exclusion have {{changed the course of}} natural succession of dominant tree species. We designed two simulation scenarios – fire exclusion and no fire exclusion – and used LANDIS to study the long-term (300 years) fire regime dynamic and the succession of dominant tree species in terms of species abundance, age structure and spatial pattern. Our simulated results show that fire exclusion can lead to <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fires</b> with return intervals ranging from 50 to 120 years, increase the proportion of coniferous forests and decrease the proportion of deciduous forests, simplify tree species composition, and alter forest age structures and landscape patterns. Based on these simulated results, we suggest that prescribed burning or coarse woody debris reduction, uneven age management, and a comprehensive wildlife habitat suitability analysis should be incorporated in forest management plans in this region...|$|R
