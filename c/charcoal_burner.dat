25|$|While a {{large number}} of Dvořák's works were given opus numbers, these did not always bear a logical {{relationship}} to the order in which they were either written or published. To achieve better sales, some publishers such as N. Simrock preferred to present budding composers as being well established, by giving some relatively early works much higher opus numbers than their chronological order would merit. In other cases, Dvořák deliberately provided new works with lower opus numbers to be able to sell them outside contract obligations to other publishers. An example is the Czech Suite which Dvořák didn't want to sell to Simrock, and had published with Schlesinger as Op. 39 instead of Op. 52. In this way it could come about that the same opus number was given to more than one of Dvořák's works; for example the opus number 12, which was assigned, successively, to: the opera King and <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Burner</b> (1871), the Concert Overture in F (1871, derived from the opera), the String Quartet No. 6 in A minor (1873), the Furiant in G minor for piano (1879), and the Dumka in C minor for piano (1884). In yet other cases, a work was given as many as three different opus numbers by different publishers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1871 Dvořák {{left the}} Provisional Theatre {{orchestra}} {{in order to}} have more time for composing. Up through 1871 Dvořák gave opus numbers only up to 5 among his first 26 compositions. The first press mention of Antonín Dvořák appeared in the Hudební listy journal in June 1871, and the first publicly performed composition was the song Vzpomínání ("Reminiscence", October 1871, musical evenings of L. Procházka). The opera The King and the <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Burner</b> was returned to Dvořák from the Provisional Theatre and said to be unperformable. Its overture was premiered in 1872 in a Philharmonic concert conducted by Bedřich Smetana, but the full opera with the original score only in 1929. Clapham says Dvořák realized he had gone to [...] "extremes in attempting to follow the example of Wagner." [...] In 1873–74 he reset [...] "the King and <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Burner</b> libretto entirely afresh, in a totally different manner", without using [...] "anything from the ill-fated earlier version". The alternate opera, called King and <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Burner</b> II, B.42, was premiered in Prague in 1874.|$|E
50|$|In earlier times, <b>charcoal</b> <b>burners</b> led an austere, lonely life. They had to {{live near}} the kiln, usually in a <b>charcoal</b> <b>burner's</b> hut (Köhlerhütte or Köte in Germany, Austrian and Switzerland). During the Middle Ages, <b>charcoal</b> <b>burners</b> were ostracised. Their {{profession}} was considered dishonourable and they were frequently accused of evil practices. Even today {{there is a certain}} denigration of this former occupation. In the German language to have a <b>charcoal</b> <b>burner's</b> faith (Köhlerglauben) is to have blind faith in something. That aside, the continuing requirement to keep the kiln at the right temperature in all weathers meant that the job must have been arduous, lonely and, at times, dangerous.|$|R
