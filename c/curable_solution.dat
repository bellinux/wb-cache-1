40|$|Lung {{transplantation}} {{is currently}} the only available treatment for endstage lung disease patients. Despite the success of improved modern lung transplantation {{with the introduction of}} new surgical techniques, improved immunosuppressive agents and innovations in managing of acute rejection and infection, the survival rate of recipients is 75 % at 1 year and less than 50 % at 5 years. (1) One of the most severe complications after lung transplantation is obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) which affect over 40 % of the recipients within 5 years during the posttransplantation period. (1). OB is a chronic disease that develops from months and mostly years after lung transplantation (2 - 4). It is characterized by progressive bronchial inflammation, epithelial injury and luminal fibrosis. (5 - 7). There is no treatment for human OB and insight into the understandings of its mechanism is still lacking. Presently, all clinical efforts are directed at slowing down the process. These efforts include pre-transplant treatment to the donor lung to reduce inflammatory inducing factors, employment of aggressive peri-transplant administration with antibiotics (3; 8 - 11) and improved immunosuppressive regimens. Only re-transplantation appears to be a <b>curable</b> <b>solution,</b> but is mostly not possible due to the limited availability of donor organs. Clinical investigation of OB in humans is restricted by the limited amount of patient material available for research. This makes the development of new treatments a difficult and time consuming task (12). Thus, a simple animal model that resembles the development of OB in human is a desirable goal. ...|$|E

We emphasized SLA of alumina as a structural ceramic and for investment casting cores. Viscosity was reduced with improved dispersion. The quality ofthe protoypes was improved by determination of appropriate build styles, and by optimization of photoinitiators and photoresins. The latter were studied by photo-differential scanning calorimetry, and photo-rheology. ONR Contract Information is summarized belo...|$|R
40|$|Geospatial {{data are}} {{available}} in raster and vector formats {{and some of them}} are available in open data form. The technique and tools to handle those data are also available in open source. Though it is free of charge, the knowledge to utilize those data is limited to non-educated in the specific field. The data and technology should be promoted to those levels to utilize in required fields with priceless in developing countries. Before utilize open data, which are required to verify with local knowledge to become usable information for the local people as priceless data resources. Developing country, which economic is based in agriculture, required more information about precise weather data and weather variation by the climate change impact for their socioeconomic development. This study found that rural to urban migration occurs in the developing countries such agriculture based country likes Myanmar when the agriculture economic are affected by unpredictable impact by the climate change. The knowledge sharing using open data resources to non-educated local people is one of the <b>curable</b> <b>solutions</b> for the agriculture economy development in the country. Moreover, the study will find ways to reduce the rural to urban migration...|$|R
40|$|The polymer {{electrolyte}} {{based on}} semi-interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structure for protection was formed on lithium electrode surface by the ultraviolet (UV) radiation-curing method. A <b>curable</b> mixed <b>solution</b> consists of linear polymer (Kynar 2801), a crosslinking agent (1, 6 -Hexanediol diacrylate), liquid electrolyte (ethylene carbonate (EC) /propylene carbonate (PC) / 1 M LiClO 4), and a photoinitiator (methyl benzoylformate). The lithium morphology deposited on the protected lithium electrode was less dendritic and smoother than {{that on the}} nonprotected lithium electrode during the 1 st charge at 0. 25 mAcm(- 2). The discharge capacity obtained from the unit cell applying the lithium anode protected with gel polymer electrolyte based on semi-IPN [Kynar 2801 / 1, 6 -Hexanediol diacrylate, 5 / 5 (w/w) ] was 80 % of the initial discharge capacity during 100 cycles at C/ 2 rate (1. 25 mAcm(- 2)). close 282...|$|R
40|$|The gel polymer {{electrolyte}} {{based on}} semi-IPN (interpenetrating polymer network) {{structure for the}} protection of lithium metal electrode was successfully developed by ultraviolet (UV) radiation-curing method. A <b>curable</b> mixed <b>solution</b> consists of linear polymer (Kynar 2801), crosslinking agent (1, 6 -hexanediol diacrylate), liquid electrolyte (ethylene carbonate (EQ/propylene carbonate (PQ/ 1 M LiClO 4), oligo(ethylene glycol) borate (OEGB) anion receptor, and photoinitiator (methyl benzoylformate). The OEGB was synthesized by the dehydrocoupling reaction of hydroxyl group in di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether with hydrogen in BH 3 and characterized by H- 1 NMR. The presence of OEGB anion receptor in the protection layer could lead to an enhancement in the ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and the interfacial properties. The deposited lithium exhibited particle-like shape resulting from the introduction of the protection layer onto the lithium electrode surface. The unit cell based on the lithium anode protected with gel polymer electrolyte containing OEGB showed higher discharge capacity than that of the unit cell without OEGB after 100 cycles at C/ 2 rate (1. 25 mA cm(- 2)). close 191...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The use of HEMA as a {{biocompatible}} material in dentin bonding systems {{and its potential}} for clinical applications has been well established. Excess water can affect conversion of bonding resins. The {{aim of this study}} was to survey the effect of water on the degree of conversion of HEMA by Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy (FT-IR). Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, distilled water was added in amounts of 0, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 4 ml to 1 ml of <b>curable</b> HEMA <b>solution.</b> Six repetitions per wa-ter ratio were made and investigated. Each sample was polymerized for 60 seconds. De-gree of conversion was obtained from the absorbance IR-Spectrum of the materials before and after polymerization by FT-IR spectroscopy. One way ANOVA and Tukey-HSD were carried out to compare and detect any differences among groups. Results: Statistical analysis indicates highly significant difference between pairs of groups at level (P< 0. 001). The results showed a trend of decreasing in HEMA conversion with increasing water. Degree of conversion changes significantly within the 0. 05 ml to 0. 2 ml water range. However, degree of conversion did not change after reaching 0. 02 ml an...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{nanofiber}} scaffold was fabricated and {{characterized as}} a potential antimicrobial wound dressing. Half generation polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer G 3. 5 was covalently conjugated to gelatin. Gelatin alone or with gelatin-dendrimer conjugates was electrospun into nanofiber scaffolds. Gelatin is a derivative of natural collagen, and it is biocompatible, non-toxic and inexpensive, making it a desirable component in a wound dressing. Dendrimers are synthetic polymers comprising of a central core, internal branches and reactive surface groups. They provide a structurally controlled architecture for drug release. Silver was incorporated into the scaffold in situ due to its broad spectrum of antimicrobial properties. The scaffolds were further crosslinked by photo <b>curable</b> PEG-diacrylate in <b>solution</b> or vapor to gain structure stability. The fabricated scaffolds with various compositions displayed {{a wide range of}} structure characteristics and properties in terms of fiber morphology, swelling and degradation, mechanical properties, antimicrobial activity and silver release kinetics. The scaffolds showed a similar fiber structure and morphology. It was found that the fiber diameter of the scaffolds containing silver was greater than scaffolds without silver. The porosity of the crosslinked scaffolds ranged from 67. 56 % to 90. 42 % and also exhibited a high capacity of swelling and adsorption. The results of the antimicrobial assay showed that scaffolds containing silver could effectively inhibit growth of bacteria at the end of 48 h. In vitro silver release studies demonstrated that silver could be released in a controlled manner {{over an extended period of}} time...|$|R
