5|$|There are {{two main}} game modes in Day of Defeat: Source: {{territorial}} control and detonation. In territorial control maps, players must fight for control of all strategic points on the map. The strategic points take various forms, such as a destroyed tank in a street or fields and buildings, and are designated by a flag in its vicinity, which displays the army colors of the team who controls the point. Points are captured by {{a certain number of}} team members surrounding the point, with it either capturing instantly or after a couple of seconds. Players on the other side can disrupt a capture by placing themselves within the <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> during the process or by killing the enemy players at the point. The first side to hold all the points simultaneously wins the round.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} early {{streamer}} emission proposes {{that if a}} lightning rod has a mechanism producing ionization near its tip, then its lightning <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> is greatly increased. At first, small quantities of radioactive isotopes (radium-226 or americium-241) were used as sources of ionization between 1930 and 1980, later replaced with various electrical and electronic devices. According to an early patent, since most lightning protectors' ground potentials are elevated, the path distance from the source to the elevated ground point will be shorter, creating a stronger field (measured in volts per unit distance) and that structure will be more prone to ionization and breakdown.|$|E

50|$|The game ends if {{at least}} one side loses all lives, or the stage is {{completed}} with at least 80% <b>captured</b> <b>area.</b> If one side loses all lives, the other side with remaining lives win. If the stage is completed with at least 80% <b>captured</b> <b>area,</b> the side with most <b>captured</b> <b>area</b> wins.|$|R
50|$|A round {{begins with}} the player {{at the edge of}} the {{background}}. <b>Capturing</b> an <b>area</b> can be done by moving cursor to the edge of the background or edge of an already <b>captured</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
5000|$|CTI (Capture The Intelligence) - Known {{in other}} games as Capture The Flag. Players {{have to pick}} up an object (usually a suitcase) and bring it to their {{designated}} <b>capture</b> <b>area.</b> The opposing team can shoot down the player carrying the object after which it will drop to the ground to be picked up by another player or left to respawn when it is not picked up for a certain amount of time. Once brought inside the team's <b>capture</b> <b>area,</b> the team receives reinforcements and/or point depending on the map.|$|E
5000|$|... b) have {{a design}} shock-on-lip flight Mach number, where the conical/oblique shock wave/s {{intercept}} the cowl lip, thus enabling the streamtube <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> to equal the intake lip area. However, below the shock-on-lip flight Mach number, the shock wave angle/s are less oblique, causing the streamline approaching the lip to be deflected {{by the presence}} of the cone/ramp. Consequently, the intake <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> is less than the intake lip area, which reduces the intake airflow. Depending on the airflow characteristics of the engine, it may be desirable to lower the ramp angle or move the cone rearwards to refocus the shockwaves onto the cowl lip to maximise intake airflow.|$|E
50|$|The D-20 also {{accepts a}} {{traditional}} film style video assist system, sharing the image {{available through the}} optical viewfinder. This {{can be useful in}} Steadicam and remote crane applications where visibility outside the sensor <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> is preferable.|$|E

50|$|The Al-Ghab {{offensive}} (July-August 2015) was {{an offensive}} launched by rebels in the Syrian Civil War to <b>capture</b> <b>areas</b> surrounding Jisr al-Shughur, {{and to establish}} {{a foothold in the}} Al-Ghab plain, in Syria's Idlib and Hama governorates.|$|R
50|$|At {{the top of}} {{each round}} is a 20-level meter, where it starts with 11. The meter gauge {{increases}} or decreases depending on how background <b>area</b> is <b>captured.</b> Usually it decreases when <b>capturing</b> <b>area</b> with silhouette, but increases when <b>capturing</b> <b>area</b> without silhouette. The meter decreases by 1 if player does not <b>capture</b> an <b>area</b> for a prolonged period. If the meter reaches 0, player loses a life; if the meter reaches 20 (full), the round is automatically cleared; if the meter reaches yellow (6 bars), the background and silhouette is replaced by an alternate picture, with different silhouette. The type of alternate background is chosen at random. When the background change occurs, it can be changed back to girl background by increasing meter level to 10. However, if the silhouette ratio reaches 80% with alternate background, that game round is restarted afterwards, without going through roulette round.|$|R
50|$|An {{aircraft}} with an on-board ILS receiver {{within the}} <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> of an ILS, (glideslope and localizer range), will detect varying depths of modulation {{according to the}} aircraft's position within that airspace, providing accurate positional information about the progress to the threshold.|$|E
50|$|Some {{document}} camera models integrate additional functionality {{into the light}} system, such as a synchronized light field that clearly indicates to the user at all times, by way of an illuminated image <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> or laser markers, the size and position of the imaging area, which adjusts simultaneously as the lens zooms in or out.|$|E
50|$|A bullet trap is {{a device}} to stop bullets fired at a {{shooting}} range. The bullet trap may also provide means to recycle bullet materials and/or prevent release of toxic metals from the shooting range. Bullet traps typically use friction, impact, or deceleration to stop bullets. Some bullet traps include a vacuum system to filter dust from air within the impact and/or <b>capture</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Pakistani army {{captured}} many {{villages in}} the Kutch area just before the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Pagi went into the <b>captured</b> <b>areas</b> to gather information from both villagers and his own relatives. This greatly assisted the Indian army.|$|R
500|$|Later that year, Governor Charles Lawrence {{issued a}} decree {{ordering}} {{the expulsion of}} the Acadian population from Nova Scotia (including recently <b>captured</b> <b>areas</b> of Acadia such as le Coude). This action {{came to be known}} as the [...] "Great Upheaval".|$|R
40|$|Site {{faithfulness}} {{and general}} movement patterns of five rock dove (Columba livia) flocks were estimated {{in order to}} evaluate their efficacy as radiological indicators on the Hanford Site. Of 367 individually marked birds, 311 were resighted or recaptured at least once during onsite and offsite monitoring. Average site faithfulness for all flocks from resightings was 87. 1 % and was not significantly different than a hypothesized 90 % site faithful distribution. Average site faithfulness from pooled resightings and recaptures was 91. 3 %, which was also not significantly different than a 90 % distribution. Since Hanford rock doves exhibit site faithfulness and can be easily monitored, I conclude {{that they can be}} used as radiological indicators. I found 107 birds at 21 different locations during offsite surveys in agricultural areas adjacent to the Hanford Site. Mean movement distances from <b>capture</b> <b>areas</b> to offsite locations for each of the five flocks were significantly different. Mean movement distances from <b>capture</b> <b>areas</b> to offsite locations for each flock were highly correlated with closest possible distances for each flock. Mean movement directions from <b>capture</b> <b>areas</b> to offsite locations for each flock were significantly different than random movement patterns for each flock...|$|R
50|$|To {{maximize}} {{the chances of}} effective license plate capture, installers should carefully consider the positioning of the camera relative to the target <b>capture</b> <b>area.</b> Exceeding threshold angles of incidence between camera lens and license plate will greatly reduce the probability of obtaining usable images due to distortion. Manufacturers have developed tools to help eliminate errors from the physical installation of license plate capture cameras.|$|E
50|$|The algal or cyanobacterial {{cells are}} photosynthetic, and as in plants they reduce {{atmospheric}} carbon dioxide into organic carbon sugars to feed both symbionts. Both partners gain water and mineral nutrients {{mainly from the}} atmosphere, through rain and dust. The fungal partner protects the alga by retaining water, serving as a larger <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> for mineral nutrients and, in some cases, provides minerals obtained from the substrate. If a cyanobacterium is present, as a primary partner or another symbiont in addition to green alga as in certain tripartite lichens, they can fix atmospheric nitrogen, complementing {{the activities of the}} green alga.|$|E
50|$|Lighting is an {{essential}} part of a document camera. To ensure good colour rendition, the lighting system used to illuminate the image <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> should be as uniform as possible. The greater the light intensity, the more independent the document camera is from ambient light sources. Using powerful lighting systems enables smaller apertures to be used, and this in turn provides a significant increase in the depth of field that can be achieved by the document camera. Also the higher the quality of the light source, the more light that will reach the camera sensor, and this results in less noticeable noise, and therefore the quality of image is not degraded.|$|E
50|$|During February 2016, Syrian {{government}} forces and allied militias, backed by Russian and Syrian airstrikes, launched an offensive to <b>capture</b> <b>areas</b> in Northern Aleppo. The YPG-led SDF followed their advances and captured {{the city of}} Tell Rifaat and the Menagh Military Airbase.|$|R
50|$|Ever since, {{the elite}} suicide squad called the Chaver Pada, were {{dispatched}} at every Mamankam by Valluvanad {{to kill the}} Samoothiri and take back its lost pride though they were quite aware of the impossibility of the task. Most of the Houses in the <b>captured</b> <b>areas</b> accepted only Vellattiri as their legitimate king. Nair houses and kalari had kudippaka (blood feud) against the Zamorin and had lost their members in the wars against him. More deaths meant incitement to the blood feud and new recruits to the suicide squads. To counter the local unrest, the Zamorin followed a custom of 'implanting' Muslim families and the families of other commanders who had allegiance to him, in the <b>captured</b> <b>areas</b> of Malappuram.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{information}} {{on the distribution of}} islands formed during submonolayer deposition is provided by the joint probability distribution (JPD) for island sizes, s, and <b>capture</b> zone <b>areas,</b> A. A key ingredient determining the form of the JPD is the impact of each nucleation event on existing <b>capture</b> zone <b>areas.</b> Combining a realistic characterization of such spatial aspects of nucleation with a factorization ansatz for the JPD, we provide a concise rate equation formulation for the variation with island size of both the <b>capture</b> zone <b>area</b> and the island density...|$|R

50|$|The {{inlet cone}} is shaped {{so that the}} shock wave that forms on its apex is {{directed}} to {{the lip of the}} intake; this allows the intake to operate properly in supersonic flight. As speed increases, the shock wave becomes increasingly more oblique (the cone gets narrower). For higher flight speeds inlet cones are designed to move axially to control how the <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> varies with the duct internal throat area. For best intake operation this required area ratio gets bigger with increasing flight Mach number, hence the large inlet cone movement on the SR-71 which had to perform well from zero to Mach 3.2.|$|E

50|$|On 3 May, the Iraqi Army {{and allied}} militia forces {{launched}} an offensive {{in the southern}} Fallujah <b>area,</b> <b>capturing</b> the <b>areas</b> between Amiriyah and Fallujah city. By the next day, Iraqi Government forces had come within 3 kilometers of Fallujah's southern entrance, capturing 4 villages, killing 100 ISIL militants, and destroying 10 ISIL tunnels. On 5 May, Anbar Operations Commander Major General Ismail Mahlawi told Anadolu Agency that the Iraqi army had <b>captured</b> five <b>areas</b> of the city.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a year of}} battle, Wanggeom-seong was {{captured}} and Wiman Joseon was destroyed.

The Commanderies eventually fell to the rising Goguryeo in 4th century AD.|$|R
50|$|On 28 April 1858 Ottoman {{commander}} Hussein Pasha {{captured the}} villages of Vilusi and Grahovo and continued his advance towards Grahovac, a small village located on a plateau elevated slightly above the <b>captured</b> <b>area.</b> The core of Montenegrin resistance was in Grahovac, which was the main bastion of Montenegrin defence according to military plans.|$|R
5000|$|Most Nikon F-mount lenses {{cover the}} {{standard}} 36×24 mm area of 135 film, while [...] "DX" [...] designated lenses cover the 24×16 mm {{area of the}} Nikon DX format DSLR sensors, {{commonly referred to as}} APS-C format. While [...] "DX" [...] lenses can be physically mounted on any Nikon film or digital SLR that support the [...] "AI" [...] exposure indexing feature (produced from 1977), there will be some degree of vignetting when used on film cameras, depending on zoom setting. All Nikon full-frame [...] "FX" [...] DSLRs have a DX-compatible mode that, by default when a DX-format lens is attached, crops the captured frames to the DX format and adjusts the viewfinder to reflect the smaller <b>capture</b> <b>area.</b> This can be overridden by the user if desired.|$|E
50|$|Optical systems utilize data {{captured}} from image {{sensors to}} triangulate the 3D {{position of a}} subject between two or more cameras calibrated to provide overlapping projections. Data acquisition is traditionally implemented using special markers attached to an actor; however, more recent systems are able to generate accurate data by tracking surface features identified dynamically for each particular subject. Tracking {{a large number of}} performers or expanding the <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> is accomplished by the addition of more cameras. These systems produce data with three degrees of freedom for each marker, and rotational information must be inferred from the relative orientation of three or more markers; for instance shoulder, elbow and wrist markers providing the angle of the elbow. Newer hybrid systems are combining inertial sensors with optical sensors to reduce occlusion, increase the number of users and improve the ability to track without having to manually clean up data.|$|E
50|$|Another {{category}} of document scanner is the document camera. Capturing images on document cameras {{differs from that}} of flatbed and Automatic document feeder (ADF) scanners in that there are no moving parts required to scan the object. Conventionally either the illumination/reflector rod inside the scanner must be moved over the document (such as for a flatbed scanner), or the document must be passed over the rod (such as for feeder scanners) in order to produce a scan of a whole image. Document cameras capture the whole document or object in one step, usually instantly. Typically, documents are placed on a flat surface, usually the office desk, underneath the <b>capture</b> <b>area</b> of the document camera. The process of whole-surface-at-once capturing has the benefit of increasing reaction time for the work flow of scanning. After being captured, the images are usually processed through software which may enhance the image and perform such tasks like automatically rotating, cropping and straightening them.|$|E
