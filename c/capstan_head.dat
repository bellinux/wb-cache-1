6000|$|As {{good luck}} would have it, they had had a whale {{alongside}} {{a day or two}} previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the word, held himself fast, {{and at the same time}} also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the <b>capstan</b> <b>head.</b> With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, [...] "Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!-- an arm that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did'st thou see the White Whale?--how long ago?" ...|$|E
50|$|The NM-1 and NM-2 had an {{amidships}} {{mounted winch}} with a <b>capstan</b> <b>head.</b> It {{had a short}} steel cargo body 11 ft long and 7 ft wide. The cargo body had troop seats, a canvas cover, and a spare tire on the front right side. NM-2 had smaller head lamps and parking lamps on top.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970’s the Lake George Steamboat Company saw {{a demand}} for a ship that could carry more passengers, serve more and better food, as well as {{entertain}} more passengers. So, the company took action and started construction of the biggest ship it had ever made in Baldwin Shipyard. The blueprints used for the boat {{were based on the}} Peter Stuyvesant, a boat that used to run the Hudson River until it sunk during the Blizzard of 1978. Robert Simons was the marine architect that refined and designed the boat. The final design ended up being ¾ the size of the Peter Stuyvesant boat on which it was based. This left the boat measuring 189 feet and 6 inches with a beam of 40 feet, making it the largest boat to ever sail the inland waters of the state of New York. When it came time to name the boat, it was decided that it would be named the same as Lake George was initially in 1646 by Isaac Jogues. The Catholic hierarchy approved the name, the Lac du Saint Sacrement which means Lake of the Blessed Sacrament in French, as well. On June 15, 1989, a ceremony was held to christen the boat. And after many speeches and a blessing by Bishop Raymond Kalisz, the Bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of Wewak, Papua New Guinea, a bottle of champagne was smashed against the ship’s <b>capstan</b> <b>head</b> to officially christen the vessel the Lac Du Saint Sacrement.|$|E
40|$|Our {{employer}} Camatec Industriteknik AB {{gave us the}} assignments {{to increase}} theirs range of versions on Camcoil that is their own patent product. Camcoil is a capstan system that is used when steel band fabricated. Exist for example in production lines their steel band should be annealed. Our goal with this work is {{to come up with}} a completed production basis on a Camcoil for heavy industry. The basis should contain calculations, 3 D-constructions, drawings and cost proposal on manufacturing and detail purchase. Demands on this project: 1. 15 ton load 2. Strip width up to 1500 mm 3. Head diameter 610 mm 4. Production speed 35 m/min 5. Economy manufacturing 6. Be simple Several concepts were decided out of the feasibility study. The concepts were compared against each other and finally only one was left. Result of the design concept became one shaft with three <b>capstan</b> <b>heads</b> and a support function. One conceivable working process was planed with a Gantt-table. A decision was made that the work of the Camcoil should be separated in several details. Earlier work on Camcoil was study to increase our understanding for the work. Some of the examined parts were shaft dimensions, bearings, head shape, tripod, support function and hydraulic cylinder for the capstan and support. Some of the calculations have been made in Ansys. Directional deformation, Von Mises stress for the shaft, length of the hydraulic cylinder in the <b>capstan</b> <b>heads</b> and the stress for tripod and support function was calculated. Analytic calculations were made on some parts. Frequency analysis for the system was made with Dunkerleys method. The reaction forces in the bearings were calculated with a combination of elementary case. Lifecycle of the bearings can with this be appreciated. Hydraulic cylinder strength in <b>capstan</b> <b>heads</b> and support function, locking assemblies, sheet metal thickness and control off beam dimensions in support was also decided with analytic calculations. 3 D models were made on several details in the system. Models like lock rings, engines and bearings were taken from the supplier. After the modeling assemble drawings and detail drawings were made for the whole capstan system. The drawings were sending to manufacturer for a cost proposal...|$|R
50|$|A tape {{transport}} is {{the collection}} of parts of a magnetic tape player or recorder that the actual tape passes through. Transport parts include the <b>head,</b> <b>capstan,</b> pinch roller, tape pins, and tape guide. The tape transport {{as a whole is}} called the transport mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Philips, however, used an 'M-wrap' {{similar to}} that in VHS machines. Cables pulled pins along tracks in order to pull the tape into the {{transport}} path. This drive was large, heavy and very complex to produce, although having the <b>head</b> drum, <b>capstan,</b> audio/erase <b>heads</b> and the respective drive motors all mounted on a common base plate meant it was produced to high tolerances. Philips referred to this assembly as the ‘microworld’. Second and third generation Philips drives replaced the cable-pulled pins with a reliable lever mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Tape motion on many systems was bidirectional, i.e. tape {{could be}} read either forward or {{backward}} {{at the request of}} the controlling computer. Because the supply vacuum column kept a small, constant tension in the reverse direction, the capstan could feed backwards without the tape bunching up or jumping out of path. Unlike most audio tape systems, the <b>capstan</b> and <b>head</b> assemblies were always in contact with the tape, even during fast forward and reverse operations, only moving the head assembly away from the tape path during high-speed rewind. On some units, manufacturers installed a [...] "fast search" [...] capability which could move the tape quickly a certain number of blocks, then bring the tape to a halt and go back to read the requested data at normal speed.|$|R
50|$|Within a month, {{the next}} round of funding came through and {{restoration}} began in earnest. The <b>heads,</b> <b>capstan</b> and rotor motors were being restored by two different companies. New documentation about the demodulation was discovered, and the team began building a board by hand. Custom belts were being manufactured to replace the old ones. Software was being written to process the digital images. The biggest expense was the heads, which cost around $8,000 each to be refurbished.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the first}} tape {{recorder}} (the EMR32PA, 1950) used the USA-made SoundMirror BK-416 chassis from the Brush Development Company in Ohio, the R62 (1954/55) was completely their own design, offering {{at that time}} a consumer tape recorder with three ebm-papst motors, <b>capstan</b> spindles, three <b>heads,</b> 10" [...] reels and an adjustable azimuth of the playback head. The R62 {{was followed by the}} R53 (1963), the R66 (1966, with transistor circuits), the R59 (1968, stereo) and finally the R73 (1971).|$|R
50|$|The WM-DC2, a smaller, playback-only Walkman Professional, sharing {{most of the}} {{features}} of the larger WM-DC6 such as audio quality, the Direct Drive quartz-lock <b>capstan</b> servo, amorphous <b>head,</b> Dolby B & C noise reduction, and Metal, CrO2, and Normal (i.e., ferric oxide), tape handling, but excluding the recording facility and level meters, was introduced in 1984. It was powered by either 2 AA batteries or a 6V adapter. A line-out socket for connecting to an external amplifier was also incorporated. The brushed black and matt black aluminium-cased player was supplied with a pair of headphones and a black leather carrying case/belt pouch. Tested by What Hi-Fi in 1988, the WM-DC2 retailed in the UK for £150.00 (US $270.00).|$|R
