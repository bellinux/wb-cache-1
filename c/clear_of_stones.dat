40|$|Using {{radiological}} interventional techniques {{the gall}} bladder can be <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> {{with a high}} success rate. As with any treatment option that leaves the gall bladder in situ there is an accompanying risk <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> recurrence, which is currently unknown for the radiological method. One hundred patients were studied prospectively to determine the recurrence rate <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> and clinical outcome after successful percutaneous cholecystolithotomy. Follow up included both clinical assessment and ultrasound examination at 3, 6, and 12 months and then annual intervals thereafter. The overall stone recurrence rate was 31 % at a mean follow up of 26 months (range, 3 - 50 months). By actuarial life table analysis, the cumulative proportion <b>of</b> gall <b>stone</b> recurrence was 7, 19, 28, 35, and 44 % at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months respectively.

40|$|Background and Aims: Urolithiasis has {{an overall}} {{prevalence}} of 2 - 3 % worldwide. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) {{is one of}} the noninvasive procedures used for the management of the same. The outcome after ESWL depends on various factors which include position, size, number and composition <b>of</b> <b>stones,</b> double-J (DJ) stenting, presence of hydronephrosis etc. The present study is aimed to assess the effect <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> related factors such as size, number, location; renal factors such as hydronephrosis and patient factors such as obesity, habitus, on the outcome of ESWL in urolithiasis. Methods: A set of 280 patients with calculi in the kidney and ureter were subjected to ESWL during the period from April 2005 to September 2008, with pre and post-ESWL serial studies of the calculi, including x-ray and ultrasonography (USG). The results were subsequently assessed for the influence of prognostic factors on the outcome, using the Chi-Square test. Results: Overall stone free rate was 63 %. Upper pole renal stones had a significant clearance over the lower pole stones (p= 0. 01). Clearance <b>of</b> ureteric <b>stones</b> <b>of</b> 1 cm (p= 0. 03). Patients with hydronephrosis showed a statistically significant clearance over patients without hydronephrosis (p= 0. 034). Clearance <b>of</b> single <b>stone</b> was also significantly better than that <b>of</b> multiple <b>stones</b> (p= 0. 001). Sixteen patients underwent DJ stenting pre-ESWL, of which 8 were <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stone,</b> without significant difference.

40|$|Aim: Evaluation of {{bilateral}} ureteroscopic retrieval <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> as a single-stage procedure {{in terms of}} clearance <b>of</b> the <b>stones,</b> complications <b>of</b> the procedure and duration of hospital stay. A successful outcome was considered when both ureters were free <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> without any major complications. Materials and Methods: A total of 60 patients with bilateral ureteric stones were treated ureteroscopically from March 2006 to September 2009 {{in the department of}} Surgery (Urology unit). Majority of the patients were in their third and fourth decade of life with 38 males and 22 females. A single session bilateral ureteroscopic retrieval <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> was done using a 7. 8 Fr semirigid ureteroscope. A 0. 038 -inch guide wire was used and advanced under direct vision, and monitored by C-arm X-ray image intensifier. Balloon dilatation of the intramural ureters was required in 82 renal units. The stones were either extracted directly or disintegrated into small pieces by lithotripsy (pneumatic) before extraction. Ureteric stenting was required in 39 patients. Patients were followed for a period of 3 - 12 months. Results: A total of 60 patients (120 renal units) with bilateral ureteric stones were treated ureteroscopically. The stone size in the treated patients was in the range 6 - 20 mm. The stones were radio-opaque in 47 patients and radiolucent in 13 patients. Single stone was present in all except two patients. Operative time ranged between 40 and 120 minutes. Stones were completely removed in 51 (85 %) patients following single-session procedure of which 39 (76. 4 %) were stonefree intraoperatively and another 12 (23. 5 %) were <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stones</b> in 4 weeks follow-up. Six patients were stonefree unilaterally. Failed procedures were managed with repeated ureteroscopy, DJ stenting and ESWL or open ureterolithotomy. Intraoperatively false passage or minor ureteric perforations were seen in six patients. Postoperative complications included abdominal pain in 10, persistent fever in 4 and hematuria in 2 patients. No long-term complications were observed. Most of the patients were discharged in 2 days. Conclusion: Bilateral same-session ureteroscopy is a safe and effective procedure in the management <b>of</b> bilateral ureteral <b>stones.</b> The results are comparable to unilateral or staged bilateral procedures...|$|R
25|$|The {{remains of}} the canon's dorter or {{dormitory}} are slight. It was probably a two-storey building, with the bottom floor used for storage – like the frater – and for a warming house. At the northern end, the dorter is backed by Longnor's Garden, the area set out by the abbot for culinary and medicinal herbs, which contained a dovecote in the 15th century. The present guidebook suggests that the dorter was divided in the 15th century to provide quarters for the prior, the abbot's deputy. However, {{the text of the}} 1459 agreement between Abbot Richard Burnell and the canons, covering the responsibilities of the prior, suggests that the prior's quarters were under the dorter, with an entrance from the cloister, next to the parlour, and access to Longnor's garden at the rear. They had been refurbished at considerable cost and effort by a former prior, William of Shrewsbury, then still living, and were to pass to his successors only after his death.

40|$|During a 29 -month trial, 65 {{patients}} with acute gallstone pancreatitis {{were randomly selected}} for biliary tract explorations either within 73 hours of admission (36 patients) or at three months following remission with nonoperative measures (29 patients, with five others awaiting elective operation). The details of surgery were identical, i. e., cholecystectomy, transduodenal sphincteroplasty, and pancreatic duct septotomy. Major bile ducts were <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> by Fogarty catheter passage up the sphincteroplasty. At early operation, pancreatitis was in the acute edematous form in 29 patients, necrotizing in six, and hemorrhagic in one. Acute inflammatory changes were also noticed in three patients who underwent late operation. The locations of the gallstones in patients undergoing early versus delayed operations were, respectively: 97 % and 100 % in gallbladder, 75 % and 28 % within common or hepatic ducts (p < 0. 02), and 31 % and 0 % free in duodenum (p < 0. 01). The distal choledochus and ampulla were inflamed in 89 % of the patients who underwent early operations, but in merely 17 % operated upon electively (p < 0. 01). Concomitant acute cholecystitis was present in 31 % of the patients if surgery was performed during the initial admission, but in only 3 % of the patients at delayed operation (p < 0. 05). Most striking was the sudden “gush” of pancreatic juice when the ampullary sphincter was first stretched or cut during sphincteroplasty at early operation. Precipitous falls in serum amylase levels then followed over the next 24 hours. No significant differences were noticed in the mortality rate (one death after early operation, two after a delayed procedure), major morbidity rate (in four and three patients, respectively), or in duration of the initial hospitalization period (early operation: 13. 5 days, delayed operation: 16. 7 days). However, a second admission {{to the hospital for}} the delayed operation (12. 1 days) was avoided by early operation. These data support the concept that biliary pancreatitis is probably initiated by gallstone passage through, or lodgement at, the ampulla of Vater. The resultant ampullary edema with or without gallstone impaction appears to be the anatomic cause for major pancreatic duct obstruction and the consequent pancreatitis. Early and appropriate surgical relief of the biliary tract pathology via a transduodenal sphincteroplasty can obviate the need for a second admission to the hospital without increasing, significantly, the attendant morbidity and mortality rates...|$|R

6000|$|The best tuneras (cochineal-plantations) lay in Grand Canary, {{where they}} could be most watered. Wherever maize thrives, {{producing}} a good dark leaf and grain in plenty, there cochineal also succeeds. The soil is technically called mina de tosca, a whitish, pumice-like stone, often forming a gravel conglomerate under a rocky stratum: hardening by exposure, it is good for building. Immense labour is required to prepare such ground for the cactus. The earth must be taken from below the surface-rock, as at Malta; spread in terraced beds, and <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> loose <b>stones,</b> which are built up in walls or in molleras, cubes or pyramids. Such ground sold for $150 per acre; $600 were paid for mètre-deep soil unencumbered by stone. Where the chalk predominates, it must be mixed with the volcanic sand locally called zahorra. In all cases the nopals are set at distances of half a yard, in trenches at least three feet deep. The 'streets,' or intervals, must measure nearly two yards, so that water may flow freely and sunshine may not be arrested. Good ground, if irrigated in winter and kept <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> weeds by the haçada (hoe), produces a cactus capable of being 'seeded' after the second year; if poor, a third is required. The plant lasts, with manure to defend it from exhaustion, a full decade. [Footnote: The compost was formerly natural, dry or liquid as in Switzerland; but for some years the costly guano and chemicals have been introduced. Formerly also potatoes were set between the stems; and well-watered lands gave an annual grain-crop as well as a green crop.] ...|$|R
