40|$|Reported is {{the result}} of an {{experimental}} investigation of fire-induced response of a 96 kg/m{sup 3 } closed cell rigid polyurethane foam. The specimen is 0. 37 m in diameter, and 152 mm thick, placed in a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>test</b> <b>vessel.</b> The fire condition is simulated by heating the bottom of the test vessel to 1283 K using a radiant heat source. Real-time x-ray shows that the degradation process involves the progression of a charring front into the virgin material. The charred region has a regular and graded structure consisting of a packed bubble outer layer and successive layers of thin shells. The layer-to-layer permeability appears to be poor. There are indications that gas vents laterally. The shell-like structure might be the result of lateral venting. Although the foam degradation process is quite complicated, the in-depth temperature responses in the uncharted foam appear to be consistent with steady state ablation. The measured temperature responses are well represented by the exponential distribution for steady state ablation. An estimate of the thermal diffusivity of the foam is obtained from the ablation model. The experiment is part of a more comprehensive program to develop material response models of foams and encapsulants...|$|E
40|$|The High-Temperature Combustion Facility (HTCF) was {{designed}} and constructed {{with the objective of}} studying detonation phenomena in mixtures of hydrogen-air-steam at initially high temperatures. The central element of the HTCF is a 27 -cm inner-diameter, 21. 3 -m long <b>cylindrical</b> <b>test</b> <b>vessel</b> capable of being heating to 700 K {+-} 14 K. A unique feature of the HTCF is the {open_quotes}diaphragmless{close_quotes} acetylene-oxygen gas driver which is used to initiate the detonation in the test gas. Cell size measurements have shown that for any hydrogen-air-steam mixture, increasing the initial mixture temperature, in the range of 300 K to 650 K, while maintaining the initial pressure of 0. 1 MPa, decreases the cell size and thus makes the mixture more detonable. The effect of steam dilution on cell size was tested in stoichiometric and off-stoichiometric (e. g., equivalence ratio of 0. 5) hydrogen-air mixtures. Increasing the steam dilution in hydrogen-air mixtures at 0. 1 MPa initial pressure increases the cell size, irrespective of initial temperature. It is also observed that the desensitizing effect of steam diminished with increased initial temperature. A 1 -dimensional, steady-state Zel`dovich, von Neumann, Doring (ZND) model, with full chemical kinetics, has been used to predict cell size for hydrogen-air-steam mixtures at different initial conditions. Qualitatively the model predicts the overall trends observed in the measured cell size versus mixture composition and initial temperature and pressure. It was found that the proportionality constant used to predict detonation cell size from the calculated ZND model reaction zone varies between 10 and 100 depending on the mixture composition and initial temperature. 32 refs., 35 figs...|$|E

40|$|Within this {{document}} a concept {{for a test}} setup that is able to mimic the mechanism and physical effects concerning the transport and storage of LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) within a see transport vessel that is build specific for that purpose. The test should cover the effects of heat exchange with walls, impact of pressure change {{and the influence of}} sloshing motion and furthermore help to improve building numerical models and simulation techniques. The test specimen is a scaled down and simplified version of a section of the tank design that is applied for the cryogenic tank of the LNG transporting ships. The test specimen {{is referred to as the}} <b>test</b> <b>vessel</b> in the remaining of the document. In order to be able to control the temperature and heat flow conditions, this <b>test</b> <b>vessel</b> should be equipped with heating elements at predefined portions of the vessel wall. To further direct the heat flow, the outside of the <b>test</b> <b>vessel</b> has to be equipped with thermal insulation. To further control the thermal conditions of the <b>test</b> <b>vessel,</b> it is foreseen that the vessel is partly submerged into a cryogenic bath, which consists of the same liquid as the test liquid. Therefore the <b>test</b> <b>vessel</b> will be situated inside a dewar.

40|$|Simulated gas-driven eruptions using CO 2 –water-polymer {{systems are}} reported. Eruptions are {{initiated}} by rapidly decompressing CO 2 –saturated water containing up to 1. 0 [*]wt. % CO 2. Both <b>cylindrical</b> <b>test</b> cells and a flask test cell {{were used to}} examine the effect of magma chamber/conduit geometry on eruption dynamics. Bubble-growth kinetics are examined quantitatively in experiments using <b>cylindrical</b> <b>test</b> cells. Uninhibited bubble growth can be roughly expressed as d r /d t ≈λ D (β- 1) /(γ t 1 / 3) for a CO 2 –water-polymer system at 0 – 22   °C and with viscosities up to 5 [*]Pa·s, where r is the radius of bubbles, λ and D are the Ostwald solubility coefficient and diffusivity of the gas in the liquid, β is the degree of saturation (decompression ratio), and γ characterizes how the boundary layer thickness increases with time and is roughly 1. 0 × 10 – 5 [*]m/s 1 / 3 in this system. Unlike the radius of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>test</b> cells, which does not affect the eruption threshold and dynamics, the shape of the test cells (flask vs cylindrical) affects the dynamics but not the threshold of eruptions. For <b>cylindrical</b> <b>test</b> cells, the front motion is characterized by constant acceleration with both Δ h (the height increase) and Δ V (the volume increase) being proportional to t 2; for the flask test cell, however, neither Δ h nor Δ V is proportional to t 2 as the conduit radius varies. Test-cell geometry also affects foam stability. In the flask test cell, as it moves from the wider base chamber into the narrower conduit, the bubbly flow becomes fragmented, affecting the eruption dynamics. The fragmentation may be caused by a sudden increase in acceleration induced by conduit-shape change, or by the presence of obstacles to the bubbly flow. This result may help explain the range in vesicularities of pumice and reticulite...|$|R

Seven pressurized vessels were evaluated under hypervelocity impact conditions. The <b>vessels</b> were <b>tested</b> with various combinations of liquids and gasses at various pressures. Results from the evaluation showed that vessels containing 100 -percent pressurized gas sustained more severe damage and had a higher potential for damaging nearby equipment, than vessels containing 75 -percent liquid, 25 -percent inert pressurized gas. Two water-filled <b>test</b> <b>vessels,</b> {{one of which was}} placed behind an aluminum shield, failed by bulging and splitting open at the impact point; pressure was relieved without the vessel fragmenting or sustaining internal damage. An additional water-filled <b>test</b> <b>vessel,</b> placed a greater distance behind an aluminum shield, sustained damage that resembled a shotgun blast, but did not bulge or split open; again, pressure was relieved without the <b>vessel</b> fragmenting.
