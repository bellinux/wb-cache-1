25|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>data</b> {{assurance}} verifies {{the integrity}} of data flowing through the information systems. <b>Continuous</b> <b>data</b> assurance uses software to extract data from IT systems for analysis at the transactional level to provide more detailed assurance. CDA systems provide the ability to design expectation models for analytical procedures at the business-process level, {{as opposed to the}} current practice of relying on ratio or trend analysis at higher levels of data aggregation. CDA software can continuously and automatically monitor transactions, comparing their generic characteristics with predetermined benchmarks, thereby identifying anomalous situations. When significant discrepancies occur, alarms are triggered and routed to appropriate stakeholders and auditors.|$|E

40|$|Continuous media applications, {{which require}} a {{guaranteed}} transfer {{rate of the}} data, are becoming {{an integral part of}} daily computational life. However, conventional le systems do not provide rate guarantees, and are therefore not suitable for the storage and retrieval of <b>continuous</b> media <b>data</b> (e. g., audio, video). To meet the demands of these new applications, continuous media le systems, which provide rate guarantees by managing critical storage resources such as memory and disks, must be designed. In this paper, we highlight the issues in the storage and retrieval of <b>continuous</b> media <b>data.</b> We rst present a simple scheme for concurrently retrieving multiple continuous media streams from disks. We then introduce a a clever allocation technique for storing <b>continuous</b> media <b>data</b> that eliminates disk latency and thus, drastically reduces RAM requirements. We present, for video data, schemes for implementing the operations fast-forward, rewind and pause. Finally, we conclude by outlining directions for future research in the storage and retrieval of <b>continuous</b> media <b>data...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{time scale}} {{calculus}} is a unification {{of the theory}} of difference equations with that of differential equations, which has applications to fields requiring simultaneous modelling of discrete and <b>continuous</b> <b>data.</b> Another way of modeling such a situation is the notion of hybrid dynamical system.|$|E
25|$|Histograms are {{sometimes}} confused with bar charts. A histogram {{is used for}} <b>continuous</b> <b>data,</b> where the bins represent ranges of data, while a bar chart is a plot of categorical variables.

25|$|Ideally, statisticians compile {{data about}} the entire {{population}} (an operation called census). This may be organized by governmental statistical institutes. Descriptive statistics {{can be used to}} summarize the population data. Numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for <b>continuous</b> <b>data</b> types (like income), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data (like race).|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the recent}} popularization of digital {{broadcasting}} systems, close-range broadcasting using <b>continuous</b> media <b>data,</b> i. e. audio and video, has attracted great attention. For example, in a drama, after a user watches interesting content such as a highlight scene, he/she will watch the main program continuously. In close-range broadcasting, the necessary bandwidth for continuously playing {{the two types of}} data increases. Conventional methods reduce the necessary bandwidth by producing an effective broadcast schedule for <b>continuous</b> media <b>data.</b> However, these methods do not consider the broadcast schedule for two types of <b>continuous</b> media <b>data.</b> When the server schedules two types of <b>continuous</b> media <b>data,</b> waiting time that occurs from finishing the highlight scene to starting the main scene, may increase. In this paper, we propose a scheduling method to reduce the waiting time for close-range broadcasting. In our proposed method, by dividing two types of data and producing an effective broadcast schedule considering the available bandwidth, we can reduce the waiting time...|$|R

25|$|Multivariate {{modeling}} {{can give}} {{answers to questions}} about the genetic relationship between variables that appear independent. For instance: do IQ and long-term memory share genes? Do they share environmental causes? Additional benefits include the {{ability to deal with}} interval, threshold, and <b>continuous</b> <b>data,</b> retaining full information from data with missing values, integrating the latent modeling with measured variables, be they measured environments, or, now, measured molecular genetic markers such as SNPs. In addition, models avoid constraint problems in the crude correlation method: all parameters will lie, as they should, between 0–1 (standardized).|$|E
25|$|In practice, the {{difficulties}} {{associated with the}} Gibbs phenomenon can be ameliorated by using a smoother method of Fourier series summation, such as Fejér summation or Riesz summation, or by using sigma-approximation. Using a continuous wavelet transform, the wavelet Gibbs phenomenon never exceeds the Fourier Gibbs phenomenon. Also, using the discrete wavelet transform with Haar basis functions, the Gibbs phenomenon does not occur {{at all in the}} case of <b>continuous</b> <b>data</b> at jump discontinuities, and is minimal in the discrete case at large change points. In wavelet analysis, this is commonly referred to as the Longo phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|Because of this, the Tropical rain belt may {{not have}} risen to its {{northern}} latitudes, thus causing an absence of seasonal rains. This claim is not universally accepted and {{is very difficult to}} test. However a 2009 Chinese study of 50 years of <b>continuous</b> <b>data</b> found that, though most parts of eastern China saw no significant change in the amount of water held by the atmosphere, light rains had decreased. The researchers then modeled the effect of aerosols and also concluded the overall effect was that water drops in polluted cases are up to 50 percent smaller than in pristine skies. They concluded smaller size impedes the formation of rain clouds, and the falling of light rain is beneficial for agriculture. [...] This was a different effect than reducing solar irradiance, but still a direct result from the presence of aerosols.|$|E
