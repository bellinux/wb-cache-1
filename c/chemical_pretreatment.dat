X-ray diffractogram demonstrated that <b>chemical</b> <b>pretreatments</b> significantly increased the crystallinity of CNFs from 38. 00 % to 70. 36 %; however, 10 - 15 times of grinding operation followed by homogenizing treatment after the <b>chemical</b> <b>pretreatments</b> did not significantly improve the crystallinity of CNFs.

40|$|Immunofluorescence {{detection}} of proteins in growth plate cartilage is often unsuccessful because of innate autofluorescence, fixative-induced fluorescence, and dense cartilage matrix, which can inhibit antibody penetration. To overcome these limitations, {{the authors have}} tested various <b>chemical</b> <b>pretreatments,</b> including the autofluorescence quencher sodium borohydride, the antigen retrieval method of boiling sodium citrate, sugar-degrading enzymes (hyaluronidase, heparinase, and chondroitinase), and the proteolytic enzyme protease XXIV.

Blocking intrinsic fluorescence of the specimen in combination with specific pretreatments allows visualization using antibodies that previously did not generate a robust signal in the growth plate.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} main {{stillage}} disposal methods {{from the point}} of view of technology, economics and energetics.

Other disposal techniques mentioned in the literature (electrofenton reaction, electrocoagulation and reverse osmosis) have not been considered, due to their high costs and technological requirements. Energy and economic calculations were carried out for a planned production of 120 m 3 of stillage per day in a given distillery. Only specific treatment operating costs (per 1 m 3 of stillage) were compared, including operational costs for energy, transport and chemicals. These values were determined for January 31 st, 2009.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to increase butanol product yields using wheat straw as the biomass. First this study examined different pretreatment and saccharification processes to obtain the maximum sugar concentration. Three different physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>pretreatment</b> methods for the wheat straws were examined in the present work in comparison with physical pretreatment alone as a reference. This included water, acidic, and alkaline pretreatment. For all cases, physical pretreatment represented by 1 mm size reduction of the straws was applied prior to each pretreatment. Results showed that 13. 91 g/L glucose concentration was produced from saccharification with just the physical pretreatment (i. e., no <b>chemical</b> <b>pretreatment).</b> This represented ~ 5 - 20 % lower sugar release in saccharification compared to the other three pretreatment processes. Saccharification with acid pretreatment obtained the highest sugar concentrations, which were 18. 77 g/L glucose and 12. 19 g/L xylose. Second this study produced butanol from simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using wheat straw hydrolysate and Clostridium beijerinckii BA 101. Water pretreatment was applied to separate lignin and polysaccharides from the wheat straw. Physical pretreatment was applied prior to water pretreatment where, wheat straw was grounded into fine particles less than 1 mm size. Another experiment was conducted where physical pretreatment was applied alone prior to SSF (i. e. no <b>chemical</b> <b>pretreatment</b> was applied).

In the goblet cells of proximal colon, sialic acid bound α 2, 3 to Galβ 1, 3 GalNAc subterminal dimers is diacetylated at C 7,C 8;C 7,C 9;C 8,C 9 or triacetylated at C 7, 8, 9. In the distal colon, sialic acid-linked α 2, 3 to Galβ 1, 3 GalNAc subterminal dimers shows reduced O-acetylation at C 7 and/or C 8, while acetyl substituents at C 9 and at C 4 are almost absent. Sialic acid is involved in different essential physiological functions; thus, alterations of its expression and acetylation in oligosaccharide chains of intestinal mucins are generally associated with diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and cancer.
