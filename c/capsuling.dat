40|$|There {{have been}} many reports {{concerning}} the role of dietary fiber in lowering postprandial serum glucose, and the main mechanism was regarded as the viscosity of different dietary fibers ih hampering diffusion of glucose and postponing absorption and digestion of carbohydrates. In this paper, two kinds of water-insoluble dietary fibers, water-insoluble dietary fiber of wheat bran and enzyme-resistant starch of maize amylose, and four kinds of water-soluble dietary fibers, water-soluble dietary fiber of wheat bran, carboxymethyl cellulose, guar gum, and xanthan gum, were used to investigate their postprandial serum glucose lowering mechanism in vitro. The results showed that these dietary fibers lowered postprandial serum glucose levels at least by three mechanisms. First, dietary fibers increase the viscosity of small intestine juice and hinder diffusion of glucose; second, they bind glucose and decrease the concentration of available glucose in the small intestine; and, third, they retard α-amylase action through <b>capsuling</b> starch and the enzyme and might directly inhibit the enzyme. All of these decreased the absorption rate of glucose and the concentration of postprandial serum glucose. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|E
30|$|The rising {{tendency}} of cancer incidence is continuing {{along with the}} raising of aging population in recent decades [1]. The effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy of cancers has been limited as {{only a small portion}} of total dose reaches the tumor site, the remainder of which is distributed throughout healthy tissues, resulting in negative effects especially neutropenia and cardiomyopathy [2]. Nanoparticles represent a potential platform for the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics [3]. As a result, reduced side effect and enhanced therapeutic efficacy can be achieved. Copolymers based Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MePEG)/poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) are supposed to be promising organic nanoparticles used in drug delivery systems (DDSs), and have already been approved by FDA. These nanoparticles possess easy controlled characteristics like biocompatibility, biodegradability, and thermosensitivity [4]. Some diblock and triblock polymers have been investigated in biomedical applications, like PCL nanosphere [5], PEG-PCL-PEG [6 – 8], and PCL-PEG-PCL [9] hydrogel. The PCL blocks compose a hydrophobic core <b>capsuling</b> hydrophobic drugs, whereas the PEG blocks form a hydrophilic shell, which makes core-shell micellar nanostructures. These diblock and triblock polymers draw considerable attentions due to the characteristics such as stable structure, prolonged duration in blood circulation, and passive targeting by means of enhanced permeation and retention effect [10]. However, controversial challenges of organic polymers still exist, including toxicity, low drug payloads, undesired drug leakage, and clearance by reticuloendothelial system [11 – 13].|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time {{elemental}} mercury in air and surface seawater was measured continuously in the remote seas of western Antarctica. A major contributor to atmospheric emissions of the toxic and globally dispersed pollutant mercury is the re-evasion from water surfaces, due to a supersaturation of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) in surface water. In this study the degree of saturation and mercury flux at the air-sea surface interface have been estimated from continuous measurements of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) or total gaseous mercury (TGM) in air, DGM in surface water and meteorological parameters. The measurements were performed during winter and spring (2013) in the Weddell Sea and during summer (2010 / 2011) in the Bellingshausen, Amundsen and Ross Seas, and show spatial and seasonal variations. The average DGM concentration in surface water in open sea was highest during spring (12 +/- 7 pg L- 1) and lowest during summer (7 +/- 6. 8 pg L- 1), resulting in a net evasion of mercury during spring (1. 1 +/- 1. 6 ng m(- 2) h(- 1)) and a net deposition during summer (- 0. 2 +/- 1. 3 ng m(- 2) h(- 1)). In open sea, higher average concentrations of GEM (or TGM) and DGM were found close to the Drake Passage compared to in the Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas. Emission sources from the South American continent, identified with back trajectories, were suggested to explain the observed variations. The yearly mercury evasion from open sea surfaces in the Southern Ocean was estimated to 30 (- 450 - 1700) tons, using the average (and min and max) flux rates obtained in this study. Higher DGM was measured under sea ice (19 - 62 pg L- 1 compared to in open sea due to a <b>capsuling</b> effect, resulting in a theoretical prevented evasion of 520 (0 - 3400) tons per year. Diminishing sea ice and higher water temperatures in polar regions could result in increased mercury evasion to the atmosphere. However, {{the contribution of the}} Southern Ocean to the global modeled annual emissions of mercury from sea surfaces would probably only be a few percent...|$|E

40|$|<b>Capsule</b> flow {{dynamics}} in microchannels plays {{a significant role}} in complex biological phenomena, such as the microcirculation, and in engineering applications, such as in microfluidic devices for drug delivery and cell sorting. In this thesis, we investigate the motion of elastic <b>capsules</b> in wall-bounded flows by extending the Membrane Spectral Boundary Element method developed by Dodson and Dimitrakopoulos for free-suspended flows. First, a validation study of the method is performed for the axisymmetric <b>capsule</b> motion in a cylindrical channel. For a <b>capsule</b> moving along the centerline of a cylindrical channel, our computational model successfully reproduced the parachute shape observed in earlier experimental and computational studies. Next, we investigate the flow dynamics of a strain-hardening Skalak <b>capsule</b> moving along the centerline in a square and a rectangular channel. We examine how the capillary number and <b>capsule</b> size influence the deformation and physical properties of the <b>capsule.</b> For large <b>capsules</b> in a square channel, our investigation reveals that the steady-state <b>capsule</b> shape is non-axisymmetric. The <b>capsule</b> assumes a shape similar to the channel's cross-section i. e. a square shape with rounded edges. Buckling of the <b>capsule's</b> upstream end resulting in a negative edge curvature is observed at higher capillary numbers and for large <b>capsule</b> sizes. For the largest <b>capsules</b> studied, we also observe the development of dimples at the <b>capsule's</b> lateral surface. A comparative study of <b>capsule</b> motion and deformation in cylindrical and square channels shows that the <b>capsule</b> deformation in a cylindrical channel is similar to that in a square channel at a larger capillary number. In a rectangular channel, we observe a three-dimensional (i. e. non-axisymmetric) deformation of the <b>capsule</b> at high capillary numbers resulting in dimpling of the <b>capsule's</b> upstream end at steady state. We also consider the transient motion of a <b>capsule</b> in a converging square microchannel and investigate the influence of viscosity ratio, capillary number and <b>capsule</b> size on the evolution of <b>capsule</b> properties.

40|$|Background Fermentation using {{encapsulated}} yeast {{leads to}} more robust ethanol production from lignocellulose hydrolyzates. Encapsulated yeast is much more tolerant to inhibitors present in hydrolyzates, and fermentation is faster due to increased total cell density. For industrial applications, <b>capsules</b> must be made robust enough to endure long periods and numerous cultivations without breaking. Results Liquid core alginatechitosanalginate (ACA) <b>capsules</b> containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae were produced by the liquid-droplet-forming method and treated with hydrolyzed 3 -aminopropyltrietoxysilane (hAPTES) forming very glossy <b>capsules.</b> <b>Capsules</b> produced with 3. 0 % hAPTES showed the best mechanical robustness but no ethanol could be produced in dilute-acid spruce hydrolyzate using these <b>capsules.</b> Untreated ACA <b>capsules</b> gave the highest ethanol production but demonstrated poor mechanical robustness. 25 % of the ACA <b>capsules</b> ruptured within 6 h in the shear test. <b>Capsules</b> treated with 1. 5 % hAPTES were significantly stronger, since only 02 % of these <b>capsules</b> broke.

In addition, this experience implies the potential risk for ingesting the patency <b>capsule.</b> We must be aware that the patency <b>capsule</b> could also be aspirated and there may be more unrecognized aspiration cases...|$|R
