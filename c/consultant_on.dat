5|$|A second {{satellite}} studio, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida, {{opened in}} 1989 with 40 employees. Its offices were {{located within the}} Disney-MGM Studios theme park at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, and visitors were allowed to tour the studio and observe animators at work. That same year, the studio released The Little Mermaid, which became a keystone achievement in Disney's history as its largest critical and commercial success in decades. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, who'd been co-directors on The Great Mouse Detective, The Little Mermaid earned $84 million at the North American box office, a record for the studio. The film was built around a score from Broadway songwriters Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, {{who was also a}} co-producer and story <b>consultant</b> <b>on</b> the film. The Little Mermaid won two Academy Awards, for Best Original Song and for Best Original Score.|$|E
5|$|Born in Hingham, Massachusetts, Lincoln {{was educated}} at Harvard, and studied law with Joseph Hawley before {{establishing}} a law practice in Worcester, Massachusetts. He {{was active in}} local politics, and participated in the convention that drafted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1779. He supported Quock Walker, a former slave seeking confirmation of his freedom under that constitution in 1783. He entered national politics with his election to the United States House of Representatives in 1800, but was immediately tapped by Jefferson to become Attorney General. Lincoln served Jefferson as a <b>consultant</b> <b>on</b> the politics of New England, and was influential {{in the distribution of}} patronage in the region. He served on a commission that resolved claims emanating from the Yazoo land scandal in Georgia, and advised Jefferson on matters related to the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by German and American examples, he {{successfully}} {{asked the}} council to construct a system of villas at Bexley, advocated the separate treatment of acute and chronic cases, and introduced parole-style rewards for 'industrious' patients. Like some of his earlier administrative innovations, villas became popular and inspired similar designs elsewhere. Stansfield also served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I, and as a <b>consultant</b> <b>on</b> nervous diseases to the Eastern Command. Although he was appointed a CBE in 1919 for his war work, historians have drawn attention to his scepticism about shell shock, his attitudes towards eugenics and heredity, and his potentially misogynistic views about medical officers marrying. He nonetheless married twice, settling with his first wife at a house in Wimbledon where he enjoyed tending to the gardens; after her death, he married a second time in 1929 {{and moved to a}} villa in Sanremo, Italy, where he lived out his retirement.|$|E

He was educated at the University of Chicago and spent most of his career at Indiana University Bloomington, where he received tenure in 1956 and retired as Arthur F. Bentley Professor Emeritus of Political Science in 1984. Caldwell was the internationally acclaimed author or coauthor of fifteen books and more than 250 scholarly articles, which may be found in at least 19 different languages. He served on many boards and advisory committees, as a <b>consultant</b> <b>on</b> environmental policy issues worldwide, and received numerous honors and awards.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical <b>consultant</b> <b>on</b> the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E
5|$|This film {{marks the}} second {{adaptation}} of Shūsaku Endō's novel, which was previously adapted by Masahiro Shinoda into the 1971 {{film of the}} same name. Scorsese penned the initial screenplay in 1991 with co-writer and longtime collaborator Jay Cocks. However, they were unsatisfied with the script and conducted rewrites for an additional 15 years. Later, Endō's official translator, Van C. Gessel, who has translated eight of his novels, assisted as a <b>consultant</b> <b>on</b> the film. The screenplay as finally filmed was assessed in critical review as an accurate depiction of the novel as written by Endo. Religious historian Haruko Nawata Ward has indicated that {{the inclusion of the}} small crucifix in the deceased priest's hand {{at the end of the}} film was an auteur decision made by Scorsese not included in Endo's original book.|$|E
