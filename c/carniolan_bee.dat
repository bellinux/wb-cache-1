5000|$|... "O Vrba" [...] is a sonnet {{written in}} 1832 and later {{corrected}} by the Slovene Romantic poet France Prešeren, {{who is considered}} the national poet of Slovenia. It was published in 1834 in the fourth volume of the almanac Krajnska čbelica (<b>Carniolan</b> <b>Bee).</b> It is the introductory exposition of a cycle of six sonnets, titled the Sonnets of Misfortune (Sonetje nesreče). The sonnet {{is dedicated to the}} Prešeren's home village of Vrba, expressing a sense of general melancholy over the lost idyll of the rural environment. According to contemporary Slovene literary critics, especially Marija Pirjevec, Boris Paternu and Janko Kos, the meaning of the sonnet is centered on the problem of insecurity and unhappiness of a free subject detached from the theocentric world view. The sonnet form follows the rules abstracted by August Wilhelm Schlegel from the sonnets of Petrarch. In the 20th century, several musical interpretations of the poem were created, the most known of them probably being a version by the Slovene folk rock musician Vlado Kreslin.|$|E

40|$|The {{superiority of}} Africanized over European honey bees in {{tropical}} and subtropical {{regions of the}} New World is both well documented and poorly understood. As {{part of an effort}} to try to understand the process by which the displacement of European bees occurred, we examined the ability of these two types of bees and of hybrids between the two to convert natural and artificial diets into usable protein. Newly emerged bees from colonies of tropically adapted Africanized and temperate-origin <b>Carniolan</b> <b>bees</b> and first-generation hybrids between the two were caged and fed artificial and natural protein diets for six days to determine whether there were differences in their ability to use these diets. The Africanized bees developed significantly higher protein levels in the hemolymph than did the <b>Carniolan</b> <b>bees.</b> The difference was 31 % when the bees were fed bee bread (37. 5 and 28. 56 mu g protein/mu L hemolymph, respectively). The hybrids developed protein levels intermediate between the two parental types. These were approximately 10 times the levels found in bees fed with sucrose alone.

Overall hygienic behaviour of colonies with a lower and greater genetic variability did not differ significantly and amounted to 52. 1 and 47. 0 %, respectively. Colonies within the lower variability group, in which drones from line selected in hygienic behaviour performance were used for inseminating queens, had a significantly greater percent of cleaned pupae than other colonies (63. 2 %).

40|$|In Apis mellifera, {{hygienic}} behavior involves {{recognition and}} removal of sick, damaged or dead brood from capped cells. We investigated whether bees react {{in the same}} way to grouped versus isolated damaged capped brood cells. Three colonies of wild-type Africanized honey bees and three colonies of <b>Carniolan</b> honey <b>bees</b> were used for this investigation. Capped worker brood cells aged 12 to 14 days old were perforated with the pin-killing method. After making holes in the brood cells, the combs were placed back into the hives; 24 h later the number of cleaned cells was recorded in areas with pin-killed and control brood cells. Four repetitions were made in each colony. Isolated cells were more frequently cleaned than grouped cells, though variance analysis showed no significant difference (P = 0. 1421). <b>Carniolan</b> <b>bees</b> also were somewhat, though not significantly more hygienic than Africanized honey bees (P = 0. 0840). We conclude that honey bees can detect and remove both isolated and grouped dead brood. The tendency towards greater hygienic efficiency directed towards grouped pin-killed brood may be a consequence of a greater concentration of volatiles emanating from the wounds in the dead pupae.

The aggressive temperament of the Sudanese bees and the FI hybrid during summer may be another reason.
