In an {{interview}} with Bloomberg, Hotz revealed he is building vehicular automation technology based on artificial intelligence algorithms. Hotz has built a working self-driving 2016 Acura ILX, which he demonstrated on the I-280 in a video. The video prompted a cease and desist letter from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Hotz wants to sell his technology to Tesla Motors and he has reported to have talked to CEO Elon Musk and is working on proving his technology to be superior to that of Mobileye, which, at the time, was used for Tesla Autopilot. [...] Hotz claims that Musk offered him $12 million (minus $1 million for every month it took Hotz to work on the task) to create a driving system that could replace the MobilEye solution currently used in Tesla vehicles.Tesla later released a statement on their website citing corrections to the Bloomberg article, stressing that their autopilot system was developed in-house, with a vision <b>chip</b> <b>component</b> from MobilEye, instead of one separate autopilot system manufactured by MobilEye, as suggested by Hotz in the interview with Bloomberg.

The system is designed to be compact, robust and stable even though it does not involve noise compensation and feedback control. Compared to currently available techniques, this system has great potential for on-line surface measurements. This application is based on a Michelson interferometer and wavelength scanning method.

The pur-poses are to numerically simulate the formation of solder joints, analyze the shape of solder joints and its influential factors and provide an efficient tool for design and manufacturing engineers to improve the integrity of solder interconnections. The formation of solder joints is numerically simulated through a surface evolver program and the calculation is automated with an additional con-troller.

This paper {{presents the results}} of an investigation into the relationship between a number of important material properties and geometric parameters on the thermal-mechanical fatigue reliability of a standard flip chip design and a flip chip design with the use of microvias. Computer modeling has been used to analyze the mechanical conditions of flip chips under cyclic thermal loading where the Coffin-Manson empirical relationship has been used to predict the life time of the solder interconnects. The material properties and geometry parameters that have been investigated are the Young's modulus, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the underfill, the out-of-plane CTE (CTEz) of the substrate, the thickness of the substrate, and the standoff height. When these parameters vary, the predicted life-times are calculated and some of the features of the results are explained.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} simple method of {{fabricating}} flexible electronic devices using a metal template for passive alignment between <b>chip</b> <b>components</b> and an interconnect layer, which enabled efficient alignment with high accuracy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor was fabricated using 20 Âµm thick polyimide (PI) {{film as a}} flexible substrate to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The interconnect layer was fabricated by a two-step photolithography process and evaporation. After applying solder paste, the metal template was placed {{on top of the}} interconnect layer. The metal template had rectangular holes at the same position as the <b>chip</b> <b>components</b> on the interconnect layer. Rectangular hole sizes were designed to account for alignment tolerance of the chips.

40|$|Environmental stress tests, or {{accelerated}} life tests, apply stresses {{to electronic}} packages that exceed the stress levels {{experienced in the}} field. In theory, these elevated stress levels are used to generate the same failure mechanisms that are seen in the field, only at an accelerated rate. The methods of assessing reliability of electronic packages can be classified into two categories: a statistical failure based approach and a physics of failure based approach. This research uses a statistical based methodology to identify the critical factors in reliability performance of a flip chip on board component level assembly and a physics of failure based approach to develop a low cycle strain based fatigue equation for flip <b>chip</b> <b>component</b> level assemblies. The critical factors in determining reliability performance were established via experimental investigation and their influence quantified via regression analysis. This methodology differs from other strain based fatigue approaches {{because it is not}} an empirical fit to experimental data; it utilizes regression analysis and least squares to obtain correction factors, or correction functions, and constants for a strain based fatigue equation, where the total inelastic strain is determined analytically.

40|$|Since the {{application}} of lead-free soldering has become oblig-atory in the electronic industry by the 1 st of July 2006, the in-depth analysis of the soldering process {{is more important than}} ever. The small chip components of the present days demand very accurate component placement machines to prevent com-mon reflow failures such as skewing or tombstoning. The ability of components to be self-aligned during soldering works against these failures, therefore it matters to what extent the solder pro-motes this effect. Dynamic behaviour of SMT (Surface Mount Technology) chip components during lead-free reflow soldering will be demonstrated in the paper. A force model has been intro-duced with the five main forces which determine the movement of the <b>chip</b> <b>component</b> during reflow soldering, namely: the force originating from the surface tension, the forces originating from hydrostatic and capillary pressure, the force of gravity, and the force of dynamic friction. The self-alignment of 0603 size chip components has been investigated by real experiments. SM chip components are misplaced intentionally by semi-automatic pick&place machine, and before and after reflow soldering the exact location of com-ponents was measured. The results have shown that the self-alignment of components does occur even in the case of 400 - 500 Âµm lateral misplacements. The explanation of the equations of the applied theory and the results of the experiments are pre-sented in the paper in details.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this work is to study the effect of {{intermetallic}} compound (IMC) layer thickness on the shear strength of surface mount component (SMC) 1206 chip resistor solder joints. Design/methodology/approach: To evaluate the shear strength and intermetallic compound thickness of the 1206 chip resistor solder joints, the test vehicles were conventionally reflowed for 480 seconds at a peak temperature of 240 Â°C at different isothermal ageing times of 100, 200 and 300 hours. A cross-sectional study {{was conducted on the}} reflowed and aged 1206 chip resistor solder joints. The shear strength of the solder joints aged at 100, 200 and 300 hours was measured using a shear tester (Dage- 4000 PXY Bond tester). Findings: It was found that the growth of IMC layer thickness increases as the ageing time increases at a constant temperature of 175 Â°C, which resulted in a reduction of solder joint strength due to its brittle nature. It was also found that the shear strength of the reflowed 1206 chip resistor solder joint was higher than the aged joints. Moreover, it was revealed that the shear strength of the 1206 resistor solder joints aged at 100, 200 and 300 hours was influenced by the ageing reaction times. The results also indicate that an increase in ageing time and temperature do not have much influence on the formation and growth of kirkendall voids. Research limitations/implications: Proper correlation between shear strength and fracture mode is required. Practical implications: The IMC thickness can be used to predict the shear strength of the component/PCB pad solder joint. Originality/value: The shear strength of 1206 chip resistor solder joint is a function of ageing time and temperature (ÂºC). Therefore, it is vital to consider the shear strength of surface mount <b>chip</b> <b>component</b> in high temperature electronics...|$|E

The intentions of this dissertation are to demonstrate the relationship between printed wiring board flexure {{and the failure of}} leadless ceramic <b>chip</b> <b>components</b> and to develop a methodology for rapidly assessing the risk of these types of failures. To achieve this objective, closed form structural engineering based equations have been developed for calculating the loads at the critical location within the surface mount package when the underlying printed wiring board is subjected to bending.
