40|$|The {{scaling of}} CMOS {{technology}} continues {{to improve the}} processor capability and memory capacity, requiring memory interface with higher bandwidth and better energy efficiency to enhance the overall system performance. Among those cutting-edge designs of memory interface, multi-band signaling has shown great potential for its high throughput along with low energy consumption. With spectrally divided signaling, the multi-band transceiver can be designed to avoid spectral notches and extend communication bandwidth on multi-drop buses. Also, the multi-band transceiver is immune to inter-symbol interference caused by channel attenuation because of unique self-equalization double-sideband signaling. In this dissertation, we will demonstrate a tri-band transceiver with four parallel lanes that achieved a total data rate of 40 Gb/s with total power consumption of 38 mW in 28 nm CMOS technology. To realize the total data rate of 40 Gb/s, PAM- 4 and 16 -QAM are used at the baseband and 3 / 6 GHz bands, respectively, to carry 10 parallel bit streams at 1 GBaud via each lane of the transceivers. These ten parallel bit streams share the same physical channel to minimize the time skew among them. In view of this, the strobe signal, DQS, is {{assigned to one of}} the ten bits for data recovery at the receiving end. Under 6 dB attenuation at 6 GHz on a 2 ” dense FR- 4 differential bus (line pitch of 6 mil), the transmitting end consumes only 1. 6 mW/lane. Together with 4. 7 mW/lane of the receiving end and 13. 4 mW of the <b>carrier</b> <b>generator</b> to be shared among all lanes consumes, the total power consumption and average energy efficiency are 38 mW and 0. 95 pJ/b.

This stabilization of the 5s orbitals causes a formation of a donor level for the oxygen ion, determined to be 0.03 eV below the conduction band.

Since the reference signal was much narrower than the laser beat signal, mixing of the two signals produced a convoluted signal which was nearly identical in shape to the original microwave beat signal produced by the DFL, but shifted to the MHz range, so that a time trace of this down converted signal could be measured with an oscilloscope (Agilent infinium 54854 A). A Discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) over duration of a short time frame (μs) was then performed on that time trace of the down-converted signal [13], This will give the frequency spectrum of the time domain signal, with various center frequency due to short time drift. By plotting these center frequencies as a function of time a graph called spectrogram can be produced.|$|E

40|$|An online, {{adaptive}} method of time delay and magnitude estimation for sinusoidal signals is presented. The method {{is based on}} an adaptive gradient descent algorithm that directly determines the time delay and magnitudes of two noisy sinusoidal signals. The new estimator uses a novel quadrature <b>carrier</b> <b>generator</b> to produce the carriers for an adaptive quadrature phase detector, which in turn uses an arc tan function to compute the time delay. The proposed method is quite robust and can adapt to significant variation in input signal characteristics like magnitude and frequency imposing no requirement on the magnitudes of the two signals. It even works effectively when the signals have time-varying magnitudes. The convergence analysis of the proposed technique shows that estimate converges exponentially fast to their nominal values. In addition, if the technique is implemented in the continuous time domain, the delay estimation accuracy will not be constrained by the sampling frequency as observed in some of the classical techniques. Extensive simulations show that the proposed method provides very accurate estimates of the time delay comparable to that of the popular methods like Sinc-based estimator, Lagrange estimator, and the Quadrature estimator, as well the magnitude estimate of the input signals at lower signal to noise ratio at appreciably reduced computational cost.

40|$|Circuit {{and system}} {{techniques}} for reducing phase noise in frequency synthesizers, and cancelling phase noise effect in quadrature receivers are presented. Phase noise performance of digital phase-locked loops (PLLs) {{is limited by}} the time resolution of time-to-digital converters (TDC). In contrast to TDCs in the past that concentrate on the arrival time difference between the divider feedback edge and the reference signal edge. Our approach extracts the timing information that is embedded in voltage domain. This approach not only achieves a higher time resolution, lower phase noise, but also consumes less power. A digital background calibration circuit is also presented to reduce the output spurious tones when the digital PLL operates under fractional-N divisions. Ring Oscillators (ROs) have the advantage of small area, wide tuning range, and multiphase output. However, their higher phase noise and higher sensitivity to supply noise may seriously deteriorate the wanted signal in wireless receivers. To circumvent this non-ideality, a low overhead phase noise cancellation technique for ring oscillator-based quadrature receivers is presented. The proposed technique operates in background and extracts ring oscillator phase noise as well as supply-induced phase noise from the digital PLL. The obtained phase noise information is then used to restore the randomly rotated baseband signal in digital domain. In recent years, the unsilenced band at 57 ~ 64 GHz frequency range has motivated the building of high-data rate radio systems targeting wireless personal area network (WPAN) applications. To address this demand, a low-noise wide-band integer-N PLL is presented which serves as the <b>carrier</b> <b>generator</b> of a 60 GHz heterogeneous transceiver.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{demand for}} global mobility and multi-media services hasmotivated the realizations of multi-mode, multi-band and multi-standard wireless communication systems. Software-defined radio (SDR), {{in which some}} or all of the physical layer functions are software defined, encompasses a wide range of design techniques to realize fully reconfigurable transceiver systems. It is an attractive radio platform that covers not only all the existing wireless standards (including cellular, WLAN, WPAN, broadcast, positioning, etc,) but also the future standards. Such a radio requires ultra-wideband (UWB) in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) local oscillation (LO) signals with sufficiently high spectrum purity to support diverse specifications. In this thesis, several novel circuit topologies and design techniques are proposed and integrated to realize for the very first time an ultra-wideband frequency generation system (FGS) for SDRs in low-cost CMOS processes. Firstly, complete analysis is derived and presented for both dual-band one-port and two-port oscillators using transformer-based fourth-order LC tanks. Based on the results, a dual-band quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (Q-VCO) is systematically designed and implemented in a 0. 13 -μm CMOS process for SDR applications. The prototype achieves a dual-band operation with IQ output signals from 2. 7 GHz to 4. 3 GHz and from 8. 4 GHz to 12. 4 GHz. Secondly, novel current-bleeding (CB) and current-reusing (CR) techniques are proposed, to efficiently enlarge and maximize the locking ranges of injection-locked frequency dividers (ILFDs) and Miller dividers (MD) without extra inductive components and extra power consumption. Implemented in a 0. 13 μm CMOS, two CR-ILFD prototypes, operating with 7 GHz and 60 GHz inputs, achieve around 3 x and 2 x locking range improvement, respectively. In addition, a 60 GHz CB-MD prototype improves the locking range by more than 5 x. Thirdly, new circuit topologies, including a reconfigurable injection locking based frequency multiplier and a tunable 3 GHz-to- 10 GHz transformer-based narrow-band LC-tank for single sideband (SSB) mixers, are proposed to implement the 14 -band MB-OFDM UWB <b>carrier</b> <b>generator</b> into the FGS. Experimentally, the generator achieves sideband rejections (SBRs) better than 31 dB for all the 14 -band carriers from 3 GHz to 10 GHz. Fourthly, a novel interpolative-phase-tuning technique is proposed to implement varactor-less multi-phase LC oscillators with a wide tuning range and a low phase noise at millimeter-wave (MMW) frequencies. Two phase-tuning oscillator prototypes, one with 8 -phase 50 GHz outputs and another with 4 -phase 60 GHz outputs, achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of phase noise, figure-of-merit (FOM), and figure-of-merit with tuning range (FOMT). Fifthly, an alternative method of using high frequency multipliers to synthesize the MMW LO frequencies is also investigated. Two injection-locked frequency multiplier (ILFM) chains are designed and demonstrated to provide LO signals for both direct-conversion and dual-conversion transceivers operating at 60 GHz band. A proposed automatic peak calibration technique is also implemented for the ILFM chain to effectively improve the output swing and the spur rejection performance with a small area and low power. Finally, employing these circuit techniques and topologies, a wideband SDR frequency generation system with a reconfigurable phase-locked loop, is proposed and demonstrated. The prototype successfully provides IQ LO signals with sufficiently good phase noise not only from 47 MHz to 10 GHz but also from 18 GHz to 22. 5 GHz and from 37 GHz to 44 GHz for all the wireless standards (including GSM 900 /DCS/PCS, UMTS, WLAN, WiMAX, Bluetooth, DECT, ZigBee, DVB-T/H, GPS, UHF-RFID, MB-OFDM UWB and UWB 802. 15. 3 c) ...|$|E
