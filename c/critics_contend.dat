5|$|Like {{several other}} luxury neighbourhoods in the city, apartments in the David's Village {{development}} are mostly owned by foreigners who visit {{for only a}} few days or weeks a year. <b>Critics</b> <b>contend</b> that this makes it a ghost town in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes to}} {{characters}} such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Arwen, Denethor, Faramir, Gimli, and Frodo, when considered together, were {{seen by some}} to alter the tone and themes found in the books. Several <b>critics</b> <b>contend</b> that the portrayal of women, especially Arwen, in the films is thematically faithful to (or compatible with) Tolkien's writings despite some differences.|$|E
5|$|The conservationists, governments, and {{non-governmental}} organizations that endorse the strategy {{argue that it}} fosters {{public support for the}} protection of elephants and that it sends a message to poachers their work is futile. <b>Critics</b> <b>contend</b> that the technique may increase poaching by creating a perception of scarcity that increases ivory's value on the black market, and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient to justify the opportunity cost for countries struggling with poverty.|$|E

2500|$|The speedy {{transfer}} of power maintained the goodwill of the new nations but <b>critics</b> <b>contended</b> it was premature. In justification Macmillan quoted Lord Macaulay in 1851: ...|$|R
50|$|Polish <b>critics</b> <b>contended</b> {{the book}} did not {{sufficiently}} {{concentrate on the}} question of securing food from local population. The book was also criticized for accusing the Armia Krajowa of allying with German occupiers.|$|R
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. <b>Critics</b> <b>contend</b> that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E
25|$|The Investigative Judgment {{doctrine}} {{is defined in}} the Church's list of fundamental beliefs. In reviewing this uniquely Seventh-day Adventist doctrine, non-Adventist <b>critics</b> <b>contend</b> {{that it is not}} Biblical teaching.|$|E
25|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>contend</b> that {{government}} and industry measures taken to reduce environmental and health risks posed by large-scale mining operations are inadequate, causing unacceptable damage to the natural environment and human welfare.|$|E
5000|$|Sestak {{supported}} the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which <b>critics</b> <b>contended</b> continued the Bush administration's policy of warrantless wiretapping and provided retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies {{who participated in}} the National Security Agency's [...] "terrorist surveillance program." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>contended</b> {{that the}} Hill & Knowlton had concocted a fake popular movement, Citizens for a Free Kuwait, and {{subsequently}} used questionable evidence and suspect witnesses to influence {{public opinion and}} policy in the United States and the UN.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>contended</b> that CHEERS {{would have}} paid {{families}} to expose their children to pesticides. EPA denies this, contending that because CHEERS would have only examined families who used pesticides prior to the study, CHEERS would not have increased the subject families' exposure to pesticides.|$|R
25|$|Flat tax <b>critics</b> <b>contend</b> that a {{flat tax}} system could be created with many loopholes, or a {{progressive}} tax system without loopholes, and that a progressive tax system could be as simple, or simpler, than {{a flat tax}} system. A simple progressive tax would also discourage tax avoidance.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the model, such as August Piper Jr., {{argue that}} {{the logic of the}} claim that {{childhood}} trauma causes insanity demonstrates a serious flaw. If the claim were true, <b>critics</b> <b>contend,</b> the abuse of millions of children over the years should have caused many cases of insanity; but no evidence exists.|$|E
25|$|Because the Constitution lacks a clear {{statement}} {{authorizing the}} Federal courts to nullify {{the acts of}} coequal branches, <b>critics</b> <b>contend</b> that the argument for judicial review must rely on a significant gloss on the Constitution's terms. Despite such criticisms of Marbury v. Madison, judicial review has been accepted in the American legal community.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{generation}} Prius has stirred {{controversy over the}} style and cohesion of its exterior design, with analysis from <b>critics</b> <b>contending</b> that the excessively angular headlamps and unnecessary creases in the bodywork has created a haphazard design, that falls {{into the trap of}} equating aggressiveness with sportiness.|$|R
5|$|In May 2003, The New York Times {{reporter}} Jayson Blair {{was forced}} to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some <b>critics</b> <b>contended</b> that African-American Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in The New York Times initial reluctance to fire him.|$|R
5|$|Bush used {{a budget}} surplus {{to push through}} Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion. He {{extended}} government funding for organizations providing education {{of the dangers of}} alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence. <b>Critics</b> <b>contended</b> that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.|$|R
25|$|Men's {{clothing}} {{is seen as}} formal and stiff, women's as elaborate and over-done. Clothing covered the entire body, we are told, and even the glimpse of an ankle was scandalous. <b>Critics</b> <b>contend</b> that corsets constricted women's bodies and women's lives. Homes are described as gloomy, dark, cluttered with massive and over-ornate furniture and proliferating bric-a-brac. Myth has it that even piano legs were scandalous, and covered with tiny pantalettes.|$|E
25|$|According to this criticism, {{the electoral}} college reduces {{elections}} to a mere count of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it obscures any voting problems within a particular state. For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by voter suppression methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally disfranchising specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement {{has no effect on}} the overall electoral tally. <b>Critics</b> <b>contend</b> that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. <b>Critics</b> <b>contend</b> {{the electoral college}} system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>contend</b> that postracial beliefs {{complicate the}} show by only {{visualizing}} {{people of color}} at work and rarely in their homes or {{from their point of}} view. Several writers have argued that the show distorts history by not showing black admen, noting real-life successful African American advertising executives who got their start in the 1960s such as Clarence Holte, Georg Olden, and Caroline Robinson Jones. Latoya Peterson, writing in Slates Double X, argued that Mad Men was glossing over racial issues.|$|E
500|$|The {{unveiling}} of the ornate fire station set off [...] "a political and civic storm." [...] It {{was called a}} waste of taxpayer funds, as <b>critics</b> <b>contended</b> [...] "three station houses could be built for what this cost." [...] Amid the outcry, city fire commissioners denied knowledge that the fire house {{was to have been}} so luxurious, though newspapers reported that the commissioners had approved the plans.|$|R

50|$|In some countries, eBay {{requires}} sellers {{to offer}} the PayPal payment service, which was formerly owned by eBay's parent company. eBay stated that this mandate {{was due to the}} safety and security of the service. However, <b>critics</b> <b>contended</b> that the requirement was meant to leverage their former co-ownership, as eBay would receive service fees, on top of transaction fees via PayPal for product and shipping payments.|$|R
25|$|Harris' {{government}} reduced Ontario {{welfare rolls}} by 500,000 people; <b>critics</b> <b>contend</b> these cuts {{led to a}} rise in homelessness and poverty. Supporters argued that high welfare rates had created disincentives to find entry-level jobs, and that poverty levels remained relatively unchanged between 1995 and 2005. Employment rates increased significantly during the late 1990s. The government rewrote labour laws to require secret ballot votes before workplaces could unionize. The previous NDP government's law outlawing the hiring of replacement workers during strikes was repealed.|$|E
25|$|UMNO <b>critics</b> <b>contend</b> {{that the}} {{official}} figure {{does not take into}} account the huge volume of shares, amounting to 7.9 percent in 1999, that is held by nominee companies. Independent studies have revealed that politicians and political parties, including UMNO, have resorted to using nominee companies to conceal their ownership of corporate equity from public scrutiny. Also, branded conglomerates like Proton and Petronas are not regarded by the government as Bumiputra companies. This approach tends to exaggerate non-Malay purchasing power. It is also not clear if the government calculations included the 2.7 million unincorporated businesses in the country.|$|E
25|$|Operation Barga (and West Bengal's land {{reforms in}} general) {{have been criticized}} for their small scope and {{inability}} to solve all the major problems. This criticism has been mainly due to policies not accounting for the high landmass-population ratio in Bengal (the highest in the country), the small and highly segregated land holding patterns and failure of the Government to develop agri-industrial markets for farm produce. These failures, <b>critics</b> <b>contend,</b> have distributed poverty rather than creating prosperity. They point out that in spite of these measures, Bengal’s agricultural infrastructure and financial situation is no better than in most other states.|$|E

25|$|Though GM cited cost as a {{deterrent}} to continuing with the EV1, the film interviewed <b>critics</b> <b>contending</b> that the cost of batteries and electric vehicles would have been reduced significantly if mass production began, due to economies of scale. There is also discussion about electric cars threatening dealer profits since they have so few service requirements—no tuneups, no oil changes, and less brake jobs because of regenerative braking.|$|R
5000|$|Cox joined {{nineteen}} {{other state}} attorneys general, {{all but one}} being Republican, in challenging the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act after its passage. <b>Critics</b> <b>contended</b> that this action was a political move because Cox was running for governor. Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, {{a professor of law}} at the Washington and Lee University, has criticized this unusual move as being not only [...] "frivolous" [...] but a waste of tax payers' dollars.|$|R
25|$|Combined, {{the pension}} {{and health care}} reforms the MTA sought would cost about US$30 million over the span of the three-year contract. Critics lambasted both the MTA and TWU for {{allowing}} a strike to occur over such a relatively small sum. However, the pension costs would balloon to US$160 {{million in the first}} 10 years, and US$80 million per year after 20 years. The MTA said that its reluctance to give in to the TWU on this point stems from fear of future deficits (projected to be 1 billion USD by 2009), although <b>critics</b> <b>contend</b> that its assertion of deficits in early 2005 was fabricated to justify fare hikes. The 2012 MTA budget maintained a $68 million deficit.|$|E
25|$|Connerly's {{opposition}} {{to affirmative action}} has generated both opposition and support. Connerly believes affirmative action {{is a form of}} racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. He thinks that selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some of their people have experienced discrimination in the past, but they do not receive the benefits of race-based admissions. <b>Critics</b> <b>contend</b> Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color.|$|E
25|$|The {{only way}} to officially leave Jehovah's Witnesses is to {{disassociate}} or be disfellowshipped, and both entail {{the same set of}} prohibitions and penalties, with no provision for continued normal association. Sociologist Andrew Holden has claimed that fear of family break-up or loss causes people who might otherwise freely leave the group to remain members. Jehovah's Witnesses state that disfellowshipping is a scripturally documented method to protect the congregation from the influence of those who practice serious wrongdoing. <b>Critics</b> <b>contend</b> that the judicial process itself, due to its private and nearly autonomous nature, directly contradicts the precedent found in the Bible and the organization's own teachings and can be used in an arbitrary manner if there is consensus among just a few to abuse their authority.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{interested}} individuals {{could enter}} a [...] "protest" [...] against a pending patent application. <b>Critics</b> <b>contended</b> that protests serve mainly to permit third parties {{to slow down}} the process for competitors. On the other hand, protests are the only way for third parties to challenge a patent prior to approval, when recourse is only available through the court system. The American Inventors Protection Act severely limited protests, but H.R. 2795 would have eliminated those limitations.|$|R
50|$|Several series {{adhere to}} this simple format which, over an {{extended}} period, may cause some viewers to develop a skewed view of reality. At least one <b>critic</b> <b>contends</b> that the recent political problems in Thailand may be at least partially attributable to the negative influence of soap operas, surmising {{that it is the}} disregard of common sense and common human wisdom that causes people to shy away from thinking critically and, as a result, becoming prone to manipulation.|$|R
5000|$|The building's <b>critics</b> <b>contended</b> that Rudolph's roof design, {{which was}} {{intended}} to make runoff water resemble a [...] "waterfall," [...] caused water to pool dangerously in the hallways. School officials also asserted that mold was an ongoing problem. Proponents for restoration of the buildings cited that inappropriate alterations to the original design had created {{some of the problems}} and that proper maintenance had been deferred as well, making the problems seem much greater, but that remedial action was feasible.|$|R
