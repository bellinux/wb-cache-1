5000|$|<b>Cotation</b> Assistée en Continu (CAC) was an {{electronic}} trading system {{used at the}} Paris Bourse, the French stock exchange, in the 1980s and 1990s. It was introduced in 1986 for trading less liquid equities, and in 1989 it was operational for all listed stocks. The acronym {{is also used to}} refer to the CAC 40, a stock index provided by the Paris Bourse. Curiously, the acronym also fits the name of the early Parisian stockbrokers' association, the [...] "Compagnie des Agents de Change". The CAC system was a version of an earlier system developed by the Toronto Stock Exchange in the mid-1970s: CATS (Computer Assisted Trading System). In the early 1990s the Paris Bourse developed an upgraded technology known as NSC (Nouveau Système de <b>Cotation),</b> which served as a technological platform for the Euronext initiative. The Paris Bourse became Euronext Paris in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|The CAC 40 (CAC quarante [...] ) (<b>Cotation</b> Assistée en Continu) is a {{benchmark}} French stock market index. The index represents a capitalization-weighted {{measure of the}} 40 most significant values among the 100 highest market caps on the Euronext Paris (formerly the Paris Bourse). It {{is one of the}} main national indices of the pan-European stock exchange group Euronext alongside Brussels' BEL20, Lisbon's PSI-20 and Amsterdam's AEX.|$|E
50|$|The CAC 40 {{takes its}} name from the Paris Bourse's early {{automation}} system <b>Cotation</b> Assistée en Continu (Continuous Assisted Quotation). Its base value of 1,000 was set on 31 December 1987, equivalent to a market capitalisation of 370,437,433,957.70 French francs. In common with many major world stock markets, its all-time high to date (6922.33 points) was reached {{at the peak of the}} dot-com bubble in September 2000. On 1 December 2003, the index's weighting system switched from being dependent on total market capitalisation to free float market cap only, in line with other leading indices.|$|E

40|$|Chaque matin avant l'ouverture du Nasdaq il y a une session durant laquelle les faiseurs de marché font des <b>cotations</b> sans exécutions d'ordres. Malgré le fait qu'il n'y a pas de {{transactions}} pendant cette période, il s'y produit une activité importante de soumission et de révision des <b>cotations.</b> Nous étudions l'information révélée par les <b>cotations</b> de prix d'achat et de vente. Notre banque de données contient l'identification des participants, ce qui nous {{permet de}} tester plusieurs hypothèses sur la dynamique de la formation du prix d'ouverture. Nous trouvons notamment que certains faiseurs de marché prennent un role de leaders. One fundamental {{issue in the}} study of market microstructures is that of price discovery. While most existing studies focus on the trading period, little is known whether and how much the non-trading period contributes to the price discovery. This paper offers a new perspective on the price discovery process by studying market makers' posting and revising of non-binding prices on Nasdaq during the one-and-half hours pre-opening period. We examine a unique data set containing all the market maker quotes and identifications collected for 50 of the most active Nasdaq stocks. Our empirical investigation shows there is strong evidence that non-binding prices contain information, and there is significant price discovery during the pre-opening period. In the absence of trades, Nasdaq dealers use locked market notes (e. g., the situation where the best bid price among all market makers is greater than the best ask) as an important device to indicate to other market makers which direction the price should move and what the opening price should be. Furthermore, we find evidence that there exists a leadership pattern among market makers, particularly for the most active stocks...|$|R
50|$|Until {{the late}} 1980s, the market {{operated}} as an open outcry exchange, with the agents de change {{meeting on the}} exchange floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the Paris Bourse started to implement an electronic trading system. This was known generically as CATS (Computer Assisted Trading System), but the Paris version was called CAC (<b>Cotation</b> Assistée en Continu). By 1989, quotations were fully automated. The Palais Brongniart hosted the French financial derivatives exchanges MATIF and MONEP, until they were fully automated in 1998. In the late 1990s, the Paris Bourse launched the Euronext initiative, an alliance of several European stock exchanges.|$|E
50|$|CATS (Computer Assisted Trading System) was an {{automated}} exchange system {{developed by the}} Toronto Stock Exchange. It went live on November 18, 1977, with 90 stocks. CATS was introduced, piloted and developed by Harold B. Hofmann, then the Vice President of Operations at the Toronto Stock Exchange. CATS {{was one of the}} first technologies allowing for a full automation of the price-setting process in a stock exchange. This technology was implemented in several other stock exchanges in the 1980s. In some cases, it was used as an assistance to open-outcry, but in others it allowed for a full dismantlement of the open-outcry institution. The Paris Bourse purchased this system in the early 1980s and implemented it as CAC (<b>Cotation</b> Assistée en Continu).|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{a context}} of {{competition}} between exchanges, most European stock exchanges have now chosen order-driven systems for the trading of large capitalisations, yet some organisation specificities have remained, and the comparison of trading costs between order books with different trading rules has become extremely relevant. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research consists in comparing spreads on two different types of auction market: the hybrid SETS (Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service) electronic order book of the London Stock Exchange (LSE), for which UK Blue Chip stocks may be traded with dealers off the order book, and the almost pure centralised NSC (Nouveau Système de <b>Cotation)</b> electronic order book of Euronext, for which a concentration rule applies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the inter-rater reliability of the revised version of the Edmonton Functional Assessment Tool (EFAT- 2). A second objective was to determine whether both formally trained and self-trained therapists had an acceptable level of inter-rater reliability. The EFAT- 2 was administered to consenting palliative care patients by one of two independent physical therapist rater pairs; one pair self-trained (R 1, R 2) and the other formally trained (R 3, R 4). The intraclass correlation [ICC (1, 1) ] for R 1, R 2 was 0. 97 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 94 – 0. 99] and for R 3, R 4 was 0. 95 (95 % CI 0. 90 – 0. 98). The standard error of measurement was 1. 09 and 1. 44, respectively. The Kappa statistic for the rater pairs on individual EFAT items ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 96. The results suggest that both formally trained and self-trained therapists obtain an acceptable level of inter-rater reliability when using the EFAT- 2.

40|$|ObjectivesThe rupture of the {{anterior}} {{part of the}} gluteus medius tendon has remained an ill-defined entity. The objectives are to develop some specific clinical signs, to {{emphasize the importance of}} MRI and to discuss the place of surgery. Patients and methodsSix patients were treated in the physical medicine department (Besançon) from 2009 to 2014 for trochanteric pain, with tears of the gluteus medius tendon confirmed by MRI. They all received suture surgery. ResultsIt was 4 women and 2 men (mean age 71 years). The interrogation at diagnosis: pain lasting for 5. 4 months [3. 5 – 9], no injuries reported, visual analog scale(VAS) 7. 6 [5 – 9], sudden onset (83 %), night pain (100 %), Blazina score ≥  3 (100 %). Clinical examination: normal and symmetric range of motion except a limitation of 10 degrees of lateral rotation on the symptomatic side for 5 / 6 patients (83 %), symptomatic triad (stretching, resisted contraction, palpation) in 100 % of cases, positive Trendelenburg sign for 5 patients (83 %) and 4 / 6 patients with decrease of the gluteus medius strength (<b>cotation</b> 4 / 5). All patients had an MRI: partial rupture (1 case), complete rupture (5 cases) of {{the anterior}} fibers of the gluteus medius. After failure of medical treatment, conducted on average 4. 7 months [3 – 11 months], a surgical treatment was chosen for all patients. Clinical reassessment 6 months after surgery: significant improvement on pain: VAS= 2. 4 (0 to 5. 5) (P< 0. 01), disappearance of night pain in 5 / 6 cases (83 %), disappearance of lameness (4 / 5 cases) except for one patient with persistent loss of gluteus medius muscle strength (<b>cotation</b> 4 / 5). ConclusionTears of the gluteus medius tendons are likely to be a more common cause of pain in the greater trochanteric region than previously thought, especially if there are sudden onset, night pain, loss of muscle strength or Trendelenburg sign. The most useful examination technique for diagnosis is MRI. The surgical suture is recently proposed. That produce good to excellent functional results and reduce pain in this series...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn industry, {{functional}} tolerancing of mechanisms {{is today}} {{more and more}} based on ISO GPS (Geometrical Product Specification) and ASME standards. In this context, the CLIC method (french acronym for " <b>Cotation</b> en Localisation avec Influence des Contacts ") has been developed in our laboratory since 1998. The current standards are incomplete to specify complex shapes, for example to define a datum reference frame on these surfaces. Using specific examples, the present paper outlines six proposals as possible extension of standards of tolerancing to describe the functional need for these links. Two main propositions are developed, the material conditions on complex surfaces and {{the definition of a}} new association criterion. Tolerance analysis models are presented; they must be consistent with respect to proposed functional specifications. The CLIC method [1] enables to elaborate a functional tolerancing based on notion of virtual boundary and a three dimensional tolerance analysis. Junctions between parts are described according to precedence order with primary, secondary and tertiary links. Geometrical functional requirements of the mechanism are imposed by the functional analysis. Intern requirements can be automatically detected by feature recognition (requirement synthesis) or imposed by the designer. Functional tolerancing relative to a given requirement is generated for each requirement (specification synthesis). Next, an equation is established to determine the effect of these tolerances on each functional characteristic (tolerance analysis). The set of equations allows then optimizing the tolerances and nominal dimensions parts in order to decrease the manufacturing cost (tolerance synthesis) ...|$|E
