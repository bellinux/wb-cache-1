5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Jesus Christ Pose" [...] was {{directed}} by Eric Zimmerman, who would later direct the music video for [...] "Rusty Cage". The video's intro includes words similar to John 3:16; [...] "And God So Loved Soundgarden He Gave Them His Only Song". The video features the band members wandering around a desert interspersed with various images of crosses, cyborgs, a crucified girl, a crucified skeleton and even vegetables crucified in a human form. Thayil said, [...] "A lot was chosen by the director Eric Zimmerman, and we <b>checked</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and decided what we liked and didn't like." [...] Cornell said, [...] "It was a pretty unanimous decision by the band to have a woman being crucified in the video ... As a visual, it's powerful and it's also challenging to people, because women basically have been persecuted since before recorded history, and it would almost make more sense than seeing a man on it." [...] He also added, [...] "There's upside down crosses and right-side up ones. But there's certainly no blatant direction as far as religious conviction in the video." ...|$|E
5000|$|Muscarello, Bertrand, and Hunt all {{strongly}} {{disagreed with}} the Air Force explanation. The two policemen {{sent a letter to}} Project Blue Book in which they stated, [...] "As you can imagine, we {{have been the subject of}} considerable ridicule since the Pentagon released its 'final evaluation' of our sighting of September 3, 1965. In other words, both Patrolman Hunt and myself saw this object at close range, <b>checked</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with each other, confirmed and reconfirmed that it was not any type of conventional aircraft ... and went to considerable trouble to confirm that the weather was clear, there was no wind, no chance of weather inversion, and that what we were seeing was in no way a military or civilian aircraft." [...] Bertrand also noted that their UFO sighting took place nearly an hour after Operation Big Blast was said to have ended, which eliminated the operation as a possible cause of the sighting. When Project Blue Book did not respond to their letter, on December 29, 1965 — nearly four months after the sighting — the two men sent another letter to Blue Book in which they wrote that the object they observed [...] "was absolutely silent with no rush of air from jets or chopper blades whatsoever. And it did not have any wings or tail ... it lit up the entire field, and two nearby houses turned completely red." ...|$|E
5000|$|Within the year’s time on November 9, 1870 {{the little}} group professed their first vows.

With this increase in numbers, Sisters Gabriela and Seraphica were able to be sent to their first “mission” in Potosi, Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Mother Odelia, on a trip from Manitowoc to St. Nazianz, discovered the beautiful property on Silver Lake. At her urging, Fr. Fessler <b>checked</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and decided to buy it as it was perhaps “the most beautiful place in the whole United States for a convent.” Unfortunately, just months before the cornerstone was to be laid in 1873, Fr. Ambrose Oschwald, who had been such a key figure in the early history of the community died. Still, on the celebrations went on as planned for the cornerstone ceremony on July 23, 1873; and within just over a year’s time, on August 2, 1874 the new Motherhouse was ready for dedication.The following year, 1875, brought the first elections for Mother Superior, as Mother Odelia had been appointed by Fr. Joseph Fessler. So it was that the first elected superior of the community was none other than Teresa Gramlich, Sr. Gabriela herself. Equally noteworthy, was that in the fall of that same year the community saw an influx of 27 members from Germany! ...|$|E

According to these conditions it provides a great convenience to prove this problem. No one has proved the CSP till now, it’s proved by myself in each case of set instruction and algorithms. It provides a gateway to solve the problem of CSP in coming future. to accomplish the incrementing atomically, using only ordinary assembler instructions. The problem was defined and first solved by Edsgar Dijkstra. "Critical section routine " was his name for the code that solved the problem...|$|E
