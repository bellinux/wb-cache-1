5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} songs {{recorded}} for the album were [...] "Any Way The Wind Blows" [...] and [...] "Who Are the Brain Police?" [...] When Tom Wilson heard the latter, {{he realized that}} The Mothers were not merely a blues band. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa wrote [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window that he was scrambling toward the phone to call his boss—probably saying: 'Well, uh, not exactly a [...] "white blues band", but... sort of.'" [...] In a 1968 article written for Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson heard these songs, [...] "he was so impressed {{he got on the}} phone and called New York, and as a result I got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity." [...] Freak Out! is an early example of the concept album, a sardonic farce about rock music and America. [...] "All the songs on it were about something", Zappa wrote in The Real Frank Zappa Book. [...] "It wasn't as if we had a hit single and we needed to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function within an overall satirical concept." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Sherritt {{home was}} a typical period two-room slab hut, which Dan <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bedroom and kitchen to Joe in the back. When Weekes had first knocked, Constable William Duross had been talking with Sherritt and {{his wife in the}} kitchen. He joined the three other policemen, Henry Armstrong, Thomas P. Dowling, and Robert Alexander, in the bedroom. Even though they were big men, well-armed and {{experienced}} [...] "protectors", they remained there in the dark in fear while Sherritt was shot. Byrne then told Ellen Barry to open {{the front door of the}} hut. When she did, Dan Kelly was revealed a few feet away. Joe ordered the frightened women to leave the house, then the outlaws began shooting into the walls of the bedroom. The police threw themselves to the floor.|$|E
60|$|This {{was soon}} done, and Walter seizing the bar, hauled himself {{up so that}} he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> loophole.|$|E
60|$|The {{front door}} was open, and they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hall and the open back door into the garden beyond.|$|E
6000|$|... "I dare say. As if one <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entire design. My Lady {{would call}} her {{sister-in-law}} to prevent her being daughter-in-law!" ...|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the two men}} <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> trees. Quintal {{was sitting}} on a felled tree, looking {{fiercely}} at McCoy, who stood beside him.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile the Spaniards {{had found}} a blacksmith, who was getting to work upon the gate, for they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him <b>through</b> <b>the</b> open upper bars.|$|R
60|$|That {{under our}} feet now, if we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> muddy water, dozens of salmon and sea-trout are running {{up from the}} sea.|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crack that Corporal Rufus Smith's {{face had}} turned to a sickly yellow shade, {{and that he was}} wiping the {{perspiration}} from his brow.|$|E
60|$|And I am {{bound to}} say that, for all I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mask of his face, he was {{satisfied}} with what I gave him, {{though it was not}} much.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Timothy {{was taking}} his walk, {{and she had}} not been able to get him to attend. If Mr. Soames would come into the back-room, he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him <b>through</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|R

60|$|The black, {{wrinkled}} face <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{window as}} we approached, {{and so far}} as being able to read an expression of either hope or despair upon his countenance, one {{might as well have}} gazed at a graven image.|$|R
6000|$|Jerry {{looked at}} the man and drew a long breath. He could see through Slocum's words as clearly as he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window. His father's claim was worth a fortune! ...|$|E
60|$|Every {{head was}} lifted, {{and when the}} boat rose again on a wave they could see a line of white foam ahead of them as far on either side as the eye <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mist.|$|E
6000|$|... “‘Ludlow began firing {{through the}} brush, and we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> palm-trees and tangle of bushes the brown and blue figures of our {{soldiers}} {{in a line}} a mile long, stealing from tree to tree, bush to bush, firing as they went.|$|E
60|$|Courtland set {{his teeth}} together. His dull-witted {{companion}} had evidently walked them both into the trap! Nevertheless, his resolve was quickly made.

30|$|From these tables, we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{proposed}} scheme, {{the number}} of conflicting bits needed to be updated was minimized, so the corresponding test data volume and test application time were both reduced in all cases.|$|R
60|$|I didn't wait or reflect one solitary second. I {{drew the}} trigger, and fired full upon him. The bang sounded {{fiercely}} in my ears, {{and for a}} moment I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> smoke of the rifle.|$|R
60|$|When he {{mentioned}} this circumstance, she suddenly {{turned her head}} on the pillow so that her face was hidden from him, and he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> counterpane that the shivering, which he had observed when her illness had seized her in the morning, had returned again.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was wearing}} a short nankin skirt, a muslin blouse; he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> thin stuff the skin of her shoulders, of her arms. The noble {{delicacy}} of her neck caused him a sort of transport. “The path begins where these three palms are. The only palms on the island.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Charles {{glanced at}} it hurriedly. [...] "Quite right," [...] he said, [...] "quite right!" [...] But {{his voice was}} hollow. I could guess he didn't care to {{continue}} the séance.

60|$|He {{would have}} gone in, but {{suddenly}} a new scruple came to him, {{that he was too}} well dressed for the company he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> dimly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> steam sitting at the counter and eating with a sort of nonchalant speed.|$|R
60|$|A {{mile and}} a half it must have been to our journey's end. I could hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving; I could smell nothing but the drizzle, now further flavored with coal smoke and {{something}} like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms. All I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streaming windows were two rows of dim houses.|$|E
60|$|The {{creature}} {{carried a}} wooden bowl which it filled with dried food from {{several of the}} vessels; then it turned and quit the room.

60|$|Bartle Massey's {{was one of}} a few {{scattered}} {{houses on}} the edge of a common, which was divided by the road to Treddleston. Adam reached it in a quarter of an hour after leaving the Hall Farm; and when he had his hand on the door-latch, he <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> curtainless window, that there were eight or nine heads bending over the desks, lighted by thin dips.|$|E
