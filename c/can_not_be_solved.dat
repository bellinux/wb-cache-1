This implies to develop propagation models able to take many phenomena into account at the same time (meteorology, uneven ground, impedances discontinuities [...] .). The parabolic equation (PE) is one of those numerical methods. Its main purpose is to predict long-range sound propagation under rangedependant environment. Despite of its efficiency, this method shows a number of limitations to study complex outdoor situations. This paper aims at presenting ATMOS (Advanced Theoretical Models for Outdoor Sound propagation). This GFPE (Green’s Function Parabolic Equation method) based calculation code is dedicated to complex outdoor situations which <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solve</b> with a classical PE approach.
