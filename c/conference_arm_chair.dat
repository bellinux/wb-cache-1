40|$|This report {{presents}} the additional table {{that serves as}} a table that has a larger surface area for table <b>arm</b> <b>chair.</b> Students often use tables <b>arm</b> <b>chair,</b> but table is usually in the design space with a limited surface. It is often used, especially in the classroom and lecture halls. In addition, the table <b>arm</b> <b>chair</b> is furniture that is used to facilitate reading and writing. This report will also be more focused on the formation of additional table expansion. Additional ways to use this table to clamp attached onto the table <b>arm</b> <b>chair.</b> Materials used to produce a table expansion are to use steel and wood. The purpose of this table expansion is designed to make the table <b>arm</b> <b>chairs</b> have enough space by using the installation. Ways and forms an attractive installation designed to make this easy to use a table expansion. Several aspects should be given full attention to ensure that this project can be carried out in line with the initial planning and be completed within the time supposed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{validate}} an evaluation instrument for tablet <b>arm</b> <b>chairs</b> based on ergonomic requirements, focused on user perceptions and using Item Response Theory (IRT). This exploratory study involved 1, 633 participants (university students and professors) in four steps: a pilot study (n= 26), semantic validation (n= 430), content validation (n= 11) and construct validation (n= 1, 166). Samejima’s graded response model was applied to validate the instrument. The results showed that all the steps (theoretical and practical) of the instrument’s development and validation processes were successful and that the group of remaining items (n= 45) had a high consistency (0. 95). This instrument can be used in the furniture industry by engineers and product designers and in the purchasing process of tablet <b>arm</b> <b>chairs</b> for schools, universities and auditoriums...|$|R

40|$|Extended linear <b>arm</b> <b>chair</b> defects are {{intentionally}} fabricated in suspended monolayer graphene using controlled focused {{electron beam}} irradiation. The atomic structure is accurately determined using aberration-corrected {{transmission electron microscopy}} with monochromation of the electron source to achieve ∼ 80 pm spatial resolution at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. We show that the introduction of atomic vacancies in graphene disrupts the uniformity of C-C bond lengths immediately surrounding linear <b>arm</b> <b>chair</b> defects in graphene. The measured changes in C-C bond lengths are related to density functional theory (DFT) calculations of charge density variation and corresponding DFT calculated structural models. We show good correlation between the DFT predicted localized charge depletion and structural models with HRTEM measured bond elongation within the carbon tetragon structure of graphene. Further evidence of bond elongation within graphene defects is obtained from imaging a pair of 5 - 8 - 5 divacancies...|$|R

50|$|The {{peculiar}} {{characteristic of}} his work is that the furniture, objects and interiors are based on used materials and reuse former or hidden functions of the recycled materials. The transformations are made with complex materials (industry), but also with cheap trash (packaging). The metamorphose of the materials should be useful and comfortable, surprising and make smile. His projects bring to the houses the sober beauty of industrial objects but simultaneously take profits from their former function: a spring damps weights (banc, office chair), a car seat has a good ergonomics (<b>arm</b> <b>chair,</b> sofa, reception room), a chain tracks and stays flexible (<b>arm</b> <b>chair,</b> bed, couch) and a supermarket trolley rolls and can be pushed together for storage (seat, child car, coat rack). The main topics related to his work are: research recycling and function reuse (studies and constructions re-using functions in new objects), furniture prototypes (authentic materials for personalised use), interior design, international projects (collaboration with designers and artists in Brazil).|$|R
