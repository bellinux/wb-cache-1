2500|$|All {{variants}} of the R.C.40 had {{much in common}} with construction of the earlier Asso 750 R.C., though they had two, rather than three, banks of 6 cylinders and 4 rather than 2 valves per cylinder. [...] Cylinder barrels were machined from carbon steel with flat-topped heads and valve seats. Each barrel had a separate sheet steel water jacket. [...] Cast aluminium head blocks were bolted to each of the two banks of 6 cylinders, providing valve ports, guides, coolant passages and <b>camshaft</b> <b>supports.</b> The pistons were also aluminium castings. The crankshaft was a 6-throw design with 8 plain bearings and a double row ball thrust bearing between the front two. [...] The connecting rods had bronze bush little ends and white metal big ends. [...] The crankcase was cast in two parts, the upper one with the housings for the crankshaft bearings.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{mechanical}} upgrade, work {{began with the}} engine, in accordance to the new standard now known as ZMZ-402. This produced , but needed 92 octane petrol. The other option was the ZMZ 4021, which gave [...] but only needed the more common 76 octane. The main novelty of the ZMZ-4022 was stratified charge ignition. This was immediately ruled out, due to its complication for the mass-produced car. Other changes, however, were retained. These included fingerless crankshaft bearing caps, new cast iron <b>camshaft</b> <b>supports</b> with no bushings, inlet and outlet valves of increased diameter with double-wound-springs, a new water pump, vibration dampener on the crankshaft pulley, contactless ignition system with a new alternator, new spark plugs, and an upgraded K-126GM carburettor. Some cars would feature the K-151 carburettor with a paper air filter (as opposed to the traditional oil bath filters), and an idle fuel cutoff solenoid with exhaust gas recirculation. These would often carry the aluminium cylinder block from the ZMZ-4022. Power was now [...] 0 to 100 km/h took 19 seconds, top speed was 147 km/h, and fuel economy [...] The GAZ-3102's braking system was also improved, with atandem brake cylinder that featuring a dual-chambered vacuum servo and pressure regulator on the rear brakes; the 3102's front disk brakes were left out. The 3.9:1 rear axle, clutch and 205/70R14 radial tyres with [...] "aerodynamic" [...] hub cups were also carried across. The dashboard and steering wheel were also from the 3102 parts bin.|$|E
50|$|The {{crankcase}} {{is made of}} {{grey cast}} iron, both the crankshaft and the <b>camshaft</b> are <b>supported</b> in five bearings. The center bearing of the crankshaft is an axial bearing. The camshaft is driven by a connecting gear, which also drives the injection pump. The housing of the crankshaft bearing contains the housing of the oil pump. Some versions of the engine are equipped with a speedometer gear assembly, which {{is connected to the}} injection pump drive.|$|R
50|$|In , the inline six engines {{underwent}} a major redesign for the EA Falcon and now featured a new {{single overhead cam}} (SOHC) crossflow aluminum head. The camshaft and auxiliary shaft are driven by a 'duplex' chain. The duplex chain drives the distributor and the oil pump shafts. The <b>camshaft</b> is <b>supported</b> on the cylinder head by using 'topless' bearings. Bearing liners are not used. The camshaft is held in position using valve spring pressure. Hydraulic lash adjusters mounted on the rocker arms are used to provide zero valve lash. As with all previous and current models, the block is cast iron, but with {{a reduction in the}} cylinder bore to try to reduce emissions.|$|R
50|$|The Pontiac's single <b>camshaft</b> was <b>supported</b> by {{journals}} {{within the}} aluminum valve cover; no separate bearing shells were used. The cam {{was driven by}} a noise-reducing fiberglass-reinforced cogged rubber belt {{instead of the usual}} metal chain or gears. Valves were opened with finger followers (centered under the cam) that pivoted at one end on stationary hydraulic adjusters. The oil pump, distributor, and fuel pump were driven by an external jackshaft powered by a rubber timing belt nestled within an aluminum housing bolted to {{the right side of the}} block. The head had a single port face with both exhaust and intake valves on the left side and valve stems strongly tilted towards the left. This engine was used in the 1966-67 Tempest and Le Mans and 1967 Firebird.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} of the OM 138 {{consists of}} two parts, the lower part with {{the lower part of}} the crankshaft bearing and the upper part with the cylinder block and the camshaft. The lower and upper crankcase parts are connected with pin screws on the horizontal crankshaft center. The lower crankcase part is strengthened with ribs and made of a light metal alloy. The flange of the gearbox is cast onto the lower crankcase part. The upper crankcase part is made of grey cast iron, it reaches from the crankshaft to the cylinder head. On itâ€²s front, the upper crankcase part has a bulge that holds the camshaft, so that the camshaft can be driven by the crankshaft using only two gears. The <b>camshaft</b> is <b>supported</b> in five bearings. For camshaft maintenance, the bulge on the crankcase front has a removable cover. Mountings for the starter motor, the alternator and the injection pump are also cast onto the crankcase. For the lubrication of the crank- and camshaft, the crankcase has an oil pipe drilled into.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} is {{a single}} cast piece, the drop-forged crankshaft with counter weights screwed on is supported in bearings made of steel-lead-bronze. The crank and shaft pins of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends. The lower big crank ends are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small crank ends are made of special-bronze. The <b>camshaft</b> is <b>supported</b> by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A gap filter in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft. An electric motor can be used to start the engine as well as a crank. The AKD 112 Z does not have glow plugs but a decompression system.|$|R
