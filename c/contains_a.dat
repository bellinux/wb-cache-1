In particular, it is shown that <b>a</b> Banach space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of l_ 1 if its dual space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> isometric copy of l_∞, and if <b>a</b> Banach space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of c_ 0, then its dual space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of l_ 1...|$|R
