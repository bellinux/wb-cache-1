5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely at the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 {{was taken from the}} trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of {{people who work for}} him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E
5|$|From his {{experiences}} on board Belgica and Gjøa, Amundsen {{had learned the}} importance on long voyages of stable and compatible companions, and with these experienced personnel {{he felt he had}} the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the Fram party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness. Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final chance to show that he was still a capable worker in the field; feeling that he could not refuse Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen. The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer Alexander Kuchin (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of Bjorn Helland-Hansen, and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck.|$|E

5|$|Zahir's initial {{military}} forces consisted of his Zaydani kinsmen {{and the local}} inhabitants of the areas he ruled. They numbered about 200 men in the early 1720s, but grew to about 1,500 in the early 1730s. During this early period of Zahir's career, he also had the key military backing of the Bani Saqr and other Bedouin tribes. As he consolidated his hold over Galilee, his army rose to over 4,000 men, many of the later recruits being peasants who supported Zahir for protecting them against Bedouin raids. This suppression of the Bedouin in turn caused the tribes to largely withdraw their military backing of Zahir. The <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> private army were the Maghrebi mercenaries. The Maghrebis' commander, Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, also served as Zahir's top military commander from 1735 until al-Dinkizli's defection during the Ottoman siege of Acre in 1775. From the time Zahir reconciled with Sheikh Nasif al-Nassar of Jabal Amil in 1768 until most of {{the remainder of his}} rule, Zahir also had the support of Nasif's roughly 10,000 Metawali cavalrymen. However, the Metawalis did not aid Zahir during the Ottoman offensive of 1775. Zahir's fortified villages and towns were equipped with artillery installments and his army's arsenal consisted of cannons, matchlock rifles, pistols and lances. Most of the firearms were imported from Venice or France, and by the early 1770s, from the Russian imperial navy.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} surrounding his origins, {{it is possible}} that Fergus was of Norse-Gaelic and native Gallovdian ancestry. Traditionally, the Gallovidians appear to have looked towards the Isles instead of Scotland, and the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family's lands seems to have centred in valley of the river Dee and the coastal area around Whithorn, regions of substantial Scandinavian settlement. Whatever the case, the fact that Fergus died as an old man in 1161 suggests that he was born before 1100.|$|E
25|$|Origen {{was a most}} {{prolific}} writeraccording to Epiphanius of Salamis, he wrote about 6,000 booksmaking it a difficult task to define the central <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teachings. The original Greek text of his main theological work De Principiis only survives in fragments, while a 5th-century Latin translation was cleared of controversial teachings by Tyrannius Rufinus, making it hard for modern scholars to rebuild Origen's original thoughts. Thus, {{it is unclear whether}} reincarnation and the pre-existence of souls formed part of Origen's beliefs.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} part of his operatic career (1733–1739), Rameau wrote his great masterpieces destined for the Académie royale de musique: three tragédies en musique and two opéra-ballets that still form the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> repertoire. After the {{interval}} of 1740 to 1744, he became the official court musician, and for the most part, composed pieces intended to entertain, with plenty of dance music emphasising sensuality and an idealised pastoral atmosphere. In his last years, Rameau returned to a renewed version of his early style in Les Paladins and Les Boréades.|$|E

25|$|In March 1891, a French force under Colonel Louis Archinard {{launched}} a direct attack on Kankan. Knowing his fortifications {{could not stop}} French artillery, Touré began a war of manoeuvre. Despite victories against isolated French columns (for example at Dabadugu in September 1891), Ture failed to push the French from the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> kingdom. In June 1892, Col. Archinard's replacement, Humbert, leading a small, well-supplied force of picked men, captured Ture's capital of Bissandugu. In another blow, the British had stopped selling breech loaders to Ture {{in accordance with the}} Brussels Convention of 1890.|$|E
25|$|He {{picks up}} {{narratives}} left hanging from previous albums, magnifies recurring themes and takes signature production techniques to extremes. The album's structure – a seamless {{ebb and flow}} of interlinked songs – is dizzyingly grandiose, underpinned by a complementary sense of theatre and elegance. Most importantly, though, through these devices, Nash reveals {{more and more of the}} contradictions and complexities at the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work: the instability generated by his obsessive examination of traditional R tropes – love, sex, money – from every possible angle; the frictions of his own fractured self-perception.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, {{with the}} craft of clowning {{seemingly}} neglected and {{with many of the}} clowns in their 50s, he established the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College. A circus in Europe was purchased for $2 million just to have its star animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams, for the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> revamped circus. Soon, he split the show into two touring units, Red and Blue, which could tour the country independently. The separate tours could also offer differing slates of acts and themes, enabling circus goers to view both tours where possible.|$|E

25|$|Previously, in 1462, the King {{sent word}} to his equerry {{that he should}} hire 8,000 cavalry to start a holy war against the Ottoman Empire only if the Venetians – {{according}} to their promise – covered the expenses (unfortunately for the Hungarians, this financial aid was postponed from time to time). The first major and mass conscription of mercenaries appeared during the Bohemian Wars (1468–78), whereas the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> royal infantry, a force of 6,000–8,000 armed men, were incorporated into the Black Army (the origins of the moniker could also come from this era).|$|E
25|$|While defeated, however, {{these states}} were not destroyed; if Hammurabi {{had a plan}} for welding them to Babylon he did not {{live long enough to}} see it through.

The task of dealing with these troubles—and others—fell to Samsu-iluna. Though he campaigned tirelessly and seems to have won frequently, the king proved unable to stop the empire's unwinding. Through it all, however, he did manage to keep the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> kingdom intact, and this allowed the city of Babylon to cement its position in history.|$|E
25|$|Koechlin was {{enormously}} prolific, as the worklist below (by no means exhaustive) suggests. He was highly eclectic in inspiration (nature, the mysterious orient, French folksong, Bachian chorale, Hellenistic culture, astronomy, Hollywood movies, etc.) and musical technique, but the expressive <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> language remained distinct from his contemporaries. At {{the start of}} his career he concentrated on songs with orchestral accompaniment, few of which were performed as intended during his lifetime. A recent (2006) recording of a selection (Hänssler Classic CD93.159) shows he was already master of an individual impressionism deriving less from Debussy than from Berlioz and Fauré. Thereafter he concentrated on symphonic poems, chamber and instrumental works.|$|E

25|$|Charles {{analysed}} {{what would}} be necessary for him to withstand a larger force and superior technology (the Muslim horsemen had adopted the armour and accoutrements of heavy cavalry from the Sassanid warrior class, which made the armored mounted knight possible). Not daring to send his few horsemen against the Islamic cavalry, he had his army fight in a formation used by the ancient Greeks to withstand superior numbers and weapons by discipline, courage, {{and a willingness to}} die for their cause: a phalanx. He had trained a <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men year round, using mostly Church funds, and some had been with him since his earliest days after his father's death.

25|$|Upon his {{graduation}} from West Point in 1974, Petraeus was commissioned an infantry officer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Howard S. Becker {{is one of}} the {{foremost}} sociologists of {{the second half of the}} twentieth century. Although he is perhaps best known for research on deviance and his book Outsiders, this constitutes only a very small fraction <b>of</b> <b>his</b> earliest work. This interview looks at some of the conti-nuities and <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work over fty years. Becker highlights how his work maintains the same core concerns, although new interests have been added over time. At the core is a concern with “work ” and “doing things together. ” Becker provides many concrete stories from the past and also raises issues about the nature of doing theory and research, how he writes and produces his studies, and the problems attached to the professionaliza-tion <b>of</b> sociology. <b>His</b> writing on art and culture can be seen as assuming a major position in his later work, but he does not identify with either post-modernism or cultural studies...|$|R
