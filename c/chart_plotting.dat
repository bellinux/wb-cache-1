The construction of the Smith chart is described in detail. The Smith chart serves for the transformation of impedance and reflection coefficient along the transmission line. In conclusion, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the matched transmission line are discussed. The project presents a demonstration program using examples.

Predator fish that were not sampled included swordfish, shark, marlin, tilefish, orange roughy, and other species of tuna (bluefin, bigeye, albacore, and yellowfin). Generally, predator fish were located in the region of low n- 3 fatty acid and high level of MeHg in the <b>chart</b> <b>plotting</b> the levels of MeHg and n- 3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). However, both Zhang et al. [10] and FAO/WHO studies reported that Pacific bluefin tuna got high n- 3 fatty acids and MeHg.

40|$|The web {{application}} service {{is part of}} the condition database system of the CMS experiment. The application server is built upon condition python API in the CMS offline software framework and serves applications and users not involved in the event-processing. The main client of the application server is the condition database web GUI, which currently exposes three main services: the Tag Browser, the Global Tag, the Historic Chart condition date in terms of their version (TAG) and the interval of validity (IOV). The global tag component is used by physicists to inspect the organization of the tags in a given data taking or data production, while production managers use the web service to produce such tag hierarchy. The History <b>chart</b> <b>plotting</b> service creates dynamic summary and distribution charts of the payload data in the database. Fast graphical overview of different information greatly contributes in monitoring and validating the calibration data stored in the condition database...|$|E

HCW (39) {{actively involved in}} growth monitoring completed questionnaires that included plotting of weights at ages 2, 6 and 9 months using the Kenyan road to health chart (RTH). The most commonly used measure for identifying undernutrition was weight for age collected at a single visit. Weights tended to be plotted higher than the true value, with 27 (69 %) respondents plotting more than ± 0. 5 kg from the true value at 9 months. At 2 months 15 % plotted age more than ± 2 weeks from the true value, 23 % at 9 months. Health workers in this local pilot study showed very poor plotting accuracy and low use of serial measurements to identify undernutrition. There {{is a need to}} improve the design of the RTH chart as well as education on chart use...|$|E

40|$|Application Abstract: The {{multifunction}} {{evaluation system}} for coal-bed gas adsorption isothermal and pollution of drilling fluids {{is used for}} detecting the isothermal curves of adsorption and desorption needed in coal-bed gas exploration and development, at the same time, the system is used for studying the influences of external conditions applied on the coal bed such as reservoir temperature, moisture in the coal, the component of adsorbed gas, the drilling fluids and fracturing fluids on the coal beds, and pertaining to the technical area of the test instruments of coal-bed gas for drilling, exploration and development. Structure {{of the system is}} rational with advanced performance and high automation, its pressure and temperature are controlled by high precision sensors, and the microcomputer matched with the instrument has functions of rapid data acquisition, data process and <b>chart</b> <b>plotting.</b> This evaluation system can not only be used for detecting the isothermal curves of adsorption and desorption of single component gases, also can be used for detecting the isothermal curves of multi-component gases and deriving the diffusion coefficient of gas in the coal beds. Also the system can be used for evaluating the restoration value of the coal-bed desorption ability both before and after being polluted by drilling fluids and estimating the influence of drilling fluid and fracturing fluid, by which the shortcomings of unicity of adsorption and desorption test of coal bed gas, low automation level and low accuracy at present are eliminated, and it has the characteristics of clear flow-sheet, easy operation, modules of experiment software and standardization of experiment data...|$|E
