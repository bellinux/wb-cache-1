25|$|Diamond turning – This type is cut and {{polished}} on a <b>CNC</b> <b>lathe.</b> The lens starts {{out as a}} cylindrical disk held in the jaws of the lathe that is equipped with an industrial-grade diamond as the cutting tool. The <b>CNC</b> <b>lathe</b> may turn at nearly 6000 RPM as the cutter removes the desired amount of material {{from the inside of}} the lens. The concave (inner) surface of the lens is then polished with some fine abrasive paste, oil, and a small polyester cotton ball turned at high speeds. To hold the delicate lens in reverse manner, wax is used as an adhesive. The lens' convex (outer) surface is thus cut {{and polished}} by the same process. This method can be used to shape rigid as well as soft lenses. In the case of softs, the lens is cut from a dehydrated polymer that is rigid until water is reintroduced.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{statement}} above, this paper established reliability model of <b>CNC</b> <b>lathes</b> considering failure correlation of subsystems using Copula theory, and then proposed a reliability allocation method {{based on the}} model. The rationality and effectiveness of the allocation method were explained and verified through two examples compared with traditional method based on failure independence assumption.

2500|$|Modern {{computer}} {{numerical control}} (<b>CNC)</b> <b>lathes</b> and (<b>CNC)</b> machining centres can do secondary operations like milling by using driven tools.

40|$|Abstract: On CKA 6136 <b>CNC</b> <b>Lathes</b> with FANUC 0 i System, fitting {{process is}} used and {{standard}} and parametric elliptical equations {{are applied to}} write a process program. The methodology and conceptualization of macro programming in elliptical parts programming are analyzed in this paper. In professional skill competitions about <b>CNC</b> <b>lathes,</b> we can often see that practical parts exams include non-circular arc curves, such as ellipses, hyperbolas, sine curves and parabolas, etc. Without CAD/CAM automatic programming software, manual programming will become the exclusive programming method. While in manual programming, these non-circular arc curves, such as ellipses, hyperbolas, sine curves and parabolas require macro programs. Among them, ellipses are the most typical. According {{to the situation in}} practical work, in present study, FANUC 0 i System was used to write elliptical programs for CKA 6136 <b>CNC</b> <b>Lathes.</b> Figure 1 The elliptical process of <b>CNC</b> <b>lathes</b> is conducted with equal-step linear fitting. The intersection point or tangent point in fitting segments is called a node. Numerous node coordinates must be represented with mathematical equations and tools must be controlled to feed successively from beginning to end and approach an elliptical curve, with variables, arithmetical operations, logics, program loop, short linear interpolation and other functions. 1.
