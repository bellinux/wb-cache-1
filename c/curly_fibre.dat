40|$|The gene {{encoding}} {{the high}} glycine/tyrosine keratin-associated protein 20 - 2 (KAP 20 - 2) gene {{has been described}} in humans, but has not been identified in any livestock species. A search for similar sequences in the caprine genome using the human KAP 20 - 2 gene (KRTAP 20 - 2) revealed a homologous sequence on chromosome 1. Three different banding patterns representing distinct sequences (A–C) in Longdong cashmere goats were identified using polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. These sequences shared high sequence similarity with the human and mouse KRTAP 20 - 2 sequences, suggesting that A–C are caprine variants of the human and mouse genes. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, and {{three of them were}} non-synonymous. KRTAP 20 - 2 was found to be expressed in secondary hair follicles, but not in heart, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, or longissimus dorsi muscle. The presence of A was associated with increased cashmere fibre weight, while the presence of B was associated with a decrease in cashmere fibre weight and <b>curly</b> <b>fibre</b> length. Goats with genotype AA had a higher cashmere fibre weight and a higher <b>curly</b> <b>fibre</b> length than those with genotypes AB or BB. These results indicate that caprine KRTAP 20 - 2 variation may have value as a genetic marker for improving cashmere fibre weight...|$|E

Then see the perfect cameo her profile makes, cut in a duskish shell, where by some happy fortune there pierced a gem-like darkness for the eye and eyebrow; the delicate nostrils defined enough {{to be ready for}} sensitive movements, the finished ear, the firm curves of the chin and neck, entering into the expression of a refinement which was not feebleness.|$|R
40|$|The {{secretion}} of the eggshell by the follicle {{cells in}} the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, was studied using the electron microscope. The 3 layers of the eggshell, the vitelline membrane, the endochorion, and the exochorion, are produced in sequence over {{a short period of}} about 30 — 36 h. The follicle cells contain little rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and small in-conspicuous Golgi bodies during vitellogenesis. As eggshell secretion approaches there is an increase in the amount of RER and number of Golgi bodies. During vitelline membrane and endochorion secretion the RER and Golgi cisternae contain electron-dense product. At each stage of the 3 -phase secretion cycle the follicle cells contain Golgi bodies and secretion vesicles with distinct morphology. The follicle cells increase in breadth and decrease in height between {{the beginning and end of}} eggshell secretion. The endochorion ridges arise at the junction between follicle cells and appear to be moulded by the microvilli formed at this position. In the ovary prior to ovulation, the eggshell consists of a thin (0 - 5 /im) electron-dense vitelline membrane, a 5 —io-/*m-thick endochorion consisting of crystalline tubules in a granular matrix, and an outer fibrillar exochorion layer, 20 - 30 fim thick. Further changes take place in the vitelline membrane and the endochorion after oviposition, and a layer of <b>curly</b> <b>fibres,</b> the extra-chorion, is secreted in the oviduct...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} present thesis was to answer this question: "To what extent is a britch of high halo-hair abundance an indicator of the non-kemp hairiness of the fleece?" It was assumed by Dr Dry in the light of earlier observations, that, on a britch with very many halo-hairs, the large <b>Curly</b> Tip <b>fibres</b> would be very hairy, and this has proved to be so. Especially did we want to learn about the degree of hairiness {{on the part of the}} fleece near to the britch. The gradient over the body from the britch was also much in mind, all the more because the boundary between the area on the britch with very many halo hairs and the neighbouring region with far fewer halo hairs is often abrupt. The aim of the work was that just defined, but the analysis of the samples examined provided information on a number of other matters, several of which may be thought more interesting than the problem proposed at the outset. These various results are reported in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Research {{on breast}} cancer {{has largely been}} {{dominated}} by research on the epithelial component of the tumour. However, recent studies have {{shed light on the}} role the stroma plays in both the development and progression of breast carcinomas. Using multiphoton microscopy(MPM), we investigated some of the structural changes the stroma undergoes in breast cancer. Methods: Whole sections of 8 low grade Luminal A-subtype ductal carcinomas, and 8 high grade HER 2 -subtype ductal carcinomas were examined using second harmonic generation microscopy. Two 3 D-images were made of each of the following zones in each case: intratumoral zone, juxtatumoral zone, and extratumoral zone. Differences in collagenstructure were examined in the three zones in each case, in addition to differences between high grade and low grade tumours. The images were evaluated digitally measuring two types of angles: the intrafibrillar angle as an expression of how straight or <b>curly</b> the individual <b>fibres</b> were, and an interfibrillar angle as an expression of the variance in fibre direction. The collagen patterns were also classified by two independent observers as curly, straight or intermediate, based on a blinded assessment of the images. Results: Collagen fibres were straightest in the intratumoral zone, and most curly in the extratumoral zone. Fibres in the juxtatumoral zone were less curly than those in the extratumoral zone, but curlier than those in the intratumoral zone. Collagen fibres in the juxtatumoral zone ran more parallel to each other than in the other zones. Collagen fibres in the juxtatumoral zone tend to run more parallel in high malignant than low malignant tumours (p= 0. 065). Conclusion: In the process of carcinogenesis, the breast stroma is reorganized with collagen fibres at the tumour-stroma boundary straightening and becoming oriented {{in such a way that}} they radiate out from the tumour. This weakening of the normal barrier that the stroma comprises, may promote invasion. </p...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{straightening}} of <b>curly</b> {{human hair}} <b>fibres</b> {{involves the use}} of strong reducing agents at alkaline pH. Human hair is made of keratin, and the fixation of fibre shape involves the reduction and reformation of new disulphide bonds between keratin molecules. Here, we propose an alternative and green methodology using keratin peptide sequences (10 - 13 residues) derived from the human genome. In a previous study, we analysed 1235 cysteine-containing peptides encoded by all human genes of hair keratin and keratin-associated proteins. These peptide fragments have been designed by nature to interact with keratin. Here we tested eight peptides, which were select based on their affinity for human hair keratin solution as shown by Matrix-Assisted Laser-Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and by molecular dynamics simulation. The peptides were characterized in detail regarding their ability to act as hair straightening modulators and to improve the tensile strength and elasticity of hair. Of the eight tested peptides, PepE, PepG and KP showed the highest ability to interact with a keratin peptide model, and to improve hair mechanical properties and straightening efficiency. The proposed solutions presented here will replace harsh reducing agents at alkaline pH by peptide formulations acting at neutral pH to change hair shape through the re-conformation of disulphide bonds. Here, we provide experimental evidence which explains at a molecular level how keratin decapeptides can interact with large keratin molecules in human hair, opening an innovative green approach to changing the shape of hair fibre.
