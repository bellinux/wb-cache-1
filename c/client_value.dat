40|$|Innovation {{is crucial}} for long tem {{economic}} growth. Traditionally innovations are visible in the production sector, while investments in innovation {{in the service sector}} are below average. In the past decades the innovative activities in service enterprises have increased, however it remains structurally behind production enterprises. As service sectors are a substantial part of most national economies there is an urgency to intensify the research in new service development. The objective of this research is to identify a connection between different innovative approaches either based on value-innovation and <b>client</b> <b>value</b> or new service development. This research is focused on the financial services industry. In this thesis the approach for value-innovation and <b>client</b> <b>value</b> is concentrated around the Blue Ocean methodology of Chan Kim and Mauborgne (2005). The basis of this approach is that the organisation is identifying unnecessary elements from their service offerings to become more focussed on and competitive in those remaining, while addressing customer needs. The client is the starting point for value-innovation, which makes this strategy suitable for innovation in the service sector. A characteristic of services is that these are produces in attendance of the client. In new service development the emphasis is on the tuning of service innovation and the internal organisation of the enterprise. In service innovation the process dimension takes a central place. Johne and Storey (1998) developed a framework with six prerequisites for successful service innovation. To understand the possible connection between different innovation approaches and new service developments, the starting points of the Blue ocean strategy (Chan Kim and Mauborgne, 2005) were matched with the new service development (NSD) framework of Johne and Story (1998). Explorative research was undertaken to investigate the connections between these different innovative approaches. A single case study within a Dutch affiliate of a multinational organisation of integrated consulting and technology services showed that <b>client</b> <b>value</b> was no (explicit) starting point. The results of this research provides an indication that <b>client</b> <b>value</b> {{could be used as a}} starting point in new service development, specifically for financial services. A structured approach as the Blue Ocean can assist in the new service development process. Although caution is necessary when interpreting these research results as they are based on a single case study. From a more high level perspective the possibilities to connect innovation approaches based on <b>client</b> <b>value</b> and new service development are interesting. If the ocean approach will lead to new ways of working to realise <b>client</b> <b>value,</b> even if the individual organisation itself does not fully incorporate the approach, the two levels in innovation hierarchy according to Hamel (2007) are connected. From the boundaries of innovation hierarchy application of innovation approaches around value innovation (the ‘strategy innovation’ level) can create opportunities on a lower level like ‘product/service innovation’ to build a competitive advantage. In the context of the increasing importance of service innovation, this research gives a first practical view of a possible connection between innovation approaches based on value innovation and <b>client</b> <b>value</b> and new service developmen...|$|E

The results generally support the hypotheses that client perceived performance is impacted by a firm’s internal resources (e. g., technical skills, customer orientation, innovation). Further, this relationship is contingent upon the COO effect, while <b>client</b> perceived <b>value</b> is moderated by the client’s buying experience.

40|$|Evidence-based {{practice}} {{requires that}} clinicians interpret the best research {{evidence in the}} context of their clinical experience, while at the same time considering client knowledge and experiences. Although clinicians are becoming increasingly skilled at the evaluation of research evidence, the evidence-based practice process often neglects <b>client</b> <b>values</b> and self-identified health issues. Ignoring these key aspects of client-centered practice may lead to interventions that fail to target the implications of a client’s disease that are important to occupational participation and quality of life (QOL). A focus on client-centeredness is particularly important in progressive neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, where there are no known curative treatments, and interventions must instead focus on symptom management. In this paper, we explore the published literature on the psychosocial aspects of the lived experience among individuals with Parkinson’s disease, arguing that such literature provides insight into the implications of the disease and into potential treatment priorities. As such, this literature provides an additional form of evidence that raises awareness of the lived implications of this disease for clients’ occupations and QOL that, in turn, may lead clinicians to be more cognizant of <b>client</b> <b>values</b> and self-identified issues...|$|R

40|$|Cleaning fish mutualisms {{appear to}} be good {{examples}} of biological markets. Two classes of traders exist: cleaner fish and their fish clients, each of which supplies a commodity required by the other (ectoparasite removal and a meal, respectively). However, clients are not all treated similarly by cleaners. There is evidence that clients with choice options (with potential access {{to more than one}} cleaner) have priority of access over clients without choice options. Market theory predicts that <b>client</b> <b>value</b> (i. e. ectoparasite load) should also influence cleaning service quality. We examined the relative roles of client choice options and <b>client</b> <b>value</b> in determining the duration of cleaning interactions between bluestreak cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, and their clients across three geographically distant sites. We found a lack of covariation between client choice options and gnathiid ectoparasite loads. Geographical differences in gnathiid availability altered the importance of client gnathiid load as a determinant of client inspection duration. As predicted, clients with both choice options and high gnathiid loads were inspected for longer, but this was observed only in an area with a relatively high incidence of parasitism. These correlational results suggest that the importance of client choice for aspects of cleaner fish service quality may be modulated by parasite availability...|$|E
