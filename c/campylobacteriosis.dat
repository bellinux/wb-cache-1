25|$|<b>Campylobacteriosis</b> is an {{infection}} by the Campylobacter bacterium, most commonly C. jejuni. It {{is among the}} most common bacterial infections of humans, often a foodborne illness.

25|$|In the United States, {{forty percent}} of homes {{have at least one}} cat. Some {{contagious}} infections such as <b>campylobacteriosis</b> and salmonellosis cause visible symptoms of the disease in cats. Other infections, such as cat scratch disease and toxoplasmosis, have no visible symptoms and are carried by apparently healthy cats.|$|E
25|$|Complications include toxic megacolon, {{dehydration}} and sepsis. Such complications generally {{occur in}} young children (< 1 year of age) and immunocompromised people. A chronic course of the disease is possible; this disease process is likely to develop without a distinct acute phase. Chronic <b>campylobacteriosis</b> features {{a long period of}} sub-febrile temperature and asthenia; eye damage, arthritis, endocarditis may develop if infection is untreated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Campylobacteriosis</b> {{is caused}} by Campylobacter {{bacteria}} (curved or spiral, motile, non–spore-forming, Gram-negative rods). The disease is usually caused by C. jejuni, a spiral and comma shaped bacterium normally found in cattle, swine, and birds, where it is nonpathogenic, but the illness can also be caused by C. coli (also found in cattle, swine, and birds), C. upsaliensis (found in cats and dogs) and C. lari (present in seabirds in particular).|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with HIV, infections {{may be more}} frequent, may cause prolonged bouts of dirty brown diarrhea, and may be more commonly associated with bacteremia and antibiotic resistance. In participants of unprotected anal intercourse, <b>campylobacteriosis</b> is more localized to the distal end of the colon and may be termed a proctocolitis. The severity and persistence of infection in {{patients with}} AIDS and hypogammaglobulinemia indicates that both cell-mediated and humoral immunity are important in preventing and terminating infection.|$|E
25|$|Campylobacter {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of human {{bacterial}} gastroenteritis. For instance, an estimated 2 million cases of Campylobacter enteritis occur annually in the U.S., accounting for 5–7% of cases of gastroenteritis. Furthermore, in the United Kingdom during 2000, Campylobacter jejuni was involved in 77.3% in all cases of laboratory confirmed foodborne illness. About 15 of every 100,000 people are diagnosed with <b>campylobacteriosis</b> every year, and with many cases going unreported, up to 0.5% of the general population may unknowingly harbor Campylobacter in their gut.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{collected}} or {{stored in}} unsanitary conditions may harbor {{a host of}} disease-causing organisms (pathogens), such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), the bacteria Campylobacter (<b>Campylobacteriosis),</b> Escherichia E. coli O157:H7), Listeria (Listeriosis), Salmonella (Salmonellosis), Yersinia (Yersinia enterocolitica), and Brucella (Brucellosis). Pasteurization consistently removes all of these pathogens, though they can be reintroduced if the product is handled carelessly. Thus dairy farms that pasteurize their milk can have unsanitary facilities without the attendant outbreaks of disease that would occur if a raw milk dairy kept its herds in similar unsanitary conditions.|$|E

2500|$|In August–September 2016, 5,200 people [...] {{fell ill}} with <b>campylobacteriosis</b> [...] after the local water supply in Havelock North tested {{positive}} for the pathogen Campylobacter jejeuni. Two deaths occurred from <b>campylobacteriosis,</b> both in nursing homes. It is suspected that after heavy rain fell on 5–6 August, water contamination from flooding caused the outbreak, although this {{is the subject of a}} government Inquiry. It is the largest outbreak of waterborne disease ever to occur in New Zealand. All schools in Havelock North closed for two weeks, with the Hastings District Council advising an urgent notice to boil water for at least one minute before consumption. This notice was lifted on September the 3rd, with the outbreak officially under control.|$|E
2500|$|Pasteurization is a {{sanitation}} {{process in}} which milk is heated briefly to a temperature high enough to kill pathogens, followed by rapid cooling. While different times and temperatures may be used by different processors, pasteurization is most commonly achieved with heating to 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.7 degrees Celsius) for 15 seconds. Milk is tested following pasteurization to confirm that bacteria have been killed to an acceptable level. Pasteurization kills pathogenic bacteria which occasionally may be present in milk, including those causing tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), listeriosis (Listeria monocytogenes), Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), brucellosis (Brucella), <b>campylobacteriosis</b> (Campylobacter), salmonellosis (Salmonella), and several other foodborne illnesses (e.g., [...] ). Pasteurization may not kill some resistant bacteria, which can eventually cause souring and spoilage of fresh milk. UHT pasteurization (Ultra High Temperature) is a more extreme form of pasteurization heating milk to a temperature high enough to kill spoilage organisms also.|$|E

50|$|<b>Campylobacteriosis</b> is an {{infectious}} disease caused by bacteria {{of the genus}} Campylobacter. In most people who become ill with <b>campylobacteriosis,</b> symptoms develop within two to five days {{of exposure to the}} organism and illness typically lasts seven days following onset. Infection with C. jejuni usually results in enteritis, which is characterised by abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and malaise. Diarrhea itself can vary in severity from loose to bloody stools. The disease is usually self-limiting. However, it does respond to antibiotics. Severe (accompanying fevers, blood in stools) or prolonged cases may require erythromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or norfloxacin. Fluid replacement may be required for serious cases.|$|E

5000|$|Campylobacter {{can cause}} a {{gastrointestinal}} infection called <b>campylobacteriosis.</b> The incubation period is 24-72 hours after infection. This is characterized by inflammatory, sometimes bloody diarrhea or dysentery syndrome, mostly including cramps, fever, and pain. The most common routes of transmission are fecal-oral, ingestion of contaminated food or water, and the eating of raw meat. Foods implicated in <b>campylobacteriosis</b> include raw or under-cooked poultry, raw dairy products, and contaminated produce. Campylobacter is sensitive to the stomach's normal production of hydrochloric acid: as a result, the infectious dose is relatively high, and the bacteria rarely cause illness {{when a person is}} exposed to less than 10,000 organisms. Nevertheless, people taking antacid medication (e. g. people with gastritis or stomach ulcers) are at higher risk of contracting disease from a smaller amount of organisms, since this type of medication inhibits normal gastric acid. The infection is usually self-limiting and, in most cases, symptomatic treatment by liquid and electrolyte replacement is enough in human infections. Symptoms typically last five to seven days. Treatment with antibiotics has little effect and is discouraged except in high-risk patients.|$|E
