However, starting in the 1980s and especially growing since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit stakeholders and customers likewise increasingly considered the environmental and social consequences of the products they bought.

These early ideas later on developed from cleaner and greener improvements to processes and products and new products and services-mixes.|$|E
50|$|Alexander et al. {{conducted}} a study {{and found that the}} use of technology did not in itself result in improvements in the quality of learning but that success depended on the design of the whole learning experience. There are two main models for the virtual campus emerging. The first of these is one in which an educational institution uses communication and information technologies (CITs) to provide all <b>conventional</b> <b>services.</b> In the second model, services are unbundled, with some being sub-contracted to other organizations. Virtual campuses are learner centered, and students can customize their virtual campus to fit their learning styles and preferences thanks to the Internet and telecommunication technologies. Teleconferencing, videoconferencing, computer-based interactive multimedia packages, and various forms of computer mediated communication are technologies that facilitate synchronous delivery of content and real-time interaction between teacher and students as well as opportunities for problem-solving either individually or as a team.|$|E
5000|$|Injection {{drug users}} (IDUs) {{are at risk}} {{of a wide range of}} health {{problems}} arising from non-sterile injecting practices, complications of the drug itself or of the lifestyle associated with drug use and dependence. [...] Furthermore, unrelated health problems, such as diabetes, may be neglected because of drug dependence. However, despite their increased health care needs, IDUs do not have the required access to care or may be reluctant to use <b>conventional</b> <b>services.</b> [...] Consequently, their health may deteriorate to a point at which emergency treatment is required, with considerable costs to both the IDUs and the health system. Accordingly, harm reduction based health care centers, also known as targeted health care outlet or low-threshold health care outlet for IDUs have been established across a range of settings utilising a variety of models. [...] These targeted outlets provide integrated, low-threshold services within a harm-reduction framework targeting IDUs, and sometimes include social and/or other services. Where a particular service is not provided, referral and assistance with access is available. In 2007, for example, 33% of all US needle-syringe programs (NSPs) provided on-site medical care, and 7% provided buprenorphine treatment. [...] Similarly, in many European countries NSP outlets serve as low-threshold primary health care centers targeting primarily IDUs.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{middleware}} for the Service Oriented Architecture, called the Semantic Service Bus. It is an advanced middleware possessing enhanced features, {{as compared to the}} <b>conventional</b> <b>service</b> buses. It is distinguished {{by the fact that it}} uses semantic description of service capabilities, and requirements towards services to enable more elaborate service discovery, selection, routing, composition and data mediation. The contributions of the paper are the conceptual architecture of the Semantic Service Bus and a prototypical implementation supporting different semantic Web service technologies (OWL-S and WSMO) and <b>conventional</b> Web <b>services.</b> Since mission critical application scenarios (for SOA) involve complex orchestrations of services, we have chosen to utilize semantically annotated service orchestrations as the applications to employ this middleware. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWith the {{enactment}} of the Equal Rights and opportunities, Participation and Citizenship of People with Disabilities Act, France has reformed its accessibility policy. Within a period of ten years, collective transportation services just be made accessible. Specialized services are only a substitute to accessible transportation services. When it is technically infeasible to render existing <b>conventional</b> <b>services</b> accessible, transportation authorities must make specialized services available for people with disabilities within three years. Admittedly the new law benefits from a favorable context. Indeed, people with disabilities no longer accept to have a special treatment. Furthermore, many technical solutions have already been developped. Lastly, the accessibility issue is now set on the institutional agenda of several organizations. Nevertheless, future decrees may impact its effectiveness and change its objectives. Furthermore some shortcomings in the new legal framework can already be identified. It is to be feared that the priority order between accessible <b>conventional</b> <b>services</b> and specialized services may be reversed at a local level. Juxtaposed implementations in a same area without coordination and a differentiated implementation throughout the national territory are foreseeable. There are also structural forces such as financial and economic constraints which challenge the legitimacy of the new law. Several tools for local actors should be set on the research agenda to avoid some of these likely outcomes...|$|E
40|$|To provide {{efficient}} {{public transportation}} services {{in areas with}} high demand variability over time, it may be desirable to switch vehicles between different types of services such as <b>conventional</b> <b>services</b> (with fixed routes and schedules) for high demand periods and flexible route services during low demand periods. Thus, this dissertation analyzes and compares conventional, flexible, and variable type bus service alternatives. Optimization formulations and numerical results show how the demand variability over time and other factors affect the relative effectiveness of such services. A model for connecting one terminal and one local region is solved with analytic optimization. Then, models are extended to consider multiple regions as well as multiple periods. Numerical results of problems for multiple regions and multiple periods are also discussed. Secondly, a problem of integration of bus transit services (i. e., conventional and flexible services) with mixed fleets of buses is explored. A hybrid method combining a genetic algorithm and analytic optimization is used. Numerical analyses confirm that the total system cost can be reduced by integrating bus services with mixed fleets and switching service types and vehicles over time among regions {{in order to better}} fit actual demand densities. The solution optimality and the sensitivity of results to several important parameters are also explored. Thirdly, transit ridership may be sensitive to fares, travel times, waiting times, and access times. Thus, elastic demands are considered in the formulations to maximize the system welfare for conventional and flexible services. Numerical examples find that with the input parameters assumed here, <b>conventional</b> <b>services</b> produce greater system welfare (consumer surplus + producer surplus) than flexible services. Numerical analysis finds that conventional and flexible services produce quite acceptable trips with the zero subsidies, compared to various financially constrained (subsidized) cases. For both conventional and flexible services, it is also found that total actual trips increase as subsidies increase. When the cost is fully subsidized, <b>conventional</b> <b>services</b> produce 79. 2 % of potential trips and flexible services produce 81. 9 % of potential trips. Several methods are applied to find solutions for nonlinear mixed integer formulations. Their advantages and disadvantages are also discussed in the conclusions section...|$|E
