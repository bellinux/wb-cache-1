5|$|Nick Hardwick, {{chair of}} the IPCC, said on 9 April {{that there were no}} CCTV <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> the area. On 14 April the Evening Standard wrote that it had found at least six CCTV <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> the area around the assault. After {{photographs}} of the cameras were published, the IPCC reversed its position and said its investigators were looking at footage from <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> Threadneedle Street near the corner of Royal Exchange Passage.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} {{refurbished}} (as of 2015) and work began on 2 January 2007. Additional CCTV cameras and Help Points were installed, {{bringing the total}} to 77 <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> the station and nine Help Points, the latter upgraded with new induction loops to better aid hearing-impaired passengers.

5|$|Between 1960 and 1992, the Navy {{carried out}} a program that {{included}} the study of marine mammals' abilities with sonar, {{with the objective of}} improving the detection of underwater objects. A large number of belugas were used from 1975 on, the first being dolphins. The program also included training them to carry equipment and material to divers working underwater by holding <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> their mouths to locate lost objects, survey ships and submarines, and underwater monitoring. A similar program was used by the Russian Navy during the Cold War, in which belugas were also trained for antimining operations in the Arctic.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, {{the tower}} was scaled by 16-year-old Weehawken, New Jersey {{resident}} Justin Casquejo, {{who entered the}} site {{through a hole in}} a fence. He was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges. He allegedly dressed like a construction worker, sneaked in, and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower’s 88th floor, according to news sources. He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site.|$|E

A month later, biologists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the ODFW returned to southwest Oregon, photographed two wolf pups, and took fecal samples for DNA testing to determine {{the relationship of the}} pups to OR-7. By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that the mate is related to the wolves in the Minam and Snake River packs of northeastern Oregon.|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort to}} develop a lighter, quieter camera with a reflex {{viewfinder}} led {{to the introduction of}} the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a shutter angle of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR during the first few years after its introduction, and it soon {{became one of the most}} popular studio <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.|$|E

5|$|The first aerial {{photographs}} {{were taken in}} 1858 by the balloonist Nadar; in 1860 James Wallace Black took the oldest surviving aerial photographs, also from a balloon. As photographic techniques made further progress, {{at the end of}} the 19thcentury some pioneers placed <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> unmanned flying objects. In the 1880s, Arthur Batut experimented with kite aerial photography. Many others followed him, and high-quality photographs of Boston taken with this method by William Abner Eddy in 1896 became famous. Amedee Denisse equipped a rocket with a camera and a parachute in 1888, and Alfred Nobel also used rocket photography in 1897.|$|E

5|$|MRO science {{operations}} were initially scheduled to last two Earth years, from November 2006 to November 2008. One of the mission's main {{goals is to}} map the Martian landscape with its high-resolution <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> order to choose landing sites for future surface missions. The MRO {{played an important role}} in choosing the landing site of the Phoenix Lander, which explored the Martian Arctic in Green Valley. The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the HiRISE camera and found to be littered with boulders. After analysis with HiRISE and the Mars Odyssey's THEMIS instrument a new site was chosen. Mars Science Laboratory, a highly maneuverable rover, also had its landing site inspected. The MRO provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 4 June 1979. The scenes featuring the film team were shot first with handheld 16mm <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> a cinéma vérité style that mimicked an observational documentary. After shooting {{with the film}} team was completed, Kerman flew down to film his scenes in the rainforest and then to New York to film exterior shots in the city. The interior shots of New York were later filmed in a studio in Rome. Production on the film was delayed numerous times while filming in the Amazon. After the original actor to play Alan Yates dropped out, filming was halted for two weeks as new casting calls began, and the crew awaited the arrival of Yorke from New York City. During principal filming with Kerman, {{the father of the}} actor who played Miguel was murdered, and production was again halted as the actor flew back to Bogotá to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} of the Stumpf was filmed using an actual New Orleans ferry in {{a portion of the}} Mississippi River sectioned off especially for the event; the occurrence took over four hours to prepare. Under the supervision of pyrotechnics expert John Frazier, the ferry was coated entirely with fire retardant and rigged with fifty gasoline bombs including black dirt and diesel, each one set to detonate within a five-second range. People and cars were added in later as elements of computer-generated graphics. Chris Lebenzon was largely responsible for moving clips from each of the sixteen <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> place to create the sensation of an extended explosion sequence. The spectacular explosion actually caused no significant structural damage to the ferry; after a bout of sandblasting and repainting, the ferry was very similar to its previous state. The ferry was returned into service four days after the production of the film's scene concluded. During filming of the underwater car scenes, actual cars were dropped into the water; computer-generated effects were later added, simulating the entities' explosions. Compositing was done on the Autodesk Inferno special effects program.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, devices like a blink {{comparator}} {{were used}} in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and people then using a blink comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the blinking could now be done at an adjustable computer screen, the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|E
