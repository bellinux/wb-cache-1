5|$|In early 31BC, Antony and Cleopatra were {{temporarily}} {{stationed in}} Greece when Octavian gained a preliminary victory: the navy successfully ferried troops across the Adriatic Sea {{under the command}} of Agrippa. Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatra's main force from their supply routes at sea, while Octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and marched south. Trapped on land and sea, deserters of Antony's army fled to Octavian's side daily while Octavian's forces were <b>comfortable</b> <b>enough</b> to make preparations.|$|E
5|$|A {{representative}} {{piece of}} Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply (c. 1450–1400 BC) {{which consisted of}} a cuirass of a complete set made up of several elements of bronze. It was flexible and <b>comfortable</b> <b>enough</b> {{to be used for}} fighting on foot, while the total weight of the armor is around 18kg (about 40lb). Important evidence of Mycenaean armor has also been found in Thebes (c. 1350–1250 BC), which include a pair of shoulder guards, smaller than to those from Dendra, with additional plates protecting the upper arms, attached to the lower edge of the shoulder guards.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} indeed {{the golden age of}} the chair, {{especially}} in France and England (including Colonial America), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even Diderot could not refrain from writing of them in his Encyclopédie. The typical Louis Seize chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, <b>comfortable</b> <b>enough</b> no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.|$|E

5|$|Parma {{was more}} than willing to help. The Electorate, {{strategically}} important to Spain, offered another land route by which to approach the rebellious northern Provinces of the Netherlands. Although the Spanish road from Spain's holdings on the Mediterranean shores led to its territories in what is today Belgium, it was a long, arduous march, complicated by the provisioning of troops and the potentially hostile populations of the territories through which it passed. An alternative route on the Rhine promised better access to the Habsburg Netherlands. Furthermore, the presence of a Calvinist electorate almost on the Dutch border could delay their efforts to bring the rebellious Dutch back to the Spanish rule and the Catholic confession. Philip II and his generals could be convinced to support Ernst's cause for such considerations. Indeed, the process of intervention had started earlier. In 1581, Philip's forces, paid for by papal gold, had taken Aachen, which Protestants had seized; by the mid–1580s, the Duke of Parma's forces, encouraged by the Wittelsbachs and the Catholics in Cologne, had secured garrisons throughout the northern territories of the Electorate. By 1590, these garrisons gave Spain access to the northern provinces and Philip felt <b>comfortable</b> <b>enough</b> with his military access to the provinces, and with their isolation from possible support by German Protestants, to direct more of his attention to France, and less to his problems with the Dutch.|$|E
