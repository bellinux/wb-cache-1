50|$|In January 2001, Verisign mistakenly issued two Class 3 {{code signing}} {{certificates}} {{to an individual}} claiming to be an employee of Microsoft. The mistake was not discovered <b>and</b> the <b>certificates</b> were not revoked until two weeks later during a routine audit. Because Verisign code-signing certificates do not specify a Certificate Revocation List Distribution Point, {{there was no way}} for them to be automatically detected as having been revoked, placing Microsoft's customers at risk. Microsoft had to later release a special security patch in order to revoke the <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> <b>mark</b> them as being fraudulent.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the macrostructure of Chinese, English <b>and</b> Polish school <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> university diplomas (Hughes, Varó 2002) in {{the aspect of}} translation. The language and vocabulary used in Chinese, Polish <b>and</b> English <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> diplomas are researched into. The conclusions are that the historically conditioned differences in legal realities in China, Taiwan, Poland (the impact of the partitions and the Communist regime) and the English-speaking countries affect the structure and contents of such <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> diplomas. Thus, Polish <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> diplomas are more similar to British and American ones. However, <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> diplomas executed in China have different macrostructure (they are in a form of a book).
