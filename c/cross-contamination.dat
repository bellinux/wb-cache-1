5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned substance furosemide. Furosemide is a diuretic often used to help lose weight {{but it is also a}} masking agent which may hide the presence of other drugs. Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a <b>cross-contamination.</b> FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of forensic {{science and the}} ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible {{at the time of the}} original examination. Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that <b>cross-contamination</b> of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Gold {{standard}} method for Mycobacterium tuberculosis identification is microbial culture, but this method can cause <b>cross-contaminations.</b> In {{the present study}} we aimed to investigate possible <b>cross-contaminations</b> in two main tuberculosis laboratories in Northwest of Iran. Methods: One hundred and fifty-six isolates from two central tuberculosis laboratories were investigated by IS 6110 -RFLP and VNTR-ETR methods. Results: 53 isolates were clustered in 18 clusters. 15 isolates were smear negative and single culture positive among which four isolates were suspected to be contaminated and in two isolates (1. 28 %) contaminations were confirmed. Conclusion: With this confirmation clustered isolates reduced from 53 isolates to 49 isolates and recent transmission rate of tuberculosis reduced to 21. 2 %. This study showed genotyping smear negative and single culture positive isolates can prevent unnecessary treatments and for this purpose VNTR-ETR is a suitable method...|$|R

50|$|Negative room {{pressure}} is an isolation technique used {{in hospitals and}} medical centers to prevent <b>cross-contaminations</b> from room to room. It includes a ventilation system that generates negative pressure to allow air to flow into the isolation room but not escape from the room, as air will naturally flow from areas with higher pressure to areas with lower pressure, thereby preventing contaminated air from escaping the room. This technique is used to isolate patients with airborne contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, or chickenpox.|$|R

40|$|In France, {{after the}} ban on meat and bone meal (MBM) in cattle feeding in June 1990, cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) have {{continued}} to be detected in bovines born after that ban (called BAB cases).

30|$|We {{have checked}} {{out all the}} COI, IRBP, and GHR gene {{sequences}} obtained for <b>cross-contaminations</b> with a special emphasis for the possible numt pseudogene occurrence for COI gene sequences (Triant and DeWoody [2007]). No traces of contamination events, no occurrence of additional stop codons, no reading frame shift or reliable transition/transversion or position bias as compared with normal mammalian mtDNA sequences have been detected. These facts, together with the concerted character of mitochondrial COI gene and nuclear IRBP and GHR gene variability, allow us to conclude that our data are very special and resulted in valid genetic vouchers rather than in artificial products of laboratory contamination or methodological artifacts.|$|R

40|$|Endoscopes, {{including}} duodenoscopes, are {{medical devices}} that are frequently associated with outbreaks of nosocomial infections.

40|$|Flexible {{endoscopy}} is {{a widely}} used diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Contaminated endoscopes are the medical devices frequently associated with outbreaks of health care-associated infections. Accurate reprocessing of flexible endoscopes involves cleaning and high-level disinfection followed by rinsing and drying before storage.

The ability of bacteria to form biofilms on the inner channel surfaces can contribute to failure of the decontamination process. Implementation of microbiological surveillance of endoscope reprocessing is appropriate to detect early colonization and biofilm formation in the endoscope and to prevent contamination and infection in patients after endoscopic procedures.

However, the use of mtDNA in quality controls of cell cultures is recent. Mitochondrial sequence differences of closely related animal species are five- to tenfold higher than those of nuclear genes. On the contrary, intraspecies variation in mitochondrial sequences is low in most animal species. Moreover, each cell contains 100 – 10. 000 mitochondrial genomes.
