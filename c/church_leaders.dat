5|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{opposed the}} march outright, {{because he was}} concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation.

Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional <b>church</b> <b>leaders</b> and the UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of 19th- and 20th-century missionaries has both transformed and maintained aboriginal integration.

40|$|The {{place and}} {{importance}} of Scripture as the primary tool {{to be used by}} a <b>church</b> <b>leader</b> is often affirmed at the beginning of ministry, but is often marginalized by the pressures of ministerial activities.

5|$|Symeon {{taught that}} putting oneself under the {{guidance}} of a spiritual father was essential for those who were serious about living the spiritual life. That relationship was a historical tradition especially prominent among the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role of a spiritual father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; the vision of God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination as a priest was not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also taught that such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view that brought him into disagreement with <b>church</b> <b>leaders</b> of his time.|$|E

5|$|As World War II neared its conclusion, Kimball {{and other}} LDS <b>Church</b> <b>leaders</b> {{constantly}} {{responded to the}} needs of the friends and families of LDS war casualties. Kimball's eldest son, Spence, was nearly killed in 1945 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier USS Franklin, when bombs dropped from Japanese airplanes damaged the ship and ignited its tanks of aviation fuel. In an attempt to give comfort to families of those killed in combat, Kimball drafted a well-known letter in which he wrote that sin, not premature death, was the only true tragedy in life. Kimball compared the death of young servicemen to the early death of Jesus Christ and stated that although such death is heartbreaking, from an eternal perspective, God's all-knowing purposes would be seen in their circumstances.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{campaign}} against the Catholic Church, hundreds of monasteries in Germany and Austria were confiscated by the Gestapo and their occupants were expelled. In 1941 the Catholic Bishop of Münster, August von Galen, publicly protested against this persecution and against Action T4, the Nazi non-voluntary euthanasia programme under which the mentally ill, physically deformed, and incurably sick were to be killed. In a series of sermons that received international attention, he criticised the programme as illegal and immoral. His sermons led to a widespread protest movement among <b>church</b> <b>leaders,</b> the strongest protest against a Nazi policy up until that point. Bormann and others called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels concluded that Galen's death would only {{be viewed as a}} martyrdom and lead to further unrest. Hitler decided {{to deal with the issue}} when the war was over.|$|E
5|$|By 1547, {{opposition}} to Calvin and other French refugee ministers {{had grown to}} constitute {{the majority of the}} syndics, the civil magistrates of Geneva. On 27 June an unsigned threatening letter in Genevan dialect was found at the pulpit of St. Pierre Cathedral where Calvin preached. Suspecting a plot against both the church and the state, the council appointed a commission to investigate. Jacques Gruet, a Genevan member of Favre's group, was arrested and incriminating evidence was found when his house was searched. Under torture, he confessed to several crimes including writing the letter left in the pulpit which threatened the <b>church</b> <b>leaders.</b> A civil court condemned Gruet to death and he was beheaded on 26 July. Calvin was not opposed to the civil court's decision.|$|E

5|$|Castillo Armas {{was given}} {{enough money to}} recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA {{established}} training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras and supplied them with weapons {{as well as several}} bombers. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was a fait accompli. Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of <b>church</b> <b>leaders</b> throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.|$|E
5|$|Equipped with ladders, ropes, {{weapons and}} ammunition, the {{soldiers}} managed {{to obtain the}} keys of the Battant through a man named Le Goux, after threatening civil law notary Jean Papay. After crossing the Battant Bridge, the soldiers entered the city and prepared to attack {{with the help of}} two townspeople; one named Recy, and the other an upholsterer named Augustin. The soldiers seized armaments located near the Battant, with the intention of sacking the archdiocese and churches, and killing Catholic priests and <b>church</b> <b>leaders.</b> The invaders then separated into groups: some gathered around the Battant, while about 70 men, on horse and foot, reached the high street; those who were approaching the Battant passed along the Rue des Granges, a major street in Besançon. Both groups were assisted by many townspeople. By this time, the Protestant invaders had destroyed several houses (such as that of Madame de Thoraise of Chavirey), and an attack on the town hall wounded one Catholic.|$|E
5|$|In January 1837, Smith {{and other}} <b>church</b> <b>leaders</b> created a joint stock company, called the Kirtland Safety Society, {{to act as}} a quasi-bank; the company issued bank notes {{capitalized}} in part by real estate. Smith encouraged the Latter Day Saints to buy the notes, and he invested heavily in them himself, but the bank failed within a month. As a result, the Latter Day Saints in Kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility. Smith was held responsible for the failure, and there were widespread defections from the church, including many of Smith's closest advisers. After a warrant was issued for Smith's arrest on a charge of banking fraud, Smith and Rigdon fled Kirtland for Missouri in January 1838.|$|E
