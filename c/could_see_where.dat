2500|$|Major A. B. Rogers {{was hired}} in April 1881 by the railway company to find the pass {{with the promise of}} having the pass named after him and a $5000 bonus. [...] Walter Moberly had {{discovered}} Eagle Pass just to the west, and based on suggestions in Moberly's reports, Rogers started out from what is now Revelstoke, up the Illecillewaet River. [...] Running out of food, Rogers and his party almost reached the summit but turned back feeling reasonably confident that a pass existed. [...] Rogers returned the following year, 1882, from the east and reached a point where he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> he had stopped the previous season, confirming that the pass existed and was good enough for the railway rapidly approaching across the prairies. [...] Rogers was reluctant to cash the $5000 cheque, and instead framed it for his wall until CPR General Manager William Cornelius Van Horne offered him a gold watch as an incentive to cash it.|$|E
60|$|Now he was abreast the girl. Just ahead he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> {{the road}} {{disappeared}} {{around a corner}} of the bluff at the dangerous curve the girl had warned him against.|$|E
60|$|I {{had come}} to a halt within a dozen paces of the savages, and <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>where</b> the {{underbrush}} was thinnest, the form of a feather-bedecked brute leaning against a tree evidently on guard.|$|E
5000|$|Assault: 1 point per weapon fired, {{five for}} hitting the outer {{rim of the}} target, 10 for hitting the {{bullseye}} (although a player <b>could</b> never <b>see</b> <b>where</b> on the target they hit) ...|$|R
60|$|He pointed {{into the}} night toward the {{northwest}} and stared as if he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>where</b> he stood that Bay of Bengal where--as he affirmed--he {{would be so much}} more at home.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm quite willing so to do," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Job, whose {{confidence and}} moral courage increased each instant. [...] "Quite willing; and am rather anxious for it, if I <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>where</b> {{to go to}} inquire." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{she went}} into the garden and waved her stick over all the rose bushes and {{blossoms}} and all; they sank down into the black earth, and no one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> they had been.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is an uncommonly {{pretty little}} sprite, and the selfish hag of a sister only left orders that I {{was to take}} care of the bike! I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> there was a stone as well as anybody else." ...|$|E
60|$|The Guardian {{unlocked}} {{a closet}} and took from it a white robe, which the soldier threw over Ojo. It covered him {{from head to}} foot, but had two holes {{just in front of}} his eyes, so he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> to go. In this attire the boy presented a very quaint appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it is you, Bathurst!" [...] {{he heard}} Wilson's voice exclaim. [...] "I {{thought it was}} you, {{but it is so}} dark now we are off that white sand that I <b>could</b> not <b>see.</b> <b>Where</b> are you hit?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now a voice cried, 'We have slain our king. Montezuma is dead,' and {{instantly}} with a dreadful wailing the multitude fled {{this way and}} that, so that presently no living man <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>where</b> there had been thousands.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{now this}} chance was {{presenting}} itself {{in all its}} simplicity, and {{all he had to}} do was to grasp it. The door of the museum was not even closed. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>where</b> he stood that it was ajar.|$|R
60|$|With caution {{both boys}} crawled {{from beneath the}} {{branches}} {{and out of the}} split in the rocks. They <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> the big tree had been uprooted, leaving a hole in the soil fifteen feet in diameter. The top of the tree was all of a hundred feet away from this hole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is {{something}} of a trail," [...] announced Ben, when the others came hurrying in that direction, and he pointed to footprints which led through some soft soil between a number of low bushes. A little further on they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> somebody's shoes or boots had carried some of the mud up on to the rocks beyond.|$|E
60|$|This {{brought her}} to the present, and she turned from the outline of St. Michael's Mount to look about for her husband's form. He was, {{as far as she could}} discover, no longer in the sea. Then he was dressing. By moving a few steps she <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> his clothes lay. But Charles was not beside them.|$|E
5000|$|Former Australian Olympian Darryl Pearce said of Ah Matt, [...] "He had {{an amazing}} {{sense of where}} {{he was on the}} court and he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> players <b>where</b> no-one <b>could</b> {{understand}} how he could actually pass the ball the way he did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>where</b> no sun <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him, <b>where</b> no eye [...] Might {{overlook}} his lonely privacy; [...] There in {{a path of}} his own making, trod [...] Rare as {{a common}} way, yet led no way [...] Beyond the turns he made.' ...|$|R
60|$|All of {{the young}} hunters were willing to leave the Marshes, for the {{increasing}} wind made the situation decidedly unpleasant. When they turned back they had both {{the wind and the}} pelting snow in their faces and <b>could</b> scarcely <b>see</b> <b>where</b> they were going.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was evident}} {{that it would be}} no easier for Doctor Prance to {{subscribe}} to a deception than it had been for her venerable patient; but she {{went so far as to}} reply, [...] "Well, I hope you won't let her suppose you are where you were that time I conversed with you. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> you were then!" ...|$|E
60|$|From the {{far north}} they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp {{whistling}} in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.|$|E
6000|$|... "That brindled gang of conspirators shoved {{back their}} chairs and {{advanced}} in force. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> Mellinger {{had made a}} mistake in massing his enemy so as to make a grand-stand play. I think he made another one, too; but we can pass that, Mellinger's idea of a graft and mine being different, according to estimations and points of view.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{sat down}} on a tuft of bank and laughed. Amomma {{returned}} very cautiously. He was accustomed to strange experiences in his afternoon walks, and, finding the cartridge-box unguarded, made investigations with his nose. Maisie fired, but <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>where</b> the bullet went.|$|R
60|$|They advanced. They passed {{within a}} few feet of her, and observing the {{condition}} of the woman and the man, she saw that these must be led because for a certain reason they <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>where</b> to go,--oh! never mind what she saw.|$|R
60|$|He was right; {{they had}} at last arrived {{at the spot where}} they had {{embarked}} from the Ice King. The place was deserted, and they <b>could</b> easily <b>see</b> <b>where</b> the steamer had pushed through the floating ice, and {{made her way to the}} broad lead beyond.|$|R
60|$|The others agreed {{readily to}} this {{sensible}} suggestion, {{and at once}} the boy began to harness Jim to the buggy. When all was in readiness the three took their seats in the buggy and Jim started cautiously along the way, Zeb driving while the Wizard and Dorothy each held a lighted lantern so the horse <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> that dear {{little black}} chamois horn came from! But Mother Bunch can't {{tell me about}} that I'm afraid, for she always went by sea, and here's the Tyrol without one bit of sea near it. It's just one of the strings to the great knot of {{mountains}} that tie Europe up in the middle. Oh! what is a mountain like?" ...|$|E
60|$|Dave {{held the}} light low {{so that he}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> he was going {{and walked into the}} opening behind him for a couple of rods. Roger {{followed}} very gingerly, for {{he did not want to}} be left behind. The opening proved to be a cave in the mountain side and the roof and flooring were of almost solid rock. Walking was very rough, and they could not tell how far the cave extended or in what direction.|$|E
60|$|They both rose. The old gentleman drew in {{his legs}} to let them pass. Though I watched with fixed eyes I was {{absolutely}} unable to follow their movements, but when they had passed the old gentleman I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>where</b> I sat that his pocketbook was gone.|$|R
60|$|We oldsters {{looking on}} more coolly <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>where</b> {{the speech was}} lacking, so far as Andrew was concerned. It {{is well known that}} when a great man, of whom there will be biographers, is to die a violent death, his last utterances are strangely significant, as if he foresaw his end.|$|R
6000|$|They <b>could</b> <b>see</b> now <b>where</b> {{the mouth}} of the stream opened out. At the sight of it Evans revived. [...] "Hurry up, man," [...] he said, [...] "or by heaven I shall have to drink sea water!" [...] He gnawed his hand and stared at the gleam of silver among the rocks and green tangle.|$|R
60|$|Down, down, down, we went, {{till the}} yellow rim above seemed a thin band of gold. I saw {{that we were}} almost to the canyon proper, and I {{wondered}} what would happen when we reached it. The dark shaded watercourse suddenly shot out into bright light and ended in a deep cove, with perpendicular walls fifty feet high. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> a few rods farther on this cove opened into a huge, airy, colored canyon.|$|E
60|$|That which I {{had in my}} mind! It was as wild {{a scheme}} as ever entered a boy's brain, I am willing to confess, {{and yet it was}} neither more nor less than the {{following}} of poor little Silver Heels until I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> she was quartered, after which, devoting all my time and my energy to her rescue, for it was to me almost as if she was a human being {{in the hands of a}} vengeful enemy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he said placidly. 'I reckon if you'd had {{any kind}} of an {{education}} you could ha' made {{a quarter of a}} million dollars easy in those days. And it's to be made now if you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>where.</b> How? Can you tell me what the capital of the Hudson Bay district's goin' to be? You can't. Nor I. Nor yet where the six next new cities is going to arise, I get off here, but if I have my health I'll be out next summer again--prospectin' North.' ...|$|E
60|$|Soon the {{darkness}} of night settled over the lake. The mist continued to roll over them until they were completely enveloped and <b>could</b> no longer <b>see</b> <b>where</b> they were going.|$|R
60|$|A shadowy figure showed {{against the}} water a short {{distance}} from where they had landed, and then a flickering beam of light fell upon the sea. It was too bright for an ordinary lantern, and Whitney <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it came from, but after a moment or two it was abruptly cut off.|$|R
50|$|Copeland {{has stated}} his hopes for similar {{accountability}} measures were he elected Lieutenant Governor {{in the belief}} that public oversight would demand greater discipline from state government. The most prominent of these measures would have been the posting of government contracts online so that members of the public <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>where</b> exactly the state spends its money.|$|R
