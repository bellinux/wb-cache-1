40|$|A {{combined}} test {{performed at the}} th week of gestation enables us to classify the pregnancy as high risk (risk higher than :) or low risk (risk lower than :) for <b>congenital</b> <b>foetal</b> anomalies, with great accuracy of -. According to the available data, the frequency of false positive results is estimated at around. [e objective {{of the study was}} to examine possible correlation between the serum marker values and amniocentesis results in prenatal diagnostics of <b>congenital</b> <b>foetal</b> anomalies. [e study included pregnant women monitored by the Genetic Counselling Service of the Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of the Clinics Centre Kragujevac. [e subjects were included in the study under condition that CRL (embryonic crown-rump length) was from to mm and that the gestational age was at -+ weeks. Free Î² HCG and PAPP-A were determined from venous blood using commer-cial DPS-USA tests. Tests were based on the analytic principle of the immuno-chemiluminescence technique and were performed by application of the automatic Immulite analyzer by DPC-USA. [e foetal nuchal translucency thickness (NT) and CRL were measured by Colour Doppler. [e chromosome identifi cation was performed after a certain number of cell divisions by stopping the cell division in metaphase of mitosis when the chromosomes were the most distinguishable. [e foetal karyotype was prepared using G bands. In the total sample of pregnant women (n=), there were six cases of pathological foetal karyotype. A statistical paradox in the frequency of <b>congenital</b> <b>foetal</b> anomalies in favour of younger population was noticed. A high coeffi cient of Spearman's rank cor-relation suggests great importance of the {{combined test}} in the detection of <b>congenital</b> <b>foetal</b> anomalies (p<,). A high consistenc...|$|R
40|$|Human {{hydrocephalus}} is {{a disorder}} of abnormality in CSF flow or resorption, {{which has been}} classified in pertinent literature as congenital and acquired. Congenital hydrocephalus can present as an isolated phenomenon which is common; or with associated anomalies affecting other organs, disturbing physiology or presenting as a syndrome. This report describes a case with <b>congenital</b> <b>foetal</b> hydrocephalus, hypoplastic lungs with super-numery lobations and large left lobe of liver compared to right. Thus far, {{a review of the}} literature indicates that this case can be postulated as a subtype of Game-Friedman-Paradice syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to explore the incidence of central nervous system anomalies in present geographical area. Method: Study includes 2000 consecutive pregnancies that have come for check up in second and third trimester with clinically relevant CNS malformations detectable by ultrasonography. Results: Analysis has revealed that there are 74 fetal anomalies in 34 fetuses with CNS anomalies and 18 fetuses with neural tube defects.

40|$|Objective: Report the {{findings}} {{and experience in}} the management of 140 patient with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia treated at the King Fahd Hospital of the University, Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia, and the effect of the treatment with Bromocriptine on the restoration of normal menstrual pattern and fertility. Method: The study was conducted over a period of five years in 140 patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia who were investigated and treated at the Endocrinological, Infertility and Gynaecological Clinics at the King Fahd Hospital of the University, Al-Khobar between January 1988 to December 1992. The initial serum prolactin levels ranged from 28. 5 to 224 ng/ml, with a mean of 62 ng/ml. Among the 140 patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia, 102 patients were complaining of infertility. All the patients in the study were treated with Bromocriptine to normalize serum prolactin or to achieve pregnancy. Result: Out of the 102 infertile patients, 82 (80. 3 %) achieved pregnancy with Bromocriptine therapy alone, and the remaining 20 patients received additional treatment with Clomiphene and Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin for induction of ovulation. A total of 88 (86. 2 %) patients achieved pregnancy, 76 had full term pregnancy and 12 ended with abortion. There {{was no significant difference in}} the pregnancy rate, between the patients with initial low serum prolactin levels and those with high levels. Similarly, the presence of galactorrhea did not influence the pregnancy rate. No lethal <b>congenital</b> <b>foetal</b> abnormalities were observed in the patients. Conclusion: Bromocriptine therapy in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia is safe and effective resulting in high pregnancy rate and resumption of normal menstrual pattern...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 23 -day-old neonate with {{neuroblastoma}} (NBL) in the right adrenal gland and widespread metastases to the liver. This raises the possibility of foetal NBL, which was missed during periodic ultrasonography done during the mother's pregnancy. We hope that this report would increase the awareness of physicians about <b>foetal,</b> <b>congenital</b> and neonatal NBL; and of sonographers about space-occupying lesions in the foetus. The clinicopathologic features and the management of neonatal NBL are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{possible}} {{effects of}} cadmium on {{the reproduction of}} cattle after lifelong exposure were investigated with a historical follow-up. The cattle lived on farms were surveilled by the regional veterinary health services between 1976 and 1986. 10 exposed farms in the Kempen were compared to 40 farms from a reference area. Decreased fertility, <b>congenital</b> malformations, <b>foetal</b> death, complications at birth and a decreased twinning rate were expected. An increased rate of slaughter of the cows was expected as well. 19591 gestations and 3798 cows were compared. Logistic models and Cox proportional hazard models were used. Fewer twins were born, more complications at birth occurred for both calf and cow and more inseminations were needed. No other differences were found. The {{results are consistent with}} those of other investigations. The conclusion is that there are differences in the reproduction of cattle between the Kempen and the reference area. These differences are possibly related to reduced implantation of embryos due to cadmium...|$|R
30|$|MRI can {{identify}} non-acute pericardial and diaphragmatic hernias. MRI without intravenous contrast can characterise the hernia {{in patients who}} cannot receive contrast for CT (renal failure, history of anaphylaxis after previous contrast medium administration, etc.). Multiple acquisitions can be obtained, which can help characterise herniation of the abdominal contents such as the liver or spleen since these can be suboptimally characterised on a single-phase contrast-enhanced CT examination [3]. Steady-state free-precession sequences are used to identify in utero <b>foetal</b> <b>congenital</b> diaphragmatic hernias. T 2 -weighted axial, coronal and sagittal images are helpful in identifying defects in the diaphragm or the chest wall. Contrast-enhanced images after injection of intravenous gadolinium can characterise contents of the hernia sac and also assess for any complications in the herniated solid viscera. Time-resolved dynamic imaging during inspiration, expiration and the Valsalva manoeuvre can be useful to show changes in the hernia with different abdominal or intrathoracic pressures.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decades our {{understanding}} about the clinical impact of diabetes has changed. We now know for certain that a good (read : near normal) glycemic control is necessary to prevent chronic complications of this disease in women regardless {{of the type of}} diabetes. Pregnancy is a specific situation whereby a near normal" control is wanted not only for the patient but also for the fetus. Several studies have shown a correlation beween glycemic control and complications of pregnancy. Reaching optimal glycemic control is mandatory even before the pregnancy starts, considering the time window of occurance of the severe <b>foetal</b> <b>congenital</b> malformations (first weeks of pregnancy). The role of pre-conception care is emphasized. Optimal control in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients can best be reached through intensive insulin therapy, but reaching normoglycemia is mainly limited by the occurence of hypoglycemia. The introduction of the new insulin analogues is an important step in our arsenal to achieve control using multiple daily insulin injections, but Novorapid and Lantus have not yet been approved for use in pregnancy. Insulin pumps are often used in pregnant patients, allowing an even better glycemic control with less hypoglycemia. An absolute requirement for CSII therapy to be successful is patient education and motivation by an experienced team"status: submitte...|$|R
40|$|The {{placenta}} {{is essential}} for normal foetal metabolism and growth. However, maternal diabetes is an unfavourable environment for embryonic and fetoplacental development, which may disrupt normal foetal programming, leading later to metabolic disease. Additionally, an adverse in utero environment may lead to <b>foetal</b> <b>congenital</b> anomalies. Existing diabetes before pregnancy (pregestational type 1 and or type 2 diabetes mellitus) may have negative effects on the embryonic development, while gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) that occurs during late stages of pregnancy may affect the growth and maturation of the foetus. Many of the damaging effects of diabetes in pregnancy {{have been attributed to}} oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are by-products of a number of important biological pathways of pregnancy, including embryo development, implantation, angiogenesis, placental development and function. In healthy pregnancies, these reactive oxygen and nitrogen species can be controlled to ensure no damage ensues. However, in pregnancies complicated by diabetes, their excessive production and/or a reduction in antioxidant defence mechanisms results in a number of damaging outcomes. Animal models of diabetes in pregnancy have provided supportive evidence of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation and their damaging effects, which are dependent on the developmental stage. In this chapter, we will review the available data on oxidative stress in human diabetic pregnancies as well as in animal models of diabetes in pregnancy during early gestation, fetoplacental development and the perinatal period, as well as on its postnatal consequences. Human and animal data supportive of antioxidant treatments will be also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Primary {{maternal}} {{infection with}} cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus B 19 (B 19 V), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) {{may result in}} adverse pregnancy outcomes like <b>congenital</b> infection or <b>foetal</b> loss. Women working in child day care have an increased exposure to CMV, B 19 V, and VZV. By comparing the seroprevalence of IgG-class antibodies against CMV, VZV and B 19 V in female day care workers (DCW) with the seroprevalence in women not working in day care this study aimed to assess the association between occupation and infection. Methods A cross-sectional design was used. Out of {{a random sample of}} 266 [*]day care centres, demographic data, data on work history, and blood samples were collected from 285 women from 38 centres. In addition, blood samples and basic demographics from women who participated in a cross-sectional survey of the Amsterdam population (2004) were used. All blood samples were tested for IgG-class antibodies against CMV, B 19 V, and VZV. Results Twenty-seven percent of the DCW were still susceptible to B 19 V or CMV. Working in day care was independently associated with B 19 V infection in all DCW (prevalence ratio [PR] 1. 2; 95 [*]% CI 1. 1 â 1. 3), and with CMV infection in DCW of European origin only (PR 1. 7; 95 [*]% CI 1. 3 â 2. 3). Almost all women born outside Europe tested seropositive for CMV (96 [*]%). All DCW tested seropositive for VZV, compared to only 94 [*]% of the women not working in day care. Conclusion This study confirms the clear association between employment in child day care centres and infection with CMV and B 19 V. Intervention policies, like screening of new employees and awareness campaigns emphasizing hygienic measures among DCW, should be implemented urgently to improve the maternal health of these women and the health of their offspring. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Basic Antenatal Care (BANC) is an {{approach}} that {{is used in the}} public health institutions of South Africa to provide health care services to pregnant women. The approach was introduced as a quality improvement strategy {{based on the belief that}} good quality Antenatal Care (ANC) could reduce maternal and perinatal mortalities and improve maternal health. Aim: The aim of this study was to analyse pregnant womenâs ANC records for evidence suggesting that the BANC principles of good care and guidelines were being applied. Setting: The study was conducted in the 12 primary health care clinics that were providing ANC services using the BANC approach in eThekwini district, KwaZulu-Natal. Methods: A cross-sectional quantitative design was used to conduct the study. Data were collected through retrospective record review of 1200 maternity case records of the pregnant women who had attended for ANC services three or more times and was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. 0. Results: The majority of the processes detailed in the guidelines and principles of good care were evident in the records. However, several were missing or recorded in few reviews. These included the ANC plan, delivery plan, midwivesâ counter signatures on the cards, assessment for <b>foetal</b> <b>congenital</b> abnormalities, and consent for HIV testing. Conclusion: The study identified evidence of incomplete application of the BANC principles of good care and guidelines in pregnant womenâs antenatal care records which indicated that the BANC approach was not being successfully implemented. Recommendations were made with regards to policy development, institutional management and practise, nursing education, and further research to assist in successful implementation of the BANC approach in line with the guidelines and principles of good care.

40|$|Introduction: The Male/Female ratio {{at birth}} has been {{described}} to favour the male conceptus, a situation that persists throughout most of childhood and into the reproductive phase of life. The reasons behind this preferential male-favouring remain elusive. Methodology: The various relevant obstetric and population national registers kept by the Department of Health information and the National Statistics Office of the Maltese Islands were reviewed to elucidate the age-related M/F ratios differences in the population starting with the third trimester of the antenatal period. In addition, third trimester M/F ratios in women with specific metabolic-related disorders were assessed and compared to the on-affected individuals. The role of <b>foetal</b> <b>congenital</b> malformations was also investigated. Results: It {{would appear that the}} M/F ratio starts favouring the male conceptus as early as the third trimester of the antenatal period. It remains favoured right through the reproductive age reaching par after the age of 45 years when it shifts to favour the female. This relationship was significantly altered during the 1930 s {{as a result of the}} emigration patters prevalent during that period. The results further show that the maternal nutritional and biochemical milieu may influence the M/F ratio at the beginning of the third trimester with women suffering from adiposity, diabetes and thyroid disease having higher M/R ratios. In spite of this preference to the male conceptus, malts have a higher mortality throughout life with mortality rates being higher for males from the third trimester up to the age of 75 years. On the other hand, female foetuses with malformations appear to have a higher mortality during intrauterine life than corresponding male foetuses. Conclusion: The M/F ratio appears to favour the male conceptus during antenatal life and is definitely evident by the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy, the selection mechanism possibly being a greater predisposition of female foetal loss in the presence of malformations. These biological observations may present advantages within the breath of human reproductive ecology, ensuring a healthy reproductive female individual who has the option of choosing her mate from a competing male community...|$|R
