40|$|Purpose of review: It is {{recognised}} {{that the}} quality of CPR is an important predictor of outcome from cardiac arrest yet studies consistently demonstrate {{that the quality}} of CPR performed in real life is frequently sub-optimal. Mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices</b> provide an alternative to manual CPR. This review will consider the evidence and current indications for the use of these devices. Recent findings: Physiological and animal data suggest that mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices</b> are more effective than manual CPR. However there is no high quality evidence showing improved outcomes in humans. There are specific circumstances where it may not be possible to perform manual CPR effectively e. g. during ambulance transport to hospital, en-route to and during cardiac catheterisation, prior to organ donation and during diagnostic imaging where using these devices may be advantageous.

Resuscitative teams are more frequently using mechanical chest compression devices, as documented in physiologic and experimental data, suggesting that these devices {{are more effective}} than manual CPR. A 41 -year-old male patient presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction with cardiac arrest.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{purpose of}} the present review is to {{describe}} the techniques currently used to preserve kidneys from donors after cardiac death. RECENT FINDINGS: Automated <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices</b> may be used to improve organ perfusion between cardiac death and preservation measures. Normothermic extracorporeal membrane oxygenation reduces warm ischemic injury and has the ability to improve organ viability in donors after cardiac death. SUMMARY: Kidneys from donors after cardiac death expand the donor pool but are inevitably subjected to a period of warm ischemia. Reduction of warm ischemic injury to the organs improves transplant outcome. To reduce this injury in organs from donors after cardiac death, different preservation techniques are used. Automated <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices</b> improve organ perfusion between cardiac death and the start of organ preservation. In-situ preservation with double-balloon triple-lumen catheter is an easy technique to preserve organs in uncontrolled donors and is used in many centers to cool and flush the organs. In controlled donors, organs can also be flushed after laparotomy and direct cannulation of the aorta. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation reduces warm ischemic injury and the use of normothermic perfusion seems promising. Optimal preservation is essential to improve the viability of kidneys from donors after cardiac death, to fully utilize this large donor pool...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{purpose of}} the present review is to {{describe}} the current kidney preservation techniques for donors after cardiac death and to give insight in new developments that may reduce warm ischemia times and therefore improve graft function after transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: There is still a general reluctance to use donors after cardiac death for kidney donation and transplantation, because of a relatively high incidence of delayed graft function and primary nonfunction compared to conventional donors after brain death. New clinically applicable methods, such as automated <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices</b> and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, may reduce warm ischemia time. SUMMARY: Kidneys from donors after cardiac death sustain an increased incidence of delayed graft function and primary nonfunction. However, transplanted kidneys that do not experience these complications survive as long as conventional kidneys from donors after brain death. Maintaining adequate organ perfusion after cardiac death by using automated <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices</b> and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation reduces warm ischemia time. Optimal organ preservation and careful selection of kidneys from donors after cardiac death may reduce the risk of delayed graft function and primary nonfunction.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} This article {{summarizes}} current {{knowledge of the}} causes and consequences of interruption of <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Recent findings Pauses in <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> occur during analysis of the heart rhythm, delivery of ventilation, interventions such as intubation, and gaining intravenous access, but pauses may also be unprompted. Pauses related to defibrillation are because of preshock pauses for rhythm analysis and charging, and postshock pauses to evaluate {{the outcome of the}} shock.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cardiac arrest (CA) is a {{dramatic}} clinical event due to an absence of mechanical myocardial contraction. Without an emergency intervention it is characterized by high mortality and morbidity. High quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation are the only factors able to reduce neurological damage. The following phases of advanced resuscitation may include different strategies to improve neurological recovery but they are {{less important than the}} early phases. AIM OF THE STUDY: the aim of this PhD was to examine, from an epidemiological point of view, the impact of CA, the organization of out-of-hospital care, the implementation of post CA care and, consequently, the survival rate of post CA patients in Italy and in Veneto region. One of the most important aims was to determine early parameters related with good neurological outcome in post CA patients. In addition to this we investigate the utility and feasibility of mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices.</b> Furthermore, in resuscitated patients, the effect of temperature changes on coronary flow velocity by transthoracic echocardiography was investigated. METHODS: {{the first part of the}} research (epidemiological) was based on the revision of scientific studies published in PubMed. The survey of therapeutic hypothermia in Intensive Care Units and in Emergency Services was based on a questionnaire/telephonic interview. The second part (clinical research) was based on database analysis of CA patients admitted in Intensive Cardiac Care Units in University Hospital of Padua (for early neurological predictors and coronary blood flow velocity) and in the regional Hospital of Treviso (for mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices).</b> RESULTS: epidemiological analysis has shown persistent high mortality rate of CA. Italy, compared with the other European countries, has low rate of CPR before emergency medical service arrival. In Italian ambulances and Intensive Care Units the implementation of post CA care is low compared to the other European countries. Our analyses have shown the possibility to determine neurological outcome only after 24 hours from the index event. NSE values more than 45. 1 µg/L or NSE values less than 45. 1 µg/L in a patient older than 78 years old are index of unfavourable neurological outcome (respectively p< 0. 0001 and p= 0. 009). A good neurological outcome, was associated with NSE value at 24 hours less than 45. 1 µg/L in a patient younger than 78 years old with S- 100 B value at 24 hours < 0. 31 µg/L (p= 0. 025). During therapeutic hypothermia at 32 °C coronary blood flow velocity showed significant reduction, proportional to rate-pressure product reduction (p= 0. 0001) with a potential in reducing ischemia-reperfusion damage. Finally the use of mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices</b> is feasible during cardiac arrest, by allowing the transport of cardiac arrest patients with the possibility to perform emergent coronary angioplasty or ECMO implantation. CONCLUSION: high quality CPR and early defibrillation are able to improve survival in out-of-hospital CA patients. For this reason it is crucial to spread the resuscitation culture from an institutional level. To increase the prognosis of these patients it is also important to integrate high quality CPR with early defibrillation and advance post CA care. Our data demonstrate the possibility to determine neurological outcome after 24 hours only with biochemical values and the beneficial effect of temperature reduction for myocardial ischemic-reperfusion damage...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices</b> {{may help}} to {{maintain}} high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but little evidence exists for their effectiveness. We evaluated {{whether or not the}} introduction of Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assistance System- 2 (LUCAS- 2; Jolife AB, Lund, Sweden) mechanical CPR into front-line emergency response vehicles would improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Objective: Evaluation of the LUCAS- 2 device as a routine ambulance service treatment for OHCA. Design: Pragmatic, cluster randomised trial including adults with non-traumatic OHCA. Ambulance dispatch staff and those collecting the primary outcome were blind to treatment allocation. Blinding of the ambulance staff who delivered the interventions and reported initial response to treatment was not possible. We also conducted a health economic evaluation and a systematic review of all trials of out-of-hospital mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression.</b> Setting: Four UK ambulance services (West Midlands, North East England, Wales and South Central), comprising 91 urban and semiurban ambulance stations. Clusters were ambulance service vehicles, which were randomly assigned (approximately 1 [*]:[*] 2) to the LUCAS- 2 device or manual CPR. Participants: Patients were included if they were in cardiac arrest in the out-of-hospital environment. Exclusions were patients with cardiac arrest as a result of trauma, with known or clinically apparent pregnancy, or aged <[*] 18 years.

30|$|Although a {{significantly}} greater CPP was achieved during resuscitation in the ZDF group vs. the ZLC and SprD groups, the ROSC rate did only differ between the ZDF and ZLC group, being {{the lowest in the}} latter group. In humans, a CPP above 15  mmHg is associated with an increased chance of achieving ROSC [40]. In our study, the mean values in all groups were above this limit, but one animal in the ZLC group achieved a substantially higher CPP, which could mask a trend of the overall lower perfusion pressures in this group. The study by Paradis et al. also indicates a correlation between increased maximum CPP values above 15  mmHg and higher ROSC rates, which could explain the increased ROSC rate in the ZDF rats compared with ZLC rats. The mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>device</b> was adjusted within a narrow range for the compression depth to correspond to one third of the thorax height and do not give an apparent explanation for the differences in CPP. Whether the difference in ROSC rates is related to the presence of hyperglycemia during resuscitation or is caused by cardiovascular changes induced by T 2 DM remains speculative.|$|E
40|$|Cardiac arrest has a dire prognosis, with {{an average}} of only 5 % of {{patients}} being dis-charged alive without neurologic problems after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (1). Despite improvements in medical therapy and other devices modifying ventilatory support (2, 3) cardiopulmonary support based especially on closed chest compres-sion is pivotal to maximize survival chanc-es. However, manual chest compression is energy consuming and operator-intensive. Moreover, it cannot be performed success-fully for a prolonged period of time by any individual healthcare provider nor in logis-tically challenging settings (e. g. helicopters). Manual chest compression appears particu-larly challenging for patients in cardiac ar-rest who also require an emergent invasive procedure, such as primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The LUCAS device (LUCAS 2, Jolife, Lund, Sweden) is a mechanical chest compres-sion-decompression system which enabled automated and continuous closed chest compression, without unduly limiting other invasive procedures such as PCI (4 - 9). It is unclear however whether the LUCAS device can really impact on the patient prog-nosis besides enabling uninterrupted PCI during a prolonged cardiac arrest, as exem-plified by a recent case we have faced.

40|$|According to the European Resuscitation Council guidelines, {{the use of}} {{mechanical}} chest compression devices is a reasonable alternative in situations where manual chest compression is impractical or compromises provider safety. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the performance of a recently developed <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>device</b> (Corpuls CPR) with an established system (LUCAS II) in a pig model. Methods. Pigs (n = 5 /group) in provoked ventricular fibrillation were left untreated for 5 minutes, after which 15 [*]min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed with chest compressions. After 15 [*]min, defibrillation was performed every 2 [*]min if necessary, and up to 3 doses of adrenaline were given. If there was no return of spontaneous circulation after 25 [*]min, the experiment was terminated. Coronary perfusion pressure, carotid blood flow, end-expiratory CO 2, regional oxygen saturation by near infrared spectroscopy, blood gas, and local organ perfusion with fluorescent labelled microspheres were measured at baseline and during resuscitation. Results. Animals treated with Corpuls CPR had significantly higher mean arterial pressures during resuscitation, along with a detectable trend of greater carotid blood flow and organ perfusion. Conclusion. Chest compressions with the Corpuls CPR device generated significantly higher mean arterial pressures than compressions performed with the LUCAS II device...|$|E

We aimed to study whether the introduction of LUCAS- 2 mechanical CPR into front-line emergency response vehicles would improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. MethodsThe pre-hospital randomised assessment of a mechanical <b>compression</b> <b>device</b> in cardiac arrest (PARAMEDIC) trial was a pragmatic, cluster-randomised open-label trial including adults with non-traumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from four UK Ambulance Services (West Midlands, North East England, Wales, South Central). 91 urban and semi-urban ambulance stations were selected for participation. Clusters were ambulance service vehicles, which were randomly assigned (1 : 2) to LUCAS- 2 or manual CPR. Patients received LUCAS- 2 mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> or manual <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> according to the first trial vehicle to arrive on scene. The primary outcome was survival at 30 days following cardiac arrest and was analysed by intention to treat. Ambulance dispatch staff and those collecting the primary outcome were masked to treatment allocation. Masking of the ambulance staff who delivered the interventions and reported initial response to treatment was not possible. The study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN 08233942. FindingsWe enrolled 4471 eligible patients (1652 assigned to the LUCAS- 2 group, 2819 assigned to the control group) between April 15, 2010 and June 10, 2013. 985 (60 %) patients in the LUCAS- 2 group received mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression,</b> and 11 (< 1 %) patients in the control group received LUCAS- 2. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 30 day survival was similar in the LUCAS- 2 group (104 [6 %] of 1652 patients) and in the manual CPR group (193 [7 %] of 2819 patients; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0 · 86, 95 % CI 0 · 64 – 1 · 15). No serious adverse events were noted. Seven clinical adverse events were reported in the LUCAS- 2 group (three patients with chest bruising, two with chest lacerations, and two with blood in mouth). 15 device incidents occurred during operational use. No adverse or serious adverse events were reported in the manual group. InterpretationWe noted no evidence of improvement in 30 day survival with LUCAS- 2 compared with manual compressions. On the basis of ours and other recent randomised trials, widespread adoption of mechanical CPR devices for routine use does not improve survival.

40|$|Purpose Mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>devices,</b> {{such as the}} AutoPulse®, {{have been}} {{developed}} to overcome problems associated with manual CPR (M-CPR). Animal and human studies have shown that AutoPulse CPR improves hemodynamic parameters over M-CPR. However, human studies conducted in the prehospital setting have conflicting results as to the AutoPulse's efficacy in improving survival. The Circulation Improving Resuscitation Care (CIRC) Trial is designed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} integrated AutoPulse-CPR (iA-CPR) (i. e., M-CPR followed by AutoPulse®-CPR) in a randomized controlled trial that addresses methodological issues that may have influenced the results of previous studies. Methods This paper describes the methodology of the CIRC trial. Results Unlike previous trials the CIRC trial studies iA-CPR where emphasis is placed on reducing “hands-off” time. The trial has six unique features: (1) training of all EMS providers in a standardized deployment strategy that reduces hands-off time and continuous monitoring for protocol compliance. (2) A pre-trial simulation study of provider compliance with the trial protocol. (3) Three distinct study phases (in-field training, run-in, and statistical inclusion) to minimize the Hawthorne effect and other biases. (4) Monitoring of the CPR process using either transthoracic impedance or accelerometer data. (5) Randomization at the subject level after the decision to resuscitate is made to reduce selection bias. (6) Use of the Group Sequential Double Triangular Test with sufficient power to determine superiority, inferiority, or equivalence. Conclusion This unique, large, multicenter study comparing the effectiveness of iA-CPR to M-CPR will contribute to the science of the treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as well as to the design of future trials...|$|R
