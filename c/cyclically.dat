5|$|There are 54 <b>cyclically</b> ordered {{combinations}} of such angles that {{add up to}} 360 degrees at a vertex, but {{the rules of the}} tiling allow only seven of these combinations to appear (although one of these arises in two ways).|$|E
5|$|Bush {{took office}} {{during a period}} of {{economic}} recession {{in the wake of the}} bursting of the dot-com bubble. The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. His administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14percent, corporate tax revenues by 50percent, customs and duties by 40percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62percent, Medicare spending by 131percent, social security by 51percent, and income security spending by 130percent. <b>Cyclically</b> adjusted, revenues rose by 35percent and spending by 65percent.|$|E
5|$|The three sonatas are <b>cyclically</b> {{interconnected}} by diverse structural, harmonic and melodic elements tying {{together all}} movements in each sonata, {{as well as}} all three sonatas together; consequently, they are often regarded as a trilogy. They also contain specific allusions and similarities to other Schubert compositions, such as his Winterreise song cycle; these connections point to turbulent emotions expressed in the sonatas, often understood as highly personal and autobiographical. Indeed, some researchers have suggested specific psychological narratives for the sonatas, based on historical evidence concerning the composer's life.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{points out}} that all changes of form are {{phenomena}} of growth. He analyses growth curves for man, noting rapid growth before birth {{and again in the}} teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in Spirogyra, peaks at a specific temperature, and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. Tree growth varies <b>cyclically</b> with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary <b>cyclically</b> with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been {{cyclical}} ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in ocean circulation and continentality induced by plate tectonics. The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or obliquity), and the alignment of summer solstice with the aphelion. Each of these effects occur <b>cyclically.</b> For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05. This is equivalent to a change of the semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor axis to 99.88%, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have known}} about the heart since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards the heart, ancient Greeks are considered {{to have been the}} primary seat of scientific understanding of the heart in the ancient world. Aristotle considered the heart to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating <b>cyclically</b> from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the heart valves.|$|E

25|$|A <b>cyclically</b> ordered {{group is}} a group {{together}} with a cyclic order preserved by the group structure.|$|E
25|$|Every cyclic {{group can}} be given a {{structure}} as a <b>cyclically</b> ordered group, consistent with the ordering of the integers (or the integers modulo {{the order of the}} group).|$|E
25|$|There are 42 ways of {{selecting}} a quadrangle of four <b>cyclically</b> ordered points no {{three of which}} are collinear, and four symmetries that fix any such ordered quadrangle. For each not-oriented quadrangle there are two cyclic orders.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} to construct sets of nontransitive dodecahedra such {{that there are no}} repeated numbers and all numbers are primes. Miwin’s nontransitive prime-numbered dodecahedra win <b>cyclically</b> against each other in a ratio of 35:34.|$|E
25|$|Serial {{interface}}: A {{serial interface}} {{is used to}} connect {{the rest of the}} components, including the driver inputs, display unit, logger, and the automatic drive and brake control (AFB) to the computers. Telegrams are transmitted <b>cyclically</b> both from and to the computers.|$|E
25|$|The cyclic {{behavior}} of repeating decimals in multiplication also {{leads to the}} construction of integers which are <b>cyclically</b> permuted when multiplied by certain numbers. For example, 102564 x 4 = 410256. Note that 102564 is the repetend of 4/39 and 410256 the repetend of 16/39.|$|E
25|$|Fuller {{wrote that}} the natural {{analytic}} geometry of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres {{and the number of}} compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous truss is <b>cyclically</b> tetrahedral.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{replication}} {{can also}} be performed in vitro (artificially, outside a cell). DNA polymerases isolated from cells and artificial DNA primers {{can be used to}} initiate DNA synthesis at known sequences in a template DNA molecule. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a common laboratory technique, <b>cyclically</b> applies such artificial synthesis to amplify a specific target DNA fragment from a pool of DNA.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{assumptions}} of Greendlinger's lemma, let D be a reduced van Kampen diagram over (∗) with a <b>cyclically</b> reduced boundary label such that D contains at least two regions. Then there exist two distinct regions D1 and D2 in D such that for jnbsp&=nbsp&1,2 the region D'j intersects the boundary cycle part&D of D in a simple arc whose length is bigger than (1-3lambda&)|part&D'j|.|$|E
25|$|The Ecofin {{agreed on}} a reform of the SGP. The {{ceilings}} of 3% for budget deficit and 60% for public debt were maintained, but the decision to declare a country in excessive deficit can now rely on certain parameters: the behaviour of the <b>cyclically</b> adjusted budget, the level of debt, {{the duration of the}} slow growth period and the possibility that the deficit is related to productivity-enhancing procedures.|$|E
25|$|Alawites have {{historically}} kept their beliefs secret from outsiders and non-initiated Alawites, so rumours about them have arisen. Arabic accounts of their beliefs {{tend to be}} partisan (either positively or negatively). However, since the early 2000s, Western scholarship on the Alawite religion has made significant advances. At the core of Alawite belief is a divine triad, comprising three aspects of the one God. These aspects or emanations appear <b>cyclically</b> in human form throughout history.|$|E
25|$|To encrypt, a {{table of}} alphabets can be used, termed a tabula recta, Vigenère square, or Vigenère table. It {{consists}} of the alphabet written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted <b>cyclically</b> to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar ciphers. At different points in the encryption process, the cipher uses a different alphabet {{from one of the}} rows. The alphabet used at each point depends on a repeating keyword.|$|E
25|$|The declining use of cash in Sweden {{is going}} to be {{reinforced}} <b>cyclically.</b> As more and more businesses find they can have a functional business without accepting cash, the number of businesses refusing to accept cash will increase. That will re-enforce the need for more and more citizens to get the Swish (payment) app which is already used by half the population. Cash machines, which are controlled by a Swedish bank consortium, are being dismantled by the hundreds, especially in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|To mend the damage, {{fibroblasts}} slowly {{form the}} collagen scar. The fibroblast proliferation is circular and <b>cyclically,</b> the fibroblast proliferation lays down thick, whitish collagen inside the provisional and collagen matrix, {{resulting in the}} abundant production of packed collagen on the fibers giving scars their uneven texture. Over time, the fibroblasts continue to crawl around the matrix, adjusting more fibers and, in the process, the scarring settles and becomes stiff. This fibroblast proliferation also contracts the tissue. In unwounded tissue, these fibers are not overexpressed with thick collagen and do not contract.|$|E
25|$|In Jain cosmology, {{characters}} {{continue to}} be reborn as they evolve in their spiritual qualities, until they reach the Jina state and complete enlightenment. This idea is explained as <b>cyclically</b> reborn triads in its Puranas, called the Baladeva, Vasudeva and evil Prati-vasudeva. Rama, Lakshmana and evil Ravana are the eighth triad, with Rama being the reborn Baladeva, and Lakshmana as the reborn Vasudeva. Rama is described to have lived long before the 22nd Jain Tirthankara called Neminatha. In the Jain tradition, Neminatha {{is believed to have}} been born 84,000 years before the 9th-century BCE Parshvanatha.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{feature of}} the monks {{is that most of}} them are itinerant, moving from one monastery or {{location}} to another, never staying in the same place for long. Many form a floating group of wanderers, where they participate in festivals together, share work and thus form a collective identity. They gather in certain places <b>cyclically,</b> particularly on festivals such as Navratri, Maha Shivaratri and Kumbh Mela. Many walk very long distances over a period of months from one sacred location to another, across India, in their spiritual pursuits.|$|E
25|$|Some LCDs mimic needle tuners with {{a needle}} graphic that moves {{in the same way}} as a genuine needle tuner. Somewhat misleadingly, many LED {{displays}} have a 'strobe mode' that mimics strobe tuners by scrolling the flashing of the LEDs <b>cyclically</b> to simulate the display of a true strobe. However, these are all just display options. The way a regular tuner 'hears' and compares the input note to a desired pitch is exactly the same, with no change in accuracy. For more on how strobe tuners work see the dedicated section.|$|E
25|$|Progressive {{revelation is}} a core {{teaching}} in the Bahá'í Faith that suggests that religious truth is revealed by God progressively and <b>cyclically</b> over time {{through a series of}} divine Messengers, and that the teachings are tailored to suit the needs of the time and place of their appearance. Thus, the Bahá'í teachings recognize the divine origin of several world religions as different stages in the history of one religion, while believing that the revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the most recent (though not the last—that there will never be a last), and therefore the most relevant to modern society.|$|E
25|$|Some {{versions}} of the Purana texts, unlike the Vedic and Upanishadic texts, emphasize Vishnu as supreme and on whom other gods depend. Vishnu, for example, {{is the source of}} creator deity Brahma in the Vaishnavism-focussed Purana texts. Vishnu's iconography typically shows Brahma being born in a lotus emerging from his navel, who then is described as creating all the forms in the universe, but not the primordial universe itself. In contrast, the Shiva-focussed Puranas describe Brahma and Vishnu to have been created by Ardhanarishvara, that is half Shiva and half Parvati; or alternatively, Brahma was born from Rudra, or Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma creating each other <b>cyclically</b> in different aeons (kalpa).|$|E
25|$|Breeding {{takes place}} <b>cyclically</b> {{in spring and}} summer. Male G. marginata are capable of {{producing}} a pheromone which attracts females, although this is only believed to be effective over short distances. They then transfer sperm to the female using their gonopods, specially modified legs. After fertilisation, the females lay 70–80 eggs, each about 1mm long, and each wrapped singly in a capsule of digested earth. The eggs hatch {{after a period of}} about two months, with the duration depending on factors including temperature. Development lasts for up to three years, and involves nine moults, following which moults occur periodically as adults. Females are fertile for several years, and can produce six broods over their lifetime, which can be up to eleven years.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or <b>cyclically,</b> if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E
500|$|Only one person, the [...] "Avatar", can bend {{all four}} elements. <b>Cyclically</b> reincarnating among the world's four nations, the Avatar {{maintains}} peace and {{balance in the}} world. The Legend of Korra focuses on Avatar Korra, a seventeen-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe and the successor of Avatar Aang from The Last Airbender.|$|E
500|$|Gardens {{are thought}} by many critics {{to play a}} {{critical}} symbolic role in Candide. The first location commonly identified as a garden is the castle of the Baron, from which Candide and Cunégonde are evicted much {{in the same fashion}} as Adam and Eve are evicted from the Garden of Eden in Genesis. <b>Cyclically,</b> the main characters of Candide conclude the novel in a garden of their own making, one which might represent celestial paradise. The third most prominent [...] "garden" [...] is El Dorado, which may be a false Eden. Other possibly symbolic gardens include the Jesuit pavilion, the garden of Pococurante, Cacambo's garden, and the Turk's garden.|$|E
500|$|Alex Raymond's [...] "influence {{on other}} cartoonists was {{considerable}} {{during his lifetime}} and did not diminish after his death". George Lucas has cited Raymond's Flash Gordon as {{a major influence on}} his Star Wars films (which, <b>cyclically,</b> inspired the 1980 Flash Gordon film), while Raymond's long shadow has fallen across the comics industry ever since his work saw print. Comics artists who have cited Raymond as a particularly significant influence on their work include Murphy Anderson, Jim Aparo, Frank Brunner, John Buscema, Gene Colan, Dick Dillin, José Luis García-López, Frank Giacoia, Bob Haney, Jack Katz, Everett Raymond Kinstler, Joe Kubert, Russ Manning, Mort Meskin, Sheldon Moldoff, Luis Garcia Mozos, Joe Orlando, Mac Raboy, John Romita Jr., Kurt Schaffenberger, Joe Sinnott, Dick Sprang and Alex Toth, among many others.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} {{black-and-white}} sequence, {{prompted by the}} caller, Leonard meets with Teddy, an undercover officer, who has found Leonard's [...] "John G," [...] Jimmy, and directs Leonard to the abandoned building. When Jimmy arrives, Leonard strangles him and takes {{a photo of the}} body. As it develops, the black-and-white transitions to the final color sequence. Leonard swaps clothes with Jimmy, hearing him whisper [...] "Sammy." [...] As Leonard has only told Sammy's story to those he has met, he suddenly doubts Jimmy's role. Teddy arrives and asserts that Jimmy was John G, but when Leonard is undeterred, Teddy reveals that he helped him kill the real attacker a year ago, and he has been using Leonard ever since. Teddy points out that since [...] "John G" [...] is common, he will <b>cyclically</b> forget and begin again and that even Teddy himself has a [...] "John G" [...] name. Further, Teddy claims that Sammy's story is Leonard's himself, repressing the memory to escape guilt.|$|E
