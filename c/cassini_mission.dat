5|$|Prior to the 2004 {{arrival of}} the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft, the rings of Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not {{expected}} to survive beyond another 300million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the <b>Cassini</b> <b>mission</b> led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass {{is thought to have}} preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.|$|E

25|$|Alkanes form a {{small portion}} of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets such as Jupiter (0.1% methane, 2nbsp&ppm ethane), Saturn (0.2% methane, 5nbsp&ppm ethane), Uranus (1.99% methane, 2.5nbsp&ppm ethane) and Neptune (1.5% methane, 1.5nbsp&ppm ethane). Titan (1.6% methane), a {{satellite}} of Saturn, was examined by the Huygens probe, which indicated that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moon's surface. Also on Titan the <b>Cassini</b> <b>mission</b> has imaged seasonal methane/ethane lakes near the polar regions of Titan. Methane and ethane have also been detected in the tail of the comet Hyakutake. Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal, which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space, away from the Sun, which would have evaporated these volatile molecules. Alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites.|$|E
25|$|A team of {{scientists}} associated with the <b>Cassini</b> <b>mission</b> {{have argued that the}} ridge could be a remnant of the oblate shape of the young Iapetus, when it was rotating more rapidly than it does today. The height of the ridge suggests a maximum rotational period of 17 hours. If Iapetus cooled fast enough to preserve the ridge but remained plastic long enough for the tides raised by Saturn to have slowed the rotation to its current tidally locked 79 days, Iapetus must have been heated by the radioactive decay of aluminium-26. This isotope appears to have been abundant in the solar nebula from which Saturn formed, but has since all decayed. The quantities of aluminium-26 needed to heat Iapetus to the required temperature give a tentative date to its formation relative {{to the rest of the}} Solar System: Iapetus must have come together earlier than expected, only two million years after the asteroids started to form.|$|E
500|$|A {{mountain}} range measuring [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high was also discovered by Cassini in 2006. This range {{lies in the}} southern hemisphere and {{is thought to be}} composed of icy material and covered in methane snow. The movement of tectonic plates, perhaps influenced by a nearby impact basin, could have opened a gap through which the mountain's material upwelled. Prior to Cassini, scientists assumed that most of the topography on Titan would be impact structures, yet these findings reveal that similar to Earth, the mountains were formed through geological processes. In December 2010, the <b>Cassini</b> <b>mission</b> team announced the most compelling possible cryovolcano yet found. Named Sotra Patera, it is one in a chain of at least three mountains, each between 1000 and 1500m in height, several of which are topped by large craters. The ground around their bases appears to be overlaid by frozen lava flows.|$|E

In 2007 Anthe was announced. In 2008 it was reported that Cassini observations of a depletion of energetic electrons in Saturn's magnetosphere near Rhea might be the signature of a tenuous ring system around Saturn's second largest moon. In , Aegaeon, a moonlet within the G Ring, was announced. In July of the same year, S/2009 S 1, the first moonlet within the B Ring, was observed.

500|$|The {{answers to}} many {{remaining}} mysteries of Enceladus {{had to wait}} until the arrival of the Cassini spacecraft on July 1, 2004, when it entered orbit around Saturn. Given the results from the Voyager 2 images, Enceladus was considered a priority target by the <b>Cassini</b> <b>mission</b> planners, and several targeted flybys within 1,500km of the surface were planned as well as numerous, [...] "non-targeted" [...] opportunities within 100,000km of Enceladus. The flybys have yielded significant information concerning Enceladus's surface, as well as the discovery of water vapor with traces of simple hydrocarbons venting from the geologically active south polar region. These discoveries prompted the adjustment of Cassini's flight plan to allow closer flybys of Enceladus, including an encounter in March 2008 that took it to within 48km of the surface. Cassini's extended mission included seven close flybys of Enceladus between July 2008 and July 2010, including two passes at only 50km in the later half of 2008. Cassini performed a flyby on October 28, 2015, passing as close as [...] and through a plume. Confirmation of molecular hydrogen (...) would be an independent line of evidence that hydrothermal activity is taking place in the Enceladus seafloor, increasing its habitability.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Cassini</b> <b>mission</b> {{confirmed}} the former hypothesis. When the probe {{arrived in the}} Saturnian system in 2004, {{it was hoped that}} hydrocarbon lakes or oceans would be detected from the sunlight reflected off their surface, but no specular reflections were initially observed. Near Titan's south pole, an enigmatic dark feature named Ontario Lacus was identified (and later confirmed to be a lake). A possible shoreline was also identified near the pole via radar imagery. Following a flyby on July 22, 2006, in which the Cassini spacecraft's radar imaged the northern latitudes (that were then in winter), several large, smooth (and thus dark to radar) patches were seen dotting the surface near the pole. Based on the observations, scientists announced [...] "definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane on Saturn's moon Titan" [...] in January 2007. The Cassini–Huygens team concluded that the imaged features are almost certainly the long-sought hydrocarbon lakes, the first stable bodies of surface liquid found outside Earth. Some appear to have channels associated with liquid and lie in topographical depressions. The liquid erosion features appear to be a very recent occurrence: channels in some regions have created surprisingly little erosion, suggesting erosion on Titan is extremely slow, or some other recent phenomena may have wiped out older riverbeds and landforms. Overall, the Cassini radar observations have shown that lakes cover {{only a small percentage of}} the surface, making Titan much drier than Earth. Most of the lakes are concentrated near the poles (where the relative lack of sunlight prevents evaporation), but several long-standing hydrocarbon lakes in the equatorial desert regions have also been discovered, including one near the Huygens landing site in the Shangri-La region, which is about half the size of Utah's Great Salt Lake. The equatorial lakes are probably [...] "oases", i.e. the likely supplier is underground aquifers.|$|E

40|$|Recent space {{missions}} {{have provided}} {{information on the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of interstellar grains such as the ratio β of radiation pressure to gravity acting on the grains in addition to the composition, structure, and size distribution of the grains. Numerical simulation on the trajectories of interstellar grains captured by Stardust and returned to Earth constrained the β ratio for the Stardust samples of interstellar origin. However, recent accurate calculations of radiation pressure cross sections for model dust grains have given conflicting stories in the β ratio of interstellar grains. The β ratio for model dust grains of so-called "astronomical silicate" in the femto-kilogram range lies below unity, in conflict with β∼ 1 for the Stardust interstellar grains. Here, I tackle this conundrum by re-evaluating the β ratio of interstellar grains {{on the assumption that the}} grains are aggregated particles grown by coagulation and composed of amorphous MgSiO_ 3 with the inclusion of metallic iron. My model is entirely consistent with the depletion and the correlation of major rock-forming elements in the Local Interstellar Cloud surrounding the Sun and the mineralogical identification of interstellar grains in the Stardust and <b>Cassini</b> <b>missions.</b> I find that my model dust particles fulfill the constraints on the β ratio derived from not only the Stardust mission but also the Ulysses and <b>Cassini</b> <b>missions.</b> My results suggest that iron is not incorporated into silicates but exists as metal, contrary to the majority of interstellar dust models available to date.
