40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to identify commonalities among the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> <b>of</b> osteoarthritis (OA), osteoporosis (OP), low back pain (LBP), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and chronic widespread pain (CWP). The aim is to identify relevant categories for the development of a tentative ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Set</b> for musculoskeletal and pain conditions. The ICF categories common to the five musculoskeletal and pain conditions in the Brief and Comprehensive ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> were identified in three steps. In a first step, the commonalities across the Brief and Comprehensive ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> for these conditions were examined. In a second and third step, we analysed the increase in commonalities when iteratively excluding one or two of the five conditions. In the first step, 29 common categories out of the total number of 120 categories were identified across the Comprehensive ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> <b>of</b> all musculoskeletal and pain conditions, primarily in the component activities and participation. In the second and third step, we found that the exclusion of CWP across the Comprehensive ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> increased the commonalities of the remaining four musculoskeletal conditions in a maximum of ten additional categories. The Brief ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> <b>of</b> all musculoskeletal and pain conditions contain four common categories out of a total number of 62 categories. The iterative exclusion of a singular condition did not significantly increase the commonalities in the remaining. Based on our analysis, it seems possible to develop a tentative Comprehensive ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Set</b> across a number of musculoskeletal conditions including LBP, OA, OP and RA. However, the profile of functioning in people with CWP differs considerably and should not be further considered for a common ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Set...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} preliminary <b>core</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> {{outcome variables}} for disease activity and damage assessment in juvenile {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (JSLE) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). METHODS: Two questionnaire surveys were mailed to 267 physicians from 46 different countries asking each member to select and rank the response variables used when assessing clinical response in patients with JSLE or JDM. Next, 40 paediatric rheumatologists from 34 countries met and, using the nominal group technique, selected the domains {{to be included in}} the disease activity and damage <b>core</b> <b>sets</b> for JSLE and JDM. RESULTS: A total of 41 response variables for JSLE and 37 response variables for JDM were selected and ranked through the questionnaire surveys. In the consensus conference, domains selected for both JSLE and JDM activity or damage <b>core</b> <b>sets</b> included the physician and parent/patient subjective assessments and a global score tool. Domains specific for JSLE activity were the immunological tests and the kidney function parameters. Concerning JDM, functional ability and muscle strength assessments were indicated for both activity and damage <b>core</b> <b>sets,</b> whereas serum muscle enzymes were included only in the activity <b>core</b> <b>set.</b> A specific paediatric domain called 'growth and development' was introduced in the disease damage <b>core</b> <b>set</b> for both diseases and the evaluation of health-related quality of life was advised in order to capture the influence of the disease on the patient lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: We developed preliminary <b>core</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> measures for disease activity and damage assessment in JSLE and JDM.
