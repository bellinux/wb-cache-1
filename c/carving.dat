5|$|In July 1995, Slovenian {{archaeologist}} Ivan Turk {{discovered a}} bone <b>carving</b> {{in the northwest}} region of Slovenia. The <b>carving,</b> named the Divje Babe Flute, features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined {{could have been used}} to play four notes of a diatonic scale. Researchers estimate the flute's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years, making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture. However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status as a musical instrument. German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the Swabian Alps. The flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic age, and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments.|$|E

5|$|Built between 1093 and 1537, Chester Cathedral {{includes}} {{a set of}} medieval choir stalls dating from 1380, with exquisite figurative <b>carving.</b> An unusual feature is the very large south transept.

5|$|Each <b>carving</b> {{receives}} a special name, and common motifs are {{animals and plants}} that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. The image to the left shows an example of Torajan wood <b>carving,</b> consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, a wish for many buffaloes for the family. The center panel represents a knot and a box, a hope {{that all of the}} family's offspring will be happy and live in harmony, like goods kept safe in a box. The top left and top right squares represent an aquatic animal, indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving on the surface of water. It also represents the need for a certain skill to produce good results.|$|E
