5|$|Like her two predecessors, Ranavalona {{concluded}} a political marriage with Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony. The young queen's role was largely ceremonial as nearly all important political decisions {{continued to be}} made by the much older and more experienced prime minister. Ranavalona was frequently called upon to deliver formal speeches (kabary) to the public on behalf of Rainilaiarivony and would make appearances to inaugurate new public buildings, such as a hospital at Isoavinandriana and a girls' school at Ambodin'Andohalo. Throughout her reign, Ranavalona's aunt, Ramisindrazana, acted as an adviser and exercised considerable influence at court. Ranavalona's older sister, Rasendranoro, whose son Rakatomena and daughter Razafinandriamanitra lived with their mother at the Rova, was also a close companion. An American journalist who visited her palace reported that Ranavalona spent much of her leisure time flying kites or playing lotto, a parlor game, with her relatives and other ladies at court. She also enjoyed knitting, needlework and <b>crocheting</b> and would frequently bring her latest craft project to work on at cabinet meetings. She had a great love of fine garments and was the only Malagasy sovereign to import the majority of her clothing from Paris rather than London.|$|E

25|$|The Thomasites {{taught the}} {{following}} subjects: English, agriculture, reading, grammar, geography, mathematics, general courses, trade courses, housekeeping and household arts (sewing, <b>crocheting</b> and cooking), manual trading, mechanical drawing, freehand drawing and athletics (baseball, track and field, tennis, indoor baseball and basketball).|$|E
50|$|<b>Crocheted</b> lace {{includes}} Irish <b>crochet,</b> pineapple <b>crochet,</b> and filet <b>crochet.</b>|$|R
25|$|Filet <b>crochet,</b> Tunisian <b>crochet,</b> {{tapestry}} <b>crochet,</b> broomstick lace, hairpin lace, cro-hooking, and Irish <b>crochet</b> are all {{variants of}} the basic <b>crochet</b> method.|$|R
50|$|Main {{styles of}} <b>crocheted</b> lace include filet <b>crochet,</b> Irish <b>crochet</b> and its modern derivatives, {{pineapple}} <b>crochet.</b> Freeform <b>crocheted</b> lace also exists, examples {{of which are}} pieces striving to imitate reticella lace.|$|R
25|$|Before use, hanks are wound into {{balls in}} which the yarn emerges from the center, making <b>crocheting</b> easier by {{preventing}} the yarn from becoming easily tangled. The winding process may be performed by hand or done with a ballwinder and swift.|$|E
25|$|The single stemmed Decorated style {{octagonal}} font has each wave of a frieze {{filled with}} an ogee trefoil and with battlements above. Suspended by a rope from the roof above is a tall and highly ornate font cover in Perpendicular Gothic style with carved figures, some original, in niches between diagonal pierced vanes with rich <b>crocheting</b> topped by a spire and winged angel.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} very common for people and groups to crochet {{clothing}} and other garments and then donate them to soldiers during war. People have also crocheted clothing and then donated it to hospitals, for sick patients and also for newborn babies. Sometimes groups will crochet for a specific charity purpose, such as <b>crocheting</b> for homeless shelters, nursing homes, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Amigurumi can be knitted, {{though they}} are usually <b>crocheted</b> out of yarn or thread, using the basic {{techniques}} of <b>crochet</b> (such as single <b>crochet</b> stitch (sc), double <b>crochet</b> (db), invisible decrease (inv.dec)). Amigurumi can be worked as one piece or, more usually, in sections which are sewed or <b>crocheted</b> together. In <b>crochet,</b> amigurumi are typically worked in spiral rounds to prevent [...] "striping", a typical feature of joining <b>crochet</b> rounds in a project.|$|R
5000|$|Filet <b>crochet</b> {{is a type}} of <b>crocheted</b> fabric. This type of <b>crocheted</b> lace is gridlike {{because it}} uses only two <b>crochet</b> stitches: the chain stitch and the double <b>crochet</b> stitch (U.S. terminology; known in some other {{countries}} as chain stitch and treble). Old filet patterns used a treble or triple stitch vertically but chained two between the vertical stitches. This was to prevent distortion of some patterns. Chain stitches use less yarn than double <b>crochet</b> stitches, which results in a visual difference in appearance between the two kinds of stitch. Filet <b>crochet</b> forms patterns by filling in parts of a mostly chain stitch mesh with double <b>crochet</b> stitches. [...] Filet <b>crochet</b> is usually constructed from monotone <b>crochet</b> thread made of Mercerised cotton in white or ecru, and worked in rows. Filet <b>crochet</b> is used for decorative applications such as window curtains, tablecloths, and place settings such as coasters and placemats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crochet</b> thread is {{specially}} formulated thread {{usually made}} from mercerized cotton for crafting decorative <b>crochet</b> {{items such as}} doilies or filet <b>crochet.</b> <b>Crochet</b> thread produces fabric of fine gauge that may be stiffened with starch.|$|R
25|$|While most crochet is {{made with}} a hook, {{there is also a}} method of <b>crocheting</b> with a {{knitting}} loom. This is called loomchet. Slip stitch crochet is very similar to knitting. Each stitch in slip stitch crochet is formed the same way as a knit or purl stitch which is then bound off. A person working in slip stitch crochet can follow a knitted pattern with knits, purls, and cables, and get a similar result.|$|E
25|$|As {{a fitness}} instructor, Smith found {{a lack of}} {{appealing}} clothes in which to work and started to sew her own. She had no formal training in garment production, but had been interested in fashion since a teenager, <b>crocheting</b> bikinis from age 16, customising her clothes from age 18, and from age 21 starting to design and make her own clothes. She began by unpicking a favourite swimsuit {{and used it to}} make a pattern out of newspaper, providing the basis for her first leotard design. Her students liked her outfits, and started requesting that Smith make clothes for them too.|$|E
500|$|Her {{first solo}} exhibition, [...] "Knitting is for Pus****", {{was held at}} Christopher Henry Gallery. In 2010 she {{exhibited}} a false apartment in which the contents, including the residents, were covered in <b>crocheting.</b> The installation took years to prepare using yarn skeins. It was originally scheduled to run from 9 September to 17 October 2010, but closed in May 2011 {{after a series of}} extensions. During that period, the gallery exhibited her work at the SCOPE Art Show in Miami. In this and other works, members of the public or the media were included, crocheted directly into suits without traditional fasteners. Acoording to the gallery, after the exhibition closed the work was priced at $90,000.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>crochet</b> {{underwent}} a subsequent decline in popularity, the early 21st century {{has seen a}} revival of interest in handcrafts and DIY, as well as great strides in improvement of the quality and varieties of yarn. There are many more new pattern books with modern patterns being printed, and most yarn stores now offer <b>crochet</b> lessons {{in addition to the}} traditional knitting lessons. There are many books you can purchase from local book stores to teach yourself how to <b>crochet</b> whether it be as a beginner or intermediate. There are also many books for children and teenagers who are hoping to take up the hobby. Filet <b>crochet,</b> Tunisian <b>crochet,</b> tapestry <b>crochet,</b> broomstick lace, hairpin lace, cro-hooking, and Irish <b>crochet</b> are all variants of the basic <b>crochet</b> method.|$|R
50|$|According to the <b>Crochet</b> Guild of America, {{there are}} earlier records of <b>crocheted</b> or knitted dolls made in China; early {{examples}} include three-dimensional dolls worked in <b>crochet.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tapestry <b>crochet</b> is {{sometimes}} called jacquard <b>crochet,</b> intarsia, mosaic, fair isle, and colorwork, but today these terms usually describe different techniques. Since the yarns are switched {{back and forth to}} create motifs, tapestry <b>crochet</b> fabric looks more like it was woven on a loom than <b>crocheted</b> with a hook.|$|R
500|$|As {{part of the}} MTA's [...] "Arts for Transit" [...] program, three mosaics by Xenobia Bailey, which total {{approximately}} , {{were installed}} in three locations within the station. The artworks, titled Funktional Vibrations, are based on some of Bailey's <b>crocheting</b> patterns, and is located in an oval-shaped recession in the ceiling at the 34th Street entrance. The other two mosaics {{are located in the}} station entrances. The tiles used in Funktional Vibrations were created by mosaic craftsman Stephen Miotto, who manufactured the tiles in his Carmel, New York, studio. Another section of the artwork is expected to be installed in the second entrance by spring 2017. However, there is no artwork {{in the rest of the}} station; one Newsweek writer observed that while the station was [...] "very clean but also a little antiseptic", [...] "cool", and [...] "efficient", it was also [...] "lacking all character" [...] with its austere design.|$|E
500|$|Olek {{first used}} <b>crocheting</b> {{as part of}} her art in 2003 after moving to the United States. She [...] "wowed critics" [...] at the Williamsburg Arts and Historical Society Surrealist Fashion Show that year. In 2004, Olek created [...] "a large tentlike piece made of crocheted strips of cloth, hair, {{cassette}} tape and stuffed animals" [...] work for a four-person show. The New York Times said this work gave the show at 5BE Gallery in Chelsea, Manhattan, [...] "a tour-de-force center to work around." [...] Her crocheted sculpture [...] "Spill" [...] (2005), featured in the Washington Post, included 1,300 skinny white balloons cascading in an [...] "intestinal shape". She participated in The Waterways, a [...] "socially conscious" [...] art project on a vaporetto water bus during the 2005 Venice Biennale; her work, called [...] "Camouflage", [...] "exploring the androgyny of fixed identity, sexuality, and culture". In September and October of that year, Olek crocheted the windows of a burned-out, abandoned building near her artist residency in Utica, New York. During this period, her costumes for theatre and dance performances drew critical praise, although a dance performance relating to one of her sculptures was criticized.|$|E
500|$|A Ladies' Aid {{society was}} {{established}} on July15, 1903, with board members Marie Hovgaard, Anna P.C. Petersen, Henrietta Hansen, and Sine C. Jensen. At first, Sunday school was conducted an hour {{prior to the}} church services on Sunday, but in 1907 {{it was decided to}} hold Sunday school during the time of worship service. As early as 1904, the synod had discussed the possibility of establishing a children's home at Tyler. On November1, 1906, a children's home opened in the residence of K.H. Duus, who temporarily moved to Askov, Minnesota. A Folk School Association was organized in 1912. As early as 1888, the colony organized its first Danish elementary school for its children, Børneskolen, which was in use until 1939. In her travel diary entitled My Big Adventure of 1915–1916: The joys and hazards of motor touring in 1915, Danebod local Ragna C. Olson (1905–2007) described the average school day in 1914: [...] "We had an hour of religion, then learned how to read and write Danish, some history, and the last hour we girls learned work such as knitting, <b>crocheting</b> and embroidery. In the afternoons, they taught us English, writing, reading and arithmetic." [...] Ragna Olsen (previously Sorensen) was the daughter of the Danish pioneers Johanne Marie Sorensen (1877–1947) and Carl Cold Sorensen (1879–1967), both of whom hold a place in Danebod history for bringing the first motorized vehicles to Tyler in the early 1900s.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} main types of basic {{stitches}} (the following description uses US <b>crochet</b> terminology which {{differs from the}} terminology used in the UK and Europe). 1. Chain Stitch - {{the most basic of}} all stitches and used to begin most projects. 2. Slip Stitch - used to join chain stitch to form a ring. 3. Single <b>Crochet</b> Stitch (called Double <b>Crochet</b> Stitch in the UK) - easiest stitch to master Single <b>Crochet</b> Stitch Tutorial 4. Half Double <b>Crochet</b> Stitch (called Half Treble Stitch in the UK) - the 'in-between' stitch Half-Double <b>Crochet</b> Tutorial 5.

2500|$|An {{instruction}} book from 1846 describes Shepherd or Single <b>Crochet</b> as what in current British usage is either called single <b>crochet</b> or slip-stitch <b>crochet,</b> with U.S. American terminology always using the latter (reserving single <b>crochet</b> {{for use as}} noted above). It similarly equates [...] "Double" [...] and [...] "French crochet".|$|R
50|$|In <b>crochet,</b> {{stitches}} {{are made}} by pulling a loop of thread through the work with a <b>crochet</b> hook. <b>Crochet</b> stitches are named based on their structure. In the English-speaking <b>crochet</b> world, basic stitches have different names that vary by country. The differences are usually referred to as UK/US or British/American.|$|R
2500|$|In the 19th century, as Ireland {{was facing}} the Great Irish Famine (1845-1849), crochet lace work was {{introduced}} {{as a form}} of famine relief (the production of crocheted lace being an alternative way of making money for impoverished Irish workers). Men, women, children joined a cooperative in order to crochet and produce products to help with famine relief during the Great Irish Famine. Schools to teach <b>crocheting</b> were started. Teachers were trained and sent across Ireland to teach this craft. When the Irish immigrated to the Americas, they were able to take with them <b>crocheting.</b> [...] Mademoiselle Riego de la Blanchardiere is generally credited with the invention of Irish Crochet, publishing the first book of patterns in 1846. Irish lace became popular in Europe and America, and was made in quantity until the first World War.|$|E
2500|$|Round or {{cylindrical}} {{patterns are}} simple to produce {{with a regular}} crochet hook, but cylindrical knitting requires either a set of circular needles or three to five special double-ended needles. [...] Many crocheted items are composed of individual motifs which are then joined together, either by sewing or <b>crocheting,</b> whereas knitting is usually composed of one fabric, such as entrelac.|$|E
2500|$|On her homepage, Pierce states {{she gets}} most ideas from things she stumbles upon. Her concept of magic as a {{tapestry}} of threads comes from her experiences in <b>crocheting,</b> {{and in her}} world, all mages are somehow based on British naturalist David Attenborough after watching his nature documentaries. Fantasy novels and Arthurian legend were {{the base of the}} worlds she thought up as a girl, and later she added contemporary issues like youth crime, cholera outbreaks in Africa. In general, Pierce states: [...] "The best way to prepare to have ideas when you need them is to listen to and encourage your obsessions." ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{instruction}} book from 1846 describes Shepherd or Single <b>Crochet</b> as what in current British usage is either called single <b>crochet</b> or slip-stitch <b>crochet,</b> with U.S. American terminology always using the latter (reserving single <b>crochet</b> {{for use as}} noted above).

2500|$|<b>Crochet</b> ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{a process}} of {{creating}} fabric by interlocking loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials using a <b>crochet</b> hook. The name is derived from the French term <b>crochet,</b> meaning 'small hook'. These are made of materials such as metal, wood, or plastic and are manufactured commercially and produced in artisan workshops. The salient difference between <b>crochet</b> and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in <b>crochet</b> is completed before proceeding with the next one, while knitting keeps a large number of stitches open at a time. (Variant forms such as Tunisian <b>crochet</b> and broomstick lace keep multiple <b>crochet</b> stitches open at a time.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Crochet</b> often employs complex lacy {{patterns}} where stitch markers are helpful. <b>Crochet</b> {{also has}} less inherent stretch than knitting, so <b>crocheted</b> garments require greater contour adjustments at the pattern and construction level.|$|R
2500|$|Basic {{materials}} {{required for}} crochet are a hook and {{some type of}} material that will be crocheted, most commonly yarn or thread. [...] Yarn, {{one of the most}} commonly used materials for <b>crocheting</b> has varying weights which need to be taken into consideration when following patterns. Additional tools are convenient for keeping stitches counted, measuring crocheted fabric, or making related accessories. Examples include cardboard cutouts, which {{can be used to make}} tassels, fringe, and many other items; a pom-pom circle, used to make pom-poms; a tape measure and a gauge measure, both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches; a row counter; and occasionally plastic rings, which are used for special projects.|$|E

The Literacy Council of Upper Pinellas, Inc., which promotes adult literacy in North Pinellas County, serves the Dunedin Public Library.|$|E
2500|$|Emma Leroy (Janet Wright) is Brent's mother, {{the brains}} and muscle of the family. She and Oscar squabble {{constantly}} and she usually ends {{up having to}} deal with the fallout from his actions, which she usually makes worse. Though he embarrasses and annoys her, she does truly love him. She has also found [...] "letting go" [...] of Brent difficult and reacts badly when someone else appears to replace her in some aspect of his life. Her main hobbies are knitting, <b>crocheting,</b> and gardening and she is active in many of the town's committees. She has also been shown to possess great strength (being able to hurl a cinder block at a skunk across the yard with little effort), and other characters often seek her advice. She has a quick-tempered, cunning, domineering personality. After the end of the series she remained married to Oscar, despite doctor's orders.|$|E
5000|$|Cro-tatting {{combines}} needle tatting with <b>crochet.</b> The cro-tatting tool is a tatting needle with a <b>crochet</b> hook at the end. One {{can also}} cro-tat with a bullion <b>crochet</b> hook {{or a very}} straight <b>crochet</b> hook. In the 19th century, [...] "crochet tatting" [...] patterns were published which simply called for a <b>crochet</b> hook. One of the earliest patterns is for a <b>crocheted</b> afghan with tatted rings forming a raised design. [...] Patterns are available in English and are equally divided between yarn and thread. In its most basic form, the rings are tatted with a length of plain thread between them, as in single-shuttle tatting. In modern patterns, {{beginning in the early}} 20th century, the rings are tatted and the arches or chains are <b>crocheted.</b> Many people consider cro-tatting more difficult than <b>crochet</b> or needle tatting. Some tatting instructors recommend using a tatting needle and a <b>crochet</b> hook to work cro-tatting patterns. Stitches of cro-tatting (and needle tatting before a ring is closed) unravel easily, unlike tatting made with a shuttle.|$|R
5000|$|Bead <b>crochet</b> is a <b>crochet</b> {{technique}} that incorporates beads into a <b>crochet</b> fabric. The technique {{is used to}} produce decorative effects in women's fashion accessories. The word [...] "crochet" [...] {{is derived from the}} French [...] "croche" [...] or [...] "croc" [...] meaning [...] "to hook". Published descriptions of bead <b>crochet</b> date from around 1824 although it was probably common before then. [...] At one time, bead <b>crochet</b> was thought by some people to be appropriate only for rich people.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic method}} of {{producing}} shell stitches is to anchor several long stitches {{into the same}} base, anchoring both ends with short stitches {{in a manner that}} spreads out the cluster like a fan. Although many variations are possible, a basic shell stitch in United States terminology would be single <b>crochet,</b> skip two, five double <b>crochets</b> into previous single <b>crochet,</b> skip two, then single <b>crochet</b> into middle double <b>crochet.</b> In abbreviated terminology, it would read 5 dcs into previous sc, sk 2 dcs, sc into middle dc. Variant patterns may use longer stitches such as triple <b>crochet,</b> may vary the number of stitches, or alter the anchoring method.|$|R
