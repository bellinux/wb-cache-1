5|$|One {{member of}} the Commission, the <b>chief</b> <b>accountant</b> of the Ministry of Finance, A. van Gijn, objected to the report's conclusions. He {{provided}} a note to Queen Wilhelmina, which argued that advocates of building large warships had forced {{their views on the}} other members of the commission. Moreover, he believed that the proposed fleet would be inadequate given the rapid naval expansion being undertaken by the major powers, and that if it was adopted there would be a requirement to buy further dreadnoughts in order to keep pace. This note was included as an appendix to the Commission's report.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad Maymandi's father, Hasan Maymandi, {{was from}} a town named Maymand in Zabulistan, a region known for its popular traditions about the mythological Iranian warrior Rostam. Hasan was the {{governor}} of Bust under Mahmud's father, Sabuktigin, whose kingdom was then a vassal state of the Samanids, who were the lords of Khorasan, and ruled much of the region through their vassals. During Hasan's governorship of Bust, Sabuktigin crucified him, an action which Sabuktigin later regretted. Maymandi was the foster brother and school-fellow of Mahmud, who was also from Zabulistan on his maternal side. Maymandi began his administrative career in 994 {{as head of the}} department of correspondence during Mahmud's governorship of Khorasan under his Samanid overlords. Maymandi was later promoted to <b>chief</b> <b>accountant</b> and head of the military department. He was also appointed as governor of Bust and Rukhkhaj.|$|E
40|$|Against the {{background}} of the role and tasks of auditors in the capitalist firms (USA, FRG, Great Britain) and of the <b>chief</b> <b>accountants</b> in the socialist enterprises (USSR, GDR), there have been presented the position and tasks of <b>chief</b> <b>accountants</b> in the Polish autonomous and seIf-managing enterprises. Next, after analyzing the factors determining the worktime of <b>chief</b> <b>accountants</b> in Poland, an attempt has been made to determine these duties to which <b>chief</b> <b>accountants</b> attach most of their attention and devote most of their efforts. The basis for this determination has been the structure of using the worktime of <b>chief</b> <b>accountants</b> fixed by means of the questionnaire survey carried out by the authoress and her Interviews with 24 <b>chief</b> <b>accountants</b> in the state enterprises located in Lodz. The presentation of work of the chiefs of finance-accounting services has been expanded by presentation of the magnitude of traditional parameters describing organization of their own work (determined through the questionnaire survey), which have been compared with the magnitudes of such parameters fixed by various authors in the course of numerous studies on organization of managerial work and with model indices characterizing effective organization of managers work designed by prof. W. Kieżun. The analysis of utilizing the worktime of <b>chief</b> <b>accountants</b> in these two cross-sections has provided a basis for drawing conclusions, which when taken into consideration by <b>chief</b> <b>accountants</b> may contribute to improved organization of their own work.
