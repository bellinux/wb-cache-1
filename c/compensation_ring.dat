To {{reduce the cost}} and release the number of bits, a temperature-dependent delay circuit (TDDC) composed of a thermal ring oscillator and a fixed-gain time amplifier was used to generate a thermal sensing delay proportional to the test temperature. An adjustable reference delay circuit (ARDC) composed of another thermal <b>compensation</b> <b>ring</b> oscillator and an adjustable-gain time amplifier was used to program a reference set-point delay. For digital output coding, a SAR control logic was adopted for selecting the optimal reference delay of the ARDC to approximate the thermal delay of the TDDC through {{the help of a}} time comparator. The chip size of the proposed oscillators-based sensor with 11 output bits was 0. 25 mm 2, which is less than the 0. 6 mm 2 of its delay-line-based predecessor with a 10 output bits in the same 0. 35 -μm TSMC CMOS process [1]. The measurement errors were within ± 0. 6 °C in the temperature range of 0 °C to 90 °C after two-point calibration for eight packaged chips...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports on}} the design and {{characterization}} of a process, temperature and supply compensation technique for a 7 -MHz clock oscillator in a 0. 25 - m, two–poly five-metal (2 P 5 M) CMOS process. Measurements made across a temperature range of 40 C to 125 C and 94 samples collected over four fabrica-tion runs indicate a worst case combined variation of 2. 6 % (with process, temperature and supply). No trimming was performed {{on any of these}} samples. The oscillation frequencies of 95 % of the sam-ples were found to fall within 0. 5 % of the mean frequency and the standard deviation was 9. 3 kHz. The variation of frequency with power supply was 0. 31 % for a supply voltage range of 2. 4 – 2. 75 V. The clock generator is based on a three-stage differential ring oscillator. The variation of the frequency of the oscillator with tem-perature and process has been discussed and an adaptive biasing scheme incorporating a unique combination of a process corner sensing scheme and a temperature compensating network is de-veloped. The biasing circuit changes the control voltage of the dif-ferential ring oscillator to maintain a constant frequency. A com-parator included at the output stage ensures rail-to-rail swing. The oscillator is intended to serve as a start-up clock for micro-con-troller applications. Index Terms—Process <b>compensation,</b> <b>ring</b> oscillators, tempera-ture compensation. I...|$|E

The phantom data were reconstructed using a clinical OSEM algorithm (GE OSEM) with ten subsets and four iterations. This reconstruction algorithm does not include collimator-detector response (CDR) compensation, which can improve spatial resolution and reduce spill-out of counts.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, some users {{may want to}} push the frontiers of their {{research}} looking for the best image quality achievable {{in order to ensure}} an accurate quantitative analysis of the reconstructed volume. They may want to invest time and efforts in the optimization of the reconstruction process by testing non-conventional flat fielding solutions, different phase retrieval algorithms as well as enhanced reconstruction approaches, such as algebraic techniques. For instance, the most recurrent additional pre-processing step deals with the <b>compensation</b> of <b>ring</b> artifacts that hamper the interpretation and segmentation of the reconstructed data [9]. Efforts in the optimization of the <b>ring</b> artifacts <b>compensation</b> step require several attempts. Also intensive computational time is required by some of these approaches, thus leading to slow reconstruction workflows (slower than the time required by data collection). Moreover, in a large scientific collaboration, it is not uncommon that the researchers involved in the data acquisition at the facility are different from those involved in the interpretation and analysis of the reconstructed images. These researchers, more expert in the image evaluation, might not possess programming skills and, therefore, their contribution can be discouraged if they are required to modify, e.g., MATLAB®, IDL® or Python scripts. An interesting additional point is that, as research in digital image processing goes on, users might be interested in applying new algorithms to past archived datasets. This is particularly true for experiments where rare specimens are scanned [10] or investigations where destructive complementary analyses (e.g., histology) are considered after the -CT acquisition. In this case, it might be hard (or even impossible) to perform a new data collection. In this scenario, the availability of user-friendly software tools for a post-beamtime optimization of the reconstruction workflow at user’s home institution might increase the image quality and improve the subsequent analyses.|$|R
