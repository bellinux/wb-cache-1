25|$|The {{interpretation}} of the correlations as fixed size quanta travelling along random walks gives a way of understanding why the <b>critical</b> <b>dimension</b> of the H4 interaction is 4. The term H4 {{can be thought of}} as the square of the density of the random walkers at any point. In order for such a term to alter the finite order correlation functions, which only introduce a few new random walks into the fluctuating environment, the new paths must intersect. Otherwise, the square of the density is just proportional to the density and only shifts the H2 coefficient by a constant. But the intersection probability of random walks depends on the dimension, and random walks in dimension higher than 4 do not intersect.|$|E

Results show that the nanowire core-shell heterostructure can sufficiently reduce the strain in the shell and increase the critical shell thickness. The <b>critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> for the nanowire core-multishell heterostructure {{are determined by the}} stress fields generated at two heterointerfaces. For thin barrier, the <b>critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> decrease as the core radius increases, while when the barrier is thick enough, the <b>critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> show an increase with the increase of core radius conversely. This can be attributed to a competition between the lattice mismatch and strain distribution, which dominate the <b>critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> alternatively. Two <b>critical</b> quantum well thicknesses are obtained in the nanowire core-multishell heterostructure. Below the dislocation-free critical thickness, the structure will be coherent regardless of the barrier thickness. While above the dislocation-unavoidable thickness, dislocations are always energetically favored. In the dislocation-controllable region between the two critical thicknesses, coherent structure can be obtained via controlling the well and barrier thicknesses. The results are in good agreement with the experimental data and may serve as guidance for the design of coherent nanowire core-multishell quantum well structures and devices.|$|R

Results {{show that the}} NW core-shell structure can sufficiently reduce the strain in the shell and increase the critical shell thickness via passing the strain into the core {{as well as a}} self-releasing mechanism. After introducing a barrier to form a NW core-multishell QW heterostructure, the critical QW thickness decreases compared with a core-shell structure, suggesting an increased strain due to the lattice mismatch between the well and barrier. The lattice mismatch and strain distribution dominate the <b>critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> alternatively, resulting in a decrease of <b>critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> for thin barrier and an increase for thick barrier, with the increase of core radius.

30|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} of the <b>critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> of NW heterostructures is helpful for designing advanced nanodevices with high crystal quality and feasible dimensions. Up to date, <b>critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> for axial NW heterostructures have been studied analytically and numerically [11 – 14]. In comparison with axial heterostructures, the strain release mechanism is quite different for core-shell heterostructures. For example, the lateral stress relaxation effect, which can sufficiently reduce the strain in NW axial heterostructures, is negligible in NW core-shell heterostructures due to a large interface area [11]. Instead, the nanosized curve surface of the NW could help to release a part of strain [15]. Although experiments on NW core-shell heterostructures have been widely reported [16 – 21], theoretical work on the <b>critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> of core-shell heterostructures is still limited [22 – 25]. Particularly, the study on <b>critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> for NW core-multishell heterostructures has not been reported yet, although which is significant for achieving high-performance optoelectronic devices. In this paper, we explore the coherency limits in NW core-shell and core-multishell heterostructures by using finite-element method (FEM) based on the energy equilibrium criteria. The effect of the core radius, barrier thickness, and lattice mismatch on the critical QW thickness is discussed and the design criteria for dislocation-free heterostructures are revealed. The theoretical results agree well with previously reported experimental values.|$|R

50|$|The non-critical string is not {{formulated}} {{with the}} <b>critical</b> <b>dimension,</b> but nonetheless has vanishing Weyl anomaly. A worldsheet theory {{with the correct}} central charge can be constructed by introducing a non-trivial target space, commonly by giving an expectation value to the dilaton which varies linearly along some spacetime direction. For this reason non-critical string theory is sometimes called the linear dilaton theory. Since the dilaton {{is related to the}} string coupling constant, this theory contains a region where the coupling is weak (and so perturbation theory is valid) and another region where the theory is strongly coupled. For dilaton varying along a spacelike direction, the dimension of the theory is less than the <b>critical</b> <b>dimension</b> and so the theory is termed subcritical. For dilaton varying along a timelike direction, the dimension is greater than the <b>critical</b> <b>dimension</b> and the theory is termed supercritical. The dilaton can also vary along a lightlike direction, in which case the dimension is equal to the <b>critical</b> <b>dimension</b> and the theory is a critical string theory.|$|E
