500|$|<b>Cott</b> was a protege of John Graham Kerr who had quarrelled with Norman Wilkinson in the First World War about dazzle {{camouflage}} for ships. Wilkinson remained {{influential in}} 1939 as an inspector of camouflage, so a political argument developed. <b>Cott</b> {{was invited to}} camouflage a 12-inch rail-mounted gun, alongside a similar gun camouflaged conventionally. <b>Cott</b> carefully combined disruptive contrast {{to break up the}} gun barrel's outlines with countershading to flatten out its appearance as a solid cylinder. The guns were then photographed from the air from various angles, and in Peter Forbes's view [...] "the results were remarkable." [...] <b>Cott's</b> gun is [...] "invisible except to the most minute scrutiny by someone who knows exactly where to look and what to look for. The other gun is always highly visible." [...] The authorities hesitated, appearing to be embarrassed by the evidence that <b>Cott</b> was right, and argued that countershading would be too difficult to use as an expert zoologist would be needed to supervise every installation. <b>Cott</b> was posted to the Middle East, and Kerr unsuccessfully intervened, pleading for guns to be painted <b>Cott's</b> way and <b>Cott</b> to be brought home.|$|R
