40|$|THE vascularization of {{the optic}} {{radiation}} {{and the visual}} cortex has been studied in 27 normal hemispheres obtained from sixteen subjects aged 41 to 73 years. The following techniques were used: (1) Injection of 33 per cent. Indian ink into the anterior choroidal, middle cerebral, and posterior cerebral artery, {{at a rate of}} 2 ml. /min.; after dissection the degree of filling was determined according to blackness in frontal, transverse, and sagittal sections. (2) Injection of Thorotrast with Paton blue at the rate of 2 ml. / 3 min.; the degree of filling was determined according to blueness, followed by microradiography. (3) Injection of Thorotrast only, followed by microradiography. I. ANATOMY OF THE OPTIC RADIATION AND OF THE <b>CORTICAL</b> <b>VISUAL</b> <b>CENTRE</b> (Fig. 1, opposite) The anatomy of the regions studied was detailed according to a somewhat new concept, before the vascularization as such was examined. (A) Optic Radiation (1) The optic radiation originates from the carrefour (cross roads) where we find: (a) The termination of the optic tract. (b) The external geniculate body, the primary ganglionic optic centre, from which the Henschen tract arises to form, with fibres of the pulvinar, the optic radiation. (c) The beginning of the optic radiation itself. (d) The Wernicke field-a triangular formation pointing upwards, capping the external geniculate body (Foix and Masson, 1923; Schiff-Wertheimer, 1926). The fibres of the optic radiation and those of the Wernicke field build up an intertwined pattern. The fibres of the optic radiation are directed out-wards to the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, crossing fibres which extend from the temporal region to the thalamus (Arnold's bundle). * Received for publication July 28, 1958...|$|E

40|$|Background: Visual loss {{associated}} with thoracic surgery {{has been reported}} mostly after coronary angiography or bypass surgery. The position of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is usually lateral, thus not compressive to the globe. Visual loss after VATS has not been reported. Herein we report a patient without any cardiovascular risk factors who experienced transient cortical blindness after an uneventful VATS. Case presentation: A 40 -year-old man noticed a visual loss at the recovery room after VATS. He showed normal pupillary reflex, normal optic disc appearance, and homonymous hemianopia respecting the vertical meridian, thus was typical for <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> impairment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aetiology}} {{of visual}} hallucinations is poorly understood in dementia with Lewy bodies. Pathological alterations in <b>visual</b> <b>cortical</b> excitability {{may be one}} contributory mechanism. AIMS: To determine <b>visual</b> <b>cortical</b> excitability in people with dementia with Lewy bodies compared with aged-matched controls and also the relationship between <b>visual</b> <b>cortical</b> excitability and <b>visual</b> hallucinations in dementia with Lewy bodies. METHOD: <b>Visual</b> <b>cortical</b> excitability was determined by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the occiput to elicit phosphenes (transient subjective visual responses) in 21 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and 19 age-matched controls. RESULTS: Phosphene parameters were similar between both groups. However, in the patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, TMS measures of <b>visual</b> <b>cortical</b> excitability correlated strongly with the severity of visual hallucinations (P = 0. 005). Six patients with dementia with Lewy bodies experienced visual hallucination-like phosphenes (for example, seeing people or figures on stimulation) compared {{with none of the}} controls (P = 0. 02).

40|$|Both dorsal and ventral <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> streams contain neurons {{sensitive}} to binocular disparities, {{but the two}} streams may underlie different aspects of stereoscopic vision. Here we investigate stereopsis in the neurological patient D. F., whose ventral stream, specifically lateral occipital cortex, has been damaged bilaterally, causing profound visual form agnosia. Despite her severe damage to <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> areas, we report that DF's stereo vision is strikingly unimpaired. She is better than many control observers at using binocular disparity to judge whether an isolated object appears near or far, and to resolve ambiguous structure-from-motion. DF is, however, poor at using relative disparity between features at different locations across the visual field. This may stem from a difficulty in identifying the surface boundaries where relative disparity is available. We suggest that the ventral processing stream may {{play a critical role}} in enabling healthy observers to extract fine depth information from relative disparities within one surface or between surfaces located in different parts of the visual field. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: While basic visual {{functions}} {{have been}} described in subjects with congenital achromatopsia (ACHM), {{little is known about}} their mid- or high-level <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> processing. We compared midlevel <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> processing in ACHM subjects (n = 11) and controls (n = 20). Methods: Abilities to detect global form, global motion, and biological motion embedded in noise were tested across a range of light levels, including scotopic, in which both ACHM subjects and controls must rely on rods. Contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs) were also measured. Results: Achromatopsia subjects showed differential impairments across tests. In scotopic conditions, global form was most impaired, while biological motion was normal. In a subset of three ACHM subjects with normal scotopic CSFs, two of the three showed global form perception worse than controls; all showed global motion comparable to controls; and strikingly, two of the three showed biological motion perception superior to controls. Conclusions: The cone signal appears to {{play a crucial role in}} the development of perception of global form, as in ACHM this is impaired even in scotopic conditions, in which controls also have to rely on rods, and even in ACHM subjects with no scotopic spatial vision loss. In contrast, the rod signal appears sufficient for the development of normal (or even superior) extrastriate biological motion perception. These results suggest that ACHM leads to atypical development of cortical vision, highlighting the need to better understand the potential for further reorganization of <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> processing following new therapies aimed at restoring cone function...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a 'motion blind' patient {{on a series of}} tasks in which the perception of motion played an essential or no role was compared with that of a human subject with normal vision and with that of macaque monkeys in which <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> area MT had been removed and adjacent areas damaged. The patient experienced difficulties on those tasks in which the perception of motion was essential, but was unimpaired on those tasks that did not require it. Similarly, the tasks which the 'motion blind' patient found impossible or difficult were precisely those tasks on which monkeys lacking area MT performed poorly. Similarly, the tasks on which the patient performed well also presented no difficulties for the animals lacking cortical area MT. The close correlation between the pattern of visual perceptual impairments in the patient and monkeys indicates that the patient's inability to perceive most forms of visual movement is attributable to total loss of, or extensive damage to, a <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> area that is the human equivalent of area MT and perhaps its adjacent areas...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{cortical}} activity [...] {{the ongoing}} cortical activities in absence of intentional sensory input [...] {{is considered to}} {{play a vital role}} in many aspects of both normal brain functions and mental dysfunctions. We present a centered Gaussian-binary Deep Boltzmann Machine (GDBM) for modeling the activity in early <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> areas and relate the random sampling in GDBMs to the spontaneous cortical activity. After training the proposed model on natural image patches, we show that the samples collected from the model's probability distribution encompass similar activity patterns as found in the spontaneous activity. Specifically, filters having the same orientation preference tend to be active together during random sampling. Our work demonstrates the centered GDBM is a meaningful model approach for basic receptive field properties and the emergence of spontaneous activity patterns in early <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> areas. Besides, we show empirically that centered GDBMs do not suffer from the difficulties during training as GDBMs do and can be properly trained without the layer-wise pretraining.

The plaids have been selected so that the plaid components move in one of the directions and the plaid pattern moves in the other direction. In addition to correctly responding to the pattern motion, observers demonstrate their ability to correctly extract the movement (and therefore the orientation) of the underlying components at specific spatial frequencies. We wanted to test CEMIT by seeing if we could replicate the broader tuning observed at low spatial frequencies for this type of plaid. Results from CEMIT were robust and successfully replicated this result for 50 typical observers.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the ability of color and motion to elicit and maintain visual attention {{in a sample of}} children with <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> impairment (CVI). It found that colorful and moving objects may be used to engage children with CVI, increase their motivation to use their residual vision, and promote visual learning.

40|$|The {{motion of}} an object (such as a wheel rotating) is seen as {{consistent}} independent of its position and size on the retina. Neurons in higher <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> areas respond to these global motion stimuli invariantly, but neurons in early cortical areas with small receptive fields cannot represent this motion, {{not only because of}} the aperture problem but also because they do not have invariant representations. In a unifying hypothesis with the design of the ventral <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> system, we propose that the dorsal visual system uses a hierarchical feedforward network architecture (V 1, V 2, MT, MSTd, parietal cortex) with training of the connections with a short-term memory trace associative synaptic modification rule to capture what is invariant at each stage. Simulations show that the proposal is computationally feasible, in that invariant representations of the motion flow fields produced by objects self-organize in the later layers of the architecture. The model produces invariant representations of the motion flow fields produced by global in-plane motion {{of an object}}, in-plane rotational motion, looming versus receding of the object, and object-based rotation about a principal axis. Thus, the dorsal and ventral visual systems may share some similar computational principles. ...|$|R
