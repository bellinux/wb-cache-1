40|$|The gas-particle {{partitioning}} of {{the primary}} organic aerosol (POA) emissions from fifty-one light-duty gasoline vehicles (model years 1987 – 2012) was investigated at the California Air Resources Board Haagen–Smit Laboratory. Each vehicle was operated over the cold-start unified cycle on a chassis dynamometer and its emissions were sampled using a <b>constant</b> <b>volume</b> <b>sampler.</b> Four independent yet complementary approaches were used to investigate POA gas-particle partitioning: sampling artifact correction of quartz filter data, dilution from the <b>constant</b> <b>volume</b> <b>sampler</b> into a portable environmental chamber, heating in a thermodenuder, and thermal desorption/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of quartz filter samples. This combination of techniques allowed gas-particle partitioning {{measurements to be made}} across a wide range of atmospherically relevant conditions – temperatures of 25 – 100 °C and organic aerosol concentrations of− 3. The gas-particle partitioning of the POA emissions varied continuously over this entire range of conditions and essentially none of the POA should be considered non-volatile. Furthermore, for most vehicles, the low levels of dilution used in the <b>constant</b> <b>volume</b> <b>sampler</b> created particle mass concentrations that were greater than a factor of 10 or higher than typical ambient levels. This resulted in large and systematic partitioning biases in the POA emission factors compared to more dilute atmospheric conditions, as the POA emission rates may be over-estimated by nearly a factor of four due to gas-particle partitioning at higher particle mass concentrations. A volatility distribution was derived to quantitatively describe the measured gas-particle partitioning data using absorptive partitioning theory. Although the POA emission factors varied by more than two orders of magnitude across the test fleet, the vehicle-to-vehicle differences in gas-particle partitioning were modest. Therefore, a single volatility distribution can be used to quantitatively describe the gas-particle partitioning of the entire test fleet. This distribution is designed to be applied to quartz filter POA emission factors in order to update emissions inventories for use in chemical transport models...|$|E

The instruments used during the intercomparison allowed online measurements of these compounds directly from the diluted exhaust. Measurements were done either in real time or immediately after the test. The measurement and analysis of exhaust emissions over the world-harmonized light-duty vehicle test cycle was done by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-Qi-ToF-MS), photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) and gas chromatography (GC). Results showed that online systems can perform measurements from the vehicle diluted exhaust assuring a good repeatability (within instrument variance) and reproducibility (between instrument variance) of the results.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of hydrogen {{is one of}} the most important parameters in liquid aluminum processing because it is responsible for gas porosity which affects casing quality, ie. pressure tightness, mechanical properties etc. In order to gain optimum quality, the amount of hydrogen dissolved in liquid aluminum must be known prior to casting. This has led to the development of several techniques to quantify hydrogen in liquid aluminum. Among these is the Reduced Pressure Test (RPT). The RPT is simple, very inexpensive and commonly used in aluminum foundries to obtain a qualitative evaluation of the melt hydrogen level. In this thesis the development of the RPT to a truly quantitative level is discussed. This includes redesigning of the steel mold and the application of a riser. The mold was redesigned to improve the test sensitivity while a CO$ sb 2 $-bonded sand riser was applied in order to eliminate volumetric shrinkage and ensure a <b>constant</b> <b>volume</b> <b>sample.</b> As the <b>sample</b> has a <b>constant</b> <b>volume,</b> either the <b>sample</b> weight or density can be used to quantify the hydrogen content. The simplest technique is to use the sample weight. Several parameters that affect the test sensitivity and reproducibility were studied, such as chamber pressure, amount of inclusions, pouring temperature, and mold temperature. It was found that there are two important parameters that strongly affect the test; chamber pressure and amount of inclusions. The lower the chamber pressure the better the test sensitivity but the poorer the test reproducibility. Increasing the amount of inclusions improves the test sensitivity. The <b>constant</b> <b>volume</b> <b>sample</b> can be used to predict the amount of hydrogen in the melt for various types of alloys including 319, 356, 357 and 413 within a reasonable margin of error.

40|$|The <b>constant</b> <b>volume</b> <b>sampling</b> (CVS) {{method has}} been used to support vehicle {{emissions}} testing for over 25 years and the ‘bag’ measurement of emissions is the key method that is used for legislative purposes. Bag measurements provide a single figure for CO, CO 2, and NOx emissions species for the complete drive cycle, but provide no information on the profile throughout the test. Instantaneous emissions measurements undertaken on a second-by-second basis are carried out to assess catalyst and engine system performance. The key measurement for this approach is the determination of the instantaneous exhaust mass flowrate, which allows the instantaneous gravimetric emissions to be calculated. Being able to accurately measure instantaneous emissions carries its own challenges, but the mixing effects in the CVS system when using the CO 2 tracer technique have been shown to compromise significantly the capability to determine exhaust volume flowrates accurately. The predicted time responses of dilute CO 2 concentration, and the resulting over-underestimate of tailpipe volume flow, display adequate agreement with experimental results.

Heavy-duty engine certification can be done either from the CVS or from a partial flow dilution system (PFDS).

NO, emissions followed a decreasing trend over both cycles, where the most beneficial reduction was obtained with the application of the more saturated biodiesel. PM emissions were decreased with the palm-based biodiesel blends over both cycles, {{with the exception of the}} 20 % blend which was higher compared to diesel fuel. PME blends led to increases in PM emissions over the ADC. The majority of the biodiesel blends showed a tendency for lower CO and HC emissions. The differences in CO 2 emissions were not statistically significant. Fuel consumption presented an increase with both biodiesels. Total PAH and nitro-PAH emission levels were decreased with the use of biodiesel independently of the source material. Lower molecular weight PAHs were predominant in both gaseous and particulate phases. Both biodiesels had a negative impact on certain carbonyl emissions. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the dominant aldehydes emitted from both fuels. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

To {{determine the effects of}} blended fuels on the emission factors, several test fuels were used: gasoline, E 10 (10 % of ethanol, by volume), diesel, B 5, B 30 (5 % and 30 % of biodiesel or FAME) and HVO (pure Hydrotreated or Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil). These tests were performed on a chassis dynamometer with <b>constant</b> <b>volume</b> <b>sampling</b> (CVS). The sampling of compounds was made using dedicated Carbotrap and Tenax cartridges, analysed by GC-FID and GC-MS respectively. Carbonyl compounds were sampled on DNPH-coated cartridges and analysed by UVHPLC. The emission factors of individual pollutants were determined, especially of 1, 3 -butadiene, benzene, and formaldehyde, which are recognized as genotoxic carcinogens. Detailed speciation of the emissions shows changes with the composition of the biofuel in the levels of hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds and carbonyls present in diesel and gasoline engine exhaust gases. This evolution of the emission factors for the different compound families is compared to the results obtained in previous studies, where the influence of driving cycles, technology and type of fuels were evaluated (Caplain et al, 2006). In the framework of this study, the first results show that an addition of ethanol in the unleaded gasoline leads to a decrease of the emissions of aromatics especially of benzene and an increase of the 1, 3 -butadiene emission. An increase of aromatics emissions but no specific trend for carbonyl compounds emission factors was observed when partially substituting biodiesel to diesel. Pure HVO leads to higher carbonyl emissions than pure or substituted diesel fuel...|$|R

40|$|Exhaust {{emissions}} of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) from passenger vehicles are usually estimated {{only for the}} particle phase via the total particulate matter measurements. However, {{they also need to}} be estimated for the gas phase, as they are semi-volatile. To better estimate SVOC emission factors of passenger vehicles, a measurement campaign using a chassis dynamometer was conducted with different instruments: (1) a <b>constant</b> <b>volume</b> <b>sampling</b> (CVS) system in which emissions were diluted with filtered air and sampling was performed on filters and polyurethane foams (PUF) and (2) a Dekati Fine Particle Sampler (FPS) in which emissions were diluted with purified air and sampled with on-line instruments (PTR-ToF-MS, HR-ToF-AMS, MAAP, CPC). Significant differences in the concentrations of organic carbon (OC) measured by the instruments are observed. The differences can be explained by sampling artefacts, differences between (1) the time elapsed during sampling (in the case of filter and PUF sampling) and (2) the time elapsed from emission to measurement (in the case of on-line instruments), which vary from a few seconds to 15 min, and by the different dilution factors. To relate elapsed times and measured concentrations of OC, the condensation of SVOC between the gas and particle phases is simulated with a dynamic aerosol model. The simulation results allow us to understand the relation between elapsed times and concentrations in the gas and particle phases. They indicate that the characteristic times to reach thermodynamic equilibrium between gas and particle phases may be as long as 8 min. Therefore, if the elapsed time is less than this characteristic time to reach equilibrium, gasphase SVOC are not at equilibriumwith the particle phase and a larger fraction of emitted SVOC will be in the gas phase than estimated by equilibrium theory, leading to an underestimation of emitted OC if only the particle phase is considered or if the gas-phase SVOC are estimated by equilibrium theory. Current European emission inventories for passenger cars do not yet estimate gas-phase SVOC emissions, although they may represent 60 % of total emitted SVOC (gas þ particle phases) ...|$|R
40|$|The need {{of better}} {{understanding}} and further {{improvement of the}} operation of modern low emission vehicles has drawn the attention on fast response time resolved emission measurements. The <b>Constant</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>Sampling</b> system (CVS), which is the main setup described by the European Union legislation for the sampling, dilution and measurement of motor vehicle tailpipe emissions over a certain driving cycle, can provide such data. The time resolution of the recorded data though is low due to design limitations of such systems. Transport delays in tubes, mixing and dispersion phenomena etc. are responsible for smoothening and distortion of the original emission signal. Aim of the current thesis {{is to develop a}} model to compensate for all these distortion sources, by taking into account the dynamic behaviour of the system. The problem was approached with purely mathematical tools derived from system theory. The CVS system was approached as a combination of different subsystems in series, that were individually modelled due to the specific design and flow characteristics of each. The parameters of each subsystem were estimated using measurements of the subsystem response to known and controlled artificial emission step inputs. The model of each subsystem was inverted and a specifically designed filter was applied to compensate for the noise of the inverted signal. The final model was designed such as to be applicable to already available or future measurements performed on the modelled setup. The model is also applicable on similar exhaust gas sampling and measurement setups with the need of specific system parameter identification measurements. The performance of the final model was evaluated compared against a sophisticated ultra fast response analyzer over a transient driving cycle. The model was proven to be able to reproduce the original signal with high accuracy. Furthermore, applications of the model on measurement devices that are used in series or parallel to the CVS setup were also presented. The methodology was able to reveal phenomena related to gaseous and particulate emission measurements that could not be revealed due to the limited time resolution of the original measurement output. ...|$|R

40|$|Particulate {{emissions}} cause {{adverse health}} effects {{and for this reason}} they are regulated since the 80 s. Vehicle regulations cover particulate emission measurements of a model before its sale, known as type approval or homologation. For heavy-duty engines the emissions are measured on an engine dynamometer with steady state points and transient cycles. For light-duty vehicles (i. e. the full power train) the particulate emissions are assessed on a chassis dynamometer. The measurement of particulate emissions is conducted either by diluting the whole exhaust in a dilution tunnel with <b>constant</b> <b>volume</b> <b>sampling</b> or by extracting a small proportional part of the exhaust gas and diluting it. Particulate emissions are measured by passing part of the diluted exhaust aerosol through a filter paper. The increase of the weight of the filter is used to calculate the particulate matter mass (PM) emissions. Vehicles are also checked during the course of their lives, i. e. those pulled over by authorities for roadside checks or the mandatory periodic inspection in a garage. In this case smoke is assessed with free acceleration tests. However, all these tests do not give any relevant information about the emissions of the vehicles during real driving conditions. This was only recently regulated. The particulate emissions on the road are measured with portable emission measurement systems (PEMS). The particulate emissions of newer vehicles decreased by more than two orders of magnitude since the 80 s. The particulate measurement methods reached their detection limit and for this reason the particle number (PN) concentration was introduced in the European Union legislation as a new metric. In this paper a short summary of the particulate emission legislation of vehicles over the years is given. Then the instrumentation that has been used and is currently being used, like gravimetric filter measurement, is explained. In addition, other popular methods and instruments are analyzed, like chemical analysis of filters, light extinction, scattering and absorption instruments, electrical mobility and particle counting instruments. Correlation of the different instruments is discussed for different vehicle emission levels. Predictions for future instruments for low emission vehicles are given. JRC.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the mechanisms whereby the molecules responsible for sensory stimuli are released in the mouth, the aim {{of this study was to}} characterise and predict the spreading of semi-solid dairy products between tongue and palate using four complementary approaches, namely sensory analysis, instrumental measurement and analytical and numerical modelling. The products studied were dairy gels, whose physical representation is a yield-stress fluid. In the instrumental approach, spreading in mouth was simulated by a test in which a <b>constant</b> <b>volume</b> of <b>sample</b> was squeezed between two plates. It was performed in two phases, the first phase with a prescribed speed and the second with a prescribed force. The influence of product rheology, interface conditions, forces involved and kinematics of displacement on spreading area were studied by combining the instrumental and modelling approaches. For the dairy gels studied in this work, the consistency K was the most influent parameter on the spreading area. Also worth noting were the good correlations between the results obtained by the sensory, instrumental and modelling approaches. The approach adopted in this study could be used to predict spreading in the mouth of food products or boluses with a rheological behaviour of the yield-stress fluid type. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
