Information from {{an assessment of the}} creditworthiness of an enterprise is the same case. But the requisite holism is much less easy to attain than one-sidedness. Therefore this contribution explains <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> and puts it in the shade of our version of systems thinking. We find that it is in line with the basic effort of Ludwig von Bertalanffy, the father of the General Systems Theory, which was to fight the exaggerated specialisation [3] because it causes a dangerous one-sidedness. A worthwhile <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> is based on a dialectical system of viewpoints rather than on the financial ones only, in order to provide a requisitely holistic information, hence a requisitely reliable decision-making and resulting action...|$|E

40|$|Financial {{institutions}} are often reluctant to lend to smaller entrepreneurs due to perceived information asymmetry {{and lack of}} available collateral. At the nascent and new entrepreneurial levels, it is generally more difficult for loan applicants to provide the information required to secure the necessary funds.

40|$|In {{the last}} 30 - 40 years multicriteria-based {{approaches}} have been strongly applied to financial decision-making problems. The contributions that use multicriteria methodologies {{in order to}} evaluate the creditworthiness of debtors and loan applicants belong to this research field and mainly refer to applications of UTADIS and ELECTRE methods. In this paper authors themselves propose a deterministic approach for creditworthiness evaluation based on the multicriteria method known as MURAME, which has been applied {{for the first time}} to <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> problems by the authors themselves. The MURAME-based approach proposed by the authors is articulated in two phases: a rating assignment phase, and a rating quantification phase. The first one is mainly devoted to determine the debtors’ rating classes, whereas the second phase allows to obtain estimates of the probabilities of default and of transition, and permits to calculate quantities providing further information about the (cardinal) rating and the (ordinal) ranking of the debtors’ credit quality.

40|$|Rating {{models have}} irreplaceable role in each credit appraisal. The {{intention}} {{of this article}} is to present development of rating model methodology used for assessment of creditworthiness for businesses. The reliability of the rating model depends largely on the quality of the rating model development, which is very complicated. Prior to rating model development, it is necessary to define rating segments and methods in use. The development itself starts with generating of the data sets, which is used in the next step for development of rating function using selected method. The whole process is closed up with the transformation of scoring values into the probability of default which is an important requirement according to Basel II. Proposed rating model then goes through validation process. It is very important to pay attention to each phase of rating model development, while failing in any way would have essential impact on suitability of given rating model for <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> of businesses.

40|$|The article {{provides}} an overview of instant-loan-related regulation and associated topical problems in Finland. Instant loans are a problematic loan product, and they account for a remarkable proportion of all indebtedness problems of consumers. One factor here is that instant loans are provided by credit companies outside the banking sector. Finland has adopted responsible lending regulations, on good lending practice, a <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> obligation, and identity verification. Consumer lending is a business subject to licence. Also, credit costs and debt-collection costs are regulated, and usury in connection with credit is criminalised by the law. Furthermore, credit-data regulation plays a significant role in consumer lending. The new laws seem to have solved some of the problems, but new problems have emerged. Most significantly, regulation pertaining to a maximum annual percentage rate of charge has caused some decrease in instant loans’ numbers and amounts, but, meanwhile, average repayment periods have increased and more complex loan products have emerged. Other noteworthy topical issues in this connection include the multi-layered system for supervision of consumer creditors and the lack of provisions regarding the financial reliability of consumer creditors...|$|E
40|$|The central {{thesis of}} this {{dissertation}} is that efficient pre-agreement assessment {{is a primary}} and effective means of preventing reckless or irresponsible lending {{which is one of}} the root causes of consumer over-indebtedness. Accordingly an examination of best practices in pre-agreement assessment of credit consumers with a view to preventing reckless lending and the resultant over-indebtedness is paramount to engaging in a meaningful discourse on the role of pre-agreement assessment in a responsible lending regime and desirable scope and extent of such assessment so as not to have a too paternalistic ?Nanny-style? mode of regulation that stifles the credit market and puts access to credit out of reach of many consumers. The 2012 Financial Stability Board Principles for Sound Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and the 2013 World Bank Report on Responsible Lending is used to provide a framework of what would constitute broad best practices in the context of pre-agreement assessment as a responsible lending practice focused on the prevention of consumer over-indebtedness. A discussion is provided of the EU approach to <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> as set out in the 2008 Consumer Credit Directive and the very recent and more progressive 2014 Mortgage Credit Directive as it is submitted that especially the 2014 Mortgage Credit Directive provides a good example of <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> trends that are aligned with the observations made in this regard by the World Bank and Financial Stability Board as international standard setting bodies. On the African continent South Africa can be regarded as a developing jurisdiction that has made significant strides in establishing a well-regulated credit market by introducing a comprehensive legislative framework for credit regulation in 2007 by means of the National Credit Act (NCA) 1. This piece of legislation has introduced the novel concepts of ?over-indebtedness? and ?reckless credit? into South African law and makes extensive provision for debt relief to over-indebted credit consumers. The dissertation examines the evolution of pre-agreement assessment in terms of the South African National Credit Act in detail and also comments on some challenges to proper pre-agreement assessment. Chapter 4 examines the progress made in Lesotho in the context of pre-agreement assessment, remarking that a major drawback in this regard is the lack of a comprehensive legislative framework for credit regulation. Ultimately best practices are extracted from the discussion in Chapter 2 to benchmark the pre-agreement procedure mandated in the South African National Credit Act 34 of 2005. The dissertation further considers any insights for Lesotho on whether it is appropriate to follow the South African example, given that it appears to follow in the footsteps of South Africa insofar as its endeavours to address reckless lending through pre-agreement assessment is concerned.

40|$|In banks/enterprises {{relations}} a {{key role}} is played by Basel II Framework, which accurately correlates banks’ capital requirement to risks, thanks to a more precise <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> (Tarantola, 2008). The containment of risks inherent in bank financing {{can be carried out}} ex ante, through an adequate screening, which allows the proper assessment of enterprises’ economic and financial situation and a sound composition of the total loan portfolio, and ex post, through guarantees, which allow to benefit from a loss reduction only after insolvency has occurred (Boot et al., 1991; Erzegovesi, 2007, 2008; Gai, 2005, 2006; Malinconico, 2008; Stiglitz, Weiss, 1981, 1986). From this perspective, Basel II Framework brings important changes, since life insurance and surety policy are “eligible” guarantees for Credit Risk Mitigation. Nevertheless, banks could offer a better pricing to borrowers not because they are less risky, but because the whole operation would need a lower capital requirement. Therefore, corporate risks reduction – which would allow, in the absence of credit rationing, a more profitable debt capacity – is necessarily achieved through an appropriate “umbrella insurance”, able to cope with both direct and indirect loss. The “therapeutic” capacities of such coverages lead to a synallagmatic relation between corporate insurance purchases and increase in enterprises’ creditworthiness, since enterprises’ risk management decreases their overall riskiness and improves their creditworthiness (Mayers, Smith, 1982; Thakor, 1982; Davidson et al., 1992; Zou, Adams, 2008, 2009; Ania, 2010) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role and}} operations of consumer Credit Bureaus in the European Union {{in the context of}} the economic theories, policies and law within which they work. Across Europe there is no common practice of sharing the credit data of consumers which can be used for several purposes. Mostly, they are used by the lending industry as a practice of <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> or as a risk-management tool to underwrite borrowing decisions or price risk. However, the type, breath, and depth of information differ greatly from country to country. In some Member States, consumer data are part of a broader information centralisation system for the prudential supervision of banks and the financial system as a whole. Despite EU rules on credit to consumers for the creation of the internal market, the underlying consumer data infrastructure remains fragmented at national level, failing to achieve univocal, common, or defined policy objectives under a harmonised legal framework. Likewise, the establishment of the Banking Union and the prudential supervision of the Euro area demand standardisation and convergence of the data used to measure debt levels, arrears, and delinquencies. The many functions and usages of credit data suggest that the policy goals to be achieved should inform the legal and institutional framework of Credit Bureaus, as well as the design and use of the databases. This is also because fundamental rights and consumer protection concerns arise from the sharing of credit data and their expanding use...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} {{examines}} the features that determine the attractivenessof bonds as a financing instrument for real estate development projects in Poland, and the share of debt securities and bonds in the financing structure of real estate development companies. The implementation of such a formulated purpose required the application of methods of statistical description. Research {{was conducted on the}} basis of data from the statistics made by Fitch Ratings Polska, Catalyst, Narodowy Bank Polski, Zwia;zek Bank 3 w Polskich and the financial statements of bond issuers. The basic research period covers the years 1998 - 2012. However, {{due to the lack of}} published data about the structure of financing of development companies, interest rates, the nominal value, the bond structure by the buyers, the type, the purpose of issuance and the form of security, long-term studies were reduced to shorter periods. Results of the research indicate that the corporate bond market of development companies was in the phase of intensive growth in 2004 - 2012. Availability of funds obtained through the issuance of bonds increased by the establishment of appropriate infrastructure in 2009. The downturn in the real estate market initiated a series of structural changes in the financing of development companies in 2008 - 2009. High margins and restrictive <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> brought on a search for alternative sources of financing. Due to restrictions imposed by the Act of 29 th April 2012 on the protection of the buyer of a dwelling or a single-family-house, it became important to provide flexible funding sources for development projects, including bond issuances...|$|E

40|$|The paper's {{intention}} is to present the functionality of the scoring and rating models approved by the New Capital Agreement and the Capital Requirements Directive {{in the context of}} credit risk management. The know-how transfers initiated the process of superseding the traditional credit risk assessment methods by new methods. The scoring and rating models are being successfully used by foreign banking institutions. A synthesis of views on credit risk assessment methods (credit scoring and credit rating) also results from many advantages that occur as well {{on the side of the}} banking institutions as on the side of their clients. The credit scoring and credit rating models automatize the banking credit procedures by providing an objective assessment of all the credit applications. In addition, standardized scoring and rating models reduce the costs related to the credit applications analysis. The existing interest in modem methods of credit risk quantification in the period of implementing the NCA/CRD inspired the author to formulate the thesis that the scoring and rating models would continue to enjoy interest on the part of the domestic banking institutions (i. e. co-operative banks). The complicated procedures of determining the capital adequacy prescribed by the CRD will make a stimulus to implementation of the models in question by the financial institutions that have hitherto been using traditional <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> methods, because the new methods simplify and accelerate the analysis of credit applications and have been included in the framework of admitted credit risk quantification methods for internal ratings. The universal functionality of scoring and rating makes the models more and more popular and demanded. In the long run, automation of processes and an elastic offer adapted to the client's profile will decide on the financial institution's competitive position. Wherever there is need for automatism and maximum objectiveness, the scoring- and rating-based assessment win most probably find new advocates. ...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{investigates the}} sub-sovereign {{financial}} market in Italy, specifically {{focusing on the}} municipal bond market and on local government credit ratings. This research aims to identify empirically the economic and financial variables which affect bond yields and credit ratings of Italian local governments, and to understand the role of such variables in explaining the differences in interest costs paid by different bond issuers (or paid by the same issuer at different times) and {{the differences in the}} rating judgments assigned by the major international rating agencies. The Italian local government finance system is characterized by the several tiers of sub-sovereign governments (regions, provinces and cities) being differently linked to the central government finances, and by the central government itself conveying a non-negligible sovereign financial risk. The three local government tiers have a different institutional nature, while cities and provinces (jointly defined as local authorities) possess a similar status and are subject to the same legislation, regions are characterized by a greater independence and by a significantly higher degree of financial autonomy. These facts should affect the investors’ evaluation of local government credit risk and, therefore, one of the aims of this research is to analyze the determinants of subsovereign bond yields and credit ratings in this institutional framework. Credit ratings are investigated under a dual perspective, beyond the analysis on the factors driving the determination of credit ratings, this research also aims to study the role played by ratings in affecting local bond yields. First, testing if the purchase of a rating is rewarded by lower yields, i. e. if rated issuers pay lower yields than their unrated peers, and then if the specific <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> assigned by rating agencies is considered by investors when they price a municipal bond, i. e. if a AAA-rated issuer pays less than a BBB-rated one.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{economic}} phase, characterized by the difficulty of firms to obtain financing, {{a key role in}} banks/enterprises relations is played by Basel II Framework, which accurately correlates banks’ capital requirement to risks, thanks to a more precise <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> (Tarantola, 2008). The containment of risks inherent in bank financing can be carried out ex ante, through an adequate screening, which allows the proper assessment of enterprises’ economic and financial situation and a sound composition of the total loan portfolio, and ex post, through guarantees, which allow to benefit from a loss reduction only after insolvency has occurred (Boot et al., 1991; Erzegovesi, 2007, 2008; Gai, 2005, 2006; Malinconico, 2000, 2008; Stiglitz, Weiss, 1981, 1986).

In the economic literature {{there is a lack of}} attention about the capability of the insurance system to favour debt capacity by enterprises. Therefore, this work aims at investigating the existence of a “virtuous” relation between corporate insurance purchases, credit risk and debt capacity.

40|$|Financing {{trade between}} {{economic}} agents located {{in different countries}} is affected by many types of risks, resulting from incomplete information about the debtor, the problems of enforcing international contracts, or the prevalence of political and financial crises. Trade is important for economic development {{and the availability of}} trade finance is essential, especially for developing countries. Relatively few studies treat the topic of political risk, particularly in the context of international lending. This thesis explores new ground to identify links between political risk and international debt defaults. The core hypothesis of the study is that the default probability of debt increases with increasing political risk in the country of the borrower. The thesis consists of three essays that support the hypothesis from different angles of the credit evaluation process. The first essay takes {{the point of view of}} an international lender assessing the credit risk of a public borrower. The second investigates <b>creditworthiness</b> <b>assessment</b> of companies. The obtained results are substantiated in the third essay that deals with an extensive political risk survey among finance professionals in developing countries. The financial instruments of core interest are export credit guaranteed debt initiated between the Export Credit Agency of Finland and buyers in 145 countries between 1975 and 2006. Default events of the foreign credit counterparts are conditioned on country-specific macroeconomic variables, corporate-specific accounting information as well as political risk indicators from various international sources. Essay 1 examines debt issued to government controlled institutions and conditions public default events on traditional macroeconomic fundamentals, in addition to selected political and institutional risk factors. Confirming previous research, the study finds country indebtedness and the GDP growth rate to be significant indicators of public default. Further, it is shown that public defaults respond to various political risk factors. However, the impact of the risk varies between countries at different stages of economic development. Essay 2 proceeds by investigating political risk factors as conveivable drivers of corporate default and uses traditional accounting variables together with new political risk indicators in the credit evaluation of private debtors. The study finds links between corporate default and leverage, as well as between corporate default and the general investment climate and measeures of conflict in the debtor country. Essay 3 concludes the thesis by offering survey evidence on the impact of political risk on debt default, as perceived and experienced by 103 finance professionals in 38 developing countries. Taken together, the results of the thesis suggest that various forms of political risk are associated with international debt defaults and continue to pose great concerns for both international creditors and borrowers in developing countries. The study provides new insights on the importance of variable selection in country risk analysis, and shows how political risk is actually perceived and experienced in the riskier, often lower income countries of the global economy...|$|E
