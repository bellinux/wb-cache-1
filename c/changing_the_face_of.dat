Prior to this appointment she had been lector in archaeology for many years, following the retirement of archaeologist G. van Hoorn in 1951 and the departure of his replacement G. H. Beyen soon after. Her initial appointment as a lecturer was for a fixed term of five years, in view of her background as an archaeologist and art historian rather than the more traditional foundation of classical philology. She published ten books and {{more than two hundred}} articles, and is credited with <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> classical archaeology in the Netherlands. She is also credited with stimulating the still nascent discipline of formal numismatic study in the Netherlands, particularly the work of Wim van Es. Her work inspired the publication of a Festschrift on the occasion of her 70th birthday, with a foreword and praise of Zadoks' work by Elizabeth Visser (1908â€“1987), the first female professor of ancient history in the Netherlands.|$|E

500|$|Kill 'Em All {{received}} critical acclaim. Bernard Doe of Metal Forces described Kill 'Em All {{as one of}} {{the fastest}} and heaviest albums ever recorded, and remarked that the album is not for the faint-hearted. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune acknowledged it as the [...] "speed metal prototype", but felt the lyrical replication of Judas Priest and the Misfits kept the album short from becoming a classic. In a retrospective review, Billboard praised Kill 'Em All for <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> popular music with its unique combination of punk and metal. AllMusic's Steve Huey called it [...] "the true birth of thrash". He praised Hetfield's highly technical rhythm guitar style and said that the band was [...] "playing with tightly controlled fury even at the most ridiculously fast tempos". Rob Kemp, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide, credited the album for consolidating the punk rock and heavy metal scenes, but felt that apart from [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] and [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth", most of the album had the band [...] "trying to look tough" [...] over enthusiastic but unfinished riff-based songs. Journalist Martin Popoff said Kill 'Em All differentiated from the debuts by Metallica's Bay Area contemporaries because the fans could identify with Hetfield's lyrics and the band's appearance. Spins Chuck Eddy considered Kill 'Em All the inception of the [...] "extreme metal mania" [...] of the early 1980s. He noted the album did not receive much critical praise {{at the time of its}} release, but said it aged well and opened the doors for the less commercially successful bands. Although McIver credits Venom's Welcome to Hell (1981) as the first thrash metal album, he acknowledged Kill 'Em All as a major influence on the flourishing American heavy metal scene. Despite its [...] "less-than-perfect" [...] production, Loudwires Jon Wiederhorn said that Kill 'Em All sounds like an [...] "influential slice of history" [...] and stands on the same level as classic albums by Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest.|$|E

2500|$|In 1748, he {{was called}} to Naples along with a team under Luigi Vanvitelli, {{to work for the}} new Bourbon King of Naples Charles III, King of the Two Sicilies.

The immediate part of the urbanistic planning involved, for example, the construction of the colossal Albergo dei Poveri with a gray stucco front extending of 354m. It was intended as a hospice to shelter 8,000 poor from all over the kingdom, (segregated by sex and age) but especially the [...] "street people" [...] of Naples, a project which was realized only in part. Fuga's final design, centered on a hexagonal church, devoted one courtyard to each of the intended social classes men, women, boys and girlseach with their separate entrance. Construction was begun in July 1751. After the departure of King Charles to take over the crown of Spain, work slowed, and when it finally ceased in 1819, three of Fuga's five courts were completed, as they may be seen today, damaged by the earthquake of 1980 and closed (Serafino).|$|E

6000|$|Technical education, in {{the strict}} sense, {{has become a}} {{necessity}} for two reasons. The old apprenticeship system has broken down, partly by [224] reason of the changed conditions of industrial life, and partly because trades have ceased to be [...] "crafts," [...] the traditional secrets whereof the master handed down to his apprentices.

60|$|While at Wilmslow (Feb. 5, 1828) Gladstone {{was taken}} to dine with the rector of Alderley--'an {{extremely}} gentlemanly and {{said to be a}} very clever man,'--afterwards {{to be known as the}} liberal and enlightened Edward Stanley, Bishop of Norwich, and father of Arthur Stanley, the famous dean. Him, on this occasion, the young Gladstone seems to have seen for the first time. Arthur Stanley was six years his junior, and there was then some idea of sending him to Eton. As it happened, he too was a pupil at Rawson's at Seaforth, and in the summer after the meeting at Alderley the two lads met again. The younger of them has described how he was invited to breakfast with William Gladstone at Seaforth House; in what grand style they breakfasted, how he devoured strawberries, swam the Newfoundland dog in the pond, looked at books and pictures, and talked to W. Gladstone 'almost all the time about all sorts of things. He is so very good-natured, and I like him very much. He talked a great deal about Eton, and said that it was a very good place for those who liked boating and Latin verses. He was very good-natured to us all the time, and lent me books to read when we went away.'[33] A few months later, as all the world knows, Stanley, happily for himself and for all of us, went not to Eton but to Rugby, where Arnold had just entered on his bold and noble task of <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> education in England.|$|E
60|$|With the remark, then, that at such {{tender age}} some naiveness of feeling and {{expression}} is excusable, I proceed to admit that, upon the whole, my previous state of existence {{was not a}} good equipment for a literary life. Perhaps I should not have used the word literary. That word presupposes an intimacy of acquaintance with letters, a turn of mind and a manner of feeling to which I dare lay no claim. I only love letters; but the love of letters does not make a literary man, any more than the love of the sea makes a seaman. And it is very possible, too, that I love the letters in the same way a literary man may love the sea he looks at from the shore--a scene of great endeavour and of great achievements <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the world, the great open way to all sorts of undiscovered countries. No, perhaps I had better say that the life at sea--and I don't mean a mere taste of it, but a good broad span of years, something that really counts as real service--is not, upon the whole, a good equipment for a writing life. God forbid, though, that I should be thought of as denying my masters of the quarter-deck. I am not capable of that sort of apostasy. I have confessed my attitude of piety towards their shades in three or four tales, and if any man on earth more than another needs to be true to himself as he hopes to be saved, it is certainly the writer of fiction.|$|E

6000|$|The abiding {{spirit of}} the child in Stevenson was seldom shown in more lively fashion than during those days of exile at Davos, where he brought a boy's eagerness, a man's intellect, a novelist's imagination, into the varied {{business}} of my holiday hours; the printing press, the toy theatre, the tin soldiers, all engaged his attention. Of these, however, the tin soldiers most took his fancy; and the war game was constantly improved and elaborated, until from {{a few hours a}} [...] "war" [...] took weeks to play, and the critical operations in the attic monopolised half our thoughts. This attic was a most chilly and dismal spot, reached by a crazy ladder, and unlit save for a single frosted window; so low at the eaves and so dark that we could seldom stand upright, nor see without a candle. Upon the attic floor a map was roughly drawn in chalks of different colours, with mountains, rivers, towns, bridges, and roads of two classes. Here we would play by the hour, with tingling fingers and stiffening knees, and an intentness, zest, and excitement that I shall never forget. The mimic battalions marched and counter-marched, changed by measured evolutions from column formation into line, with cavalry screens in front and massed supports behind, in the most approved military fashion of to-day. It was war in miniature, even to the making and destruction of bridges, the entrenching of camps, good and bad weather, with corresponding influence on the roads, siege and horse artillery proportionately slow, as compared to the speed of unimpeded foot and proportionately expensive in the upkeep; and an exacting commissariat added to the last touch of verisimilitude. Four men formed the regiment or unit, and our shots were in proportion to our units and amount of ammunition. The troops carried carts of printers' [...] "ems"--twenty [...] "ems" [...] to each cart--and for every shot taken an [...] "em" [...] had to be paid into the base, from which fresh supplies could be slowly drawn in empty carts returned for the purpose. As a large army often contained thirty regiments, consuming a cart and a half of ammunition in every engagement (not to speak of the heavy additional expense of artillery), it will be seen what an important part the commissariat played in the game, and how vital to success became the line of communication to the rear. A single cavalry brigade, if bold and lucky enough, could break the line at the weakest link, and by cutting off the sustenance of a vast army could force it to fall back in the full tide of success. A well-devised flank attack, the plucky destruction of a bridge, or the stubborn defence of a town, might each become a factor in <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the war and materially alter the course of campaigns.|$|E
