The amplitude {{was found to be}} higher at nighttime than daytime in both seasons, and the LT variations showed a good agreement with calculated LT {{variations of}} the resultant magnetic field due to a pair of field-aligned currents (FACs) and ionospheric currents produced by the FACs. The DL- and DP-component of the disturbance field of SC can be separated based on a comparison of the observed and calculated LT variations.

40|$|The lateral {{resistance}} provided by pile caps is often significant, {{and that in}} many cases the cap resistance is as large as the {{lateral resistance}} provided by the piles themselves. An artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed to study the pile cap resistance under lateral load. The model test facility was developed and the data generated from this facility were used for both training and testing of the ANN model. The observed agreement between the findings from the experimentation and the predictions indicate that the model is capable of effectively capturing the phenomenon. From the results of few full scale tests, model test and analytical studies demonstrate about the pile cap lateral resistance.

40|$|We {{directly}} {{compare the}} relative GPS scintillation levels associated with regions of enhanced plasma irregularities called auroral arcs, polar cap patches, and auroral blobs that frequently {{occur in the}} polar ionosphere. On January 13, 2013 from Ny-Ålesund, several polar cap patches were observed to exit the polar cap into the auroral oval, and were then termed auroral blobs. This gave us an unprecedented opportunity to compare the relative scintillation levels associated with these three phenomena. The blobs {{were associated with the}} strongest phase scintillation (r/), followed by patches and arcs, with r / up to 0. 6, 0. 5, and 0. 1 rad, respectively. Our observations indicate that most patches in the nightside polar cap have produced significant scintillations, but not all of them. Since the blobs are formed after patches merged into auroral regions, in space weather predictions of GPS scintillations, it will be important to enable predictions of patches exiting the polar <b>cap.</b> <b>Key</b> words.

Materials and methods. The frequency of the allele variants of 7 genes was studied in the groups of patients with pneumonia (n= 524) and healthy donors (a control group (n= 178). Results. There were are genotypes associated with predisposition to community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia (CAP and NP) : GSTM I*, CYP 1 A 1 606 T/T, ACE D/D and those associated with a higher risk for complicated CAP. There were effects of the allelic variants of the ACE gene in developing complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction, and sepsis: ACEI/I insertion homozygotes linked to survival and the alternative ACE D/D genotype to mortality.

40|$|The work {{describes}} experimental {{observations of}} enhancements in the electron {{density of the}} ionospheric F-region created by cusp/cleft particle precipitation at the dayside entry to the polar-cap convection flow. Measurements by meridian scanning photometer and all-sky camera of optical red-line emissions from aurora are used to identify latitudinally narrow bands of soft-particle precipitation responsible for structured enhancements in electron density determined from images obtained by radio tomography. Two examples are discussed in which the electron density features with size scales and magnitudes commensurate with those of patches are shown to be formed by precipitation at the entry region to the anti-sunward flow. In one case the spectrum of the incoming particles results in ionisation being created, {{for the most part}} below 250 km, so that the patch will persist only for minutes after convecting away from the auroral source region. However in a second example, {{at a time when the}} plasma density of the solar wind was particularly high, a substantial part of the particle-induced enhancement formed above 250 km. It is suggested that, with the reduced recombination loss in the upper F-region, this structure will retain form as a patch during passage in the anti-sunward flow across the polar <b>cap.</b> <b>Key</b> words.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{preliminary}} {{interpretation of the}} Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) pressure data from the first 100 Martian solar days (sols) of the Mars Science Laboratory mission. The pressure sensor is performing well and has revealed the existence of phenomena undetected by previous missions that include possible gravity waves excited by evening downslope flows, relatively dust‐free convective vortices analogous in structure to dust devils, and signatures indicative of the circulation induced by Gale Crater and its central mound. Other more familiar phenomena are also present including the thermal tides, generated by daily insolation variations, and the CO 2 cycle, driven by the condensation and sublimation of CO 2 in the polar regions. The amplitude of the thermal tides is several times larger than those seen by other landers primarily because Curiosity is located where eastward and westward tidal modes constructively interfere and also because the crater circulation amplifies the tides to some extent. During the first 100 sols tidal amplitudes generally decline, which we attribute to the waning influence of the Kelvin wave. Toward {{the end of the}} 100 sol period, tidal amplitudes abruptly increased in response to a nearby regional dust storm that did not expand to global scales. Tidal phases changed abruptly during the onset of this storm suggesting a change in the interaction between eastward and westward modes. When compared to Viking Lander 2 data, the REMS daily average pressures show no evidence yet for the 1 – 20 [*]Pa increase expected from the possible loss of CO 2 from the south polar residual <b>cap.</b> <b>Key</b> Points REMS pressure sensor is operating nominally New phenomena have been discovered Familiar phenomena have been detecte...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the expression pattern of calcium-binding proteins S 100 A 2 and S 100 A 4. We also sought to determine the prognostic value of these markers for patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods: Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect S 100 A 2 and S 100 A 4 expression in 26 tissue samples obtained during transurethral resection from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in 67 tissue samples obtained during prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy from patients with prostate carcinoma. The immunoreactivity of these proteins was stratified on a scale of 0 to 3 and was correlated with the pathologic features of prostate adenocarcinoma. Results: High expression of S 100 A 2 was observed in the tissue of patients with BPH, whereas low or no expression was observed in prostate cancer (CaP) cells. The protein level of S 100 A 4 was significantly higher in CaP than in BPH cells. The higher level of S 100 A 4 observed in CaP tissue correlated with increasing tumor grade. Conclusions: Decreased expression of S 100 A 2 and increased expression of S 100 A 4 may be important in the progression of CaP. This finding could aid in identifying aggressive CaP. The simultaneous analysis of S 100 A 2 and S 100 A 4 expression in prostate tissues may be a useful prognostic marker for <b>CaP.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: Prostatic hyperplasia; Prostatic neoplasms; S 100 A 2 protein, human; S 100 A 4 protein, human This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licens...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Only at {{the onset}} of the second year are {{children}} able to form stable word-object associations and this point marks the beginning of a protracted period of semantic language development of which we know relatively little. The present event-related potential study aims to establish whether the language-related N 400 component can be employed as an index of semantic priming in children at age 24 months. If so, the N 400 component could potentially be of great value in investigations of the organization of word meaning at an early stage in language development. To address this issue an unimodal auditory semantic priming design was used. Method: The subjects were presented for word stimuli consisting of semantically related and unrelated prime-target word pairs. In the related condition basic level words were taken from the same superordinate category (e. g. cat-horse). In the unrelated condition prime and target belonged to different superordinate categories (e. g. apple-table). The EEG was recorded with 30 silver-silverchloride electrodes attached to an elastic electrode <b>cap.</b> <b>Key</b> result: Statistical analyses revealed a significant main effect of semantic relatedness in the 600 - 800 ms interval after stimulus onset, where unrelated words were more negative than related words. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that in 24 -month-old children target words which were preceded by a semantically unrelated word elicited a broadly distributed N 400 -like effect compared to target words which were primed by a semantically related word, suggesting sensitivity to semantic relatedness in this age group. The establishment of an N 400 -like semantic priming effect in the present experiment indicates that priming studies can be used as a functional tool in investigations of word meaning in toddlers and provides an opportunity to investigate semantic memory at a very early stage in development...|$|E
40|$|The ionospheric {{signature}} of a flux transfer event (FTE) seen in EISCAT radar data {{has been used}} as the basis for a modelling study using a new numerical model of the high-latitude ionosphere developed at the University of Sheffield, UK. The evolution of structure in the high-latitude ionosphere is investigated and examined with respect to the current views of polar patch formation and development. A localized velocity enhancement, of the type associated with FTEs, is added to the plasma as it passes through the cusp. This is found to produce a region of greatly enhanced ion temperature. The new model can provide greater detail during this event as it includes anisotropic temperature calculations for the O + ions. This illustrates the uneven partitioning of the energy during an event of this type. O + ion temperatures are found to become increasingly anisotropic, with the perpendicular temperature being substantially larger than the parallel component during the velocity enhancement. The enhanced temperatures lead to an increase in the recombination rate, which results in an alteration of the ion concentrations. A region of decreased O + and increased molecular ion concentration develops in the cusp. The electron temperature is less enhanced than the ions. As the new model has an upper boundary of 10 000 km the topside can also be studied in great detail. Large upward fluxes are seen to transport plasma to higher altitudes, contributing to the alteration of the ion densities. Plasma is stored in the topside ionosphere and released several hours after the FTE has finished as the flux tube convects across the polar cap. This mechanism illustrates how concentration patches can be created on the dayside and be maintained into the nightside polar <b>cap.</b> <b>Key</b> words.
