5|$|The Eastern Catholic Churches {{share common}} {{patrimony}} and liturgical rites as their counterparts, including Eastern Orthodox and other Eastern Christian churches who {{are no longer}} in <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the Holy See. These include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East. The Eastern Catholic Churches are groups of faithful who have either never been out of <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the Holy See or who have restored <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> it at the cost of breaking <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> their associates of the same tradition.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{frequently}} accompanied {{his wife}} to church services. Third-hand reports say that he took communion, although he is usually characterized as never or rarely participating in the rite. He would regularly leave services before <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the other non-communicants (as was the custom of the day). He ceased attending at all on communion Sundays after being admonished by a rector.|$|E
5|$|In Edward's lifetime, the Church of England {{disapproved of}} {{divorced}} people remarrying in church while a former spouse was still living. The monarch {{was required to}} be in <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the Church of England, and was its nominal head or Supreme Governor. If Edward married Wallis Simpson, a divorcee who would soon have two living ex-husbands, in a civil ceremony, it would directly conflict with Church teaching and {{his role as the}} Church's ex officio head.|$|E

Days later, Hughes confirmed that the band was officially over, hinting that he would continue working with Bonham and Sherinian under a new collective name. Sherinian later joined Bonamassa's touring band, while Hughes and Bonham formed California Breed with guitarist Andrew Watt. Hughes and Bonamassa later reconciled and the band reunited in 2016, with fourth album BCCIV released in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Evangelical Missionary Church of Besançon (French: Église évangélique missionnaire de Besançon), {{formerly}} known as the Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon and The Mission, is a Christian movement established in Besançon, France, in December1963. In close <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the Protestant Federation of France, this church belongs to the Pentecostal movement and in 1969 founded the Evangelical Missionary Federation (Fédération Évangélique Missionnaire, or FEM) to gather the various Pentecostal churches it created. The assemblies, which developed very quickly throughout eastern and northern France, numbered well over 2,000 members.|$|E
5|$|There are High Church and Low Church traditions, {{and some}} Anglicans regard {{themselves}} as Anglo-Catholics, following the Tractarian movement. The monarch of the United Kingdom is the Supreme Governor of the church, which has around 26million baptised members (of whom {{the vast majority}} are not regular churchgoers). It forms part of the Anglican <b>Communion</b> <b>with</b> the Archbishop of Canterbury acting as its symbolic worldwide head. Many cathedrals and parish churches are historic buildings of significant architectural importance, such as Westminster Abbey, York Minster, Durham Cathedral, and Salisbury Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|With the English Reformation and the {{breaking}} of <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai. The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.|$|E
5|$|Following Mary's childless death, her {{half-sister}} Elizabeth {{inherited the}} throne. One {{of the most}} important concerns during Elizabeth's early reign was religion. Elizabeth could not be Roman Catholic, as that church considered her illegitimate. At the same time, she had observed the turmoil brought about by Edward's introduction of radical Protestant reforms. <b>Communion</b> <b>with</b> the Roman Catholic Church was again severed by Elizabeth. She relied primarily on her chief advisors, Sir William Cecil, as her Secretary of State, and Sir Nicholas Bacon, as the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, for direction on the matter. Chiefly she supported her father's idea of reforming the church but made some minor adjustments. In this way, Elizabeth and her advisors aimed at a church that included most opinions.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{broke from}} <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the Catholic Church, over issues {{relating}} to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, {{the roots of the}} split were more political than theological. He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism.|$|E
50|$|A notable {{aspect of}} MCC's {{theology}} is {{its position on}} homosexuality and Christianity where it fully embraces and welcomes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Indeed, the majority of members are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, with many clergy being openly LGBT. MCC fully affirms the ministry of both men and women, seeing them as equal, and the past election of Nancy Wilson as Moderator makes MCC one of {{a small number of}} <b>communions</b> <b>with</b> female senior leadership.|$|R

5|$|In the 7th and 8th centuries, {{expanding}} Muslim conquests {{following the}} advent of Islam led to an Arab domination of the Mediterranean that severed political connections between that area and northern Europe, and weakened cultural connections between Rome and the Byzantine Empire. Conflicts involving authority in the church, particularly {{the authority of the}} Bishop of Rome finally culminated in the East–West Schism in the 11th century, splitting the Church into the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Earlier splits within the Church occurred after the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Chalcedon (451). However, a few Eastern Churches remained in <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> Rome, and portions of some others established communion in the 15th century and later, forming what are called the Eastern Catholic Churches.|$|E
5|$|The second {{break from}} the kirk was also {{prompted}} by issues of patronage. Minister Thomas Gillespie (1708–74) was deposed by the General Assembly in 1752 after he refused to participate in inducting a minister to the Inverkeithing parish, since the parishioners opposed the appointment. Gillespie was joined by two other ministers and they held {{the first meeting of}} the Presbytery of Relief at Colinsburgh in Fife in 1761. While evangelical in doctrine, the Relief Church did not maintain that it was the only true church, but stated that it was still in <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the kirk and maintained contact with Episcopalians and Independents. Like the Associate Presbytery, the movement was initially small, but benefited from the Evangelical Revival of the later eighteenth century, which helped it expand rapidly.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Zoghby {{considered}} {{the issues of}} ecumenism and the schism between the Melkite Catholic and Antiochian Orthodox Churches. As he began to study both the historical roots of the separation and the modern divisions of Middle Eastern churches {{he came to the}} opinion that the schism was unjustifiable. He also began to question the domination of the so-called Uniate churches by the See of Rome. Zoghby, along with other Melkite priests in Egypt such as George Hakim and Joseph Tawil, were influenced by Father Oreste Karame, who advocated the need for the Melkite Church to return to its proper traditions and work for <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|Cathedrals {{are places}} where the Christian rituals {{particular}} to a bishop, especially ordination and enthronement, can be performed, and are structured and furnished for these purposes. Each cathedral contains {{the seat of the}} local bishop, often literally a large throne. The bishop's throne is located towards the eastern end of the cathedral, near the high altar, which is main focus of worship. On the altar is served the Eucharist, a symbolic meal of bread and wine in memory of Jesus’ last supper with his disciples. In the early Medieval period, the altar always contained, or was associated with, the relics of a saint. Sometimes the relics were held in a separate shrine, near the high altar. In this part of the church are often located the tombs of former bishops, typically arranged either side of the major shrine, so the worshipping congregation symbolically comprised the whole body of clergy of the diocese, both living and dead, in <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> their patron saint. Seats are provided for the other significant clergy of the cathedral: the dean who is the foremost priest at the cathedral, the precentor, sacristan, archdeacon and canons.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} community, was restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 census, 59.4% of the {{population}} of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were Muslim, while 3.7% of {{the population}} belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not give an answer. Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as it has been since the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier in Gaelic and Roman times. This Celtic Church was gradually joined to the Catholic hierarchy following the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by StAugustine. The established church of England is the Church of England, which left <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> Rome in the 1530s when HenryVIII was unable to annul his divorce to the aunt of the king of Spain. The church regards itself as both Catholic and Protestant.|$|E
5000|$|Communion: In the monotheistic tradition, {{religious}} ecstasy {{is usually}} associated <b>with</b> <b>communion</b> and oneness <b>with</b> God. Indeed, ecstasy {{is the primary}} vehicle {{for the type of}} prophetic visions and revelations found in the Bible. However, such experiences can also be personal mystical experiences with no significance to anyone but the person experiencing them.|$|R

5|$|By the mid-18th century, Catholicism {{had been}} reduced to the fringes of the country, {{particularly}} the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite risings and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. However, Catholic Emancipation in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, principally to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation of its fortunes. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland. Also important was Episcopalianism, which had retained supporters through the civil wars and changes of regime in the 17th century. Since most Episcopalians had given their support to the Jacobite risings in the early 18th century they suffered a decline in fortunes, but revived in the 19th as the issue of succession receded, becoming established as the Episcopal Church in Scotland in 1804, as an autonomous organisation in <b>communion</b> <b>with</b> the Church of England. Baptist, Congregationalist and Methodist churches also appeared in Scotland in the 18th century, but did not begin significant growth until the 19th century, partly because more radical and evangelical traditions already existed within the Church of Scotland and the free churches. From 1879 they were joined by the evangelical revivalism of the Salvation Army, which attempted to make major inroads in the growing urban centres.|$|E
