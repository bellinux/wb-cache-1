40|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the Bayer process for the extraction of alumina from Bauxite ore, there is a push for increasing processing temperature and caustic concentrations, which has also led to an increased concern for caustic embrittlement. In this study, the <b>caustic</b> <b>cracking</b> behaviour of steel in Bayer solutions of 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 moldm "free caustic" concentrations have been studied at different temperatures using pre-cracked circumferential notch tensile specimens.

In this paper, the corrosion resistance of {{two kinds of}} martensitic cast steels containing chromium in static 303 g/L NaOH alkaline solution at 85 ℃ was studied through polarization and potential-time curves, corrosion weight loss and corrosion morphology analysis. Experimental results showed that protection effect by passive film of cast steel containing Cr was temporary. The low carbon steel without Cr content also exhibited chemical passivity in the same solution. The corrosion mode of the tested Cr-containing cast steel was composed of active dissolving corrosion and <b>caustic</b> embrittlement <b>cracking.</b> Dissolving corrosion was the primary mechanism for the induced weight loss, while severe <b>caustic</b> embrittlement <b>cracking</b> was secondary.

40|$|In this study, {{problems}} in determining threshold {{stress intensity factor}} (KISCC) in corrosive environment for thin narrow sections have been identified and a novel technique circumferential notch tensile (CNT) has been successfully used to determine KISCC of thin sections. Although a narrow zone of steel weld was successfully tested by CNT technique, the KISCC data were not very reliable because of poor weld quality. Specimens with simulated microstructure of heat affected zone were used for determination of KISCC of heat affected zone and base metal, using CNT technique. Stress corrosion crack growth in caustic solution (30 % NaOH) at elevated temperatures (100 ºC) has been determined using this technique. CNT technique has also been successfully used to study the effect of sensitization on KISCC and crack growth rate of thin sections of solution annealed and sensitized stainless steel in 42 % MgCl 2 environment. Stress corrosion crack growth {{was found to be}} faster in sensitized stainless steel than solution annealed. In this study, effect of caustic solution chemistry on stress corrosion cracking susceptibility of carbon steel has been studied. Constant load tests with fatigue pre-cracked specimens were conducted in 10, 20, 30 and 40 % caustic concentration at different temperatures varying from 45 - 100 ºC. <b>Caustic</b> <b>cracking</b> susceptibility diagram has been verified using CNT technique. Stress corrosion crack initiation in blunt notch has also been studied in Bayer solution and plain caustic solution. Addition of impurities has significant effect on stress corrosion cracking susceptibility. Hence, constant load tests were conducted in real plant Bayer solution.

The {{effects of}} cold working and heat {{treatment}} on <b>caustic</b> stress corrosion <b>cracking</b> (SCC) of mill annealed (MA) alloy 800 M in boiling solution of 50 %NaOH+ 0. 3 %SiO 2 + 0. 3 %Na 2 S 2 O 3 were investigated {{by means of}} microstructure examination, tensile test, X-ray stress analysis, SCC testing of C-rings, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and metallo-graphy. The microstructure of alloy 800 M under tested conditions was austenite. With a strain of 25 % by cold working, the grains of alloy 800 M became longer, yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) increased, elongation (δ) decreased, residual stress and the susceptibility to SCC increased. With increasing temperature of heat treatment of alloy 800 M with cold working, the grains became bigger, residual stress, YS and UTS decreased and δ increased, the susceptibility to SCC of alloy 800 M decreased. In boiling <b>caustic</b> solution, SCC <b>cracks</b> on the surfaces of C-ring specimens polarized potentiostatically at – 20 mV/SCE initiated from pitting and propagated along grain boundaries.

The most common family of alloys include the iron (Fe) -based stainless steels, nickel (Ni) alloys and titanium (Ti) alloys. There also other corrosion resistant alloys but their family of alloys is not as large as for the three groups mentioned above. All ranges of corrosive environments {{can be found in}} the CPI, from caustic solutions to hot acidic environments, from highly reducing to highly oxidizing. Stainless steels are ubiquitous since numerous types of stainless steels exist, each type tailored for specific applications.

40|$|ASTM A 106 /B is {{commonly}} used for pressure piping in alumina refineries. Due {{to the problem of}} <b>caustic</b> <b>cracking</b> in alumina refineries, piping must be stress relieved after welding, usually through a post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) process at a temperature of 635 °C. However, multiple PWHT procedures tend to degrade the mechanical properties of steel and design standards have set limits on the length of time PWHT can be carried out before steel should be replaced. In this study, the effect of PWHT time on the properties of A 106 /B parent metal was examined, with particular emphasis on the effect on toughness. PWHT was carried out for 1, 8 and 40 hours and the results were compared with those for as-received material. Impact transition temperature and room-temperature tensile results were determined using standard tests. The reference temperature, To, was determined using ASTM E 1921 with arc-shaped tension specimens.

Peak current densities varied from 0. 3 to 3. 8 A/cm " depending on electrode potential, elec-trolyte concentration, and temperature, and initial film coverage was com-plete {{in less than}} 1 or 2 msec. The amount of corrosion accompanying passive film formation was not very sensitive to the above-mentioned electro-chemical variables, and it ranged from 1 • 10 - 3 to 5 X 10 - 3 coulombs/cme. Repassivation was facilitated by additions to the test electrolyte of the anodic dissolution product HFeO 2 -. The total corrosion up to 1 sec following straining was a strong function of potential, electrolyte concentration, and temperature, as was the quasi steady-state current density.

40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} crack (SCC) {{growth rate}} tests and analytical electron microscopy (AEM) studies were performed over {{a broad range}} of environments and heat treatments of Alloy 600. This effort was conducted to correlate bulk environmental conditions such as pH and electrochemical potential (EcP) with the morphology of the SCC crack. Development of a library of AEM morphologies formed by SCC in different environments is an important step in identifying the conditions that lead to SCC in components. Additionally, AEM examination of stress corrosion cracks formed in different environments and microstructures lends insight into the mechanism(s) of stress corrosion cracking. Testing was conducted on compact tension specimens in three environments: a mildly acidic oxidizing environment containing sulfate ions, a caustic environment containing 10 % NaOH, and hydrogenated near-neutral buffered water. Additionally, stress corrosion cracking testing of a smooth specimen was conducted in hydrogenated steam. The following heat treatments of Alloy 600 were examined: mill annealed at 980 C (near-neutral water), mill annealed at 1010 C (steam), sensitized (acid and caustic), and mill annealed + healed to homogenize the grain boundary Cr concentration (<b>caustic).</b> <b>Crack</b> growth rate (CGR) testing showed that sensitized Alloy 600 tested in the mildly acidic, oxidizing environment containing sulfate ions produced the fastest cracking ({approx} 8. 8 {micro}m/hr at 260 C), and AEM examination revealed evidence of sulfur segregation to the <b>crack</b> tip. The <b>caustic</b> environment produced slower cracking ({approx} 0. 4 {micro}m/hr at 307 C) in the mill annealed + healed heat treatment but no observed cracking in the sensitized condition. In the caustic environment, fully oxidized carbides were present in the crack wake but not ahead of the crack tip. In near-neutral buffered water at 338 C, the CGR was a function of dissolved hydrogen in the water and exhibited a maximum (0. 17 {micro}m/hr) near the transition between Ni and NiO stability. The cracks in near-neutral hydrogenated water exhibited Cr-rich spinels and NiO-type oxides but no significant oxidation of grain boundary carbides. No clear effect of dissolved hydrogen on the crack wake morphology was apparent. In hydrogenated steam testing of a smooth specimen (CGR estimated as {approx} 0. 7 {micro}m/hr at 399 C), metallic nickel nodules were evident in both the crack wake and on the specimen surface. Oxide particles having a similar size and shape to the microstructural carbides were found in the crack wake, suggesting that these particles are carbides that were oxidized by contact with the steam.

40|$|Fracture of AISI 4340 {{steel in}} {{concentrated}} sodium hydroxide solution has been {{monitored by measuring}} the coupling current that flows between the crack and the external surfaces. The results clearly demonstrate that positive current flows from the crack to the external cathodes (through the solution) during crack growth of AISI 4340 steel in concentrated (6 to 12 M) sodium hydroxide solution at 70 C. The (electron) coupling current contains periodic noise that is attributed to fracture events occurring at the crack front, with the amplitude of the noise and the mean current increasing with crack growth rate. The characteristic shape of the individual transients in the noise at lower SCC crack growth rate is a rapid drop followed by slow recovery. The form of the noise in the coupling current during SCC at high NaOH concentration (8 M and 12 M) is attributed to overlap of many cracks propagating simultaneously through micro fracture events along grain boundaries. The discrete events, which have a dimension of about 49 {micro}m, are postulated to be hydrogen induced, and the mechanism of <b>caustic</b> <b>cracking</b> of AISI 4340 steel {{is considered to be}} hydrogen embrittlement along grain boundaries. Measurement of the electrochemical noise is shown to be capable of detecting and distinguishing between uniform corrosion and stress corrosion cracking in the steel/NaOH system.

40|$|Type IV waste {{tanks were}} {{designed}} and built to store waste that does not require auxiliary cooling. Each Type IV tank is a single-shell tank constructed of a steel-lined pre-stressed concrete tank {{in the form of}} a vertical cylinder with a concrete domed roof. There are four such tanks in F-area, Tanks 17 - 20 F, and four in H-Area, Tanks 21 - 24 H. Leak sites were discovered in the liners for Tanks 19 and 20 F in the 1980 's. Although these leaks were visually observed, the investigation to determine the mechanism by which the leaks had occurred was not completed at that time. Therefore, a concern was raised that the same mechanism which caused the leak sites in the Tanks in F-area may also be operable in the H-Area tanks. Data from the construction of the tanks (i. e., certified mill test reports for the steel, no stress-relief), the service history (i. e., waste sample data, temperature data), laboratory tests on actual wastes and simulants (i. e., electrochemical testing), and the results of the visual inspections were reviewed. The following observations and conclusions were made: (1) Comparison of the compositional and microstructural features indicate that the A 212 material utilized for construction of the H-Area tanks are far more resistant to SCC than the A 285 materials used for construction of the F-Area tanks. (2) A review of the materials of construction, temperature history, service histories concluded that F-Area tanks likely failed by <b>caustic</b> stress corrosion <b>cracking.</b> (3) The environment in the F-Area tanks was more aggressive than that experienced by the H-Area tanks. (4) Based on a review of the service history, the H-Area tanks have not been exposed to an environment that would render the tanks susceptible to either nitrate stress corrosion cracking (i. e., the cause of failures in the Type I and II tanks) or <b>caustic</b> stress corrosion <b>cracking.</b> (5) Due to the very dilute and uninhibited solutions that have been stored in Tank 23 H, vapor space corrosion has occurred on some of areas of the liner.

Although directed jets or sprays of rinse flows was not recommended, methods were suggested for conserving rinse water. Drying (as well as heating and cooling) of components was again shown to be constrained mostly by individual geometry and not processing parameters.

40|$|The elastic KIII-stress {{intensity}} factor, {{characterizing the}} magnitude of the singularity occurring at the tip of a crack loaded in out-of-plane shear, was successfully determined by the experimental method of reflected caustics (P. S. Theocaris, Int. J. Mech. Sci. 23, 105 - 117 (1981)). For the determination of the elastic KIII it was assumed that the immediate vicinity of the crack tip was dominated by the elastic (- 1 2) -singular stress field. For a work-hardening elastic-plastic material, and for small scale yielding conditions occurring at the crack tip, the plastic stress and strain fields imply other shapes and dimensions for the reflected caustics. Although the region surrounding the plastic zone remains under the dominance of the elastic singular solution, a more proper characterization of the intensity of stress singularity occurring at the crack tip was introduced by the notion of the plastic SIF. In the present paper the determination of the plastic SIF by means of the method of reflected <b>caustics</b> for a <b>cracked</b> plate loaded in out-of-plane shear was given. In the theoretical analysis the elastic-plastic solution for work-hardening materials was used.

40|$|The {{evaporator}} recycle streams contain {{waste in}} a chemistry and temperature regime {{that may be}} outside of the current waste tank corrosion control program, which imposes temperature limits to mitigate <b>caustic</b> stress corrosion <b>cracking</b> (CSCC). A review of the recent service history (1998 - 2008) of Tanks 30 and 32 showed that these tanks were operated in highly concentrated hydroxide solution at high temperature. Visual inspections, experimental testing, and {{a review of the}} tank service history have shown that CSCC has occurred in uncooled/un-stress relieved F-Area tanks. Therefore, for the Type III/IIIA waste tanks the efficacy of the stress relief of welding residual stress is the only corrosion-limiting mechanism. The objective of this experimental program is to test carbon steel small scale welded U-bend specimens and large welded plates (12 x 12 x 1 in.) in a caustic solution with upper bound chemistry (12 M hydroxide and 1 M each of nitrate, nitrite, and aluminate) and temperature (125 C). These conditions simulate worst-case situations in Tanks 30 and 32. Both as-welded and stress-relieved specimens have been tested. No evidence of stress corrosion cracking was found in the U-bend specimens after 21 days of testing. The large plate test is currently in progress, but no cracking has been observed after 9 weeks of immersion. Based on the preliminary results, it appears that the environmental conditions of the tests are unable to develop stress corrosion cracking within the duration of these tests...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum is a {{principal}} element in alkaline nuclear sludge waste stored in high level waste (HLW) tanks at the Savannah River Site. The mass of sludge in a HLW tank can be reduced through the caustic leaching of aluminum, i. e. converting aluminum oxides (gibbsite) and oxide-hydroxides (boehmite) into soluble hydroxides through reaction with a hot caustic solution. The temperature limits outlined by the chemistry control program for HLW tanks to prevent <b>caustic</b> stress corrosion <b>cracking</b> (CSCC) in concentrated hydroxide solutions will potentially be exceeded during the sludge mass reduction (SMR) campaign. Corrosion testing was performed to determine the potential for CSCC under expected conditions. The experimental test program, developed based upon previous test results and expected conditions during the current SMR campaign, consisted of electrochemical and mechanical testing to determine the susceptibility of ASTM A 516 carbon steel to CSCC in the relevant environment. Anodic polarization test results indicated that anodic inhibition at the temperatures and concentrations of interest for SMR is not a viable, consistent technical basis for preventing CSCC. However, the mechanical testing concluded that CSCC will not occur under conditions expected during SMR {{for a minimum of}} 35 days. In addition, the stress relief for the Type III/IIIA tanks adds a level of conservatism to the estimates. The envelope for corrosion control is recommended during the SMR campaign is shown in Table 1. The underlying assumption is that solution time-in-tank is limited to the SMR campaign. The envelope recommends nitrate/aluminate intervals for discrete intervals of hydroxide concentrations, although it is recognized that a continuous interval may be developed.

40|$|The optical {{method of}} {{caustics}} {{was used for}} the evaluation of the stress intensity factor at the crack tip in a viscoelastic plate made of polycarbonate of bisphenol A and containing a single external crack under conditions of generalized plane stress. It was assumed that the crack developed in a linear viscoelastic material. The reflected rays from both lateral faces, as well as the transmitted rays of a normally incident light beam were significantly dispersed at the close neighborhood of the crack tip because of the excessive lateral constraint and the strong variation of the refractive index, and concentrated along singular curves (caustics) at some distances from the plate. The reflected caustics formed two branches. While the internal branch, which was formed by reflections from the front face, depended only on the elastic modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio (v) of the material, the external branch, formed by reflections from the rear face, depended on E and v, {{as well as on the}} refractive index of the material (n). The transmitted rays formed the same type of caustic as that which was formed by reflections from the rear face, but with a different size. By studying the relative position and shape of the two reflected branches and their variation with time, information was derived concerning the viscoelastic state of the material at fracture. The transmitted light caustic was used as a check on the results. A series of viscoelastic tests in pure tension at various stress and strain levels yielded the variation of the mechanical (E, v) and optical (n, cr, cf) properties of the material with applied stress and strain. The values of these quantities at each stress level allowed the plotting of the relative positions of the two branches of the reflected caustics. Comparison of the actual position of the <b>caustics</b> at the <b>crack</b> tip with the caustic nomogram yielded the viscoelastic behavior of the material during the progress of loading. It was shown that by increasing the loading mode a strong viscoelastic behaviour was apparent which influenced considerably the fracture mode of the plate. © 1974...|$|R
