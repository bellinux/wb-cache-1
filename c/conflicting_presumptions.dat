It explains how the economic theory, empirical evidence and experience are used to determine a presumption and how that presumption interacts with the reliability of relevant evidence to rationally set the appropriate burden of production and burden of persuasion to rebut the presumption. The article applies this reasoning to merger presumptions. It also sketches out a number of non-market share structural factors that might be used to supplement or replace the current legal and enforcement presumptions for mergers. It also discusses the potential for <b>conflicting</b> <b>presumptions</b> and how such conflicts might best be resolved...|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture {{expansion}} {{is a political}} priority in Norway, despite simmering conflicts and competing claims. We expand on this hypothesis and analyze the Norwegian governance system by adding stakeholder theory {{in case of a}} simulated model of the effects of municipal coastal zone planning in the municipality of Frøya, Norway. One cannot analyze the governance system in Norway without fully comprehending the perspectives of the stakeholders involved. Different stakeholders will react and respond differently and have <b>conflicting</b> <b>presumptions</b> basing their actions towards the planning process for coastal areas. They will also have different levels of power and abilities to influence the system. The article presents the interdisciplinary, first generation development of an agent based simulation model that mimics the outcomes of coastal zone planning for a stakeholder groups, the commercial fishers and the aquaculture industry, based on qualitative input from legislation, regulations and stakeholder workshops. We proceed with verifying the applicability of this simulator in light of the key actors involved, namely the commercial fishers. We found that the simulator had two outcomes for the commercial fishers that were consistently recurring, namely collapse and stability, based on the simulated occurrences of complaints by the stakeholders, with the latter being the de facto perceptions of actuality by the commercial fishers. Using stakeholder theory, we argue that the aquaculture industry’s role has the saliency of an Important Stakeholder in Frøya has steered the commercial fishers, who has the role of Dependent Stakeholders according to stakeholder theory, to no longer see any legitimacy in the process in that their complaints were never upheld because of their lack of the attribute Power...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{describes}} {{an approach to}} moral conundrums (such as those occasioned by reproductive technology, including preimplantation genetic diagnosis) in a heterogeneous society. The approach, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 mediative, 2 ̆ 2 is designed to clarify aspects {{of the process of}} moral contemplation. It does not aim to secure any particular sort of resolution or conclusion. In this sense, the approach is not exclusively committed to any particular religious or philosophical perspective regarding bioethical questions and can most felicitously accommodate many of them. The approach reflects an anthropological apperception: the effort to understand the Other (the stranger, the outsider, the foreigner) depends on a process of mediating between the analyst 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs and the beliefs of the Other. The process is complicated because anthropologists usually begin without a clear sense of the Other 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs and with an incomplete or even misguided sense of their beliefs. The mediative approach that this essay describes requires a similar effort to understand the Other 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs from inside one 2 ̆ 7 s own and to become conscious, or more conscious, of one 2 ̆ 7 s own beliefs through reference to those of the Other. Thus, the process involves delimiting and then mediating among one 2 ̆ 7 s own and some Other 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 moral 2 ̆ 2 presumptions and choices. The first aspect of the task involves trying to reveal various assumptions underlying moral choices and conclusions. Then, the analyst must try to situate himself or herself in the ideological gap among different, often <b>conflicting,</b> <b>presumptions</b> in order to make sense of each set of presumptions from the perspective of another set of presumptions. Part II of this essay delimits the scope of moral debate about preimplantation genetic diagnosis (2 ̆ 2 PGD 2 ̆ 2). This Part describes arguments that both favor and disfavor the technique. Part III then outlines the mediative approach to moral dilemmas such as those posed by PGD...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we use concepts, {{structure}} and tools from argumentation theory {{to show how}} conversational implicatures are triggered by <b>conflicts</b> of <b>presumptions.</b> Presumptive implicature are shown {{to be based on}} defeasible forms of inference used in conditions of lack of knowledge, including analogical rea-soning, inference to the best explanation, practical reasoning, appeal to pity, and argument from cause. Such inferences are modelled as communicative strategies used to fill knowledge gaps by shifting the burden of proof to provide the missing contrary evidence to the other party in a dialogue. c Through a series of illustrative examples, we show how such principles of inference are based on common knowledge about the ordinary course of events shared by participants in a struc-tured dialogue setting in which they take turns putting forward and responding to speech acts...|$|R
40|$|Our aim in {{this paper}} is to show that there exists a {{fundamental}} 'moral tension' between the ostensible goals of environmental education {{on the one hand and}} the traditional goals of engineering science and pedagogy on the other. This moral tension is particularly evident in the case of the Chinese Three Gorges Dam Project (TGDP), where the collision of <b>conflicting</b> value <b>presumptions</b> has led to massive ecological devastation and the alleged violation of human rights concerns associated with the forced dislocation of local populations in the area. Although considerable engineering planning has gone into the construction of this largest dam project in the world, the horrific decimation of its surrounding environment and the concomitant dislocation of so huge a population of local people (now called 'resevoir refugees' in excess of 1. 3 million) (Tan & Yao 2006) makes clear that the consequences of the Project were hopelessly unanticipated, or epistemologically and in turn politically misguided. Our aim is to elaborate one neglected epistemological reason why this is so, and we believe that doing so adds a new dimension to the decades of debate on the topic...|$|R
40|$|Detainees in the War on Terror {{have been}} at Guantanamo Bay for over a decade. The {{justification}} for these detentions has been, at least in part, the on-going hostilities in Afghanistan. However, President Obama’s announcement in his 2013 State of the Union address that “By the end of [2014] our war in Afghanistan will be over” may undercut the continuing detention authority {{for at least some}} of these Guantanamo detainees. This paper analyzes the legal doctrine of release and repatriation in light of President Obama’s announcement and concludes that the President’s determination that hostilities have concluded between specific Parties to an armed conflict and the corresponding withdrawal of troops from the area of <b>conflict</b> creates a <b>presumption</b> that detainees from that conflict should be repatriated. This presumption may be overcome on an individual basis by a finding that released and repatriated fighters will return to the battle...|$|R
40|$|The First World War (1914 – 1918) {{defined the}} “American century,” {{establishing}} global {{political and economic}} hegemony and shaping national culture and society. However, over a century after {{the outbreak of the}} conflict that served to delineate and establish the modern era within the United States, the war appears to be absent from social and collective memory. Indeed, such is the apparent neglect of the war within schemes of remembrance that the campaign for the National World War I Memorial in Washington, DC, which was begun in earnest in 2008, was based upon the sense of amnesia that obscures the role of the United States in the conflict. The reason for this absence may be regarded as due to the all-encompassing nature of the Second World War and the relatively short period in which the nation was involved in the <b>conflict.</b> However, such <b>presumptions</b> have been roundly dismissed by scholars who have demonstrated the highly important role of the United States in ensuring victory for the Entente. This work has revealed {{the way in which the}} war altered society and politics after the entry of the nation into the global conflagration. It is during this war that the forces of capitalism and immigration that had built the United States during the nineteenth century were harnessed for the war effort, monitored by the state and controlled by the government for the purposes of national security. The impact of this wartime alteration was so extensive that the process of forgetting the conflict has been highlighted by some studies as a necessary response to the repressive intrusion into the lives of civilians. It is through these accounts that a new account of the First World War and the United States has emerged which reasserts the significance of the conflict for the nation...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) My aim in {{this thesis}} {{is to show that}} there exists a {{fundamental}} ‘moral tension’ between the ostensible goals of environmental education {{on the one hand and}} the politicization of China’s ideology of power and obsession with global economic dominance on the other. This moral tension is particularly evident in the case of the Chinese Three Gorges Dam Project (TGDP), where the unresolved collision of these <b>conflicting</b> value <b>presumptions</b> has led to massive ecological degradation on the one hand and issues of social injustice associated with population dislocation on the other. Although considerable engineering planning by the government has gone into the construction of what is claimed to be the most energy productive and largest dam project in the world, its horrific legacy of decimation to the surrounding land and water environments has been catastrophic. Similarly, the forced dislocation of so huge a population of local people (now called ‘reservoir refugees’, at least 1. 3 million people based on the official figures) makes clear that the humanitarian ramifications of the TGDP were hopelessly unanticipated, or based upon epistemological presumptions which served to marginalize their moral importance. The Three Gorges Dam (TGD) is politically applauded for several innovations, three of which I wish to draw to the reader’s attention. First, it is hailed as being the largest dam in the world, and second, it is touted as being capable of producing far more ‘safe’ energy than any of the other major dams scattered around the globe. Last but not least, it has unashamedly been exalted with pride as the most expensive construction project of any kind in the world. The question I pose is whether the price that has been paid and is still now being paid in terms of environmental destruction, humanitarian suffering, and ‘cultural genocide’ as I shall call it, are prices far too high to pay. Although the full environmental consequences and social justice issues raised by the TGDP have due to political reasons, not been teased out sufficiently in the Chinese public arena, I shall argue that the deleterious environmental and social impacts of the TGDP are incontestable and can better be understood as representing the inevitable outcome of a misguided epistemology of power and control driven by a political ideology within which values issues of social injustice, equity, and environmental stewardship have been irrevocably compromised. The main body of my thesis will be concerned to reflect critically on this moral tension between environmental education and the political epistemology and ideology of power which challenges it. Once this first major task has been completed, I will then propose a more comprehensive framework of theory and praxis grounded in an environmental pedagogy of ‘empathetic epistemology’ within which the moral issues raised can be treated with serious educational consideration and respect. This thesis thus endeavors to provide a new vision of our relationship to nature which is sponsored on the epistemic insight that the spiritual quality of our own existence cannot be defined independently of the moral integrity of our relationship to nature...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} disclose the reconciling power of Christian preaching, and examine the homiletical task {{through the lens of}} Jesus' command to "love your enemies. " Because the heart of Christian preaching lies in the Word of God revealed as the Prince of Peace, Gospel proclamation and reconciliation are perpetually intertwined. God's message of reconciliation has irrupted in history through a Son who not only forbids the killing of enemies, but also commands his followers to love them. Yet, in the wake of history's bloodiest century, Christians continue to sanction divisive, violent responses to those considered strangers and enemies [...] even those who also claim the name "Christian. " The time is ripe for an analysis of the proclaimed Word of God as a potent catalyst for reconciliation. The church needs a theology of preaching that offers an alternative to the world's language about enemies. My contention is that a theological investigation of enemy-language will {{have a positive impact on}} the theory and practice of Christian preaching, while unearthing new possibilities for churches and other faith communities beset by seemingly insurmountable <b>conflict.</b> I challenge <b>presumptions</b> about who our enemies truly are through descriptions of the rhetorical, theological, and homiletical elements of gospel proclamation in communities torn by conflict. What I finally hope to show is that because God has entrusted the church with the message of reconciliation, preaching is then an inherently reconciling practice, unintelligible apart from its nature as an address to God's former enemies. Reconciling sermons address and sustain churches with cruciform speech, or gospel-shaped language redeemed by God's Spirit, through which disciples are summoned to recognize and embody the forgiveness of the crucified yet risen Jesus, and equipped to exemplify, as ambassadors of reconciliation, the radical consequences of Christ's lordship. Methodologically, the dissertation pursues a theological analysis of preaching based on the relationship between the God of Jesus Christ and humankind. This reconciliation encompasses all things, past, present, and future. Such an assertion proceeds from a paradox: the world rejects Christ, and yet God has reconciled the world through Jesus on the cross (2 Cor. 5 : 18). Consequently, as Richard Lischer has said, reconciliation is the "animating principle" of preaching. God's reconciling action in Christ is the essential, constitutive homiletical thrust. Thus, sermonic language must align itself with God's reconciling action in Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. The dissertation advances these claims through a theoretical analysis of the "enemy" as it occurs in theological discourse, biblical interpretation, homiletical rhetoric, and constructive theologies of preaching and reconciliation, as well as through theological investigations of the preaching of Will Campbell, and sermons directly related to The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Overall, the dissertation combines the traditional disciplines of homiletics, theology, biblical interpretation, and rhetoric with contextualized field studies of "reconciling sermons. " The ultimate hope of this work is to invite the field of homiletics and the church it serves toward a more comprehensive acknowledgement of the crucial, reciprocal relationship between preaching, reconciliation, and peacemaking.

5000|$|From the Fletcher decision: The {{views of}} the Judge Advocate General, and {{the action of the}} Secretary in 1888 upon a {{reference}} of the subject in answer to the petition of Captain Fletcher, presented to the President, March 27 of that year, were induced by the case of Runkle v. United States, 122 U. S. 543, and the present decision of the Court of Claims was based upon it. Reference to the report of that case shows that the circumstances were so exceptional as to render it hardly a safe precedent in any other.It appeared therein that the proceedings, findings, and sentence of the court-martial were transmitted to the Secretary of War, who on January 16, 1873, wrote upon the record an order approving the proceedings, with certain exceptions, and the findings and sentence, together with the further statement that, in view of the unanimous recommendation by the members of the court that the accused should receive executive clemency, and other facts, the President was pleased to remit all of the sentence except so much as directed cashiering, and that thereupon the Secretary issued a general order announcing the sentence, as thus modified. It further appeared that thereafter, and on the same day, Major Runkle presented to President Grant a petition insisting that the proceedings had not been approved by him as required by law; that the conviction was unjust; that the record was insufficient to warrant the issuing of the order, and asking its revocation and annulment; whereupon, in pursuance of the petition, the record of the official action theretofore had was, by direction of the President, referred to the Judge Advocate General for review and report; that this report was subsequently made, and with the petition was found by President Hayes awaiting further and final action thereon, and, being taken up by him as unfinished business, the conviction and sentence were disapproved, and the order of January 16, 1873, revoked.This Court was of opinion that the order was capable of division into two separate parts, one relating to the approval of the proceedings and sentence and the other to the executive clemency which was invoked and exercised, and that under the circumstances, which are recapitulated, it could not be said that it positively and distinctly appeared that the proceedings had ever in fact been approved or confirmed by the President as required by the articles of war.The facts that there was no reference to Article 65 in the Secretary's endorsement; that the objection that President Grant had not personally examined and approved of the proceedings was taken and urged upon President Grant himself immediately upon the promulgation of the sentence, and that he entertained the objection, thereby recognizing the contention, seemed to make it a matter of argument whether he had personally acted in the premises.If it had been affirmatively stated that the proceedings were submitted, perhaps the action of President Grant in the matter of the application might have been ascribed to some other ground than doubt as to his examination of the proceedings; but as the record stood, this Court apparently thought that the <b>presumptions</b> <b>conflicted,</b> and therefore felt constrained to the conclusion announced.|$|R
