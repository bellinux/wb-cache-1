From 55 wild hosts including six different species (Nasua nasua, Cebus spp., Cerdocyon thous, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Tamandua tetradactyla and Dasyprocta aguti), 323 ticks were collected. Amblyomma ovale ticks were found solely on coatis, and Amblyomma nodosum was identified solely on anteaters. No ticks were found on capuchin monkeys. However, Amblyomma cajennense was found on all parasitized host species {{with the exception of}} capuchin monkeys. Giant anteaters displayed the highest infestation abundance, with a mean of 53 ticks&# 8725;animal. Environmental sampling yielded 166 adult A. cajennense ticks. The tick species found on domestic animals (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, R. sanguineus, Dermacentor nitens and A. cajennense) were those typically found on these hosts in Brazil. The most prevalent tick species, A. cajennense, was found on both wild and domestic animals and was also prevalent in the environment. Thus, this tick species is the primary vector that allows pathogens to bridge wild and domestic animals in the Cerrado...|$|E
40|$|Particularly in {{developing}} countries, forests provide feed for livestock {{in the form}} of fodder for stall-feeding and grazing in forest areas. Extraction of fodder resources from forests often leads to forest degradation. An attempt has been made to qualify extend of biomass extraction from forests and to compare forest fodder dependence of households in a number of forest density classes in the mountainous region of Himalayas, in Uttarakhand state in India, according to livestock owners 2 ̆ 7 perspectives. Information was obtained from a survey of livestock feed and fodder collection and utilization from 316 randomly selected households distributed across four government-defined forest density classes, namely very dense forest, moderately dense forest, open forest and scrub. Households obtained feed and fodder for livestock from three sources, i. e. forest areas, non-forest areas and local markets. Daily feed consumption per adult <b>cattle</b> <b>unit</b> varied according to source, ranging from 9. 85 to 14. 70 kg from forest areas, 7. 40 to 11. 14 kg from non-forest areas, and less than 1 kg from local markets. The dependency of households on fodder for livestock differed significantly between households located in each forest density classes. The current forest fodder extraction rate is likely to be unsustainable. Measures identified to reduce the extraction rate include greater use of alternative fodder sources and managing small patches of the natural forests adjoining dependent villages for fodder production through community participation...|$|E
30|$|Among {{other factors}} that {{have contributed to the}} success of the Kangayam grassland, absence of {{communal}} grazing land could have been one of the most important factors. It is difficult to find direct evidence, but since the deplorable condition of community grazing lands all over the country is widely noted, we are ready to accept that absence of the communal grazing land may have a positive effect on its sustainability. The Task Force on Grassland and Deserts (Planning Commission 2007) of Government of India has pointed out that in the semi-arid grasslands, the carrying capacity is 1 Adult <b>Cattle</b> <b>Unit</b> (ACU) per ha, but the stocking rates are as high as 51 ACU per ha, while in the arid areas, the carrying capacity is 0.2 - 05 ACU per ha but the stocking rates are 1 to 4 ACU per ha. Almost all the unoccupied and wastelands in the Kangayam grassland were given on lease (Pillu patta) to the farmers between 1855 and 1891, as previously explained (Table 1). A century ago Nicholson (1887) had also observed that as far as communal grazing land is concerned, there is everything against it. Where there is communal grazing, every peasant in the village naturally claims as large a share of it as possible, with the result that grazing lands are always overstocked, are never given rest and are usually little more than exercise grounds for cattle. He also reported that when the grazing was regulated, pastures not overstocked, and manure not removed from ground, excellent pasturage should in time be formed.|$|E

Antibiotic treatment was administered if calves displayed signs of respiratory illness and rectal temperature was â‰¥ 40 Â°C. Calves (n = 72) requiring antibiotic treatment were assigned randomly to either treatment 1 (florfenicol) or treatment 2 (florfenicol plus isoflupredone acetate). Both treatment groups were rechecked 48 hours post treatment to determine treatment efficacy. Blood was collected (at treatment and recheck) via jugular venipuncture to evaluate complete blood count. Weights were recorded on days 0, 14, 28, 45, and 46. No difference existed for medical cost (P = 0. 54) or temperature at recheck (P = 0. 43). Upon recheck, neutrophils were higher and lymphocytes were lower in calves that received isoflupredone acetate (P â‰¤ 0. 04).

Eradication of this disease has proved difficult to achieve in Portugal where it still occurs in some regions despite an ongoing national eradication programme. In 2004, the Alent-ejo region, a major cattle producing area, reported {{one of the highest}} levels of bovine brucellosis in the country, especially in one divisional area. In that area, bovine brucellosis was particularly problematic in a holding of ten herds, the largest extensive <b>cattle</b> <b>unit</b> in the country, which remained infected despite an extensive test-and-slaughter programme and depopulation of five herds. A 5 -year programme of RB 51 vaccination with biannual test-and-slaughter was thus implemented in 2004. The apparent animal seroprevalence decreased from 19 % (646 / 3, 400) to 3 % (88 / 2930) on the third herd-level test and remained below 0. 8 % (27 / 3324) after the fourth test. After the tenth test, the holding had a prevalence of 0. 1 % (2 / 2332) and only one herd remained positive with a within-herd prevalence of 1. 1 % (2 / 177). The results were compared to all other herds (n = 10) in the divisional area that were also persistently infected but were subject only to test-and-slaughter before being depopulated. In these herds, the strategy of test-andslaughter did not reduce the prevalence, which remained significantly higher than the vaccinated group (median = 0. 48 % and 8. 5 % in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated herds; Wilcoxon rank sum test; P < 0. 01). The success of this pilot programme in continental Portugal pro-vided a valuable case study to the official veterinary services by illustrating the value of RB 51 vaccination with parallel testing and improved biosecurity as a comprehensive and sustainable strategy for bovine brucellosis control in persis-tently infected herds.

40|$|Animal leptospirosis, exempt in rodents, manifests as {{peculiar}} biology {{where the}} animal can function, simultaneously or not, as a susceptible host or reservoir. In the first case, clinical symptoms are likely. In the second case, infection is subclinical and manifestations are mild or absent. Mild clinical symptoms encompass reproductive failure in production animals for host-adapted Leptospira sp. serovars. This work presents {{a study on}} Leptospira sp. infection in a mixed-species (bovine and swine) farm with documented reproductive disorders in the <b>cattle</b> <b>unit.</b> A long calving interval (above 450 days) was the hallmark observed in cows. Some cows (2 / 26 tested) presented a high titre of antibodies against Leptospira sp. serogroup Sejroe, but the overall within-herd prevalence was low (11. 5 % and 7. 7 % for cut-off titres of 1 : 30 and 1 : 100, respectively). The in-herd prevalence of leptospirosis in the sow unit (determined for 113 / 140 animals) was high when using a lowered cut-off threshold (32. 7 % vs. 1. 8 % for cut-off titre of 1 : 30 and 1 : 100, respectively). In this unit, the most prevalent serogroup was Autumnalis. The final diagnostic confirmation of Leptospira sp. maintenance within the farm was obtained through detection by PCR of Leptospira sp. DNA in an aborted swine litter. Despite {{the fact that a}} common causative infective agent was diagnosed in both species, the direct link between the two animal units was not found. Factors such as drinking from the same water source and the use of manure prepared with the swine slurry might raise suspicion of a possible cross-contamination between the two units. In conclusion, this work suggests that leptospirosis be included in the differential diagnosis of reproductive disorders and spontaneous abortions in production animals and provides data that justify the use of a lowered threshold cut-off for herd diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|In many African cities {{urban and}} peri-urban {{agriculture}} (UPA) {{plays a major}} role in creating jobs and contributing to food security. However, many small-scale UPA systems are characterised by excessive nutrient inputs to the livestock unit and poor handling of manure. To assess the impact of improved feeding and manure management on nutrient use efficiency within the <b>cattle</b> <b>unit,</b> simulation modelling was used to compare three typical UPA farm types in Niamey, Niger, that comprised: animal husbandry alone (AH), animal husbandry plus gardening (AH+G), and animal husbandry plus gardening plus millet cultivation (AH+G+M). Improved feeding increased annual body weight gain and milk offtake from cattle and reduced the amount of nitrogen (N) excreted in urine, thereby lowering the risk of N emissions. With improved manure management, dry matter (DM) and nutrients recycled per animal and year, and potentially available for cropping, ranged from 321 – 690 kg DM, 8 – 22 kg N, 1. 2 – 2. 5 kg phosphorus (P), and 3. 0 – 5. 6 kg potassium (K) in AH as well as AH+G+M farms compared to 221 – 479 kg DM, 5. 0 – 14. 0 kg N, 0. 7 – 1. 6 kg P, and 2. 0 – 4. 0 kg K in AH+G farms. These amounts were up to 2. 2 -, 2. 5 -, 1. 9 - and 1 -fold higher than the quantities of DM, N, P and K recycled under current practices.

In an early study, Shaw (1921) attempted to measure the amount of winter wheat loss due to Columbia ground squirrel. Grinnel and Dixon (1918) related ground squirrel damage to forage loss and cattle production. Several rodent enclosure and exclosure studies have been conducted in an attempt to measure the impact of field rodents and rabbits. Most of the damage assessment investigations involved rangeland production. The species studied have included prairie dogs (Taylor 1924, 1930; Fitch 1947), ground squirrels (Taylor 1930, Fitch 1947, Kalmbach 1948, Fitch and Bentley 1949, Norris 1950, Howard et al. 1950), jack rabbits (Taylor 1930, Kalmbach 1948, Norris 1950), kangaroo rats (Kalmbach 1948, Reynolds and Glendening 1949, Fitch and Bentley 1949, Reynolds 1950, Norris 1950), and pocket gophers (Kalmbach 1948, Fitch and Bentley 1949). Relatively few rodent damage assessment studies on agronomic crops, such as grain, alfalfa, and irrigated pasture, have been conducted in the western U. S. Foster (1965) noted that a large overwintering population of Microtus severely reduced production of irrigated wheat grass in seed fields and plots. The Belding ground squirrel (S. beldingi) is found in rangeland, pasture, and various agronomic crops. However, its impact on agricultural production ahs been measured only rarely, e. g., by Grinnel and Dixon (1918) and Sauer (1976, 1977).

40|$|AbstractStudying {{the changes}} in {{nutrient}} use strategies induced by grazing can {{provide insight into the}} process of grassland degradation and is important for improving grassland quality and enhancing ecosystem function. Dominant species in meadow steppe can optimize their use of limiting resources; however, the regulation of nutrient use strategies across grazing gradients is not fully understood. Therefore, in this study, we report an in situ study in which the impact of grazing rates on nutrient use strategies of Leymus chinensis, the dominant plant species in eastern Eurasian temperate steppes, was investigated. We conducted a large randomized controlled experiment (conducted continuously for five years in grassland plots in a natural pasture in Hailar, eastern Mongolia Plateau, China) to assess the effects of grazing rate treatments (0. 00, 0. 23, 0. 34, 0. 46, 0. 69, and 0. 92 adult <b>cattle</b> <b>unit</b> (AU) ha− 1) on L. chinensis along a grazing gradient and employed a random sampling approach to compare the accumulation, allocation, and stoichiometry of C, N, and P in leaves and stems. Our findings demonstrated the follows: (i) The height of L. chinensis decreased with an increase in the grazing gradient, and the concentrations of C, N, and P significantly increased; (ii) the accumulation of C, N, and P per individual was negatively correlated with the concentration of aboveground tissues, suggesting that there was a tradeoff in L. chinensis between nutrient accumulation and concentration at the individual scale; (iii) the leaf-to-stem ratio of C, N, and P accumulation increased with grazing intensity, indicating a tradeoff in nutrient allocation and plant size at the individual plant level; and (iv) grazing rates were negatively correlated with the ratios of C:N and C:P in the stem; however, these ratios in leaves significantly increased with grazing intensity. Our findings suggest that L. chinensis in meadow steppe adapts to grazing disturbance through tradeoffs between plant size and nutrient use strategies. Moreover, our results imply that grazing produces a compensatory effect on nutrient use efficiency between the stems and leaves of L. chinensis...|$|E

The main aim is to identify the principal factors that may influence Individual Cell Counts (ICC) of milk, while using 8 periodic controls by a complete lactation for 707 cows in total. The analysis showed that ICC varies especially with the rank and the stage of lactation, month and season of calving and between regions. ICC increases with the rank of lactation reflecting thus the increased incidence and persistence of mammary infections with age. ICC of primiparous are always lower compared to ICC of multiparous. Cell counts gradually increased during lactation. Seasonal and monthly variations of ICC are specific to this study and result from particular breeding and milking conditions. During lactation, the ICC has a reverse profile versus the profile of individual milk production. Generally, ICC varies throughout the study between concerned regions.

The present study {{has focused on the}} impact of watershed interventions on crop-livestock linkages with particular emphasis on how the interventions have affected the quantity of stovers/straws as livestock feeding materials in bridging the demand-supply gap. The study has been carried out in three typical Shivalik foothill watersheds (two treated and one untreated) in the Panchkula district of Haryana state. The impact of watershed development programme has been estimated by adopting both with and without approach and before and after approach. The untreated watershed has derived 65 per cent of its total income from animal husbandry. On the contrary, this sector has contributed 42 per cent and 20 per cent in two treated watersheds. The availability of supplemental irrigation enabled the villagers to step up cropping intensity. The number of goats has reduced considerably in both treated watersheds and the number of stall-fed buffaloes has increased. Adult <b>cattle</b> <b>units</b> per household and per hectatre of cultivated area {{have been found to be}} highest in the untreated watershed.

However, {{little is known about}} the resource use efficiencies in West African small-scale UPA crop and livestock production systems, and about the benefits that urban producers and retailers obtain from the cultivation and sale of UPA products. To contribute to filling this gap of knowledge, the studies comprising this doctoral thesis determined nutrient use efficiencies in representative urban crop and livestock production system in Niamey, Niger, and investigated potential health risks for consumers. Also assessed was the economic efficiency of urban farming activities. The field study, which was conducted during November 2005 to January 2008, quantified management-related horizontal nutrient flows in 10 vegetable gardens, 9 millet fields and 13 cattle and small ruminant production units. These farms, selected on the basis of a preceding study, represented the diversity of UPA crop and livestock production systems in Niamey. Based on the management intensity, the market orientation and especially the nutrient input to individual gardens and fields, these were categorized as high or low input systems. In the livestock study, high and low input cattle and small ruminant units were differentiated based on the amounts of total feed dry matter offered daily to the animals at the homestead. Additionally, economic returns to gardeners and market retailers cultivating and selling amaranth, lettuce, cabbage and tomato - four highly appreciated vegetables in Niamey were determined during a 6 -months survey in forty gardens and five markets. For vegetable gardens and millet fields, significant differences in partial horizontal nutrient balances were determined for both management intensities. Per hectare, average annual partial balances for carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) amounted to 9936 kg C, 1133 kg N, 223 kg P and 312 kg K in high input vegetable gardens as opposed to 9580 kg C, 290 kg N, 125 kg P and 351 kg K in low input gardens. These surpluses were mainly explained by heavy use of mineral fertilizers and animal manure to which irrigation with nutrient rich wastewater added. In high input millet fields, annual surpluses of 259 kg C ha- 1, 126 kg N ha- 1, 20 kg P ha- 1 and 0. 4 kg K ha- 1 were determined. Surpluses of 12 kg C ha- 1, 17 kg N ha- 1, and deficits of - 3 kg P ha- 1 and - 3 kg K ha- 1 were determined for low input millet fields. Here, carbon and nutrient inputs predominantly originated from livestock manure application through corralling of sheep, goats and cattle. In the livestock enterprises, N, P and K supplied by forages offered at the farm exceeded the animals’ requirements for maintenance and growth in high and low input sheep/goat as well as <b>cattle</b> <b>units.</b> The highest average growth rate determined in high input sheep/goat units was 104 g d- 1 during the cool dry season, while a maximum average gain of 70 g d- 1 was determined for low input sheep/goat units during the hot dry season. In low as well as in high input <b>cattle</b> <b>units,</b> animals lost weight during the hot dry season, and gained weight during the cool dry season. In all livestock units, conversion efficiencies for feeds offered at the homestead were rather poor, ranging from 13 to 42 kg dry matter (DM) per kg live weight gain (LWG) in cattle and from 16 to 43 kg DM kg- 1 LWG in sheep/goats, pointing to a substantial waste of feeds and nutrients. The economic assessment of the production of four high value vegetables pointed to a low efficiency of N and P use in amaranth and lettuce production, causing low economic returns for these crops compared to tomato and cabbage to which inexpensive animal manure was applied. The net profit of market retailers depended on the type of vegetable marketed. In addition it depended on marketplace for amaranth and lettuce, and on season and marketplace for cabbage and tomato. Analysis of faecal pathogens in lettuce irrigated with river water and fertilized with animal manure indicated a substantial contamination by Salmonella spp. with 7. 2 x 104 colony forming units (CFU) per 25 g of produce fresh matter, while counts of Escherichia coli averaged 3. 9 x 104 CFU g- 1. In lettuce irrigated with wastewater, Salmonella counts averaged 9. 8 x 104 CFU 25 g- 1 and E. coli counts were 0. 6 x 104 CFU g- 1; these values exceeded the tolerable contamination levels in vegetables of 10 CFU g- 1 for E. coli and of 0 CFU 25 g- 1 for Salmonella. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that Niamey’s UPA enterprises put environmental safety at risk since excess inputs of N, P and K to crop and livestock production units favour N volatilisation and groundwater pollution by nutrient leaching. However, more detailed studies are needed to corroborate these indications. Farmers’ revenues could be significantly increased if nutrient use efficiency in the different production (sub) systems was improved by better matching nutrient supply through fertilizers and feeds with the actual nutrient demands of plants and animals.

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{epidemic}} dynamics of heartwater within a <b>cattle</b> production <b>unit</b> was presented by Yonow et al. (1998). Here, the model is expanded to a region consisting of several farms to study the effect of environmental variability on control strategies. We have shown that: • In a region, where the environment of each farm is modelled with constant epidemiologic parameter values, while the between-farm parameter values differ, regional variation in the removal rate of infected cattle increases the average fraction of infected cattle across the region, while regional variation in the transmission rate of infection from ticks to cattle decreases the average fraction of infected cattle, thereby requiring control measures that keep the removal rate uniform and the transmission rate variable. • In a region, where in addition to regional variation between farms, the epidemiologic parameters of each farm are time-variant, then temporal variation in both the transmission rate and removal rate increases the average fraction of infected cattle across the region, thereby requiring control measures that keep both parameters uniform.

This study was performed to investigate risk factors affecting chemical and bacteriological quality of bulk tank milk. According to the following conducted experiments, the milk was divided into two standard and non-standard groups. Then, effect of risk factors on making the samples non-standard was studied. Risk factors such as type of milk delivery <b>unit,</b> distance of <b>cattle</b> farm from plant, size of herd, education level of stockbreeders, capacity of milk transport tank, capacity of cooler device, and number of workers employed in cattle farms were evaluated in this study. Microbial and chemical evaluations were performed. Beta-lactam antibiotic residues and somatic cell count were specified. At the same time, the stockbreeders who referred to the plant were given some questionnaires and the mentioned primary questions were asked. After collecting the data, logistic regression model was used. According to the obtained results and comparison with Iran’s national standard, 26 out of 109 samples were determined to be at standard level and 83 ones had at least one out-of-standard factor. The results obtained from the model demonstrated significant effect of education of stockbreeders and capacity of cooler devices on the milk quality.

One of the treatment techniques more adequate is the anaerobic digestion, which allows obtaining two valorizable products: biogas which {{can be used as a}} source of energy and a digested efluent that can be used as agricultural fertilizer. This work aims to study the potential use of a cattle farm effluent on AD. Therefore, it was necessary to collect data relating to the flow analysis and then, make the experimental design according to the needs inherent to this type of farming. For waste treatment from a <b>cattle</b> farming <b>unit</b> for milk production by AD, it was expected that the process had low viability owning the residue characteristics. Therefore it was used an agricultural waste for the process of anaerobic co-digestion. The residue selected as cosubstrate to the mixture of manure / washing waters, was a liquid residue from a surplus harvest of Pear Rocha from the region of Mafra. From the results it can be concluded that the co-digestion of these two residues can contribute to a sustainable management at a farm scale level.

40|$|Abstract. Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium {{species are}} the most {{frequent}} toxigenic fungi found in Europe which produce aflatoxin B 1 transformed into M 1 in milk. This toxin is highly dangerous for human health, being carcinogens, mutagens and also teratogens. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the incidence of M 1 aflatoxin in <b>cattle</b> growth <b>units</b> for milk production and also in collecting units found in two surveillance systems from Transylvania. This incidence was further compared among these systems so as to establish the prevalence area of aflatoxin M 1 occurrence in milk. The material used was represented by 141 raw milk samples analyzed and tested in 2 regional sanitary veterinary control laboratories by immuno-enzymatic ELISA method. Of the total samples, 56 were obtained from milk collecting units and 85 from growth units. The study shows that in 35. 65 % of the samples analyzed the identification of aflatoxin M 1 was possible. Surprisingly, in the growth units with less than 100 individuals, aflatoxin M 1 was identified in a proportion of 81. 4 %. None of the samples with M 1 toxin exceeded the limit of 0. 05 µg/kg, which is the maximum allowed. In the samples gathered from collecting centers from both surveillance systems a percent of 48 were identified with M 1 afllatoxin, and 2 samples showed values that exceeded the one stated by the current legislation. When comparing the two surveillance systems we found significant differences (p< 0. 05), one being with...|$|R

There are references, in the Rig Veda, to the leveling of fields, seed processing, and storage of grains in large jars. War booty was also a major source of wealth. Economic exchanges were conducted by gift giving, particularly to kings (bali) and priests (dana), and barter using <b>cattle</b> as a <b>unit</b> of currency. While gold is mentioned in some hymns, there is no indication of the use of coins. Metallurgy is not mentioned in the Rig Veda, but the word ayas and instruments made from it such as razors, bangles, axes are mentioned. One verse mentions purification of ayas. Some scholars believe that ayas refers to iron and the words dham and karmara refer to iron-welders. However, philological evidence indicates that ayas in the Rigveda refers only to copper and bronze, while iron or śyāma ayas, literally [...] "black metal", first is mentioned in the post-Rigvedic Atharvaveda, and therefore the Early Vedic Period was a Bronze Age culture whereas the Late Vedic Period was an Iron Age culture.|$|R
40|$|In a {{longitudinal}} study in a Finnish <b>cattle</b> finishing <b>unit</b> we investigated excretion and sources of Escherichia coli O 157 in bulls from postweaning until slaughter. Three groups of 31 to 42 calves were sampled in a calf transporter before they entered the farm and four to seven times at approximately monthly intervals at the farm. All calves sampled in the livestock transporter were negative for E. coli O 157 on arrival, whereas positive animals were detected 1 day later. During the fattening period the E. coli O 157 infection rate varied between 0 and 38. 5 %. The animals were also found to be shedding during the cold months. E. coli O 157 was isolated from samples taken from water cups, floors, and feed passages. E. coli O 157 was detected in 9. 7 to 38. 9 % of the fecal samples taken at slaughter, while only two rumen samples and one carcass surface sample {{were found to be}} positive. E. coli O 157 was isolated from barn surface samples more often when the enrichment time was 6 h than when the enrichment time was 24 h (P < 0. 0001). Fecal samples taken at the abattoir had lower counts (≤ 0. 4 MPN/g) than fecal samples at the farm (P < 0. 05). E. coli O 157 was isolated more often from 10 -g fecal samples than from 1 -g fecal samples (P < 0. 0001). Most farm isolates belonged to one pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) genotype (79. 6 %), and the rest belonged to closely related PFGE genotypes. In conclusion, this study indicated that the finishing unit rather than introduction of new cattle was the source of E. coli O 157 at the farm and that E. coli O 157 seemed to persist well on barn surfaces...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} in the New Zealand seasonal dairying system to dry-off the herd at an earlier date {{in order to prevent}} excessive loss of body condition and average pasture cover. Thus, short lactation length {{is one of the main}} reasons for the low milk yield per cow in New Zealand. An experiment was carried out in April and May 1995 (54 days) at the Dairy <b>Cattle</b> Research <b>Unit</b> (DCRU), Massey University in order to measure the effects of extending the lactation, and feeding silage on the dairy farm system. On the 4 th April, 54 of the lower yielding cows of the herd (118 cows) were dried-off and divided into two equal herds (D or control system). The remaining 64 cows were also divided into two equal herds, and milked for another 54 days (M system). Each of the four herds was grazed on a self-contained farmlet, at 2. 9 cows/ha stocking rate. D herds received only grazed pasture (16 kg dry matter (DM) /cow/day allowance), while M herds received pasture (30 kg DM/cow/day allowance) plus silage (5. 5 kg DM/cow/day). All of the replicated farmlets were feed budgeted to common targets of 2, 000 Kg DM/ha pasture cover and condition score 5. 0 at 29 th May. At the end of the experiment the M system had produced 57. 7 kg milksolids (MS, fat+protein) per cow, but had lower (P< 0. 01) average pasture cover (by 584 kg DM/ha) and body condition scores (by 0. 33 units/cow) than the D system. The target conditions were achieved by the D system, but not by the M system (deficits of 400 kg DM/ha pasture cover and 0. 38 units CS/cow). When the feed required to overcome the deficits (when compared with the D system) in pasture cover and condition score of the M system was added to the silage fed, and these were all expressed in terms of their "pasture equivalences", a total marginal response to the silage feeding and extra days in milk of 116 g MS/kg equivalent pasture DM was calculated. Findings of this and previous farm system studies show that milk production response to late lactation (autumn) supplementary feeding is higher than was commonly believed, provided that it is associated with extra days in milk. Nevertheless, feed planning and management must be specially vigilant to ensure that the extended lactation does not cause reduced body condition score and pasture cover at the start of the next season...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} to assess the effect of sowing mixed legume forage and {{applying}} cattle manure on the productivity and feed value of whole-crop barley (WCB) as a representative of winter crops and to estimate feeding capacity of Korean native <b>cattle</b> (Hanwoo) per <b>unit</b> area by defining optimal application level of cattle manure for more fertile soil and manure recycling for the purpose of reduced environmental pollution and efficient production of organic forage contributable to production of organic animal products. Sowing mixed legume forage significantly (p< 0. 05) increased yields of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) for WCB compared to WCB alone sowing, but {{there was no difference between}} mixed sowing treatments. The yields of DM, CP and TDN were significantly (p< 0. 05) highest in 100 ~ 150 kg N/hg. The CP and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents were highest in mixed sowing with hairy vetch, followed by sowing mixed forage pea and WCB alone (p< 0. 05). There were no differences in CP and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) contents among cattle manure application levels. As nitrogen application level increased, ADF content increased (p< 0. 05), but TDN content decreased (p< 0. 05). Feeding capacity of organic Hanwoo (head/ha) weighing 450 kg of body weight with 400 g of daily gain significantly (p< 0. 05) increased due to mixed sowing with legume forage, and with increasing application levels of fermented cattle manure, feeding capacity significantly (p< 0. 05) increased.
