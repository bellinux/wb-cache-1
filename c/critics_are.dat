5|$|The {{philosophical}} {{nature of}} the character has invited political critiques, and resulted in comparisons drawn against the political and philosophical views of other fictional characters.

5|$|Since 1984, when John Rutter's {{edition of}} the 1893 score was {{recorded}} for the Conifer label, {{there have been numerous}} sets of both the 1893 and 1900 versions issued on CD.

The Requiem is often combined in recordings and concert performances with Fauré's early Cantique de Jean Racine, an award-winning composition originally for choir and organ which the composer wrote aged 19 in his last year of ten years at the school of church music École Niedermeyer de Paris.|$|E
5|$|They are an {{essential}} part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the Creation of Adam. Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are empty as are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the <b>critics</b> <b>are</b> the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse.|$|E

If the inner <b>critic</b> <b>is</b> intense and stubborn, a friendly approach of valorizing the inner <b>critic's</b> concerns could <b>be</b> helpful; if the inner <b>critic</b> <b>is</b> mild, it may be more appropriate to gently ignore it and make contact with [...] "suppressed organismic experience".|$|R

25|$|Literary {{criticism}} (or literary studies) is the study, evaluation, {{and interpretation}} of literature. Modern literary criticism is often influenced by literary theory, which is the philosophical discussion of literature's goals and methods.

25|$|Some <b>critics</b> <b>are</b> {{skeptical of}} {{the healing power of}} psychotherapeutic relationships. Some dismiss {{psychotherapy}} altogether {{in the sense of a}} scientific discipline requiring professional practitioners, instead favoring either nonprofessional help or biomedical treatments.

25|$|One view, first propounded by Enlightenment philosophers, {{asserts that}} the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have {{hindered}} the progress of civilization. Communist states have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such <b>critics</b> <b>are</b> the Church's condemnations of the teachings of Copernicus, Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth of}} managed care in the U.S. was spurred by the {{enactment}} of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. While managed care techniques were pioneered by health maintenance organizations, they are now used by a variety of private health benefit programs. Managed care is now nearly ubiquitous in the U.S, but has attracted controversy because it has had mixed results in its overall goal of controlling medical costs. Proponents and <b>critics</b> <b>are</b> also sharply divided on managed care's overall impact on the quality of U.S. health care delivery.|$|E
25|$|Although her novels were {{hugely popular}} during her lifetime, Burney's {{reputation}} as a writer of fiction suffered after her death {{at the hands of}} biographers and critics, who felt that the extensive diaries, published posthumously in 1842–46, offered a more interesting and accurate portrait of 18th-century life. Today <b>critics</b> <b>are</b> returning to her novels and plays with renewed interest in her outlook on the social lives and struggles of women in a predominantly male-oriented culture. Scholars continue to value Burney's diaries as well for their candid depictions of English society in her time.|$|E
