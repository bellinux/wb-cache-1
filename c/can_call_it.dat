He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down. In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, [...] "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> whatever you want, but at some point we're {{going to have to get}} serious about how we deal with this issue".|$|E

This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. It is all about a beat with style, with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both." ...|$|E

She still included many recipes but increasingly wrote about places—markets, , farms—and people, including profiles of famous chefs and gourmets such as Marcel Boulestin and Édouard de Pomiane. In her later articles, she expressed strongly held views {{on a wide range of}} subjects; she abominated the word [...] "crispy", demanding to know what it conveyed that [...] "crisp" [...] did not; she confessed to an inability to refill anybody's wineglass until it was empty; she insisted on the traditional form [...] "Welsh rabbit" [...] rather than the modern invention [...] "Welsh rarebit"; she poured scorn on the Guide Michelin's standards; she deplored [...] "fussy garnish... distract from the main flavours"; she inveighed against the ersatz: [...] "anyone depraved enough to invent a dish consisting of a wedge of steam-heated bread spread with tomato paste and a piece of synthetic Cheddar <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a pizza." ...|$|E

Marge is so angry that she banishes Homer, who takes up residence in Bart's treehouse with Amber.

However none of the titles were confirmed for Folie à Deux. It also featured a song titled [...] "America's Sweethearts" [...] which was eventually confirmed for the album but with an alternate spelling, [...] "America's Suitehearts". The band confirmed that it intended to release the mixtape in conjunction with the [...] "Citizens" [...] campaign, and felt that it was relevant to not only the themes of the album, but the 2008 election as well.

When going around a bend a few tenths of a mile from his parents' house, Favre lost control of his car, which flipped three times and came to rest against a tree. It was only after one of his brothers smashed a car window with a golf club that Favre could be evacuated and rushed to the hospital. In the ambulance, his mother was sitting with him. [...] "All I kept asking [...] was 'Will I be able to play football again?'" [...] Favre recalled later. Doctors would later remove 30 inches (76cm) of Favre's small intestine. Six weeks after this incident, on September 8, Favre led Southern Miss to a comeback victory over Alabama.

Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called [...] "Endless, Nameless" [...] intended to appear at the end of [...] "Something in the Way", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was kind of a}} verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their instructions, so you <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> my mistake if you want. Maybe I didn't write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn't on there." [...] When the band discovered the song's omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of [...] "Something in the Way" [...] and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.|$|E

[...] The Lanterns Alex Antonetz wrote that both [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] are future Charlie Bear fare. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song is perfect for the clubs. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled [...] "Numb" [...] together with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as essential tracks on Looking 4 Myself. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing [...] "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" [...] and even though you <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] "an EDM cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers hopped on the bandwagon".|$|E
500|$|Captain Henry Blackwood {{arrived at}} Merton early on 2 September, {{bringing}} {{news that the}} French and Spanish fleets had combined and were currently at anchor in Cádiz. Nelson hurried to London where he met cabinet ministers and was given command of the fleet blockading Cádiz. It was while attending one of these meetings on 12 September, with Lord Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, that Nelson and Major General Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, met briefly in a waiting room. Wellington was waiting to be debriefed on his Indian operations, and Nelson on his chase and future plans. Wellington later recalled, [...] "He (Nelson) entered at once into conversation with me, if I <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> conversation, for it was almost all on his side and all about himself and, in reality, a style so vain and so silly as to surprise and almost disgust me." [...] However, {{after a few minutes}} Nelson left the room and having been told who his companion was, returned and entered into an earnest and intelligent discussion with the young Wellesley which lasted for a quarter of an hour, on the war, the state of the colonies and the geopolitical situation, that left a marked impression upon Wellesley.

500|$|The Braves {{opened the}} third inning with {{back-to-back}} singles by Ozzie Virgil and Terry Blocker. Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher Rick Mahler and Ron Gant and then retiring Jeff Blauser on a flyball to left. In the seventh inning, a double by Andrés Thomas was followed with an error by Franklin Stubbs, giving the Braves runners at first and third. Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again. Gant's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall. Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying: [...] "It was the worst I've thrown {{in the last five}} or six starts,...I was really inconsistent. I didn't have good stuff or location. I couldn't establish a pattern. I had to work hard adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn't have if I was going badly." [...] The Dodgers' only run came in the ninth inning on what newspapers described as a successful hit and run play in which Mike Marshall on a 2-2 count doubled Kirk Gibson in from first base. However, as recalled by Marshall: [...] "Let me tell you, it wasn't a hit-and-run. [...] Gibby was probably going with two strikes. [...] We never would hit-and-run with us.

2500|$|In {{its early}} days, Rutgers athletes were known informally as [...] "The Scarlet" [...] in {{reference}} to the school color, or as [...] "Queensmen" [...] {{in reference to}} the institution's first name, Queen's College. In 1925, the mascot was changed to Chanticleer, a fighting rooster from the medieval fable Reynard the Fox (Le Roman de Renart) which was used by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales. At the time, the student humour magazine at Rutgers was called Chanticleer, and one of its early arts editors, Ozzie Nelson (later of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet fame) was quarterback of the Rutgers team from 1924 to 1926. The Chanticleer mascot was unveiled at a football game against Lafayette College, in which Lafayette was also introducing a new mascot, a leopard. However, the choice of Chanticleer as a mascot was often the subject of ridicule because of its association with [...] "being chicken." [...] In 1955, the mascot was changed to the Scarlet Knight after a campus-wide election, beating out other contenders such as [...] "Queensmen", the [...] "Scarlet", the [...] "Red Lions", the [...] "Redmen" [...] and the [...] "Flying Dutchmen." [...] Earlier proposed nicknames included [...] "Pioneers" [...] and [...] "Cannoneers". When Harvey Harman, then coach of the football team, was asked why he supported changing the Rutgers mascot, he was quoted as saying, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the Chanticleer, you <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a fighting cock, you <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> any damn thing you want, but everybody knows it's a chicken." [...] Harman later is said to have bought the first [...] "Scarlet Knight" [...] mascot costume for the 1955 season, which was to be his final season as football coach at Rutgers.|$|E

According to Sondheim's music director, Paul Gemignani, [...] "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility." [...] Although Merrily closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, [...] "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs... But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I feel betrayed?
