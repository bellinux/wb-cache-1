25|$|Swan's <b>carbon</b> <b>rod</b> {{lamp and}} carbon {{filament}} lamp, while functional, were still relatively impractical due to low resistance (needing very expensive thick copper wiring) and short running life. While {{searching for a}} better filament for his light bulb, Swan inadvertently made another advance. In 1881 he developed and patented a process for squeezing nitro-cellulose through holes to form conducting fibres. His newly established company (which by merger eventually became the Edison and Swan United Company) used Swan's cellulose filaments in their bulbs. The textile industry has also used this process.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan {{developed}} a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880. On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender <b>carbon</b> <b>rod</b> was shown {{at a meeting of}} the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a <b>carbon</b> <b>rod</b> from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. This bulb lasted about 40 hours. Swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. The first street in the world to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. It was lit by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879.|$|E

2500|$|In 1866, Georges Leclanché {{patented}} a new battery system, {{which was}} immediately successful. Leclanché's original cell was assembled in a porous pot. The positive electrode (the cathode) consisted of crushed manganese dioxide {{with a little}} carbon mixed in. The negative pole (anode) was a zinc rod. The cathode was packed into the pot, and a <b>carbon</b> <b>rod</b> was inserted {{to act as a}} current collector. The anode and the pot were then immersed in an ammonium chloride solution. The liquid acted as the electrolyte, readily seeping through the porous pot and making contact with the cathode material.

5000|$|Before {{the carbon}} nanoballs can be made, a <b>carbon</b> <b>rod</b> must be formed. The <b>carbon</b> <b>rod</b> is {{prepared}} {{in the presence}} of acetylene with coke powder (type of fuel source with few impurities and a high carbon content) and formed using arc discharge technique. Arc discharge technique uses two high-purity graphite electrodes as an anode and a cathode which are vaporized by the passage of a DC (direct current) current. [...] After arc discharging for a period of time, a <b>carbon</b> <b>rod</b> is built up at the cathode. The <b>carbon</b> <b>rod</b> is then put in a DC arc discharge reactor. The <b>carbon</b> <b>rod</b> acts as the anode while a high purity graphite rod acts as the cathode. A current adjusted to 70-90 amps was passed through the two rods in an acetylene medium at a pressure of 0.05 to 0.06 MPa (megapascals). Carbon nanoballs formed on the <b>carbon</b> <b>rod</b> during the arc evaporation process. The carbon nanoballs were then examined using a FE-SEM(Field emission scanning electron microscope) and a STEM(scanning transmission electron microscope) which was equipped with energy dispersive x-rays operated at 200kV (kilo-volts), x-ray diffraction, and Raman Spectroscopy. Most of the carbon nanoballs that was formed were sintered(solid mass of material formed by heat and/or pressure). Trace amounts of nanoballs that existed as individuals rather than a group was also detected as well as a few cotton-like nano-materials.|$|E

[...] The rods are then slowly drawn apart, and electric current heats and maintains an arc across the gap. The tips of the <b>carbon</b> <b>rods</b> are heated and the carbon vaporizes.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{feasibility}} study of producing fullerenes (C 60 and C 70) using <b>carbon</b> <b>rods</b> manufactured from Chinese coal {{which is one}} of the cheapest natural resources of carbon. A DC arc method is employed using coal-derived <b>carbon</b> <b>rods</b> as electrode materials. The <b>carbon</b> <b>rods</b> are prepared from seven typical Chinese hard coals including bituminous coals and anthracite. The results show that all Chinese coals tested can be used to produce significant quantities of fullerenes. Their yields are strongly affected by the methods of preparing carbon electrodes and the parameters of the arc process, which are directly related to the coal properties and characteristics. Our results show that the two step carbonisation method is significantly better than the one-step hot-pressing method with regard to the fullerene yields, as such the two-step method is recommended for fullerenes production from Chinese coals. It is found that the fullerene yield increases as the the carbon content in coal increases and as ash content in coal decreases. This suggests that the mineral matter in coals could somehow inhibit the fullerenes production. An interesting linear relationship between the C 60 /C 70 ratios and the volatile matter content in Chinese coals is also noted...|$|R
