40|$|Beliefs formed under {{uncertainty}} come {{in different}} grades, which are called <b>credences</b> or degrees of belief. The most common way of measuring {{the strength of}} <b>credences</b> is by ascribing probabilities to them. What kind of probabilities may be used {{remains an open question}} and divides the researchers in two camps: the sharpers who claim that <b>credences</b> can be measured by the standard single-valued precise probabilities. The non-sharpers, on the other hand, claim that <b>credences</b> are imprecise and can only be measured by imprecise probabilities. The latter view has recently gained in popularity. According to non-sharpers, <b>credences</b> must be imprecise when the evidence is essentially imprecise (ambiguous, vague, conflicting or scarce). This view is, however, misleading. Imprecise <b>credences</b> can lead to irrational behaviour and do not make much sense after a closer examination. I provide a coherence-based principle which enables me to demonstrate that {{there is no need for}} imprecise <b>credences.</b> This principle is then applied to three special cases, which are prima facie best explained by use of imprecise credences: the jellyfish guy case, Ellsberg paradox and the Sleeping Beauty problem. The jellyfish guy case deals with a strange situation, where the evidence is very ambiguous. Ellsberg Paradox demonstrates a problem that occurs when comparing precise and imprecise <b>credences.</b> The Sleeping Beauty problem demonstrates that imprecise <b>credences</b> are not useless, but rather misguided. They should be understood as sets of possible precise <b>credences,</b> of which only one can be selected at a given time...|$|R
40|$|A {{group is}} often {{construed}} as a single agent with its own probabilistic beliefs (<b>credences),</b> which are obtained by aggregating those of the individuals, for instance through averaging. In their celebrated contribution “Groupthink”, Russell et al. (2015) apply the Bayesian paradigm to groups by requiring group <b>credences</b> to undergo a Bayesian revision whenever new information is learnt, i. e., whenever the individual <b>credences</b> undergo a Bayesian revision based on this information. Bayesians should often strengthen this requirement by extending it to non-public or even private information (learnt by not all or just one individual), or to non-representable information (not corresponding to an event in the algebra on which <b>credences</b> are held). I propose a taxonomy of six kinds of `group Bayesianism', which differ {{in the type of}} information for which Bayesian revision of group <b>credences</b> is required: public representable information, private representable information, public non-representable information, and so on. Six corresponding theorems establish exactly how individual <b>credences</b> must (not) be aggregated such that the resulting group <b>credences</b> obey group Bayesianism of any given type, respectively. Aggregating individual <b>credences</b> through averaging is never permitted. One of the theorems – the one concerned with public representable information – is essentially Russell et al. 's central result (with minor corrections) ...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} kinds of epistemic experts to which we might wish to defer in setting our <b>credences.</b> These include: highly {{rational}} agents, objective chances, our own future <b>credences,</b> our own current <b>credences,</b> and evidential (or logical) probabilities. But exactly what constraint does a deference requirement place on an agent's <b>credences?</b> In this paper we consider three answers, inspired by three principles that have been proposed for deference to objective chances. We consider how these options fare when applied to the other kinds of epistemic experts mentioned above. Of the three deference principles we consider, we argue {{that two of the}} options face insuperable difficulties. The third, on the other hand, fares well|at least when it is applied in a particular way...|$|R

40|$|Bayesianism, in its {{traditional}} form, {{consists of two}} claims about rational <b>credences.</b> According to the first claim, probabilism, rational <b>credences</b> form a probability function. According to the second claim, conditionalization, rational <b>credences</b> update by conditionalizing on new evidence. The simplicity and elegance of classical Bayesianism make it an attractive view. But many have argued that this simplicity comes at a cost: that it requires too many idealizations. This thesis aims to provide a justification of classical Bayesianism. Chapter One defends probabilism, classically understood, against the charge that by requiring <b>credences</b> to be precise real numbers, classical Bayesianism is committed to an overly precise conception of evidence. Chapter Two defends conditionalization, classically understood, against the charge that epistemic rationality consists only of synchronic norms. Chapter Three defends both probabilism and conditionalization against the objection that they require us, in some circumstances, to have <b>credences</b> that we can know are not {{as close to the}} truth as alternatives that violate Bayesian norms. by Jennifer Rose Carr.

40|$|Some {{examples}} {{suggest that}} religious <b>credences</b> respond to evidence. Other examples suggest they are wildly unresponsive. So the examples taken together suggest {{there is a}} puzzle about whether descriptive religious attitudes respond to evidence or not. I argue for {{a solution to this}} puzzle according to which religious <b>credences</b> are characteristically not responsive to evidence; that is, they do not tend to be extinguished by contrary evidence. And when they appear to be responsive, it is because the agents with those <b>credences</b> are playing what I call The Evidence Game, which in fundamental ways resembles the games of make-believe described by Walton's theory of make-believe...|$|R

40|$|Four {{important}} {{arguments for}} probabilism—the Dutch Book, representation theorem, calibration, and gradational accuracy arguments—have a strikingly similar structure. Each {{begins with a}} mathematical theorem, a conditional with an existentially quantified consequent, of the general form: if your <b>credences</b> are not probabilities, {{then there is a}} way in which your rationality is impugned. Each argument concludes that rationality requires your <b>credences</b> to be probabilities. I contend that each argument is invalid as formulated. In each case there is a mirror-image theorem and a corresponding argument of exactly equal strength that concludes that rationality requires your <b>credences</b> not to be probabilities.

I argue that the use of these 'Savagean' theorems create significant difficulties for both projects, but particularly the latter. The origin of the problem directly relates {{to the question of whether}} we can have <b>credences</b> regarding acts currently under consideration and the consequences which depend on those acts; I argue that such <b>credences</b> are possible. Furthermore, I argue that attempts to use Jeffrey's non-Savagean theorem (and similar theorems) in the service of these two projects may not fare much better...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{important}} sense in which an agent’s <b>credences</b> are universal: while they reflect an agent’s own judgments, those judgments apply equally to everyone’s bets.

The other is the well known "Judy Benjamin" problem concerning conditional <b>credences.</b> We argue that our results concerning the problems point to deficiencies of the framework.

40|$|Reasoning {{that takes}} into account self-locating {{evidence}} in apparently plausible ways sometimes yields the startling conclusion that rational <b>credences</b> are such as if agents had bizarre causal powers.

Furthermore, it suggests as a general desideratum for approaches to problems of self-locating belief that they should not recommend <b>credences</b> that are as if anyone had anomalous causal powers. Adopting this desideratum, as the paper shows, yields uniformly plausible verdicts on the most-discussed problems of self-locating belief...|$|R
40|$|I analyze {{a recent}} {{exchange}} between Adam Elga and Julian Jonker concerning unsharp (or imprecise) <b>credences</b> and decision-making over them.

Through the lens of computational complexity theory, I then argue that even though nonlinear valuations can be rational, they come in general at the price of computational intractability, and that this problematizes their use in defining rationality. I conclude that the meaning of "rationality" may be philosophically vague...|$|R
5|$|A further {{elaboration}} on {{this story}} is possibly found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia {{as if it were}} a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological <b>credence</b> to this fanciful version of events.|$|E

The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending <b>credence</b> to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E
5|$|After four largely injury-free seasons, {{the muscular}} {{injuries}} {{that had previously}} plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench {{in the second half}} and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave <b>credence</b> to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} representation theorem for expected utility theory {{tells us}} that if a subject’s preferences conform to certain axioms, then she can be represented as maximising her expected utility given {{a particular set of}} <b>credences</b> and utilities—and, moreover, that having those <b>credences</b> and utilities is the only way that she could be maximising her expected utility (given her preferences). However, the kinds of agents these theorems seem apt to tell us anything about are highly idealised, being (amongst other things) always probabilistically coherent with infinitely precise degrees of belief and full knowledge of all a priori truths. Ordinary subjects do not look very rational when compared to the kinds of agents usually talked about in decision theory. In this paper, I will develop an expected utility representation theorem aimed at the representation of those who are neither probabilistically coherent, logically omniscient, nor expected utility maximisers across the board—that is, agents who are frequently irrational. The agents in question may be deductively fallible, have incoherent <b>credences,</b> limited representational capacities, and fail to maximise expected utility for all but a limited class of gambles...|$|R
40|$|The {{cardinal}} epistemic good is {{the holding}} of beliefs that accurately reflect the facts. Believers {{have a duty to}} rationally pursue doxastic accuracy.

Moving <b>credences</b> closer to truth-values improves accuracy. Extensionality. b’s inaccuracy at is solely a function of the <b>credences</b> b assigns and the truth-values assigns. Propriety. If b is a probability, then b itself uniquely minimizes expected inaccuracy when expectations are calculated using b. Such an I captures a consistent way of valuing closeness to the truth...|$|R
40|$|Suppose we wish {{to provide}} a naturalistic account of {{intentionality}}. Like several other philosophers, {{we focus on the}} intentionality of belief, hoping that we may later supplement our account to accommodate other intentional states like desires and fears. Now suppose that we also take partial beliefs or <b>credences</b> seriously. In cashing out our favoured theory of intentionality, we may for the sake of simplicity talk as if belief is merely binary or all-or-nothing. But {{we should be able to}} supplement or modify our account to accommodate <b>credences.</b> I shall argue, however, that it is difficult to do so with respect to certain causal or teleological theories of intentionality-in particular, those advanced by the likes of Stalnaker (Inquiry, 1984) and Millikan (J Philos 86 : 281 – 297, 1989). I shall first show that such theories are tailor-made to account for the intentionality of binary beliefs. Then I shall argue that it is hard to extend or supplement such theories to accommodate <b>credences.</b> Finally, I shall offer some natural ways of modifying the theories that involve an appeal to objective probabilities. But unfortunately, such modifications face problems...|$|R
