500|$|Some tax protesters {{have cited}} the U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in the case of}} Eisner v. Macomber for the theory that wages are not taxable, or for the theory that dividends are not taxable. The case dealt with a stock dividend on stock that was essentially equivalent to a stock split, as opposed to a <b>cash</b> <b>dividend</b> on stock. In the case of this kind of [...] "dividend" [...] the stockholder does not receive anything or realize any additional value. For example, if a stockholder owns 100 shares of stock having a value of $4 per share, the total value is $400. If the corporation declares, say, a [...] "two for one" [...] stock dividend that is essentially similar to a stock split (and the corporation distributes no money or other property), the stockholder now has 200 shares with a value of $2 each, which is still $400 in value - i.e., no increase in value and no income. The pie is still the same size [...] but it's sliced into more pieces, each piece being proportionately smaller.|$|E
2500|$|A {{shareholder}} {{also makes}} no [...] "sale or other disposition" [...] of stock after {{this sort of}} stock dividend. The taxpayer still owns the same proportionate percentage of the corporation he or she owned prior to the stock dividend. Again, this is also true of a <b>cash</b> <b>dividend.</b>|$|E

[...] In effect, he argued that a stock dividend is really a <b>cash</b> <b>dividend,</b> since it is really two-step affair, consisting of 1. a cash distribution, 2. subsequently used to purchase additional shares through the exercise of stock subscription rights. [...] Brandeis saw no reason why two essentially identical transactions should be treated differently for tax purposes.|$|E

2500|$|Dividend {{policy is}} {{concerned}} with financial policies regarding the payment of a <b>cash</b> <b>dividend</b> in the present or paying an increased dividend at a later stage. [...] Whether to issue dividends, and what amount, is determined mainly {{on the basis of}} the company's unappropriated profit (excess cash) and influenced by the company's long-term earning power. When cash surplus exists and is not needed by the firm, then management is expected to pay out some or all of those surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends or to repurchase the company's stock through a share buyback program.|$|E
2500|$|However, several {{important}} factors distinguish a stock and <b>cash</b> <b>dividend.</b> [...] "Overall, {{the aim of}} the tax law is to impose a tax on [...] "dividends" [...] when assets representing corporate earnings are transferred to the shareholders. Stock dividends, however, merely give the shareholders additional pieces of paper to represent the same equitable interest; they do not transfer assets or create new priorities among the security-holders. The total value of the common shares, though now spread out over a larger number of units, is left unchanged from its previous level. In effect, nothing of substance has occurred." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cash {{dividends}} are {{the most}} common form of payment and are paid out in currency, usually via electronic funds transfer or a printed paper check. Such dividends are a form of investment income and are usually taxable to the recipient in the year they are paid. This is the most common method of sharing corporate profits with the shareholders of the company. For each share owned, a declared amount of money is distributed. Thus, if a person owns 100 shares and the <b>cash</b> <b>dividend</b> is 50 cents per share, the holder of the stock will be paid $50. [...] Dividends paid are not classified as an expense, but rather a deduction of retained earnings. [...] Dividends paid does not show up on an income statement but does appear on the balance sheet.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{solves the}} {{dispute between the}} free cash flow and {{tunneling}} hypotheses in explaining the role of <b>cash</b> <b>dividends</b> on asset expropriation of the controlling shareholders in Chinese listed firms. Investors value more the <b>cash</b> <b>dividends</b> and the <b>cash</b> holdings of firms with lower ownership control than those of firms with higher ownership control. This is more consistent with the tunneling hypothesis. However, when investment opportunities are considered, the free cash flow hypothesis better explains firms' dividend policy.

Bahia on the north east coast of Brazil was captured in 1624 but only held for a year before it was recaptured by a joint Spanish-Portuguese expedition. [...] In 1628, Piet Heyn captured the entire Spanish treasure fleet, and made off with a vast fortune in precious metals and goods that enabled the Company two years later to pay its shareholders a <b>cash</b> <b>dividend</b> of 70%, though the Company was to have relatively few other successes against the Spanish. [...] In 1630, the Dutch occupied the Portuguese sugar-settlement of Pernambuco {{and over the next}} few years pushed inland, annexing the sugar plantations that surrounded it. [...] In order to supply the plantations with the manpower they required, a successful expedition was launched in 1637 from Brazil to capture the Portuguese slaving post of Elmina, and in 1641 successfully captured the Portuguese settlements in Angola. In 1642, the Dutch captured the Portuguese possession of Axim in Africa. By 1650, the West India Company was firmly in control of both the sugar and slave trades, and had occupied the Caribbean islands of Sint Maarten, Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire in order to guarantee access to the islands' salt-pans.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a random}} sample of US {{companies}} affected by a regulatory experiment (i. e. the Regulation SHO adopted by the SEC in 2004), this thesis examines whether the removal of short-selling constraints affects corporate payout decisions. We find that companies pay higher <b>cash</b> <b>dividends</b> but do not repurchase more shares in response to the relaxation of short-selling constraints. The response of increased <b>cash</b> <b>dividends</b> is concentrated in small firms. Our finding is consistent with the literature that paying <b>cash</b> <b>dividends</b> can be used to deter short-selling activities as a more costly and hence a more reliable signal of stock undervaluation than share repurchases.

50|$|<b>Cash</b> <b>dividends</b> {{are good}} for {{people that want to}} {{liquidate}} their money from the market and not reinvest their <b>dividends.</b> However, <b>cash</b> <b>dividends</b> are not the only type of dividend. The main type of dividend referring to common stocks is called a stock <b>dividend.</b> Unlike <b>cash</b> <b>dividends,</b> stock dividends do not involve the distribution of cash to the common stock owners. Instead, a stock dividend distributes additional stock of the company to the owners of the company (people that own stocks of the company). Stock dividends have equity. They are even dispersed to the people who own stock depending on their portion of ownership in a corporation. If a corporation is declared a 20% stock dividend then this means the corporation will give out 2 shares for every 10 shares to the shareholders. Those are the two different types of dividends that can be offered to the shareholders of a common stock.|$|R

40|$|Based on option put-call parity relation, we derive {{model-free}} {{boundary conditions}} of option time value and option early exercise premium with presence of <b>cash</b> <b>dividends</b> on the underlying stock.

(1) For European options, {{the difference in}} time value between a call option and a put option is the discount interest earned on the exercise price less {{the present value of}} <b>cash</b> <b>dividends</b> to be paid before the option expiration. (2) For American options, the difference in time value between a call option and a put option is bounded between the negative amount of the present value of dividends and the discount interest earned on the exercise price. (3) The early exercise premium of an American put option is bounded between zero and the discount interest earned on the exercise price. (4) The early exercise premium of an American call option is bounded between zero and the present value of <b>cash</b> <b>dividends</b> to be paid before the option expiration. Based on results (3) and (4), the difference in early exercise premiums between an American put option and a call option is bounded below by the negative amount of the present value of <b>cash</b> <b>dividends</b> and bounded above by the discount interest earned on the exercise price. We numerically test these results in the Black-Scholes and binomial tree models. This paper contributes to the finance literature.
