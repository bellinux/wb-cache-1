50|$|Chantilly is {{also home}} to the Living Museum of the Horse, with stables built by the Princes of Condé. It is {{considered}} one of the more important tourist destinations in the Paris area. Chantilly gave its name to <b>Chantilly</b> <b>cream</b> and to <b>Chantilly</b> lace. The city was the base for the England National Football Team during the Euro 2016 Championship.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} of a wafer, considered {{a part of}} the traditional cuisine in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador, Venezuela, and México, is known as an oblea. It is usually eaten as a dessert with two pieces filled with arequipe, dulce de leche (milk caramel), and/or sweetened condensed milk in the middle. In some places, they might contain cheese, fruits, or <b>chantilly</b> <b>cream,</b> among others.|$|R
5000|$|In Greece, {{the pastry}} is called Μιλφέιγ, {{which is the}} {{transcription}} of the word mille-feuille using Greek letters. The filling between the layers is <b>cream</b> whereas <b>Chantilly</b> <b>cream</b> is used {{at the top of}} the pastry. It also has some resemblance to the traditional Greek dish of Galaktoboureko (literally [...] "milk börek"), though with this dish, the custard is baked with the pastry, rather than added afterwards.|$|R
2500|$|The {{invention}} of crème Chantilly is often credited incorrectly, and without evidence, to François Vatel, maître d'hôtel at the Château de Chantilly in the mid-17th century. But the name Chantilly is first connected {{with whipped cream}} in the mid-18th century, around {{the time that the}} Baronne d'Oberkirch praised the [...] "cream" [...] served at a lunch at the Hameau de Chantillybut did not say what exactly it was, or call it <b>Chantilly</b> <b>cream.</b>|$|R
25|$|Desserts and sweets {{are usually}} stuffed or covered with dulce de leche. The latter can be eaten alone or {{on top of}} cakes, alfajores, panqueques (creppes), and pastries, or as a topping spread over flan. <b>Chantilly</b> <b>cream</b> is widely {{consumed}} and used in preparing sweets and desserts. Additionally, cakes, sponge cakes, and puddings are very popular dishes. Italian ice-creams in this region also achieved a significant degree of development by adding local flavors that somehow preserved the local spirit involved in their preparation.|$|R
5000|$|In various South American {{countries}} such as Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Cuba, piononos are prepared using a dough made of flour, eggs, and sugar, which is baked in a thin sheet then rolled around a filling of dulce de leche sometimes with walnuts, or fruits like strawberries with <b>chantilly</b> <b>cream,</b> {{or in the case}} of savoury piononos with York ham, cheese, tomato and mayonnaise, or a savory salad, such as ham salad with asparagus and lettuce, chicken salad or even tuna. In Cuba and in several other countries it is also called [...] "Brazo de Gitano" [...] or [...] "Brazo Gitano".|$|R
2500|$|In 1900, Bernhardt {{presented}} L'Aiglon, a {{new play}} by Rostand. She played the Duc de Reichstadt, {{the son of}} Napoleon Bonaparte, imprisoned by his unloving mother and family until his melancholy death in the Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna. L'Aiglon was a verse drama, six acts long. The 56-year-old actress studied the walk and posture of young cavalry officers and had her hair cut short to impersonate the young Duke. The Duke's stage mother, Marie-Louise of Austria, was played by Maria Legault, an actress 14 years younger than Berhnardt. The play ended with a memorable death scene; according to one critic, she died [...] "as dying angels would die if they were allowed to." [...] The play was extremely successful; it was especially popular with visitors to the 1900 Paris International Exposition, and ran for nearly a year, with standing-room places selling {{for as much as}} 600 gold francs. The play inspired the creation of Bernhardt souvenirs, including statuettes, medallions, fans, perfumes, postcards of her in the role, uniforms and cardboard swords for children, and pastries and cakes; the famed chef Escoffier added Peach Aiglon with <b>Chantilly</b> <b>Cream</b> to his repertoire of desserts.|$|R
5000|$|A cremeschnitte (krempita, kremšnita, [...] krémes, kremówka, cremșnit or crempita, кремпита/krempita, Krémeš, Kremna rezina) is a <b>chantilly</b> and custard <b>cream</b> cake dessert {{popular in}} several Central European countries. There are many {{regional}} variations, {{but they all}} include a puff pastry base and custard cream.|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of fresh}} milk in coffee in cafés and {{restaurants}} is a newer phenomenon (from the 20th century) when refrigeration became common. The use of full cream is known much further {{back in time}} (but not in the use as whipped <b>cream</b> <b>chantilly</b> [...] ), as this was a product more easily stored and frequently used also in cooking and baking. Thus, a 'Kapuziner' was prepared with a very small amount of cream to get the 'capuchin' colour. Today, 'Kapuziner' is still served in viennese traditional cafés: still black coffee {{with only a few}} drops of cream (in some establishments developed into a capå of whipped cream).|$|R
