The chemical reaction used to produce the acetaldehyde used mercury sulfate as a catalyst. Starting August 1951, the <b>co-catalyst</b> was changed from manganese dioxide to ferric sulfide. A side reaction of this catalytic cycle led to the production of a small amount of an organic mercury compound, namely methylmercury.

A <b>co-catalyst</b> of palladium-copper is used in the coupling due to the improved reactivity that is achieved. [...] Sonogashira coupling reactions are advantageous in that the reaction has technical simplicity as well as functional group compatibility. CMPs are easily formed using this method due to the ease of rotation of alkynes in planar monomers to achieve a 3-D network. [...] The strength of these planar monomers can be tuned to control the pore diameters of CMPs. [...] Solvents in the Sonogashira coupling reaction can also play a role in the formation of CMPs. Solvents that facilitate the synthesis of CMPs best are dimethylformamide,1,4-dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran. These solvents help neutralize the formation of the hydrogen halide produced as a byproduct. A disadvantage of using terminal alkynes as a monomer, is that terminal alkynes readily undergo homocoupling under the presence of oxygen, so the reaction must be carried out without the presence of oxygen and water.|$|E
