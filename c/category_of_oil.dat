40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} the uncertainties {{that exist in}} estimating the remaining ultimately recoverable resources of oil globally including the reasons for these and, where possible, how they may be mitigated, resolved, or reduced in future assessments. The encompassing and ambiguous terms ‘conventional oil’ and ‘unconventional oil’ are disaggregated into the numerous categories of oil that exist within each. These categories are investigated individually {{in order to identify}} the specific uncertainties by which they are influenced and affected. A key finding is that there are intrinsic uncertainties within every <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> Future assessments of global oil resources and projections of oil production should hence acknowledge these issues, explain or assess the effects that they have on results, and present ranges in any estimates produced or provided. An initial estimate is made of the technically recoverable resources of the light tight oil often called ‘shale oil’: oil found in low permeability shale formations requiring stimulation to be extracted. These resources are estimated to range on a global scale between 150 and 508 billion barrels with a central estimate of 278  billion barrels...|$|E

40|$|The {{devastating effects}} of oil spill {{incidents}} on humans {{and the environment}} can be overwhelming. Effects such as loss of life, forced displacements, loss of property and serious health risks cannot be overlooked. Also, the long-term damage to the ecosystem, sea life and biodiversity {{are some of the}} long-term consequences of an oil spill incident. Thus, a swift response to oil spill incidents is always necessary in order to minimize these effects. The multi-agency response approach emphasizes a holistic and coordinated involvement of several related institutions and entities in order to ensure adequate response to any <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> spill incident. Even though the multi-agency approach seems to be already embedded in relevant legislation on oil spill control and containment in Nigeria, its operationalization has been less impressive.

40|$|In {{search for}} {{sustainable}} alternatives for fish meal and overseas vegetable protein sources some selected protein sources were evaluated. These included oil seed co-products, grain legumes and their concentrates, insects, leaf and aquatic proteins, etc. These sources differ substantially {{in terms of}} protein yield, environmental sustainability, nutritional value and availability. Products with a low dry matter content, i. e. lucerne, leaves, aquatic proteins {{are considered to be}} less sustainable due to the high energy costs for drying. Some values, however, are lacking for some of the protein sources. Within the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> seeds, European produced soybean meal seems to be the most promising alternative for soybean meal from beans imported from South America. Nutritional value and especially protein digestibility of soybean meal is very good. Protein yield of soybean meal produced in Europe should be further increased to make this crop feasible for the farmer. To realize this, varieties have to be selected with an ultra-short growth season. Within the category of grain legumes, peas seem the most promising alternative for soybean meal, at least for the short-term. The protein yield is reasonably high, but should be further improved. In long-term, leaf proteins and aquatic proteins probably might contribute to reduce soybean imports. Therefore, more knowledge regarding protein separating techniques and nutritional value of these products is necessary. Leafs, aquatic and insect protein sources are not in direct competition with the land use of other crops. Enhancing the protein content of these plant protein sources by processing needs further development; especially products such as duckweed and algae seems promising, but sustainability aspects should be studied. We also realize, that the nutritional value of products such as leaf proteins, some aquatic proteins and insects is not known sufficiently. For these sources, aspects of cell wall degradation, feed safety and legislation should definitely be covered. At this moment {{it is not possible to}} draw sound conclusions with respect to the environmental sustainability of the selected protein sources...|$|E

40|$|The Gulf is {{considered}} to be a young sea in decline, with poor prognosis for continuing production of abundant natural resources. We compare and contrast ‘monetary’ and ‘environmental’ compensation as mechanisms for addressing ecosystem damage in the Gulf. The 1992 International Oil Pollution Compensation Conventions settle claims financially, but only for certain <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> spills. For example, aside from inherent difficulties of valuing ecosystem services and their losses, ecological damage from the time of injury to recovery (interim losses) is not compensated. Another approach involves reimbursement for environmental action/projects to restore affected resources and offset impacts until recovery. In habitat equivalency analysis, mitigation requirements are calculated from the type(s), severity, duration and extent of resource impacts. This approach was utilized to resolve several claims for damage from the 1991 Gulf War oil spill. Various compensatory projects resulted, including direct oil spill remediation and other environmental projects such as the establishment of ≥ 1 protected area (x ha for y years). Besides compensation, in this paper we advocate setting threshold levels for the protection of different coastal and marine ecosystems. This could be achieved by a proportion (c. 30 %) of every major ecosystem becoming fully protected, through an expanded regional protected area network...|$|R

40|$|Efforts {{to limit}} {{cumulative}} emissions {{over the next}} century may be offset by emissions leakage, not only between countries but over time. Current price-cost margins for major reserves are ample, leaving scope for significant price reductions if climate policies alter demand for fossil fuels. This resource owner response to maintain extraction over time has been labelled the “green paradox, ” which has a “strong” form that implies intertemporal leakage may reach 100 %, and a “weak ” form that notes policies like a faster transition to clean energy may accelerate emissions, shortening the time to adapt and increasing damages. We contribute to this literature by isolating the effects of intertemporal leakage, using a model of multiple pools of different extraction costs. We compare the effects of five policy options: accelerating cost reductions in the clean backstop, taxing emissions, improving energy efficiency, a clean fuel blend mandate, and mandating carbon capture and sequestration. A stylized one-pool model identifies two types of equilibria that extend to multiple pools: full exhaustion of the last pool, and partial exhaustion of the last pool. All policies can reduce cumulative emissions, but the backstop policy accelerates extraction while conservation policies delay emissions. However, when comparing to {{what would happen in}} the absence of resource rent adjustment, we find that conservation policies have higher intertemporal leakage rates, and backstop policies can have lower leakage than an emissions tax. Leakage rates generally decline as targets become more stringent. We calibrate an extension of this model to five major <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|R

40|$|Oil and gas {{have been}} known since Antiquity but the modern oil {{industry}} had {{its roots in the}} middle of the 19 th Century in Pennsylvania and on the shores of the Caspian. In the early days, the discovery <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> was a hit or miss affair, but in later years it became a decidedly scientific and technological process. Perhaps the most important development was a geochemical breakthrough in the 1980 s that made it possible to relate the oil in a well with the rock in which it was generated. That in turn led to an understanding of the very exceptional conditions under which oil was formed in Nature. Advances in computer science also brought great progress in seismic surveying that made it possible to determine with great accuracy the nature of deeply buried geological structures. These scientific advances have not however been matched by clarity in reporting the results, which are clouded by ambiguous definitions and lax reporting practices. In short, it has been another example of poor accounting. Estimating the size of an oilfield poses no great technological challenge, although there is naturally a quantifiable range of uncertainty. Extrapolating the discovery trend of the past to determine future discovery and production should be straightforward, and the size distribution of fields should be evident. But the atrociously unreliable nature of public data has given much latitude when it comes to interpreting the status of depletion and the impact of economic and political factors on production. This has allowed two conflicting views of the subject to develop.

The final conclusion is that the opening of polish economy in 1989 might have revealed the real comparative advantages in trade between Poland and European Union...|$|R

One <b>category</b> <b>of</b> tested <b>oils</b> was the heat-treated type {{which is expected}} as degraded palm oil by heating during cooking. The degraded degree was controlled by the length of heating period, then the acid number, AN, was varied between 0 and 3. 5 [mgKOH/g]. For these oils, temperature dependence during friction test was examined on friction and wear between 40 - 100 ˚C. Degraded palm <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> higher acid number showed wear much more, and the wear for AN= 3. 5 showed almost double <b>of</b> non-heat treated <b>oil,</b> but half <b>of</b> mineral <b>oil,</b> VG 32, up to 85 ˚C. Friction coefficient did not show strong dependence of the acid number, and the value was 20 %-lower than VG 32 between 40 - 100 ˚C. The other was the free-fatty acid added type which is expected as degraded palm oil by hydrolysis during cooking where boiled water reacts with palm oil. Four model oils were prepared, {{and each of them}} contained one <b>of</b> major palm <b>oil</b> components, such as palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid, at 10 mass % to refined palm oil. For these oils, friction test was performed at 40 and 100 ˚C to examine the effect of temperature. Addition of stearic acid showed lowest wear and lowest friction at both temperatures among fatty acid added types. The experimental results are discussed with kinematic viscosity, apparent normal stress, and apparent tangential shear stress...|$|R
50|$|One very {{important}} aspect of the remit of the IOC is to draw up and update methods of analysis and standards for olive products with a view to promoting international trade and preventing fraud. To do so, it works very closely with leading chemists from its member countries who contribute their knowledge and expertise. It also cooperates with other international organisations such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) or the Codex Alimentarius Commission in order to bring their testing methods and standards into line with IOC texts. The IOC has two trade standards, one for olive oils and olive pomace oils and the other for table olives. The olive oil standard fixes the names and definitions <b>of</b> the different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> olive <b>oils</b> and olive pomace oils as well the quality and purity criteria for each grade of product; it specifies testing methods and covers other aspects, such as food additives, contaminants, hygiene, packing, pack fill tolerances and labelling. IOC Members are committed to prohibiting the use of any product names other than those specified in the standard. The table olive standard fixes the names, definitions and requirements for all the different types, styles and trade preparations of table olives.|$|R
40|$|Dietary fat, both {{in terms}} of {{quantity}} and quality, has been implicated to cancer development, either positively or negatively. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether olive oil or monounsaturated fat intake was associated with the development of cancer. A systematic search of relevant studies, published in English, between 1990 and March 1, 2011, was performed through a computer-assisted literature tool (i. e., Pubmed). In total 38 studies were initially allocated; of them 19 case-control studies were finally studied (13800 cancer patients and 23340 controls were included). Random effects meta-analysis was applied in order to evaluate the research hypothesis. It was found that compared with the lowest, the highest <b>category</b> <b>of</b> olive <b>oil</b> consumption was associated with lower odds of having any type of cancer (log odds ratio = - 0. 41, 95 %CI - 0. 53, - 0. 29, Cohran's Q = 47. 52, p = 0. 0002, I-sq = 62 %); the latter was irrespective of the country of origin (Mediterranean or non-Mediterranean). Moreover, olive oil consumption was associated with lower odds of developing breast cancer (logOR = - 0, 45 95 %CI - 0. 78 to - 0. 12), and a cancer of the digestive system (logOR = - 0, 36 95 %CI - 0. 50 to - 0. 21), compared with the lowest intake. The strength and consistency of the findings states a hypothesis about the protective role <b>of</b> olive <b>oil</b> intake on cancer risk. However, it is still unclear whether olive oil's monounsaturated fatty acid content or its antioxidant components are responsible for its beneficial effects...|$|R
