40|$|Optical {{interconnects}} {{represent an}} attractive alternative {{technology for the}} implementation of dense, high-speed interconnects, as they do not suffer from many of the problems plaguing electrical interconnects such as frequency-dependent <b>crosstalk</b> and <b>attenuation.</b> However, optics has still not been accepted commercially as an interconnect technology. There is concern regarding the cost and complexity of the optomechanics needed to achieve the very fine alignments necessary to guarantee that the light emitted from the source actually falls on the receiver. The demonstration of a simple-to-assemble, dense and robust optical interconnect would constitute an important proof of the practicality of this technology. The photonic backplane demonstrator system presented in this thesis addresses these issues through a novel approach; the system uses slow Gaussian beams (f/ 16) and a clustered design to maximize misalignment tolerances. This in turn relaxes the positioning and packaging requirements for the components, thus simplifying assembly. This thesis pursues two sets of complementary goals; the first set is concerned with the demonstration of some desirable optomechanical characteristics for optical interconnects such as passive alignment, repeatability and stability while the second set of goals is concerned with a verification of hypotheses often used in the design and implementation of optical interconnects. Such hypotheses are often used in practice to design optical interconnects despite the fact that little data exists in the literature to warrant their use. It therefore makes good sense to spend some time verifying the accuracy of these models. This will provide a solid engineering foundation for the design of future systems...|$|R
40|$|State-of-the-art {{interconnect}} {{design is}} very challenging. Designers are facing ever more stringent design specifications {{expressed in terms}} of bandwidth, speed, <b>crosstalk,</b> signal <b>attenuation,</b> etc. that dictate the need for powerful modeling tools. It is of a paramount importance that these tools are able to very accurately incorporate all substrate loss mechanisms and the finite conductivity and shape of the metallic interconnects. From this perspective, macromodels describing all high-frequency behavior are extremely useful to analyze the signal integrity (SI) behavior of the interconnects. Often, interconnect structures are characterized by using their cross-sectional geometry in a two-dimensional (2 -D) electromagnetic (EM) simulation, leading up to a corresponding transmission line model [1]. An accurate description of the interconnects is then provided in terms of their per unit of length (p. u. 1.) resistance (R), inductance (L), conductance (G) and capacitance (C) parameters, yielding so-called RLGC(f) models. Here, f denotes the frequency, as such indicating the frequency-dependent character of the p. u. l. parameters. For a comprehensive overview of such modeling methods, the reader is encouraged to consult [1] and the references therein. For on-chip lines that are electrically very short, sometimes, the p. u. l. resistance R and capacitance C are dominant (RC regime). In the present paper, however, all four p. u. l. parameters are considered, making the approach more general and also valid at very high frequencies.

40|$|Abstract—Methods of {{quantitative}} emission computed tomog-raphy require compensation for linear photon attenuation. A current trend in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) is to employ transmission scanning to reconstruct the attenuation map. Such an approach, however, considerably complicates both the scanner design and the data acquisition protocol. A dramatic simplification could be made if the attenuation map could be obtained directly from the emission projections, {{without the use of}} a transmission scan. This can be done by applying the consistency conditions that enable us to identify the operator of the problem and, thus, to reconstruct the attenuation map. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the discrete consistency conditions. One of the main advantages of the suggested method over previously used continuous conditions is that it can easily be applied in various scanning configurations, including fully three-dimensional (3 -D) data acquisition protocols. Also, it provides a stable numerical implementation, allowing us to avoid the <b>crosstalk</b> between the <b>attenuation</b> map and the source function.

40|$|Organic {{thin film}} {{transistors}} and ferroelectric polymer (polyvinylidene difluoride) sheet material are integrated to form various sensors for stress/strain, acoustic wave, and Infrared (heat) sensing applications. Different from silicon-based transistors, organic thin film transistors can be fabricated and processed in room-temperature and integrated {{with a variety}} of substrates. On the other hand, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) exhibits ferroelectric properties that are highly useful for sensor applications. The wide frequency bandwidth (0. 001 Hz to 10 GHz), vast dynamic range (100 n to 10 M psi), and high elastic compliance (up to 3 percent) make PVDF a more suitable candidate over ceramic piezoelectric materials for thin and flexible sensor applications. However, the low Curie temperature may have impeded its integration with silicon technology. Organic thin film transistors, however, do not have the limitation of processing temperature, hence can serve as transimpedance amplifiers to convert the charge signal generated by PVDF into current signal that are more measurable and less affected by any downstream parasitics. Piezoelectric sensors are useful for a range of applications, but passive arrays suffer from <b>crosstalk</b> and signal <b>attenuation</b> which have complicated the development of array-based PVDF sensors. We have used organic field effect transistors, which are compatible with the low Curie temperature of a flexible piezoelectric polymer,PVDF, to monolithically fabricate transimpedance amplifiers directly on the sensor surface and convert the piezoelectric charge signal into a current signal which can be detected even in the presence of parasitic capacitances. The device couples the voltage generated by the PVDF film under strain into the gate of the organic thin film transistors (OFET) using an arrangement that allows the full piezoelectric voltage to couple to the channel, while also increasing the charge retention time. A bipolar detector is created by using a UV-Ozone treatment to shift the threshold voltage and increase the current of the transistor under both compressive and tensile strain. An array of strain sensors which maps the strain field on a PVDF film surface is demonstrated in this work. The strain sensor experience inspires a tone analyzer built using distributed resonator architecture on a tensioned piezoelectric PVDF sheet. This sheet is used as both the resonator and detection element. Two architectures are demonstrated; one uses distributed directly addressed elements as a proof of concept, and the other integrates organic thin film transistor-based transimpedance amplifiers monolithically with the PVDF sheet to convert the piezoelectric charge signal into a current signal for future applications such as sound field imaging. The PVDF sheet material is instrumented along its length and the amplitude response at 15 sites is recorded and analyzed {{as a function of the}} frequency of excitation. The determination of the dominant frequency component of an incoming sound is demonstrated using linear system decomposition of the time-averaged response of the sheet using no time domain detection. Our design allows for the determination of the spectral composition of a sound using the mechanical signal processing provided by the amplitude response and eliminates the need for time-domain electronic signal processing of the incoming signal. The concepts of the PVDF strain sensor and the tone analyzer trigger the idea of an active matrix microphone through the integration of organic thin film transistors with a freestanding piezoelectric polymer sheet. Localized acoustic pressure detection is enabled by switch transistors and local transimpedance amplification built into the active matrix architecture. The frequency of detection ranges from DC to 15 KHz; the bandwidth is extended using an architecture that provides for virtually zero gate/source and gate/drain capacitance at the sensing transistors and low overlap capacitance at the switch transistors. A series of measurements are taken to demonstrate localized acoustic wave detection, high pitch sound diffraction pattern mapping, and directional listening. This system permits the direct visualization of a two dimensional sound field in a format that was previously inaccessible. In addition to the piezoelectric property, pyroelectricity is also exhibited by PVDF and is essential in the world of sensors. An integration of PVDF and OFET for the IR heat sensing is demonstrated to prove the concept of converting pyroelectric charge signal to a electric current signal. The basic pyroelectricity of PVDF sheet is first examined before making a organic transistor integrated IR sensor. Then, two types of architectures are designed and tested. The first one uses the structure similar to the PVDF strain sensor, and the second one uses a PVDF capacitor to gate the integrated OFETs. The conversion from pyroelectric signal to transistor current signal is observed and characterized. This design provides a flexible and gain-tunable version for IR heat sensors...|$|R
