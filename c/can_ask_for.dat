5|$|Norway has {{a unified}} police, {{which means that}} there is a single police {{organization}} and that police power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails that police officers have no geographical or sector limitations to their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including the healthcare authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when it is necessary to enact a decision by force. Conversely, the police <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under armed attack.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{one and two}} player modes, both {{of which}} are single screen. In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Jr.; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challenging: Donkey Kong <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> negative numbers, and the absolute values of the target numbers are in the hundreds instead of the tens.|$|E

The answer is given as follows: every such module H {{can be given}} an M-dimension dimM(H) (not its dimension as a complex vector space) such that modules are isomorphic {{if and only if}} they have the same M-dimension. The M-dimension is additive, and a module is isomorphic to a subspace of another module if and only if it has smaller or equal M-dimension.|$|E
25|$|The Health / Hauora curriculum, {{including}} the sexuality education component, {{is the only}} part of the New Zealand Curriculum / Te Matauranga o Aotearoa (the former for English-medium schools, the latter for Māori-medium schools) in which state and state-integrated schools must legally consult with the school community regarding its delivery, and the consultations must occur at least once every two years. Parents <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> their children to be removed from the sexuality education component of the health curriculum for any reason, provided they apply in writing to the school principal, and do so at least 24 hours beforehand so alternative arrangements can be made. However, this does not prevent a teacher answering sexuality education questions if a student, excluded or not, asks them.|$|E
25|$|An MP <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> {{leave to}} move the {{adjournment}} of Parliament {{for the purpose of}} discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance. If the MP obtains the general assent of Parliament or at least eight MPs rise in their places to support the motion, the motion stands adjourned until 5:30pm on the same day. At that time, any proceedings on which Parliament is engaged are suspended so that the urgent matter may be raised. Proceedings on the motion for adjournment may continue until the moment of interruption, whereupon if they have not been completed the motion lapses. The postponed proceedings are resumed either on the disposal or the lapse of the motion for adjournment. Not more than one such motion for adjournment may be made at any one sitting.|$|E

25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E
500|$|The archetypal {{example of}} an {{invariant}} is the discriminant B2 − 4AC of a binary quadratic form Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2. This is called an invariant because it is unchanged by linear substitutions x→ax + by, y→cx + dy with determinant ad − bc = 1. These substitutions form the special linear group SL2. (There are no invariants under the general linear group of all invertible linear transformations because these transformations can be multiplication by a scaling factor. To remedy this, classical invariant theory also considered relative invariants, which were forms invariant up to a scale factor.) One <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> all polynomials in A, B, and C that are unchanged {{by the action of}} SL2; these are called the invariants of binary quadratic forms, and {{turn out to be the}} polynomials in the discriminant. More generally, one <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> the invariants of homogeneous polynomials A0xr'y0 + ... + A'rx0y'r of higher degree, which will be certain polynomials in the coefficients A0, ..., A'r, and more generally still, one can ask the similar question for homogeneous polynomials in more than two variables.|$|E

Life is also a journey, and everyone has to face difficulties like Odysseus, when he returned from Troy. When you reach Ithaca, you have gained so much experience from the voyage, that it is not very important if you reached your goals (e.g. Odysseus returned all alone). Ithaca cannot give you riches, but she gave you the beautiful journey.|$|E
