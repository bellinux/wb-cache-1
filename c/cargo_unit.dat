30|$|Due to the {{unreliability}} of {{the rail}} transports COOP choose trailers and not swap bodies as <b>cargo</b> <b>units.</b> Swap bodies have a lower net weight (three tonnes; they can accommodate 18 pallets) than trailers (ten tonnes; they can accommodate 33 pallets). For COOP, in 90  % of all cases {{the volume of the}} products (rather than the weight) is the limiting factor when filling <b>cargo</b> <b>units.</b> The use of trailers with a higher net weight than swap bodies leads tentatively to higher energy costs per tonne-kilometre; these extra costs are negligible for COOP.|$|R

50|$|Cassette system’s high loading {{capacity}} {{is based on}} high payload on a cassette and reduced lashing on board. Usually lashings are not mandatory if the cassettes are stowed on blocks. Block stowing of cassettes increases the vessels capacity even 20% compared to some other cargo handling methods. This is possible {{due to the fact}} that there’s no need for additional lashings around the cassette. In block stowing the cassettes are stowed tightly side-by-side. When handling cargo units in traditional way, units are lashed with external lashings. This takes ship’s deck space around the <b>cargo</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

50|$|The open hatch bulk carrier, often {{referred}} to as OHBC or conbulker, is designed to offer direct access to the hold through hatches which extend the full width of the vessel. As a result, large cargo units can be lowered into place. If it is possible, the holds or hatches are designed around standard <b>cargo</b> <b>unit</b> sizes. Sometimes a gantry crane is fitted. There is special attention for cargo-handling shipping gear. These conbulkers are expensive because there is extra steel necessary to widen the hatches. This is crucial to provide strength. The open hatches are useful for forest products, such as pre-slung timber and logs. The heavy units are more easy to handle than in a conventional bulk carrier. The open hatch bulk carriers {{can also be used to}} carry containers on the outward leg, and dry bulk on the return leg. The first open hatch bulk carrier was built in 1962, for the use of paper trade.|$|E
30|$|The {{condition}} T_ 1 < l_min /v_ 1 signals self-impediment (see Fig.  2 b) {{that occurs}} if a self-loaded general <b>cargo</b> <b>unit</b> still blocks the input {{area at the}} end of handling the following general <b>cargo</b> <b>unit.</b> If the speed of conveyer 1 is too low or, put in another way, the operator at station 1 acts to fast, the preceding general <b>cargo</b> <b>unit</b> has not had enough time to leave the input area. Assuming that the current general <b>cargo</b> <b>unit</b> then will be placed immediately after the preceding one, there will be effectively no vacant space left between the two units.|$|E

Experimental results on real life data show significant improvements on both objectives compared to the results obtained by an experienced planner...|$|R

30|$|On the one hand, {{impediment}} can {{be caused}} by the presence of a self-loaded general <b>cargo</b> <b>unit</b> that has not yet left the input area in the moment when the next general <b>cargo</b> <b>unit</b> is ready to be placed on the conveyer belt. This phenomenon is called self-impediment. On the other hand, at subsequent input stations of a multistage feeder system, impediment may and usually will be caused by traversing general cargo from previous input stations. This article is largely focused on the latter type of impediment, mutual impediment (see Sect.  2).|$|E
30|$|While, in principle, l_GC and l_min may be {{different}} for each individual general <b>cargo</b> <b>unit</b> and thus represent random variables, both shall be assumed constant for simplicity.

An illustration of the basic structure is shown in Fig.  4.|$|E

40|$|High and heavy’ <b>cargo</b> <b>units</b> {{are carried}} {{around the world}} on roll-on-roll-off (ro-ro) ships. These <b>cargo</b> <b>units</b> are loaded and {{unloaded}} using rolltrailers and the risk of rollover for the trailer-cargo unit, during port manoeuvre, often needs to be assessed in short time. On request by Wallenius Marine AB in Stockholm, this thesis examines the dynamics of the rolltrailer and different methods to predict the risk of rollover. The objective is to present a theoretical foundation for a toolbox that can support the assessment of trailer-load combinations. The study focuses on the effect of running over ‘bumps’. An analytic model, based on assumptions of the transfer of energy in the rollover scenario, as well as a simulation, within the SimMechanics environment, was developed and the two were compared. The models produced almost identical output under the circumstances specified. The conclusion was that the assumptions made in the analytic model were reasonable and that the model can be used to characterize the trailer-cargo unit’s stability. The major reservation was that some dynamic properties of the trailer had been neglected and that the model does not account for a sequence of inputs and resonance effects. The recommendation given is to develop the analytic model to an application for practical use. A developed SimMechanics simulation, on the other hand, can be used to examine additional dynamic aspects, resonance effects and other types of influences. Such results could support the decision making regarding what safety margin should be applied to the analytic result...|$|R

30|$|A new {{feeding system}} that {{substantially}} reduces mutual impediment was conceived, simulated and validated {{with the help}} of a prototype in [12]: the divided conveyer belt feeder. A sequence of conveyer belts with sequentially increasing speeds, in combination with spatially variable input (denoted variable input in the following), guarantees that there is always sufficient vacant space at subsequent input stations such that another general <b>cargo</b> <b>unit</b> can be loaded. The divided conveyer belt with variable input is discussed in Sect.  3.|$|E
30|$|For k_E > 2 + k_GC≈ 3, i.e. {{for input}} areas of width b_E > 2 l_min + l_GC≈ 3 l_min, the {{expression}} for the maximum idle time becomes negative, {{which does not}} make sense technically. But it simply indicates an (unnecessary) surplus of input space, which may be available or not, depending on whether there is an immediately following general <b>cargo</b> <b>unit</b> or not. In particular, for model 3 with b_E = 3 l_min, i.e. k_E = 3, there appears no idle time at all. Mutual impediment arising from the presence of general cargo from station 1 at the input area of station 2 is eliminated.|$|E
