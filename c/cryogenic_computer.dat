50|$|In February 2013 the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity started <b>Cryogenic</b> <b>Computer</b> Complexity (C3) {{program which}} envisions a new {{generation}} of superconducting supercomputers that operate at exascale speeds based on Superconducting logic. In December 2014 it announced a multi-year contract with International Business Machines, Raytheon BBN Technologies and Northrop Grumman to develop the technologies for C3 program.|$|E
40|$|The {{methods that}} have been {{developed}} to determine the three-dimensional crystal and molecular structures while they are in metastable or short-lived photoactivated states are described. The structural science of photocrystallography has developed {{over the last two decades}} because of the use of synchrotron radiation, coupled with advances in <b>cryogenics,</b> <b>computer</b> hardware and software, and laser technology. Initial studies have been carried out on metastable linkage isomers and LIESST-generated metastable structures and, more recently, by using the synchronisation of laser pulses with X-ray pulses, it has been possible to determine the structures of complexes with microsecond lifetimes. In the future X-ray Laue techniques and one-shot XFEL studies applied to molecular systems promise to make the study of sub-microsecond species a reality...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} an intermediate-level laboratory experiment to determine the temperature- dependent characteristic temperature of beryllium. The apparatus {{used to measure the}} resistance of a beryllium wire sample between liquid nitrogen and room temperatures was simple. The characteristic temperatures obtained from these data using the Block-Gr√ºneisen model are in reasonable agreement with literature values obtained from resistivity and heat capacity experiments. The experiment introduced students to <b>cryogenic</b> and <b>computer</b> data analysis techniques and forced them to extend their knowledge of the theory of electrical resistance and of characteristic temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The Centaur space {{launch vehicle}} {{airborne}} computer, which was primarily used to perform guidance, navigation, and sequencing tasks, was further used to monitor and control inflight pressurization and venting of the <b>cryogenic</b> propellant tanks. <b>Computer</b> software flexibility also provided a failure detection and correction capability necessary to adopt and operate redundant hardware techniques and enhance the overall vehicle reliability...|$|R
40|$|Correction of airfoil {{data for}} {{sidewall}} boundary-layer effects requires {{a knowledge of}} the boundary-layer displacement thickness and the shape factor with the tunnel empty. To facilitate calculation of these quantities under various test conditions for the Langley 0. 3 m Transonic <b>Cryogenic</b> Tunnel, a <b>computer</b> program was written. This program reads the various tunnel parameters and the boundary-layer rake total head pressure measurements directly from the Engineering Unit tapes to calculate the required sidewall boundary-layer parameters. Details of the method along with the results for a sample case are presented...|$|R
40|$|Although the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) has {{repeatedly}} demonstrated {{the capability to}} perform during launch, the High Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump (HPOTP) main shaft bearings have not met their 7. 5 hour life requirement. A tester is being employed to provide the capability of subjecting full scale bearings and seals to speeds, loads, propellants, temperatures, and pressures which simulate engine operating conditions. The tester design permits much more elaborate instrumentation and diagnostics than could be accommodated in an SSME turbopump. Tests were made to demonstrate the facilities; and the devices' capabilities, to verify the instruments in its operating environment and to establish a performance baseline for the flight type SSME HPOTP Turbine Bearing design. Bearing performance data from tests are being utilized to generate: (1) a high speed, <b>cryogenic</b> turbopump bearing <b>computer</b> mechanical model, and (2) a much improved, very detailed thermal model to better understand bearing internal operating conditions. Parametric tests were also made {{to determine the effects}} of speed, axial loads, coolant flow rate, and surface finish degradation on bearing performance...|$|R
5000|$|After hacking {{into the}} {{training}} simulator, the player (in the chronological {{order of the}} map menu layout) arrives at {{what seems to be}} an underground city filled with snipers, drones and some insect-like creatures that are presumably analogues of computer viruses. After completing the City map, the player arrives at the [...] "Base" [...] map (described in-game as an abandoned mine site in an alien planetary colony). There, like the City, the player battles through a 6-floor map {{in order to get to}} the Kernel and defeat the level's boss. Upon making their way through the Base, the player will have to travel through the [...] "Ruins" [...] map to complete Sector 1 Training - unlike the past maps, this map contains a majority of insect and flora-like enemies and at points appears to be of Egyptian or Aztec influence. After making their way through the Ruins, the player will hack into a new and more dangerous sector called [...] "Sector 2 Training". Like the previous maps they are also named City, Base and Ruins but possess shifts in visuals throughout progression - for example, Sector 2 City is at first almost identical to Sector 1 City, but about halfway through the art style and decoration immediately shift to a more Japanese aesthetic (interestingly, Sector 2 City is the only map to have a visible sky) - Sector 2 Base changes from an exposed, industrial warehouse look to a colder military outpost with what appear to be <b>cryogenic</b> pods and <b>computer</b> databases that can be destroyed, and Sector 2 Ruins changes to a darker and much more technologically advanced ruin.|$|R
