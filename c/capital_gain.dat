The richest 2 percent of Americans receive more than 50 percent of all <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> Claims that <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> recipients only appear to be rich because their <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> income is transitory are not supported by longitudinal data. Likewise, claims that a large fraction of the benefits from <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax reductions flow to middle income taxpayers result from failing to consider tax shelters. <b>Capital</b> <b>gains</b> on corporate stocks are considerably more concentrated among high income indi-viduals than <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> on other assets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In a {{cross-border}} takeover, the {{tax base}} associated with future <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> is transferred from target shareholders to acquirer shareholders. Cross-country differences in <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax rates enable us to estimate the discount in the takeover price on account of future <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> The estimation suggests that a one percentage point increase in the <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax rate reduces the valuation of new equity by 0. 136 %. The implied average effective tax rate on <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> is 4. 57 %, indicating that <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation is a significant cost to firms when raising new equity capital. Apart from the taxation of future <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> we also find that takeover prices are affected by <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation resulting from the accelerated realization of past <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> by target shareholders...|$|R
40|$|Lowering or {{eliminating}} {{the tax on}} <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> may be a tempting undertaking for Canada's federal government facing electorate pressure. It {{may also be a}} tempting course of action for interest groups and public policy stakeholders. To analyse the merits of such a policy measure, this paper explores two queries. Fist, how the previous changes in <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation affected the level of realization of <b>capital</b> <b>gains?</b> And, second, do provincial differences in tax rates transpire into differences in the intensity of realizing <b>capital</b> <b>gains?</b> The analysis shows that only {{a relatively small number of}} Canadians report <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> and a smaller proportion of them effectively pay taxes on <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> The changes in <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax rate introduced in 2000 lead to only a temporary increase in intensity and volume of realized <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> Similarly, no significant increase in holdings of capital assets by households was observed. The analysis of provincial differences in tax rates levied on <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> also does not conclusively show that lower tax rates lead to a higher turnover of investments. <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> taxation of <b>capital</b> <b>gains...</b>|$|R

25|$|Corporate {{taxable profits}} (ordinary income) are taxed at a flat rate of 27%. The tax base {{is the sum}} of {{operating}} profit/loss, financial revenues and net capital gains minus tax depreciation. In addition, the profit is taxed on the owner's hand through dividend and <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> taxation.|$|E
25|$|A <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a dividend. Generally, a <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> occurs where a capital asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a tax on capital gains (often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.|$|E
25|$|The {{part of the}} {{dividend}} that is not exceeding a risk-free return on the investment, is not taxed on {{the hand of the}} shareholder, and is thus subject to the 28% company taxation only.

40|$|From 1922 to 1986, {{long-term}} <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> were {{taxed at}} lower rates than other income, generally by allowing {{a portion of}} long-term <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> to be excluded from taxable income. While taxing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> at the same rates as other income has been hailed {{by some as a}} major accomplishment of tax reform, it has been criticized by others as one of its main flaws. As a result, there have been proposals each year since 1986 to restore some type of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> preference. These proposals have sparked a lively debate centered on three main questions: Would reducing the <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax lower or raise federal revenues?

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxes on investment decisions {{is a central}} issue of accounting and public finance research. However, the implications of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxes on investors' willingness to invest in irreversible projects with entry and exit flexibility {{have not yet been}} a focal issue. As a result, the effects of taxing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> on the interdependencies of investment and divestment decisions have to be identified, especially under timing flexibility. This paper closes this gap by simultaneously analyzing investment timing and abandonment decisions for risky irreversible investment projects with uncertain cash flows under differential tax rates for ordinary income and <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> We investigate whether <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxes affect immediate and delayed investment asymmetrically. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation on the optimal abandonment decision. Performing extensive numerical simulations we find that varying the liquidation proceeds affects the decision whether or not to postpone the investment decision. Higher cash flow volatility favors delayed investment. We find that the introduction of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation tends to be harmful for immediate investment. Moreover, we show that taxing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> may induce a tax paradox for delayed investment. Depending on the pre-tax parameter setting the future value of delayed investment may even increase in absolute terms for increasing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax rates. For sufficiently high liquidation proceeds <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation tends to favor continuation of a project. We find taxing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> mainly induces other, but not necessarily less arbitrary distortions than exempting <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> [...] ...|$|R
25|$|An inverse ETF, {{like any}} {{leveraged}} ETF, needs to buy {{when the market}} rises and sell when it falls {{in order to maintain}} a fixed leverage ratio. This results in a volatility loss proportional to the market variance. Compared to a short position with identical initial exposure, the inverse ETF will therefore usually deliver inferior returns. The exception is if the market declines significantly on low volatility so that the <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> outweighs the volatility loss. Such large declines benefit the inverse ETF because the relative exposure of the short position drops as the market fall.|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions {{imposing}} {{an income}} tax treat capital gains as part of income subject to tax. <b>Capital</b> <b>gain</b> is generally a gain on sale of capital assets—that is, those assets not held {{for sale in the}} ordinary course of business. Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held. Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for ordinary income, there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital. Some tax scholars have argued that differences in the ways different kinds of capital and investment are taxed contribute to economic distortions.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{structured}} for tax efficiency {{and can be}} more attractive than mutual funds. In the U.S., whenever a mutual fund realizes a <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> that is not balanced by a realized loss, the mutual fund must distribute the capital gains to its shareholders. This can happen whenever the mutual fund sells portfolio securities, whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund. In contrast, ETFs are not redeemed by holders (instead, holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market, as they would a stock, or effect a non-taxable redemption of a creation unit for portfolio securities), so that investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares or when the ETF trades to reflect changes in the underlying index.|$|E
40|$|The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA 97) {{significantly}} {{changed the}} tax treatment of housing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> in the United States. Before 1997, homeowners {{were subject to}} <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation when they sold their houses unless they purchased replacement homes of equal or greater value. Since 1997, homeowners can exclude $ 500, 000 of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> when they sell their houses.

Using ZIP-code level housing price indexes and sales on single-family houses data from 1982 to 2006 in 16 affluent towns within the Boston metropolitan area, this paper finds that TRA 97 reversed the lock-in effect of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxes on houses with low and moderate <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> However, TRA 97 may have generated an unintended lock-in effect on houses with <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> over the maximum exclusion amount. In addition, this paper exploits legislative changes in <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax rate to estimate the tax elasticity of home sales during the post-TRA 97 period.

50|$|A <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax (CGT) {{is a tax}} on <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> {{the profit}} {{realized}} {{on the sale of}} a non-inventory asset that was greater than the amount realized on the sale.

25|$|Taxable income {{includes}} capital gains. However, {{individuals are}} taxed {{at a lower}} rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below). A <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those assets not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Capital losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses {{is limited to the}} total capital gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately). An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Gains on depreciable property used in a business are treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{simplicity}} {{depends on}} the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require brokers and mutual funds to calculate the realized <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> on all sales and redemption. If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% {{of the amount of}} the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers {{at the end of the}} period. Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies.|$|E
25|$|If one invests $100 in {{an inverse}} ETF {{position}} in an asset worth $100, and the asset's value changes to $80 {{and then to}} $60, then {{the value of the}} inverse ETF position will increase by 20% (because the asset decreased by 20% from 100 to 80) and then increase by 25% (because the asset decreased by 25% from 80 to 60). So the ETF's value will be $100*1.20*1.25=$150. The gain of an equivalent short position will however be $100–$60=$40, and so we see that the <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> of the ETF outweighs the volatility loss relative to the short position. However, if the market swings back to $100 again, then the net profit of the short position is zero. However, since the value of the asset increased by 67% (from $60 to $100), the inverse ETF must lose 67%, meaning it will lose $100. Thus the investment in shorts went from $100 to $140 and back to $100. The investment in the inverse ETF, however, went from $100 to $150 to $50.|$|E
