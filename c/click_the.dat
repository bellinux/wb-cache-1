The name also refers to the computer keystroke that connects women (and men) to the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Lau et al. {{set up an}} {{experiment}} where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to <b>click</b> <b>the</b> mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, {{and the other was}} given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16ms, and shifted back the 14ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.|$|E

Described as [...] "rp, rp, rp, rp, rrrrrp", the sound is produced when single muscular contractions <b>click</b> <b>the</b> tymbal inward, buckling 7–9 of the tymbal ribs, each of which produces a pulse. This occurs alternately on the two tymbals and is rapidly repeated at a frequency of about 143Hz (in groups of four except when the cicada is in distress– when they are ungrouped and at a lower frequency), giving a pulse repetition frequency of around 1050 per second, with a relatively broad sound frequency range of 7.5–10.5kHz, that has a dominant frequency (at which the peak energy is observed) of 9.5–9.6kHz.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "singing" [...] of male cicadas is not stridulation such as many {{familiar}} {{species of}} insects produce, crickets, for example. Instead, male cicadas have a noisemaker called a tymbal below {{each side of}} the anterior abdominal region. The tymbals are structures of the exoskeleton formed into complex membranes with thin, membranous portions and thickened ribs. Contraction of internal muscles buckles the tymbals inwards, thereby producing a click; on relaxation of the muscles, the tymbals return to their original position, producing another <b>click.</b> <b>The</b> male abdomen is largely hollow, and acts as a sound box. By rapidly vibrating these membranes, a cicada combines the clicks into apparently continuous notes, and enlarged chambers derived from the tracheae serve as resonance chambers with which it amplifies the sound. The cicada also modulates the song by positioning its abdomen toward or away from the substrate. Partly by the pattern in which it combines the clicks, each species produces its own distinctive mating songs and acoustic signals, ensuring that the song attracts only appropriate mates.|$|E
