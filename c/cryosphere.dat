5|$|The {{mesosphere}} of Venus can {{be divided}} into two layers: the lower one between 62–73km and the upper one between 73–95km. In the first layer the temperature is nearly constant at 230K (−43°C). This layer coincides with the upper cloud deck. In the second layer temperature starts to decrease again reaching about 165K (−108°C) at the altitude of 95km, where mesopause begins. It is the coldest part of the Venusian dayside atmosphere. In the dayside mesopause, which serves as a boundary between the mesophere and thermosphere and is located between 95–120km, temperature increases to a constant—about 300–400K (27–127°C)—value prevalent in the thermosphere. In contrast, the nightside Venusian thermosphere is the coldest place on Venus with temperature as low as 100K (−173°C). It is even called a <b>cryosphere.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} 12 focus groups that {{organize}} research involving {{two or more}} sections. These are atmospheric and space electricity; <b>cryosphere</b> sciences; Earth and planetary surface processes; Earth and space science informatics; mineral and rock physics; global environmental change; natural hazards; near surface geophysics; nonlinear geophysics; paleoceanography and paleoclimatology; study of the Earth's deep interior; and societal impacts and policy sciences.|$|E
25|$|Cryobiology is {{the branch}} of biology that studies the effects of low {{temperatures}} on living things within Earth's <b>cryosphere</b> or in science. The word cryobiology {{is derived from the}} Greek words κρῧος , « cold », βίος , « life », and λόγος , « word » (hence science). In practice, cryobiology is the study of biological material or systems at temperatures below normal. Materials or systems studied may include proteins, cells, tissues, organs, or whole organisms. Temperatures may range from moderately hypothermic conditions to cryogenic temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Earth science {{generally}} recognizes 4 spheres, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and {{the biosphere}} as correspondent to rocks, water, air, and life respectively. Some scientists include, {{as part of}} the spheres of the Earth, the <b>cryosphere</b> (corresponding to ice) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere, as well as the pedosphere (corresponding to soil) as an active and intermixed sphere. Earth science (also known as geoscience, the geosciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. There are four major disciplines in earth sciences, namely geography, geology, geophysics and geodesy. These major disciplines use physics, chemistry, biology, chronology and mathematics to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas or spheres of Earth.|$|E
25|$|Geobiology is a {{field of}} {{scientific}} research that explores the interactions between the physical Earth and the biosphere. It is a relatively young field, and its borders are fluid. There is considerable overlap with the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, paleontology, and particularly biogeochemistry. Geobiology applies the principles and methods of biology and geology {{to the study of}} the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth as well as the role of life in the modern world. Geobiologic studies tend to be focused on microorganisms, and on the role that life plays in altering the chemical and physical environment of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and/or <b>cryosphere.</b> It differs from biogeochemistry in that the focus is on processes and organisms over space and time rather than on global chemical cycles.|$|E
25|$|Snow cover has {{the second-largest}} areal extent of any {{component}} of the <b>cryosphere,</b> with a mean maximum areal extent of approximately 47 million km2. Most of the Earth’s snow-covered area (SCA) {{is located in the}} Northern Hemisphere, and temporal variability is dominated by the seasonal cycle; Northern Hemisphere snow-cover extent ranges from 46.5 million km2 in January to 3.8 million km2 in August. North American winter SCA has exhibited an increasing trend over much of this century (Brown and Goodison 1996; Hughes et al. 1996) largely in response to an increase in precipitation. However, the available satellite data show that the hemispheric winter snow cover has exhibited little interannual variability over the 1972-1996 period, with a coefficient of variation (COV=s.d./mean) for January Northern Hemisphere snow cover of < 0.04. According to Groisman et al. (1994a) Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover should exhibit a decreasing trend to explain an observed increase in Northern Hemisphere spring air temperatures this century. Preliminary estimates of SCA from historical and reconstructed in situ snow-cover data suggest this is the case for Eurasia, but not for North America, where spring snow cover has remained close to current levels over most of this century. Because of the close relationship observed between hemispheric air temperature and snow-cover extent over the period of satellite data (IPCC 1996), there is considerable interest in monitoring Northern Hemisphere snow-cover extent for detecting and monitoring climate change.|$|E
500|$|Liquid water cannot {{exist on}} the surface of Mars due to low {{atmospheric}} pressure, which is less than 1% that of Earth's, except at the lowest elevations for short periods. The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of [...] A permafrost mantle stretches from the pole to latitudes of about 60°. Large quantities of water ice are thought to be trapped within the thick <b>cryosphere</b> of Mars. Radar data from Mars Express and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show large quantities of water ice at both poles (July 2005) and at middle latitudes (November 2008). The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008.|$|E
500|$|Samus awakens in a Galactic Federation {{facility}} after {{dreaming about}} her battle on planet Zebes with Mother Brain {{and the death}} of an infant Metroid. After leaving the facility, Samus receives a distress signal from a derelict vessel known as the [...] "Bottle Ship". There, Samus meets the Galactic Federation 07th Platoon, among which her old colleagues from her military career: commanding officer Adam Malkovich, and point man Anthony Higgs. After Samus saves the platoon from monsters, Adam allows her to cooperate with the platoon under the condition that she follow his orders, and assigns the platoon to go on solo searches to investigate the Bottle Ship. Samus and the 07th Platoon heads to the Biosphere's Exam Center, where they learn that the ship's director, Dr. Madeline Bergman, had conducted research on illegal bioweapons for the Federation. After a mysterious reptilian creature attacks before being driven off, Adam directs Samus to follow the monster to the Pyrosphere, but is quickly directed to the <b>Cryosphere</b> in search for survivors. There, Samus encounters a woman in a lab coat, but is attacked by an unidentified 07th Platoon soldier. Realizing there is a traitor amongst the platoon, Samus dubs him the [...] "Deleter".|$|E

2500|$|The <b>cryosphere</b> (from the Greek [...] kryos, [...] "cold", [...] "frost" [...] or [...] "ice" [...] and [...] sphaira, [...] "globe, ball") {{is those}} {{portions}} of Earth's surface where water is in solid form, including sea ice, lake ice, river ice, snow cover, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, and frozen ground (which includes permafrost). Thus, {{there is a}} wide overlap with the hydrosphere.

2500|$|The word glacier is a loanword from French {{and goes}} back, via Franco-Provençal, to the Vulgar Latin , {{derived from the}} Late Latin , and {{ultimately}} Latin , meaning [...] "ice". The processes and features caused by or related to glaciers {{are referred to as}} glacial. The process of glacier establishment, growth and flow is called glaciation. The corresponding area of study is called glaciology. Glaciers are important components of the global <b>cryosphere.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Frozen ground (permafrost and {{seasonally}} frozen ground) occupies approximately 54 million km2 of {{the exposed}} land {{areas of the}} Northern Hemisphere (Zhang et al., 2003) and therefore has the largest areal extent of any component of the <b>cryosphere.</b> Permafrost (perennially frozen ground) may occur where mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) are less than -1 or -2nbsp&°C and is generally continuous where MAAT are less than -7nbsp&°C. In addition, its extent and thickness are affected by ground moisture content, vegetation cover, winter snow depth, and aspect. The global extent of permafrost is still not completely known, but it underlies approximately 20% of Northern Hemisphere land areas. Thicknesses exceed 600 m along the Arctic coast of northeastern Siberia and Alaska, but, toward the margins, permafrost becomes thinner and horizontally discontinuous. The marginal zones will be more immediately subject to any melting caused by a warming trend. Most of the presently existing permafrost formed during previous colder conditions and is therefore relic. However, permafrost may form under present-day polar climates where glaciers retreat or land emergence exposes unfrozen ground. Washburn (1973) concluded that most continuous permafrost is in balance with the present climate at its upper surface, but changes at the base depend on the present climate and geothermal heat flow; in contrast, most discontinuous permafrost is probably unstable or [...] "in such delicate equilibrium that the slightest climatic or surface change will have drastic disequilibrium effects".|$|E

5000|$|Many {{different}} {{theories have}} been advanced for how floods of water {{came to be}} released {{with the formation of}} chaotic terrain. Evidence for the involvement of water has been found—minerals associated with water, such as grey, crystalline hematite and phyllosilicates, are present in chaos regions. [...] Many explanations for the creation of chaos involve the sudden melting of giant reservoirs of ground ice. Some researchers have suggested that a frozen layer, called a <b>cryosphere,</b> developed over a long time period and then something triggered it to rupture and melt suddenly. The rupturing event may have been impacts,magma movements, seismic activity, [...] volcanic tectonic strains, [...] increased pore pressure, or the dissociation of clathrates. A clathrate composed of carbon dioxide and methane could have explosively dissociated, thereby liquefying water-saturated sediments. A variation of this idea of a <b>cryosphere</b> is that an aquifer was created along with the <b>cryosphere.</b> As more and more ice was added resulting in a thicker <b>cryosphere,</b> the water in the aquifer became pressurized. [...] When something like an impact or movement of magma broke or melted the <b>cryosphere,</b> floods of water under great pressure were released. However, further calculations showed that the great channels could not have been produced with just a single discharge. [...] Later proposals advanced the notion that the geological shapes present in chaos regions could have been made by a series of over a 100 flooding events.|$|E
