40|$|To date, {{the most}} {{developed}} models of <b>compromise</b> {{in situations of}} value conflict {{come out of the}} bargaining theory or rational choice theory literature. While useful in <b>compromises</b> over more straightforward preferences and interests, these models are shown to be seriously limited when applied to decisions involving moral commitments and moral <b>compromise,</b> especially among firm moral believers. A series of arguments is offered to motivate <b>compromise</b> over moral commitments, and these arguments attempt to take seriously the experience of the firm believer who is not moved by the straightforward maximizing arguments offered by bargaining theory. Two types of <b>compromise</b> are defended: separation <b>compromises</b> and direct <b>compromises.</b> The first defends indirect forms of <b>compromise</b> or assent to <b>compromise</b> where the damage done to firm moral beliefs is minimized through varying degrees of psychological distancing. Separation <b>compromises</b> include the use of arbiters, reliance on procedural solutions to conflict, separation between private and public or professional roles, withholding of intent, and symbolic gestures of protest or dissent. These indirect <b>compromises,</b> while often the only way of protecting firm beliefs and avoiding protracted conflict by assenting to <b>compromise,</b> come at a sometimes tragic price; at the very least the agent will still be complicit in the <b>compromise,</b> and responsible for immoral <b>compromises.</b> A second, more positive account of <b>compromise</b> is then defended. Three arguments are offered to motivate direct <b>compromise,</b> even among firm believers, in situations where there is some willingness among all parties concerned to at least enter into debate. The first is an appeal to the often self-defeating implications of protracted conflict and "walking away". The second argument appeals to moral fallibility. The third argument demonstrates the important relationship between our underdetermined moral principles and certain forms of conceptual compromise; <b>compromise</b> on this third account can be an important way of filling out our underdetermined regions of moral belief and principle. In closing, the normative limits on moral <b>compromise</b> are considered, as generated by appeals to fairness, moral complicity, and moral integrity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the concept of <b>compromise</b> in {{organization}} studies. The concept of <b>compromise</b> is often mobilized in discourses. Nevertheless, it seems difficult to comprehend this concept, while it can help us to enhance our understanding about organization structuring. The aim is to propose a conceptual framework {{in order to understand the}} shaping of <b>compromise,</b> and the roles of <b>compromises</b> in organization. The main contribution is in the understanding of concept of <b>compromise</b> both as a process and a state. <b>Compromise</b> also understands itself as an actant mobilized and redefined in practice by actors to mediate their interaction and coordinate themselves. Thus, <b>compromise</b> enables and constrains interaction because it carries on irreversibility in the organizational process. From a case study based on the development of an Information System for Human Resource Management in a bank during the financial crisis, I illustrate the conceptual framework, and I discuss three roles and effects of <b>compromises</b> in organizational process: the importance of the first <b>compromise</b> in organizational process, the <b>compromise</b> as an ongoing update equilibrium between concession and gift, and the materialization of <b>compromise</b> to objective modalities. compromise; organizational process; coordination; Actor Network Theory;...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to specify}} the feasibility conditions of <b>compromise.</b> More specifically, {{the goal of this}} dissertation is to specify the conditions of increasing the feasibility of <b>compromise.</b> The underlying assumption here is that feasibility is a scalar concept, meaning that a socio-political ideal can be feasible to different degrees (Lawford-Smith 2013). In order to specify the conditions of increasing the feasibility of <b>compromise,</b> it is necessary to first identify potential feasibility constraints. The main chapters of this dissertation are devoted to this task. My research identifies two kinds of feasibility constraints that <b>compromise</b> potentially faces: A psychological feasibility constraint on realizing moral <b>compromise</b> (i. e. <b>compromise</b> on moral issues) and a structural feasibility constraint on realizing fair <b>compromise.</b> The psychological feasibility constraint consists in what I call an “affective aversion” to <b>compromise.</b> Affective aversion designates a deep emotional reluctance to <b>compromise</b> on moral values, which, I propose, can be reduced by cultivating an affective attitude of respect for other persons. The structural feasibility constraint refers to the process through which a <b>compromise</b> is achieved. I argue that if a fair <b>compromise</b> is the goal, the process of compromising needs to be based on deliberation rather than on the negotiation or bargaining processes that are commonly associated with <b>compromise.</b> Based on these results, my research indicates a) that an affective cultivation of respect is a condition for increasing the feasibility of moral compromise; and b) that deliberation, not negotiation or bargaining, is a condition for increasing the feasibility of fair <b>compromise...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo {{understand}} how collaborative work practices emerge and evolve throughout activities, {{the purpose of}} this paper is to comprehend the making of <b>compromises</b> from a process view. <b>Compromises</b> are here understood as constantly evolving throughout activities. Design/methodology/approach: The author relies on the Actor-Network Theory to define two dynamics participating in the making of compromises: the translation and the association. These two dynamics are then illustrated with a case study about the development of a Human Resource Management device that took place in a bank in Luxembourg. From this case, the author focuses on the emergence of various <b>compromises</b> about the project’s purpose. Findings: Based on the insights brought by the theoretical framework and case studies, <b>compromise</b> is understood as a temporary result of the translations and associations between humans and non-humans. <b>Compromise</b> is also anything that is shared by actors (meaning, categories, objectives, etc). that enables them to make their collective activity possible. This process view of <b>compromises</b> makes three contributions: it fully recognizes that <b>compromise</b> is not stable but situated in practices, it highlights the mediating role of <b>compromises</b> and it insists on the interrelation between <b>compromises</b> throughout the activity. Originality/value: The matter of <b>compromise</b> has mainly been studied from a moral standpoint as a stable agreement, whatever the context.
