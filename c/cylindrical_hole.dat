60|$|Between {{himself and}} the {{illuminated}} space on which he gazed--his breath quick and his eyes widely distended--there seemed to be nothing at all. To all appearances he was looking into a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>hole</b> a few feet deep.

60|$|When in this neighbourhood, I {{several times}} {{heard of the}} Sierra de las Cuentas: a hill distant many miles to the northward. The name signifies hill of beads. I was assured that vast numbers of little round stones, of various colours, each with a small <b>cylindrical</b> <b>hole,</b> are found there. Formerly the Indians used to collect them, {{for the purpose of}} making {{necklaces}} and bracelets--a taste, I may observe, which is common to all savage nations, {{as well as to the}} most polished. I did not know what to understand from this story, but upon mentioning it at the Cape of Good Hope to Dr. Andrew Smith, he told me that he recollected finding on the south-eastern coast of Africa, about one hundred miles to the eastward of St. John's river, some quartz crystals with their edges blunted from attrition, and mixed with gravel on the sea-beach. Each crystal was about five lines in diameter, and from an inch to an inch and a half in length. Many of them had a small canal extending from one extremity to the other, perfectly cylindrical, and of a size that readily admitted a coarse thread or a piece of fine catgut. Their colour was red or dull white. The natives were acquainted with this structure in crystals. I have mentioned these circumstances because, although no crystallised body is at present known to assume this form, it may lead some future traveller to investigate the real nature of such stones.|$|E
60|$|Another {{and smaller}} species of Furnarius (F. cunicularius), resembles the oven-bird {{in the general}} reddish tint of its plumage, in a {{peculiar}} shrill reiterated cry, and in an odd manner of running by starts. From its affinity, the Spaniards call it Casarita (or little housebuilder), although its nidification is quite different. The Casarita builds its nest {{at the bottom of}} a narrow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>hole,</b> which is said to extend horizontally to nearly six feet under ground. Several of the country people told me, that when boys, they had attempted to dig out the nest, but had scarcely ever succeeded in getting to the end of the passage. The bird chooses any low bank of firm sandy soil by the side of a road or stream. Here (at Bahia Blanca) the walls round the houses are built of hardened mud, and I noticed that one, which enclosed a courtyard where I lodged, was bored through by round holes in a score of places. On asking the owner the cause of this, he bitterly complained of the little casarita, several of which I afterwards observed at work. It is rather curious to find how incapable these birds must be of acquiring any notion of thickness, for although they were constantly flitting over the low wall, they continued vainly to bore through it, thinking it an excellent bank for their nests. I do not doubt that each bird, as often as it came to daylight on the opposite side, was greatly surprised at the marvellous fact.|$|E
40|$|Flow {{visualisation}} experiments {{related to}} turbine film cooling have been conducted. These investigated the fluid mechanics of coolant ejection using a large-scale, flat-plate model at engine-representative Reynolds numbers in a low-speed tunnel with ambient-temperature mainstream flow. The coolant trajectories were captured using a fine nylon mesh covered with thermochromic liquid crystals, allowing measurement of gas temperature contours in planes {{perpendicular to the}} flow. Three injection geometries were assessed: <b>cylindrical</b> <b>holes</b> with stream-wise injection, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>holes</b> with cross-stream injection, and fan-shaped holes. The data demonstrated that the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>holes</b> produced discrete jets, which lifted off the surface at high coolant-to-mainstream momentum flux ratios; these jets were characterised by the kidney-shaped stream-tubes expected for injection into cross-flow. The jets injected with cross-stream momentum exhibited a more obvious kidney-shaped cross-section, which rotated with distance downstream of injection. The jets from the fan-shaped holes were attached to the surface even at high momentum flux ratios, were more diffuse, and exhibited two cores of high temperature. The trajectory visualisation data were used to interpret the adiabatic cooling effectiveness measured at the surface...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{experiments}} on the scattering of surface-elastic waves by a periodic array of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>holes.</b> The experiments were {{performed in a}} marble quarry by drilling <b>cylindrical</b> <b>holes</b> in two different configurations: honeycomb and triangular lattices. The attenuation spectra of the surface waves show the existence of absolute band gaps for elastic waves in these semi-infinite two-dimensional crystals. Results are compared with theoretical calculations based on a scalar-wave approach. The scaling property of the underlying theory has led us to explore the possible application of the results obtained to the attenuation of surface waves in seismic movements. © 1999 The American Physical Society.

60|$|Intelligence {{shown by}} worms in their manner of {{plugging}} up their burrows.--If {{a man had}} to plug up a small <b>cylindrical</b> <b>hole,</b> with such objects as leaves, petioles or twigs, he would drag or push them in by their pointed ends; but if these objects were very thin relatively {{to the size of}} the hole, he would probably insert some by their thicker or broader ends. The guide in his case would be intelligence. It seemed therefore worth while to observe carefully how worms dragged leaves into their burrows; whether by their tips or bases or middle parts. It seemed more especially desirable to do this in the case of plants not natives to our country; for although the habit of dragging leaves into their burrows is undoubtedly instinctive with worms, yet instinct could not tell them how to act in the case of leaves about which their progenitors knew nothing. If, moreover, worms acted solely through instinct or an unvarying inherited impulse, they would draw all kinds of leaves into their burrows in the same manner. If they have no such definite instinct, we might expect that chance would determine whether the tip, base or middle was seized. If both these alternatives are excluded, intelligence alone is left; unless the worm in each case first tries many different methods, and follows that alone which proves possible or the most easy; but to act in this manner and to try different methods makes a near approach to intelligence.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} the data about {{heat transfer coefficient}} ratios, film cooling effectiveness and heat loads for the injection through <b>cylindrical</b> <b>holes,</b> 3 -in- 1 holes and fanned holes in order to characterize the film cooling performance downstream of a row of holes with 45 ° inclination and 3 hole spacing apart. The trip wire is placed upstream {{at a distance of}} 10 times diameter of the cooling hole from the hole center to keep mainstream fully turbulent. Both inlet and outlet of 3 -in- 1 holes have a 15 ° lateral expansion. The outlet of fanned holes has a lateral expansion. CO 2 is applied for secondary injection to obtain a density ratio of 1. 5. Momentum flux ratio varies from 1 to 4. The results indicate that the increased momentum flux ratio significantly increases heat transfer coefficient and slightly improve film cooling effectiveness for the injection through <b>cylindrical</b> <b>holes.</b> A weak dependence of heat transfer coefficient and film cooling effectiveness, respectively, on momentum flux ratio has been identified for the injection through 3 -in- 1 holes. The increase of the momentum flux ratio decreases heat transfer coefficient and significantly increases film cooling effectiveness for the injection through fanned holes. In terms of the film cooling performance, the fanned holes are the best while the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>holes</b> are the worst among the three hole shapes under study...|$|R

The sensitivity of longitudinal waves of near grazing incidence is higher than of SH waves in depths between 7 and 11 mm. Comparable sensitivities are reached with SH and longitudinal waves for crack-line defects in the austenitic cladding/ferritic base material interface. Surface defects can only be detected with SH waves. From the ferritic side all test reflectors are detected by SH waves.

Aerodynamic and thermal tests were carried out at low Mach number. To evaluate the interaction of injected flow with secondary flows a 5 hole probe was traversed downstream of the trailing edge plane.
