25|$|Technical dives may {{alternatively}} {{be defined}} as dives where the diver cannot safely ascend directly to the surface either due to a mandatory decompression stop or a physical ceiling. This form of diving implies a much larger reliance on redundancy of <b>critical</b> <b>equipment</b> and procedural training since the diver must stay underwater until {{it is safe to}} ascend or the diver has successfully exited the overhead environment.|$|E
25|$|Technical diving {{encompasses}} multiple {{aspects of}} diving, that typically share lack of {{direct access to}} surface, which {{may be caused by}} physical constraints, like an overhead environment, or physiological, like decompression obligation. In case of emergency, therefore, the diver or diving team must be able to troubleshoot and solve the problem underwater. This requires planning, situational awareness, and redundancy in <b>critical</b> <b>equipment,</b> and is facilitated by skill and experience in appropriate procedures for managing reasonably foreseeable contingencies.|$|E

A number of techniques such as dissolved gas analysis (DGA), polarization and depolarization currents (PDC) measurement and frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) have been adopted across utilities for transformer insulation diagnosis. However, there are still considerable challenges remaining in interpreting measured data of these techniques. This paper develops machine learning algorithms, which utilise archived data for making insulation diagnosis on the transformer of interest. Analysis and interpretation of field test data are presented in the paper...|$|R
25|$|Cleaning is an {{important}} part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing on the horse. Sweat and dirt also tend to cause cracking in leather, which may result in breaking. This not only decreases the value of the saddle, but can be very dangerous if <b>critical</b> <b>equipment,</b> such as a stirrup leather, breaks mid-ride. Proper care and conditioning of the saddle will not only increase its useful life, but will also help to retain its value.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, New York City began a {{four-year}} project to upgrade and reactivate the flushing tunnel. [...] The proposed plans included steps to [...] "reconstruct the motor pit {{and replace the}} propeller with three modern vertical turbines; clean, patch and smooth {{the interior of the}} tunnel; replace the broken sewer pipe and encase it in concrete to improve water flow; and reduce the amount of sewer overflow into the canal by increasing capacity at a nearby pumping plant." [...] Increasing oxygen content was a major goal of the project. The original plans were modified in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy, to protect <b>critical</b> <b>equipment</b> from flooding. [...] In 2014, following completion of much of the work, [...] the tunnel was reactivated at a cost of $177 million.|$|E
2500|$|On August 15, 1944, {{airborne}} {{units of}} the 6th Army Group provisional airborne division, commanded by U.S. Major General Robert T. Frederick, opened Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France, with a dawn assault. Called the [...] "1st Airborne Task Force", the force was composed of the 1st Special Services Forces, British 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade, the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, the 509th and 551st Parachute Infantry Battalions, the glider-borne 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion, and supporting units. Nearly 400 aircraft delivered 5,600 paratroopers and 150 guns to three drops zones surrounding Le Muy, between Fr√©jus and Cannes, in phase 1, Operation Albatross. Once they had captured their initial targets, they were reinforced by 2,600 soldiers and <b>critical</b> <b>equipment</b> carried in 408 gliders daylight missions code-named Operation Bluebird, phase 2, simultaneous with the beach landings, and Operation Dove, phase 3. A second daylight parachute drop, Operation Canary, dropped 736 men of the 551st PIB with nearly 100% effectiveness late {{on the afternoon of}} August 15. The airborne objective was to capture the area, destroy all enemy positions and hold the ground until the U.S. Seventh Army came ashore.|$|E

2500|$|The first United States all-female {{team was}} led by Jones in 1969. Her team, which {{included}} the first women to {{set foot on the}} South Pole, were used by the navy as a publicity stunt, [...] "paraded around" [...] and called [...] "Powderpuff explorers". The first United States woman to step into in the Antarctic interior in 1970 was engineer Irene C Peden, who also faced various barriers to her working on the continent. Peden describes how a [...] "mythology had been created about the women who'd gone to the coast -- that they had been a problem," [...] and that since they had not published their work within the year, they were [...] "heavily criticized." [...] Men in the Navy in charge of approving her trip to Antarctica were [...] "dragging their feet", citing that there were not women's bathrooms available and that without another female companion, she {{would not be allowed to}} go. The admiral in charge of transportation to Antarctica suggested that Peden was trying to go there for adventure, or to find a husband, rather than for her research. Despite her setbacks, including not receiving <b>critical</b> <b>equipment</b> in Antarctica, Peden's research on the continent was successful.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there are}} hazards {{specifically}} associated with solo diving, {{most of these}} can be planned for and their consequences mitigated {{by the use of}} appropriate equipment. In technical diving, where redundancy of <b>critical</b> <b>equipment</b> is standard policy, self-sufficiency is emphasised and taught more extensively than in recreational diving. This philosophy should also be followed by solo divers. A solo diver operating beyond the range for acceptable risk for a controlled emergency swimming ascent needs to carry a second, independent source of suitable breathing gas, which includes a regulator and preferably a submersible pressure gauge. This emergency gas supply typically {{takes the form of a}} pony bottle, or for more demanding diving, a twin tank set with the capability of independent operation of each tank. Additional equipment carried may include a backup dive computer, a backup dive light and a backup dive mask. The diver must be [...] familiar with the equipment configuration used and be able to access the equipment easily if it is needed. A solo diver needs to be particularly aware of overall personal fitness and health and the limitations it may impose on their ability to manage an emergency. Finally, the solo diver may dive a more conservative dive plan than he/she might dive with an equally competent buddy diver.|$|E

5000|$|Almost all {{avionics}} now incorporate BIST. In avionics, {{the purpose}} is to isolate failing line-replaceable units, which are then removed and repaired elsewhere, usually in depots or at the manufacturer. Commercial aircraft only make money when they fly, so they use BIST to minimize the time on the ground needed for repair and to increase the level of safety of the system which contains BIST. Similar arguments apply to military aircraft. When BIST is used in flight, a fault causes the system to switch to an alternative mode or equipment that still operates. <b>Critical</b> flight <b>equipment</b> is normally duplicated, or redundant.
