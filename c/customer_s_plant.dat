40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a firm-strategy perspective {{to the global}} combat against environmental pollution. We find that U. <b>S.</b> <b>plants</b> release less toxic emissions when their parent firm imports more from low-wage countries (LWCs). Consistent with the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, goods imported by U. S. firms from LWCs are in more pollution-intensive industries; U. <b>S.</b> <b>plants</b> also shift production to less pollution-intensive industries and spend less on pollution abatement when their parent firm imports more from LWCs. The negative impact of LWC imports on toxic emissions is stronger for U. <b>S.</b> <b>plants</b> located in counties with more powerful institutions, but weaker for more-capable U. <b>S.</b> <b>plants</b> and firms. These results highlight the role of local institutions and firm capabilities in explaining firms’ choice of offshoring and environmental strategy...|$|R

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} {{that supported the}} hypothesis that the mutation to the psbA plastid gene that confers S-triazine resistance (R) in Brassica napus also results in an altered diurnal pattern of photosynthetic carbon assimilation (A) relative to that of the susceptible (S) wild type, and that these patterns change over the ontogeny of a plant. Photosynthetic photon flux density, under closely controlled environmental conditions, was incrementally increased and decreased {{on either side of the}} midday maxima of 1150 to 1300 μmol quanta m− 2 s− 1. In all experiments, A approximately tracked the increasing and decreasing diurnal light levels. Younger (3 - to 4 -leaf) R plants had greater photosynthetic rates early and late in the diurnal light period, whereas those of <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> were greater during midday as well as during the photoperiod as a whole. These relative photosynthetic characteristics of R and <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> changed in several ways with ontogeny. As the plants aged during the vegetative phase of development, <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> gradually assimilated more carbon in the early, and then in the late, part of the day. At the end of the vegetative phase of development, R plant carbon assimilation was less relative to <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> at most times of the day, and was never greater. This relationship between the two biotypes dramatically changed with the onset of the reproductive phase (8 ½ to 9 ½ leaf) of plant development: R plants assimilated more carbon than <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> during all periods of the diurnal light period with the exception of the late part of the day. In addition to these differences in A, R plant stomatal function differed from that in <b>S</b> <b>plants.</b> R plant leaves were always cooler than <b>S</b> <b>plant</b> leaves under the same environmental and diurnal conditions. Correlated with this difference in leaf temperature were equal or greater total conductances to water vapor and intercellular CO 2 partial pressures in R compared to S leaves in most instances. These studies indicate a more complex pattern of photosynthetic carbon assimilation than previously observed. The photosynthetic superiority of one biotype relative to the other was a function of the time of day and the age of the plant. These studies also suggest that R plants may have an adaptive advantage over <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> in certain unfavorable ecological niches independent of the presence of S-triazine herbicides, such as cool, low-light environments early and late in the day, as well as late in the plants' development. This advantage could result in R biotypes appearing in populations of a species in greater numbers than plastidic mutation alone could cause...|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} of hereditary endophytic fungi, {{and the effects}} on grass persistence strategies (i. e. relative investment in sexual reproduction and vegetative growth) under natural conditions may help to predict how some alpine ecosystems will respond to environmental change. Grass persistence and endophyte maintenance in host populations are closely related, but could become independent due to endophyte loss mechanisms. We used native grass and endophyte populations {{to test the hypothesis}} that fungal endophytes manipulate grass persistence strategies to secure endophyte maintenance in plant populations. Two conditions were required to verify this hypothesis: 1) the fungus caused alterations in host plant strategies; and 2) plant phenotypic changes induced by the fungal endophyte increased endophyte transmission. We compared symbiotic (S) and non-symbiotic (NS) persistence strategies of Festuca eskia (Poaceae), an alpine grass infected by the asexual form of the fungal endophyte Epichloë festucae. We characterised endophyte transmission efficiency, and described vegetative growth and sexual reproduction in a field population that naturally supports approximately 50 % <b>S</b> <b>plants.</b> We built a demographic model to estimate plant vegetative growth rates. A correlation between plant persistence strategy, and fungal maintenance was evaluated by increasing soil resource levels. Under natural conditions, <b>S</b> and NS <b>plants</b> exploited different persistence strategies in the same population; <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> exhibited greater vegetative growth than their NS counterparts, while maintaining the same reproductive output. In response to higher soil resource levels, <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> shifted in persistence strategies and phenology, whereas NS plants maintained the same strategies. Therefore, results suggested the fungal endophyte fine-tuned host persistence strategies according to soil resource level. Finally, we found no direct relationship between the changes induced by fungal endophyte and endophyte transmission. Consequently, fungal endophytes affected host persistence strategies, but did not directly increase endophyte transmission. 10 page(s...|$|R
