5|$|Polyols, {{compounds}} containing {{more than}} one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution {{the presence of the}} sugar is signaled by a <b>color</b> <b>change</b> from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.|$|E
30|$|In our {{previous}} studies [12, 13], <b>color</b> <b>changes</b> in hinoki wood (Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl.) and cellulose filter paper {{as a major}} component of wood were successfully analyzed using a kinetic approach, which allowed precise prediction of <b>color</b> <b>changes</b> at any temperature and time within the experimental ranges.

These results show that cellulose is a major component that contributes to <b>color</b> <b>changes</b> of wood, however, other wood components such as extractives, lignin, hemicelluloses and minor components also have effects on <b>color</b> <b>changes</b> of wood, especially on the chromatic characteristics. The successful kinetic analysis indicated that the thermal oxidation might cause the <b>color</b> <b>changes</b> of wood as well as cellulose, irrespective of treatment temperatures. The values of activation energy calculated from each color parameters of wood were {{lower than those of}} cellulose in all color parameters. The lower activation energy may be due to wood components other than cellulose. While <b>color</b> <b>changes</b> of ligno-cellulosic materials are due to the multiple and/or interactive effect of their components, the <b>color</b> <b>changes</b> of cellulose certainly contributes to that of ligno-cellulosic materials.|$|R
5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a <b>color</b> <b>change</b> occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E
5|$|Robert Shaffer defined four {{forms of}} R.densifolia in a 1962 {{monograph}} on section Compactae, differentiating them by spore print color, fruiting pattern, odor, gill spacing, {{and the intensity}} of the <b>color</b> <b>change</b> with bruising. Three forms are from the Pacific Northwest region of North America: form dilatoria has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray; form fragrans has a fragrant odor and widely spaced gills; form cremeispora produces a light yellow spore print and has an obscurely two-layered cap cuticle. Form gregata, found in the eastern United States, grows gregariously in jack pine and Scotch pine forests. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum lumps these forms, as well as f. subrubescen, published by Patrick Reumaux in 1996, together into synonymy. Other synonyms include Rolf Singer's 1931 variety caucasica, Roger Heim's 1938 variety latericola, and C. Dagron's 1999 variety colettarum.|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state {{at room temperature}} upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular <b>color</b> <b>change</b> in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E

5|$|Mammalian coats are colored for {{a variety}} of reasons, the major {{selective}} pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication and physiological processes such as temperature regulation. Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal <b>color</b> <b>change</b> between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, {{is the result of a}} symbiotic relationship with algae. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.|$|E
