5|$|The film {{features}} catapults resembling windmills, that <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> rapidly, and a ballista that <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> three projectiles at a time. The practical {{versions of}} these were metal with fibreglass painted and aged to resemble wood on top. Weta created props of the missiles thrown by the Telmarine equipment. The practical version of the catapult had its upper half painted blue, to composite a digital version programmed for rapid firing movement.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} economic building is the Town Center, where villagers are created, {{all types of}} resources can be stored, some technologies are researched, and the player can advance to the next Age. The Town Center <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack. Other economic buildings available include storage buildings for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship has}} {{self-defence}} capability and {{is equipped with}} an indigenous anti-missile defence chaff system. On-board systems include fully automatic engine controls, power management and battle damage control systems. According to the navy, the ship was designed to operate as a command platform. The ship is fitted with four AK-630 Close-in weapon systems, which <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> {{at a rate of}} 4,000 to 10,000 rounds a minute.|$|E

50|$|A {{single shot}} firearm <b>can</b> only be <b>fired</b> once per {{equipped}} barrel before {{it must be}} reloaded or charged via an external mechanism or series of steps. A repeating firearm <b>can</b> be <b>fired</b> multiple times, but <b>can</b> only be <b>fired</b> once with each subsequent pull of the trigger. Between trigger pulls, the firearm's action must be reloaded or charged via an internal mechanism.|$|R
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Every {{character}} {{has been given}} their own unique ability. For example, Jazz <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> a grappling hook to reach high or distant places, Optimus Prime can command the massive Metroplex, and the Combaticons {{have the ability to}} combine into the Decepticon Bruticus. Segments in which players control Bruticus are designed to accommodate its larger size. Scale is maintained so the character towers over enemies. The Autobot Grimlock, who transforms into a dinosaur, is controlled differently than other characters. Carrying only a sword and shield, Grimlock cannot transform at will, instead accumulating rage as he battles opponents. When he gains enough rage, Grimlock is able to transform and inflict massive damage. The online cooperative campaign play featured in the first game has been removed in favor of levels that utilize each character's specific abilities.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) are {{summoned to}} the ensuing hostage {{situation}} by Agent Lucy Kazdin (CCH Pounder), since Barry insists {{that he is an}} alien abductee. Mulder contacts Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) for assistance, asking her to look into Barry's history. Mulder acts as a hostage negotiator, calling Barry in order to earn his trust so that the standoff may be peacefully resolved. Barry quickly figures this out, causing Mulder to learn that he is a former FBI agent. A power outage occurs, frightening Barry and causing him to fire his gun, hitting one of the hostages. Mulder heads inside the travel agency with a paramedic. Barry releases the wounded hostage in exchange for Mulder, who is instructed to get Barry near the agency's front door so that snipers <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> on him.|$|E
5000|$|The {{search of}} such rules that <b>can</b> be <b>fired,</b> that is, all the input {{variables}} {{of which are}} known, is implemented successively, for example, top-down. If {{there are no such}} rules, there is no logical inference path and input data refinement (addition) should be requested. If there are such rules that <b>can</b> be <b>fired,</b> each of them is labeled in the corresponding place of service row that the rule <b>can</b> be <b>fired.</b> For example, we can write 1 in the matrix cell, which is illustrated in the cell [...]|$|R

5|$|Samus Aran is {{typically}} seen wearing the Power Suit, a powered exoskeleton which protects her from most dangers she encounters {{and can be}} enhanced by power-ups collected during gameplay. In regard to offense, the Power Suit boasts the Arm Cannon, which <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> various energy beams, charge beams to shoot an extra-powerful blast, or launch {{a limited number of}} missiles. The Power Suit can also be reconfigured into a small, spherical form called the Morph Ball, which allows her to roll through tight areas, such as tunnels, and use Bombs. The Power Suit is also equipped with a Grapple Beam, which can be used to tether onto objects to cross large distances, such as chasms. Additionally, its visor can be used to scan objects to learn more about them, a feature that has been used since Metroid Prime. Aside from her Power Suit, Samus is also in possession of a Gunship, which is used in the games to save progress and restore her health and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Teenager Billy Duncan {{wakes up}} in his bed, {{seemingly}} disturbed, and learns his mother is leaving for vacation. He goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy, but her deranged grandfather Colonel Farley makes him leave before he can see her. As Billy drives around town, he is harassed by bullies Chuck Boran and Froggy, and by two police deputies who give him a speeding ticket. Billy wanders into the desert and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, pretending to shoot things, then realizes he <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> the weapon while wearing the pendant. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around {{to head back to}} Earth. Context implies that the two aliens, upon departing Earth, left the cannon and pendant behind under the presumption that no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had, but they have now learned that they were in error.|$|E
5|$|The game world {{consists}} {{of a number of}} rooms and passages with background scenery including a machine which stretches four conjoined babies and men being torn apart on racks. The game's rooms are filled with enemies and traps such as spiked ceilings, falling anvils and airborne spinning blades. The player character is armed with a laser gun and a jet pack which is used to fly around the game world. The laser can overheat and become inoperable for a time if not used sparingly. Scenery and surfaces can be degraded then destroyed by repeated laser fire, allowing access to adjacent rooms which would otherwise be unreachable or require a detour. The player starts each game with three lives; the game's display features a heart strength indicator which is reduced each time the player is injured. If the player loses all their heart strength, their heart stops, resulting in a lost life. Players can render themselves invisible and invincible for a limited period three times on a single life. When the player character is invisible, he <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> the laser in order to determine his current location.|$|E
50|$|The main gun <b>can</b> also <b>fire</b> a laser {{guided missile}} against battle tanks, {{armoured}} vehicles and hovering helicopters {{within the range}} of 5,000m. The missile <b>can</b> be <b>fired</b> on the move against travelling targets. The tandem warhead fitted on the missile can defeat targets equipped with explosive reactive armour and advanced spaced armour.|$|R

5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E

25|$|The new variant {{possesses}} superior missile firing {{capabilities and}} <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> missiles accurately up {{to a range}} of 2km. The latest test consisted of an indigeniously developed missile demonstrating target hit at a range of 5km.|$|E
50|$|A {{fire service}} is {{normally}} set up where it <b>can</b> have <b>fire</b> stations and sophisticated fire engines strategically deployed {{throughout the area}} it serves, so that dispatchers <b>can</b> send <b>fire</b> engines, fire trucks, or ambulances from the fire stations closest to the incident. Larger departments have branches within themselves to increase efficiency, composed of volunteers, support, and research.|$|R

25|$|The GAU-8/A is {{extremely}} accurate and <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> 4,200 {{rounds per minute}} without complications. The 30-mm shell has twice the range, half the time to target, and three times the mass of projectiles fired by guns mounted in comparable close air support aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The main gun, {{considered}} {{light for}} a modern tank, <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> BM-354P HVAP, sub-caliber AP-T, AP-T, BR-350 API-T and OF-350 Frag-HE rounds (as can the 76.2mm M1942 (ZiS-3) divisional gun) and is capable of penetrating the armour of APCs and other lightly armored vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Prioritised Petri nets add {{priorities}} to transitions, whereby {{a transition}} cannot fire, if a higher-priority transition is enabled (i.e. <b>can</b> <b>fire).</b> Thus, transitions are in priority groups, and e.g. priority group 3 can only fire if all transitions are disabled in groups 1 and 2. Within a priority group, firing is still non-deterministic.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{inconsistencies}} {{within the}} Gaunt's Ghosts novels themselves include {{the operation of}} the hotshot las weapon. Early novels imply that the hotshot sniper rifles <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> multiple shots which are more powerful than a standard weapon, although each powercell provides fewer shots than standard. The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer (Damocles Gulf Edition) confirms that a hotshot clip is good for roughly 20 shots.|$|E
25|$|A {{prototype}} designated BTR-90M {{was built}} (see photo) {{with a larger}} turret derived from the BMP-3, mounting a coaxial low-velocity 2A70 100mm rifled gun/missile launcher system (which <b>can</b> <b>fire</b> conventional shells or laser beam-riding 9M117 anti-tank missiles (ATGM), such as AT-10 Stabber), a 30mm Shipunov 2A72 cannon, and a 7.62mm PKT machine gun.
