40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the macroeconomic adjustment {{process of the}} Korean financial crisis in a broad international perspective. In particular, the impacts of the crisis on GDP growth, inflation, current account balance, and employment are analyzed using a cross­ country data set, which compiled 150 financial crisis episodes from all developing countries that have received <b>conditional</b> financial <b>assistance</b> from the IMF over the period from 1973 to 1994. The cross country patterns show that GDP growth rates sharply drop with the eruption of a crisis but then recover quickly to the pre­crisis level {{in two or three}} years, showing a v­ pattern of adjustment; inflation and current account deficit exhibit an inverse v­pattern, but they do not improve to the level of non­program period; employment growth is most sluggish in the recovery process compared with other macroeconomic variables. We find that the Korean case is in general consistent with these stylized patterns. However, the degree of initial contraction and following recovery has been far greater in Korea than what the cross­country evidence predicts. Cross­country comparison indicates that both the export­oriented structure and the swift adjustment of macroeconomic policies contributed to the speedy adjustment of the Korean economy. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{relation}} between Fund conditionality and country ownership of assistance programs is considered {{from a political}} economy perspective, focusing {{on the question of}} why conditionality is needed if it is in a country’s best interests to undertake the reform program. It is argued that heterogeneity of interests must form the basis of any discussion of conditionality and ownership. The paper stresses a conflict between a reformist government and domestic interest groups that oppose reform, leading to a distinction between government and country ownership of a program. After discussing conceptual issues, I present a model of lending and policy reform that illustrates the effects of unconditional and <b>conditional</b> <b>assistance</b> first without and then with political constraints. It is shown that conditionality can play a key role even when the Fund and authorities agree on the goals of an assistance program...|$|E

A reformist government does not need conditionality and it is useless if it does not want to reform. A government that faces opposition may use conditionality and the help of pro-reform lobbies as a lever to counteract anti-reform groups and succeed in implementing reforms. ^ The second chapter analizes economies saddled with taxes and regulations. I consider an economy in which many taxes, subsidies, and other distortionary restrictions are in place simultaneously. If I start from an inefficient laissez-faire equilibrium because of some domestic distortion, a small trade tax or subsidy can yield a first-order welfare improvement, even if the instrument itself creates distortions of its own. This may result in 2 ̆ 2 welfare paradoxes 2 ̆ 2. The purpose of the chapter is to quantify the welfare effects of changes in tax rates in a small open economy. I conduct the simulation {{in the context of an}} intertemporal utility maximization framework. I apply numerical methods to the model developed by Karayalcin. I introduce changes in the tax rates and quantify both the impact on welfare, consumption and foreign assets, and the path to the new steady-state values. ^ The third chapter studies the role of stock markets and adjustment costs in the international transmission of supply shocks. The analysis of the transmission of a positive supply shock that originates in one of the countries shows that on impact the shock leads to an inmediate stock market boom enjoying the technological advance, while the other country suffers from depress stock market prices as demand for its equity declines. A period of adjustment begins culminating in a steady state capital and output level that is identical to the one before the shock. The the capital stock of one country undergoes a non-monotonic adjustment. The model is tested with plausible values of the variables and the numeric results confirm the predictions of the theory. ...|$|E

This paper examines the effects of foreign assistance in countries with plentiful investment opportunities when interest groups compete for unproductive government transfers. We assess <b>conditional</b> and unconditional <b>assistance</b> (project and program aid, loans, and grants). We find that project conditionality alone may fail to spur growth. Official development loans channeled to investment may not increase the recipient's growth and welfare even if interest groups are unable to appropriate aid funds directly. Conditions must tackle the domestic drivers of inefficient fiscal policies. To improve the composition of government expenditure, increase growth, and improve welfare, tax rates must be kept constant and loan repayment be financed by cuts in unproductive transfers. Official development grants are superior to loans of the same net present value if donors cannot enforce conditions on assistance. ...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{countries}} sell {{carbon offset}} credits at a profit, but that profit {{would be reduced}} if they accepted a cap on emissions. This linkage increases their resistance to accepting such caps. Also, the profitability of offsets motivates developing countries to insist on stricter caps on industrialized na‐ tions, because stricter caps increase the demand for offset credits supplied by developing countries. Caps on their own emissions, however, have now been rejected by developing countries. This leaves offsets, on a massive scale, as the only path within the Kyoto framework for restraining the bulk of emissions growth. But offsets over‐pay for emission reductions, and are inefficient and often corrupt. Hence offsets could never be implemented on a sufficient scale to succeed. Instead, a new path to international commitment is required. The remaining possibility for commitment is flexible global carbon pricing, which allows a choice of cap or tax. Developing countries could accept an equal tax, because it leaves them room to grow {{to the level of}} developed countries instead of temporarily capping their growth.

The paper charts the movement’s historical ascendancy from a fringe Gaza-based group to a mainstream Islamist movement and mouthpiece for dispossessed Palestinians. Since 2001, Hamas’s leadership has come under increasing attack from Israel, killing a number of the movement’s leaders and senior members, most prominently Sheikh Yasin, the movement’s founder and spiritual leader, and his successor as Hamas leader, Abd al-Aziz Rantissi. Nonetheless, Hamas’s duality as “worshippers” and “warmongers” has made the organisation extraordinarily popular among dispossessed Palestinians and a mounting political challenge to the secular nationalism of the PLO. At present, two-thirds of the Palestinians live below the “poverty line” and it is likely that it is in this disenfranchised segment of the population that Hamas finds its core support. Presently, about one in every six Palestinians in the Occupied Territories benefits from support from Islamic charities.

The 1996 US welfare reform welfare for single mother families was no longer an entitlement and there were stiff work requirements enforced by sanctions and time limits. In Western Europe, although there is variation, welfare has become <b>conditional</b> for social <b>assistance</b> recipients the "socially excluded. " Social assistance is administered at the municipal level, which contracts with private companies. Caseworkers are supposed to make individualized contracts emphasizing work activities. This paper examines the field-level data in several US programs and finds that there is a symbiotic relationship between governments and contractors; caseworkers, whether public or private, focus on process rather than substantive plans; government does not question the data; contracts are imposed; the most employable are placed; and the most vulnerable are sanctioned or otherwise not allowed on welfare. Research in some European countries is showing similar results activation programs are difficult to administer and increase the risks for the most vulnerable. Individualized contracts are a myth, given administrative constraints and client dependency. The paper argues that the difficulties of activation are an additional reason for a basic income guarantee. The socially excluded will have an exit option and well-being will be improved. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} factors influencing choice and {{the determinants of}} women's health services demand. Demand for health services in Colombia is practically unexplored, and {{there appear to be}} no studies of demand for health services by women of child rearing age in Colombia. The Colombian National Health Study of 1980 (Estudio Nacional de Salud- 1980) is the data base used, supplemented by hospital data from the Ministry of Health. After a description of the Colombian Health System, the choice between traditional and modern care is studied for prenatal care, and for child's delivery assistance, emphasizing differences among insured and non-insured women. The first part of the study estimates demand schedules through a logistic specification. The choice of institutional setting for child's delivery <b>assistance,</b> <b>conditional</b> upon the prior decision of using modern care, is studied through a nested multinomial logit specification for women in different regions of the country and for urban and rural women as well. Expected prices for a delivery are estimated for all choices women face. Only few recent studies have found demand for modern health services to be price elastic and dependent on income level; this is also the case in some of the regions of Colombia. Moreover, demand for health services becomes less price elastic as income increases. Demand for Private care is generally more price elastic than demand for other types of care, and in some cases demand for Public care is significantly price elastic at lower income levels. Lower income women rely on Public hospitals when they have decided against traditional care. Then, price changes for Public care would have larger welfare effects on lower income groups. Urban women of high income groups often use Public care, indicating that government subsidies are favoring better-off sectors of the population. Meanwhile, rural women rely heavily on home care, even at higher income levels. A more rational price system for services at social security hospitals would not reduce significantly women's welfare; higher prices would help to provide better quality services and/or permit cost recovery for those institutions which very often find themselves in financial trouble...|$|R
