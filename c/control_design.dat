5|$|Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra {{commented that}} Robotrons success, along with Defender, {{illustrated}} that video game enthusiasts {{were ready for}} more difficult games with complex controls. Though {{not the first to}} implement it, Robotron: 2084s use of dual joysticks popularized the design among 2D shooting games, and has since been copied by other arcade-style games. The control scheme has appeared in several other titles produced by Midway Games: Inferno, Smash TV, and Total Carnage. Many shooting games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network use this dual <b>control</b> <b>design.</b> The 2003 title Geometry Wars and its sequels also use a similar control scheme. The input design was most prominent in arcade games until video games with three-dimensional (3D) graphics became popular in the late 1990s. Jarvis attributes the lack of proliferation in the home market to the absence of hardware that offered two side-by-side joysticks. Most 3D games, however, use the dual joystick scheme to control the movement of a character and a camera. Few console games, like the 2004 title , use two joysticks for movement and attacking.|$|E

5|$|The 767 was {{the first}} Boeing {{wide-body}} to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced {{the role of the}} flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in <b>control</b> <b>design,</b> flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the control yoke has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the first}} half of the 1980s, Prof. Fang and his team {{organized}} almost one hundred noise control pilot study in 13 provinces and 40 enterprises with the support of relevant departments of the State Council in order to provide the basis for developing noise standard. This large-scale engineering practice not only provided a paradigm for the implementation of noise <b>control</b> <b>design,</b> but also verified the fact that the vast majority of industrial enterprises verification could achieve the noise limit through efforts. These examples were included in the book named as [...] "114 cases of Noise Control" [...] (in Chinese). The specifications, which were studied and drawn up by almost the whole noise industry and related industry, were approved and promulgated by the Ministry of National Planning Commission in December 1985, named as Chinese national standards GBJ 87-1985 [...] "Industrial Enterprises Noise <b>Control</b> <b>Design</b> Specifications". The approval and promulgation of the specifications marked the birth of Noise Control Engineering in China. From then on, noise was not only of physics or acoustics, but also a subject area of engineering and industrial field.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} Tsien wrote Engineering Cybernetics which was {{published}} by McGraw Hill in 1954. The book deals with the practice of stabilizing servomechanisms. In its 18 chapters it considers non-interacting controls of many-variable systems, <b>control</b> <b>design</b> by perturbation theory, and von Neumann’s theory of error control (chapter 18). Ezra Krendel reviewed the book, stating that it is [...] "difficult to overstate the value of Tsien's book to those interested in the overall theory of complex control systems." [...] Evidently Tsien’s approach is primarily practical, as Kendel notes that for servomechanisms the [...] "usual linear design criterion of stability is inadequate and other criteria arising from the physics of the problem must be used." ...|$|E

A compelling [...] laboratory study from Williamson and Feyer [...] used a cross-over randomized <b>control</b> <b>design</b> to observe cognitive and motor performance after minor sleep deprivation to performance after alcohol consumption. All subjects participated in both alcohol consumption and sleep deprivation, and the order of testing was counterbalanced so that half of the subjects participated in the alcohol consumption part first while the other half participated in the sleep deprivation part first. To avoid carry-over effects from one condition to the next, subjects were provided with a night of rest in a motel between each condition.|$|E

2500|$|Optimal {{control is}} a {{particular}} control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain [...] "cost index": for example, {{in the case of}} a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal <b>control</b> <b>design</b> methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are Model Predictive Control (MPC) and linear-quadratic-Gaussian control (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the [...] "optimal control" [...] structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in process control.|$|E
2500|$|After Graduation, Danqun Fang {{began his}} {{scientific}} work at Beijing Municipal Institute of Labor Protection. In the 1960s, he successfully developed {{a series of}} mufflers {{that could be used}} in industry environment. On the basis of the sound absorption theory of Micro perforated plate proposed by Prof. Daa-You Maa, Danqun Fang successfully developed a series of micro-perforated plate mufflers, which was widely used for sound absorption. From the 1970s, Danqun Fang led a team of acousticians, physiologists and doctors to research the influence of noise on hearing, cardiovascular, nervous system. After working out series of relationship between noise and brain, noise and deafness, noise and neurasthenia, he proposed noise standard for all places in industrial enterprise plants in China. His work led to the issue of the first China National Noise Standard for Industry in 1980. Five years later, with more comprehensive research by analyzing 11794 noise sources of 1034 factories and investigating noise exposure conditions of 62726 workers, Danqun Fang drew up “Industrial Noise <b>Control</b> <b>Design</b> Specification” for China, which was named as [...]|$|E
2500|$|Destiny {{was criticized}} for its lack of story content, with many {{pointing}} to the disjointed narrative and shallow plot implementation. Bungie has since acknowledged that the story was lacking in some respects, and stated that the game's first DLC expansion, The Dark Below, would focus on providing more background to the universe of Destiny. The game's end-game content {{was the subject of}} criticism, due to its particular focus on grinding for rare items through various means (including multiplayer games and other missions). The discovery of [...] "loot caves" [...] — locations with quickly re-spawning enemies that could previously be used to farm for items — along with initial issues surrounding the Vault of Glass raid mission became associated with these lingering issues. Despite the criticism, the game received the title of Game of the Year from GamesRadar, the BAFTA Award for Best Game at the British Academy Video Games Awards. At the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR), the game won Original Dramatic Score, New IP and Control Precision, and was nominated for Game Design(New IP), <b>Control</b> <b>Design</b> (3D), Character Design and Art Direction (Contemporary).|$|E
