25|$|Aside {{from their}} immense size, <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls</b> were also {{structurally}} {{different from the}} ones built in medieval Europe. Whereas European walls were {{for the most part}} constructed of stone with gravel or rubble filling and limestone mortar, <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls</b> had tamped earthen cores which absorbed the energy of artillery shots. Walls were built using constructed wooden frameworks which were then filled with layers of earth tamped down to a highly compact state, and once that was completed the frameworks were removed for use in the next wall section. Starting from the Song dynasty these walls were improved with an outer layer of bricks or stone to prevent erosion, and during the Ming, earthworks were interspersed with stone and rubble. Most <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls</b> were also sloped rather than vertical to better deflect projectile energy.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{introduce}} and analyse the regulatory means of the so-called <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls</b> in banking sector. This is done by examining the Czech Banking Law, but also through comparison of the mechanism of <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls</b> to alternative methods of regulation, {{as well as by}} presenting of two practical studies dedicated to <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls.</b> As mentioned, the focus is placed on Czech legislation, however, we do not omit various alternative abroad regulatory approaches used in the past or indeed planned to be passed in the nearest future. The reason for the research is our interest in banking law and this form of regulation of insider trading. The thesis is composed of Introduction, three numbered chapters and Conclusion. Each of the chapters deals with different aspects of the thesis' topic. Introduction briefly explains the different issues that are to be discussed further. In Chapter One, we firstly explain our position on what indeed is the reason the <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls</b> have been introduced to the Czech legal system. After that, we mainly concentrate on the Czech banking legislation, thoroughly analysing its numerous legal aspects. In the end of this chapter, as the result of our analysis, we present our amended version of the law with the recommended changes. Chapter Two describes a brief [...] ...|$|R

[...] The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895 where he states [...] "besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon." [...] The issue of [...] "canals" [...] on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space.

40|$|A strict separation, or ‘Chinese walls’, {{between the}} {{supervisory}} and monetary policy {{arms of the}} European Central Bank is not needed. The economic literature is not unanimous on this issue and we argue that a strict separation of supervision and monetary policy is not desirable during a financial crisis when the systemic stability of the financial system represents {{the biggest threat to}} a monetary policy that aims at price stability. The key problem hampering the ECB today is that it lacks detailed information on the state of health of the banking system, which is often highly confidential. <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls</b> would not solve this problem. Moreover, the new, proposed Supervisory Board will be composed to a large extent of representatives of the same institutions which also dominate the Governing Council.

Yet <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls</b> do not fully explain the divergence in gun development as European guns grew not only bigger, but more effective as well. By 1490 the European gun had achieved the basic form it would take for the next three centuries, during which it would dominate the fields of warfare. The Classic Gun had arrived, and in the 1510s and 1520s when the Chinese encountered European firearms, they fully recognized they were superior to their own.|$|R

The delicacy guiding her choice to the least valuable and most dilapidated articles passed unacknowledged, because Winnie’s philosophy consisted in not taking notice of the inside of facts; she assumed that mother took what suited her best.

60|$|The {{accounts}} {{given us}} of the events and transactions of Genghis Khan's reign after he acquired the supreme power over the Mongul and Tartar nations are imperfect, and, in many respects, confused. It appears, however, from them that in the year 1211, that is, about five years after his election as grand khan, he became involved in a war with the Chinese, which led, in the end, to very important consequences. The kingdom of China lay to the southward of the Mongul territories, and the frontier was defended by the famous <b>Chinese</b> <b>wall,</b> which extended from east to west, over hills and valleys, from the great desert to the sea, for many hundred miles. The wall was defended by towers, built {{here and there in}} commanding positions along the whole extent of it, and at certain distances there were fortified towns where powerful garrisons were stationed, and reserves of troops were held ready to be marched to different points along the wall, wherever there might be occasion for their services.|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning at}} six-thirty {{the sun was}} shining clear, and only a few clouds sailed in the blue. Wind was in the west and the weather promised fair. But clouds began to creep up behind the mountains, first hazy, then white, then dark. Nevertheless we decided to ride out, and cross the Flattop rim, and go around what they call the <b>Chinese</b> <b>Wall.</b> It rained as we climbed through the spruces above Little Trappers Lake. And as we got near the top it began to hail. Again the air grew cold. Once out on top I found a wide expanse, green and white, level in places, but with huge upheavals of ridge. There were flowers here at eleven {{thousand}} feet. The view to the rear was impressive--a wide up-and-down plain studded with out-cropping of rocks, and patches of snow. We were then on top of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>Wall,</b> and the view to the west was grand. At the moment hail was falling thick and white, and to stand above the streaked curtain, as it fell into the abyss was a strange new experience. Below, two thousand feet, lay the spruce forest, and it sloped and dropped into the White River Valley, which in turn rose, a long ragged dark-green slope, up to a bare jagged peak. Beyond this stretched range on range, dark under the lowering pall of clouds. On top we found fresh Rocky Mountain sheep tracks. A little later, going into a draw, we crossed a snow-bank, solid as ice. We worked down into this draw into the timber. It hailed, and rained some more, then cleared. The warm sun felt good. Once down in the parks we began to ride through a flower-garden. Every slope was beautiful in gold, and red, and blue and white. These parks were luxuriant with grass, and everywhere we found elk beds, where the great stags had been lying, to flee at our approach. But we did not see one. The bigness of this slope impressed me. We rode miles and miles, and every park was surrounded by heavy timber. At length we got into a burned district where the tall dead spruces stood sear and ghastly, and the ground was so thickly strewn with fallen trees that we had difficulty in threading a way through them. Patches of aspen grew on the hillside, still fresh and green despite this frosty morning. Here we found a sego lily, {{one of the most beautiful}} of flowers. Here also I saw pink Indian paint brush. At the foot of this long burned slope we came to the White River trail, and followed it up and around to camp.|$|E
25|$|While China was {{the birthplace}} of {{gunpowder}} the guns there remained relatively small and light, weighing less than 80 kilograms or less for the large ones, and only a couple kilograms at most for the small ones during the early Ming era. Guns themselves had proliferated throughout China and become a common sight during sieges, so the question has arisen then why large guns were not first developed in China. According to Tonio Andrade, this wasn't a matter of metallurgy, which was sophisticated in China, and the Ming dynasty did construct large guns in the 1370s, but never followed up afterwards. Nor was it the lack of warfare, which other historians have suggested to be the case, but does not stand up to scrutiny as walls were a constant factor of war which {{stood in the way}} of many Chinese armies since time immemorial into the twentieth century. The answer Andrade provides is simply that <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls</b> were much less vulnerable to bombardment.

40|$|Conflicts of {{interests}} are often {{dealt with by}} arguing that individuals, not institutions, are responsible for behaving unethically. In fact, institutions often push individuals to behave unethically. Individuals {{would need to be}} heroes to behave differently. This is particularly visible in organizations whose members are professionals; as brokers and boundary spanners, they use conflicts {{of interests}} to increase the power of their firm. Organizations cover themselves against accusations of unethical behavior by introducing formal organizational separations between their members, replicating inside the organization the boundaries that reflect external conflict. An example of such organizational devices are provided by <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls.</b> Using a network study of a New Eng- land corporate law firm, I look into the black box of such organizations and show that it is impossible for members to respect such <b>Chinese</b> <b>walls</b> unless they are heroes. The question arising from this analysis is, therefore, {{whether or not it is}} time for such professional firms to shrink to greatness. If members cannot be expected to be heroes, should their institutions not be redesigned so as to prevent unethical behavior without counting on their heroism...|$|R

60|$|The {{scene was}} one of those lyceum halls, of which almost every village has now its own, {{dedicated}} to that sober and pallid, or rather drab-colored, mode of winter-evening entertainment, the lecture. Of late years this has come strangely into vogue, when the natural tendency of things would seem to be to substitute lettered for oral methods of addressing the public. But, in halls like this, besides the winter course of lectures, there is a rich and varied series of other exhibitions. Hither comes the ventriloquist, with all his mysterious tongues; the thaumaturgist, too, with his miraculous transformations of plates, doves, and rings, his pancakes smoking in your hat, and his cellar of choice liquors represented in one small bottle. Here, also, the itinerant professor instructs separate classes of ladies and gentlemen in physiology, and demonstrates his lessons by the aid of real skeletons, and manikins in wax, from Paris. Here is to be heard the choir of Ethiopian melodists, and to be seen the diorama of Moscow or Bunker Hill, or the moving panorama of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>wall.</b> Here is displayed the museum of wax figures, illustrating the wide catholicism of earthly renown, by mixing up heroes and statesmen, the pope and the Mormon prophet, kings, queens, murderers, and beautiful ladies; every sort of person, in short, except authors, of whom I never beheld even the most famous done in wax. And here, in this many-purposed hall (unless the selectmen of the village chance to have more than their share of the Puritanism, which, however diversified with later patchwork, still gives its prevailing tint to New England character),--here the company of strolling players sets up its little stage, and claims patronage for the legitimate drama.|$|E
6000|$|Military bureaucratic systems {{everywhere}} {{have too}} much tendency to work upon one idea, {{and there was a}} time when the military and bureaucratic system of the British in the East worked on the idea of the fear of Russia. It is needless here to explain that sentiment, and useless to explain it away. It was partly a mere tradition from the natural jingoism of the Crimean War; it was partly in itself a tribute to the epic majesty of the Russian march across mysterious Asia to the legendary <b>Chinese</b> <b>Wall.</b> The point here is that it existed; and where there exists such an idea in such military rulers, they very seldom alter their idea. But Kitchener did alter his idea. Not in mere military obedience, but in genuine human reasonableness, he came late in life to see the Russian as the friend and the Prussian as the enemy. In the inevitable division of British ministerial councils about the distribution of British aid and attention he was the one man who stood most enthusiastically, one might say stubbornly, for the supreme importance of munitioning the magnificent Russian defence. He mystified all the English pessimists, in what seemed to them the blackest hour of pessimism, by announcing that Germany had [...] "shot her bolt"; that she had already lost her chance, not by any of the Allied attacks, but by the stupendous skill and valour of that Russian retreat, which was more triumphant than any attack. It is this discovery that marks an epoch; for that great deliverance was not only the victory of Russia, but very specially the victory of the Russians. Never before was there such a war of men against guns--as awful and inspiring to watch as a war of men against demons. Perhaps the duel of a man with a modern gun is more like that between a man and an enormous dragon; nor is there anything on the weaker side save the ultimate and almost metaphysical truth, that a man can make a gun and a gun cannot make a man. It is the man--the Russian soldier and peasant himself--who has emerged like the hero of an epic, and who is now secure for ever from the sophisticated scandal-mongering and the cultured ignorance of the West.|$|E
