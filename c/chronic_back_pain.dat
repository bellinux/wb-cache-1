5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces <b>chronic</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} {{why some}} people develop <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain,</b> and whether illness perceptions are an important risk factor in the transition from acute to <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Design Cross-sectional study. Participants Four hundred and {{two members of the}} general Dutch population, with and without <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Main outcome measures Sociodemographics and the translated version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised, adapted for <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Results Of the sample, 115 (29 %) individuals had <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> (> 6 months) and 287 (71 %) did not have <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Many of the participants with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> believed that one 'wrong' movement can potentially lead to more severe problems, and that X-rays or computer tomography scans can determine the cause of the pain. Many of the participants with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> did not perceive a relationship between psychosocial factors and low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Conclusions Illness perceptions differed between individuals with and without <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> In the subacute phase, healthcare professionals could assess illness perceptions and, if necessary, incorporate them into the management of patients with low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> (C) 2011 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{estimate}} worldwide {{prevalence of}} <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> according to age and sex. METHODS We consulted Medline (PubMed), LILACS and EMBASE electronic databases. The search strategy used the following descriptors and combinations: <b>back</b> <b>pain,</b> prevalence, musculoskeletal diseases, chronic musculoskeletal <b>pain,</b> rheumatic, low <b>back</b> <b>pain,</b> musculoskeletal disorders and <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> We selected cross-sectional population-based or cohort studies that assessed <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> as an outcome. We also assessed {{the quality of}} the selected studies as well as the <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> prevalence according to age and sex. RESULTS The review included 28 studies. Based on our qualitative evaluation, around one third of the studies had low scores, mainly due to high non-response rates. <b>Chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> prevalence was 4. 2 % in individuals aged between 24 and 39 years old and 19. 6 % in those aged between 20 and 59. Of nine studies with individuals aged 18 and above, six reported <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> between 3. 9 % and 10. 2 % and three, prevalence between 13. 1 % and 20. 3 %. In the Brazilian older population, <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> prevalence was 25. 4 %. CONCLUSIONS <b>Chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> prevalence increases linearly from the third decade of life on, until the 60 years of age, being more prevalent in women. Methodological approaches aiming to reduce high heterogeneity in case definitions of <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> are essential to consistency and comparative analysis between studies. A standard <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> definition should include the precise description of the anatomical area, pain duration and limitation level...|$|R

5|$|Exercise {{therapy is}} {{effective}} in decreasing pain and improving function for those with chronic low back pain. It also appears to reduce recurrence rates {{for as long as}} six months after the completion of program and improves long-term function. There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another. The Alexander technique appears useful for <b>chronic</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain,</b> and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic low back pain. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1964, Kennedy was a {{passenger}} {{in a private}} Aero Commander 680 airplane that was flying in bad weather from Washington to Massachusetts. The plane crashed into an apple orchard in the western Massachusetts town of Southampton on the final approach to the Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield. The pilot and Edward Moss (one of Kennedy's aides) were killed. Kennedy was pulled from the wreckage by fellow Senator Birch Bayh and spent months in a hospital recovering from a severe back injury, a punctured lung, broken ribs and internal bleeding.

40|$|Background. There {{is little}} {{evidence}} about the management and course of <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> in primary care. Objectives. Our aim was to describe the course of <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> and the performed diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for patients with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> in general practice. Methods. Twenty-six GPs involved in the Registration Network Family Practices participated in this prospective follow-up study. All patients and GPs {{were asked to complete}} questionnaires at baseline and at 4, 8 and 12 months follow-up. Results. The GPs provided information about diagnostic and therapeutic procedures concerning 524 patients with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Diagnostic tests other than history-taking and physical examination were not frequently used. Medication, mostly NSAIDs, was the most frequently used type of treatment (21. 6 %). The most frequent referrals concerned physiotherapy (16. 3 %) and neurology or neurologic surgery (6. 3 %). Information about the course of their <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> was provided by 368 patients participating in our study. The course of <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> appeared to be quite stable, as there was only a slight improvement in pain intensity and physical functioning over the 12 months of follow-up. Conclusions. A variety of options for the treatment and referral of <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> patients is available for and used by GPs. Efforts should be made to establish which diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are the most effective for <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain...</b>|$|R
40|$|Study design: Review and reinterpretation of {{existing}} literature. Objective: This review article summarizes the anatomy and pathogenesis of disease processes {{that contribute to}} low <b>back</b> <b>pain,</b> and discusses key issues in existing therapies for <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> The article also explains the scientific rationale for investigational pharmacology and highlights emerging compounds in late development. Results/conclusion: While the diverse and complex nature of <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> continues to challenge clinicians, a growing understanding of <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> on a cellular level has refined our approach to managing <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> with pharmacology. Many emerging therapies with improved safety profiles are currently in the research pipeline and will contribute to a multimodal therapeutic algorithm in the near future. With the heterogeneity of the patient population suffering from <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain,</b> the clinical challenge will be accurately stratifying the optimal pharmacologic approach for each patient...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to compare the maximal aerobic capacity of patients with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> with healthy asymptomatic controls matched for age, gender and level of physical activity at work and during sports activities. Reported data in the literature with respect to aerobic capacity in patients with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> are not conclusive. Nevertheless, based on the assumption that <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> leads to deconditioning, physical training programs are widely used as a treatment. A total of 70 patients with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> and 70 healthy asymptomatic subjects completed questionnaires regarding demographics and performed a graded maximal exercise test until exhaustion on a cycle ergometer. The maximal aerobic power was measured by indirect calorimetry. Heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio and blood lactate levels were also measured. The test was considered maximal when VO 2 max achievement criteria were obtained. VO 2 max values were compared among groups. The absolute and normalized for weight values of VO 2 max measured in patients with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> were significantly lower than that of the control group. Independent comparison between men and women showed that absolute values of VO 2 max are also significantly lower in men and women with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Women reached absolute and normalized for weight VO 2 max values significantly lower than those of men, both in <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> and control group. In conclusion, <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> patients, especially women, seem to have a reduced aerobic capacity compared to healthy asymptomatic subjects...|$|R

25|$|Lemieux's {{career was}} plagued by health {{problems}} that limited him to 915 of a possible 1,428 regular season games, between {{the opening of the}} 1984-85 campaign and the final game of 2005–2006. Lemieux's NHL debut was on October 11, 1984, and his final game took place on December 16, 2005. His numerous ailments included spinal disc herniation, Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic tendinitis of a hip-flexor muscle, and <b>chronic</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> so severe that other people had to tie his skates. He retired on two separate occasions due to these health issues, first in 1997 after battling lymphoma before returning in 2000, and then a second and final time in 2006 after being diagnosed with an atrial fibrillation. Lemieux also missed the entire 1994–95 season due to Hodgkin's lymphoma. Despite his lengthy absences from the game, his play remained at a high level upon his return to the ice; he won the Hart Trophy and scoring title in 1995–96 after sitting out the entire previous season, and he was a finalist for the Hart when he made his comeback in 2000. In 1999, he bought the then-bankrupt Penguins and their top minor-league affiliate, the American Hockey League's (AHL) Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and is currently the team's principal owner and chairman.|$|E

40|$|Low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> is {{a common}} but severe health problem. <b>Chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> {{accounts}} {{for the bulk of}} the burden of low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Exercise interventions are effective in the management of <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Current clinical thinking in physical therapy treats low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> as a heterogeneous entity seeking to match specific interventions to subpopulations. None of these subgroups assess the role of gluteus medius dysfunction in <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> These projects seek to describe the prevalence of gluteus medius weakness in people with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> and test the effectiveness of a gluteus medius strengthening exercise intervention in people with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Gluteus medius strength was assessed in 150 people seeking care for <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> and 75 healthy people without low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Gluteus medius was found to be weaker on affected sides compared to unaffected sides within people with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> and weaker than people without low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Gluteus medius weakness was a strong predictor of the presence of low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> A gluteus medius strengthening program was compared with lumbar stabilization exercises in 56 people with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Although there was a clinically significant improvement in pain in people who performed the gluteus medius strengthening exercise program, this was not significantly different from the stabilization exercise intervention. Adherence to exercise was significantly correlated with reduction in pain and perceived improvement of low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Although gluteus medius weakness is common in people with low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> and treating this weakness with a targeted exercise intervention is effective, it is not better than a standard stabilization exercise intervention.

40|$|Low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> has a {{life time}} {{prevalence}} of 70 % to 85 %. Approximately 10 % to 20 % of all patients experience recurrent episodes or develop <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics explain the transition from acute to <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> only to a limited extent. Altered central pain processing may be a contributing mechanism. The measurement of reflex receptive fields (RRF) is a novel method to assess altered central pain processing. The RRF area denotes {{the area of the}} foot sole from which spinal nociceptive reflexes can be elicited. It was shown to be enlarged in patients with acute and <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> compared with pain-free individuals.

40|$|Background and Aims Spinal {{injection}} is used {{to improve}} pain and functional outcomes for <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> (CLBP) patients, while physiotherapists {{use a variety of}} assessment protocols to classify patients with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Most protocols evaluate the patient's response to movement patterns, sustained, repeated or combined movements on pain distribution, intensity and functional restriction. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the validity of a diagnostic classification system used to direct the application of spinal injection in patients with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Methods All subjects had been diagnosed with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> and referred to a pain clinic. A physiotherapist and a neurosurgeon examined and classified all subjects. Spinal injection was conducted by a neurosurgeon based on the physiotherapy diagnostic classification. Immediately following spinal injection subjects were reexamined.

As a result, in relation to in the fatty degeneration ratio of the left spine and right spine, there were significant differences in erector spinae and multifidus(p<. 001), and in relation to the Fat Infiltration ratio between all the groups, there were significant differences in psoas major, erector spinae and multifidus between the acute low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> patient group and the <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> patient group(p<. 001). In the post-hoc test, multifidus and erector spinae in the acute low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> group and <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> group showed the highest Fat Infiltration ratio. The serious Fat Infiltration of multifidus and erector spinae in the <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> group led to weakened strength of muscles that stabilize the spine.

500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered <b>chronic</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> [...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know if it was going to be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time. [...] "Once MCA jumped on board, it was kind of like, [...] "Whatever! That's cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don't really care!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of officers carry their equipment on a leather duty appointment belt. In recent times, {{there has been}} a large movement within the police to implement changes in methods of equipment carry to relieve officers with back injuries. This has ranged from trials of lightweight nylon duty belts (such as the shapeshifter [...] "gel belt"), to thigh holsters for firearms and load bearing equipment vests. As of 2010, the load-bearing vest has become increasingly prevalent amongst general duty officers and it is anticipated that this trend will continue. It is believed that the vests are effective in relieving officers of <b>chronic</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain,</b> as it takes most of the weight away from the waist and back area, and distributes it across the frontal area of the officer's torso.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> {{is one of}} the commonest {{maladies}} of man. There {{are multiple}} causes of <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> that will include degenerative, inflammatory and mechanical causes. Develop-mental lumbar spinal stenosis is known to cause symptoms of axial <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> with or without leg pain in the young adult. These symptoms become severer when patients with developmental stenosis acquire degenerative changes as the severity of theca sac and foramina compression increases. We hypothesized that developmental lumbar spinal stenosis is a major predisposing factor for <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> in adult population. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the prevalence of developmental lumbar spinal ste-nosis in a group of individuals suffering from <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> This prevalence was compared with another group of asymptomatic individuals (without low <b>back</b> <b>pain).</b> Both Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images were used for this analysis. Design: This was a prospective, case-control, radiographic study. Subjects: Radiological materials from 118 individuals undergoing MRI scans for <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> with or without leg pain were analyzed to obtain the AP diameters of the lumbar vertebral body and vertebra...|$|R
5|$|Other {{problems}} may occur along with low <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> <b>Chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> {{is associated with}} sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep, disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration of sleep, and less satisfaction with sleep. In addition, a majority of those with <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> show symptoms of depression or anxiety.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{incidence}} of <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> (LBP) {{is very high}} in Bangladesh. There is a high prevalence of psychiatric diseases among <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> patients. But primary care physicians and specialists do not screen this association. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate the incidence and pattern of psychiatric diseases in <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> patients. Materials and methods: A prospective cross-sectional hospital-based study of 135 <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> patients using simple, direct, standardized questionnaire including history and detailed psychiatric evaluation by a consultant psychiatrist from January to December 2014. Results: A total 69 <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> patients (51. 1 %) were diagnosed with psychiatric problems. Predominant group were female (65. 9 %), above 40 years of age (60. 7 %). Depression (44. 9 %) and anxiety (31. 9 %) were the major psychiatric illness diagnosed (76. 8 %). Only 17. 4 % patients expects complete cure. Fear of disease outcome was the commonest precipitating factor found (66. 6 %). With the adjuvant psychiatric management, 81. 1 % showed improvement clinically. Conclusion: Detecting the level of psychiatric illness among <b>chronic</b> low <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> patients at early stage will improve the treatment outcome. A referral system to psychiatrists by physicians needs to develop to screen the mental disorder symptoms to treat the problem...|$|R
