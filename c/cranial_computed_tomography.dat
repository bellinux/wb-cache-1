40|$|OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the {{influence}} of emergency <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> on the management of acute febrile encephalopathy in children. METHODS: A retrospective study in children with acute febrile encephalopathy who underwent emergency <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> within 12 hours of admission to the paediatric intensive care unit. All scans were evaluated by two independent radiologists. RESULTS: Thirty nine children were included. Fourteen scans were abnormal and two had clinically insignificant incidental findings. Four children with focal neurological signs had scans demonstrating extra-axial collections. None required neurosurgical intervention. Clinically, raised intracranial pressure was present in 10 patients. Only five had cerebral oedema on computed tomography; these five children died. Emergency <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> influenced subsequent management in no child without focal neurological signs and in only one child with focal neurology. CONCLUSION: Emergency <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> in acute febrile encephalopathy in children without focal neurological signs has little influence on subsequent management. Where <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> is thought to be necessary, it should be carried out when the child's clinical condition has been stabilised...|$|E

40|$|We present 19 {{patients}} with {{tuberous sclerosis complex}} and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. The mean age {{at the time of}} tumor diagnosis was 9. 4 years (range, 1. 5 to 21 years). <b>Computed</b> <b>cranial</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) or cranial magnetic res-onance imaging (MRI) identified the lesion which was resected in all cases. Seven patients had hydrocephalus and there was an interval increase in the tumor size or a large tumor without hydrocephalus in 12 patients. Surgical criteria included: (1) presence of hydrocephalus; (2) interval increase in tumor size; (3) new focal neurologic deficit attributable to the tumor; and/or (4) symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Eight patients were identified through a surveillance program involving annual <b>computed</b> <b>cranial</b> <b>tomography.</b> All of these eight patients had their tumor removed prior to the develop-ment of symptoms, none had neurologic deficits which persisted after surgery, and none has so far developed recurrent subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. In contrast, of the 11 patients from the non-surveillance group 7 were symptomatic at tumor diagnosis, 1 had a complicated postoperative course, 2 developed recurrent giant cell astrocytoma, and 1 had an extensive lesion that could not be completely excised. Periodic cranial imaging may help to identify subependymal giant cell astrocytomas in tuberous sclerosis patients before they become symptomatic. Earlier diagnosis and treatment could reduce surgical morbidity and the risk of tumor recurrence. (J Child Neurol 1998; 13 : 173 - 177) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Release of the {{neuronal}} protein S- 100 B {{into the}} circulation {{has been suggested}} as a specific indication of neuronal damage. The hypothesis that S- 100 B is a useful and cost-effective screening tool {{for the management of}} minor head injuries was tested. METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients sustaining isolated minor head injury were prospectively evaluated in the emergency room of a Brazilian hospital by routine <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> scan. Venous blood samples (processed to serum) were assssayed for S- 100 B using a newly developed immunoassay test kit. Twenty-one normal healthy individuals served as negative controls. Data are presented as median and 25 to 75 percentiles. RESULTS: Patients reached the emergency room an average of 45 minutes (range: 30 - 62 minutes) after minor head injury. Six of 50 patients (12 %) showed relevant posttraumatic lesions in the initial <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> scan and were counted as positive. The median systemic concentration of S- 100 B in those patients was 0. 75 µg/L (range: 0. 66 - 6. 5 µg/L), which was significantly different (U-test, P <. 05) from the median concentration of 0. 26 µg/L (range: 0. 12 - 0. 65 µg/L), of patients without posttraumatic lesions as counted by the <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography.</b> A sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 20 %, a positive predictive value of 15 %, and a negative predictive value of 100 % was calculated for the detection of patients suffering from intracranial lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Protein S- 100 B had a very high sensitivity and negative predictive value and could have an important role in ruling out the need for <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> scan after minor head injury. This appears to be of substantial clinical relevance, particularly in countries where trauma incidence is high and medical resources are limited, such as in Brazil...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivesOnly few {{reports in}} {{literature}} {{have pointed out}} {{to the possibility of}} a cranial subdural haematoma formation associated with dural puncture during spinal or epidural analgesia. We herein describe such a rare case who was diagnosed to have acute subdural haematoma after combined spinal–epidural anaesthesia used in labour. Case reportA 34 -year-old, primigravid women with a gestation of 38 weeks underwent caesarean section under combined spinal–epidural anaesthesia and gave birth to a healthy boy. Thirty-two hours after delivery, her moderate headache progressed to a severe headache associated with nausea and vomiting and later was more complicated with a generalized tonic–clonic seizure and ensuing lethargy. Computed tomography of the brain demonstrated a right-sided fronto-temporo-parietal acute subdural haematoma with diffuse cerebral oedema. She underwent urgent FTP craniotomy and evacuation of the haematoma. Early postoperative <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> showed a clean operative site. Eight days after subdural haematoma surgery, she became lethargic again, and this time <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> disclosed an extradural haematoma under the bone flap for which she had to undergo surgery again. Two days later, she was discharged home with Karnofsky performance score of 90 / 100. At follow-up exam, she was neurologically intact and her <b>cranial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> and magnetic resonance were normal. ConclusionsAs conclusion, with the use of this combined spinal–epidural anaesthesia, it should be kept in mind that headache does not always mean low pressure headache associated with spinal anaesthesia and that a catastrophic complication of subdural haematoma may also occur...|$|E

40|$|Death {{following}} {{lumbar puncture}} (LP) is feared by physicians. Many opinions {{are found in}} literature on the question whether <b>computed</b> <b>cranial</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) should be performed before LP, to prevent herniation. These opinions are mainly based on retrospective studies and pathophysiological reasoning. In this review the difficulties in the decision whether we should perform CT before LP are discussed. It is explained {{that the concept of}} "raised intracranial pressure" is confusing, and that the less ambiguous terms "brain shift" and "raised CSF pressure" should be used instead. Brain shift is a contraindication to LP, whether CSF pressure is raised or not, and whether papilloedema is present or not.

40|$|Based on {{provisional}} clinical diagnosis, {{the choice}} of <b>computed</b> <b>cranial</b> <b>tomography</b> (CCT) or radionuclide brain scan (RBS) was retrospectively evaluated. In 1, 333 selected cases, 551 had CCT only, 560 had RBS only, and 222 had both. CCT was the clinician's preference in cases of dementia, hydrocephalus, hemorrhage, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), primary tumor, visual abnormality, coma, and multiple sclerosis. RBS was preferred in headache, syncope, seizure, transient ischemic attack (TIA), metastatic disease, and encephalitis. Neither procedure appeared preferable in cases of psychosis, psychiatric disease, cerebral vascular accident (CVA), and abscess. Thirty-eight percent of CCTs yielded abnormal findings, not necessarily correlated with the provisional diagnosis.

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{dynamic model}} generates patient-specific estimates of intracranial pressure (Kashif et al., this issue) and suggests a path forward for bringing simulated (SIM) physiologic models to the patient’s bedside. DECISION-MAKING UNDER PRESSURE In Nils Lundberg’s thesis published in 1960, “Continuous recording {{and control of}} ventricular fluid pressure in neurosurgical practice, ” 134 cases of ventricular fluid pressure monitoring were described (1). A phenomenon called plateau waves (Lundberg A-waves) was characterized by “rapid increase and decrease of pressure to and from a level of considerable height and varying duration … and often irregular occurrence without precursory symptoms or obvious precipitating factors. ” Cases with typical A-waves had well-defined attacks of headache associated with nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Other patients exhibited loss of consciousness, disorientation, myoclonus of the arms, and weakness of the legs. All cases had bilateral papilledema [swelling of the optic nerve associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) ]. In most cases, clinical symptoms occurred during or worsened {{at the time of}} A-wave rises in ICP. In the past 50 years, we {{have come a long way}} in monitoring and understanding these dramatic changes in ICP.

Clinical presentations in the early stage are nonspecific, and the sensitivity of <b>cranial</b> axial <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) with thick section is low. This study analyzed the clinical manifestation and neuroimaging findings in patients with septic CST in a medical center in Taiwan. MethodsThis retrospective case series included nine patients with septic CST who had typical symptoms and clinical course, evidence of infection, and imaging studies which demonstrated cavernous sinus lesion, and who were treated between 1995 and 2003 at National Taiwan University Hospital. ResultsSeven (77. 8 %) patients were more than 50 years old. Five (55. 6 %) had diabetes, and three (33. 3 %) had hematologic diseases. All cases were associated with paranasal sinusitis. The most frequent initial symptom was headache (66. 7 %), followed by ophthalmic complaints (diplopia or ophthalmoplegia, 55. 6 %; blurred vision or blindness, 55. 6 %), and ptosis (44. 4 %). Initial cranial images failed to identify CTS in all patients. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or coronal contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) with thin section confirmed the diagnosis. Fungi were the most common pathogens (55. 6 %). The inhospital case-fatality rate was high (44. 4 %). ConclusionDue to the high case-fatality rate and low yield rate of blood cultures, fungal CST should be suspected in an immunocompromised patient with ophthalmic complaints that progress from one eye to the other.

Although Weber's {{syndrome is}} rare, a child born with the disorder typically has a port-wine stain on the face around the eye. While the port-wine stain {{does not necessarily mean}} the child has Weber's syndrome, if the port-wine stain involves the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve than the likelihood of it being weber's syndrome greatly increases. If a port-wine stain around the eye is found, the patient should be screened for intracranial leptomeningeal angiomatosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)can be used to determine the presence and severity while <b>computed</b> <b>cranial</b> <b>tomography</b> can be used to determine the effect. MRI is the preferred diagnostic test on children presenting with port-wine stain. Other imaging techniques can be used in addition to further determine the severity of the disorder.
