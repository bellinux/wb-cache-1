In spread-spectrum communications, the information is sent, in parallel, at very low level through a set of frequencies. Only when the receiver knows the frequencies, the time relationship on when a given frequency or other communications channel will carry content, and how to extract the content, can information be recovered. Basic spread spectrum uses a fixed set of frequencies, but the signal strength in any one frequency is too low to detect without correlation to other frequencies.|$|E

Cameras had to be cooled by liquid nitrogen so they wouldn’t generate a heat signature themselves. They were also <b>computer-dependent</b> and could only record 2.5 minutes of footage before data needed to be downloaded, which also meant that dancers, wearing little in the cold building, had to stop every two minutes. The six dancers also had to perform without lighting or music.|$|E

40|$|Superconducting wiggler {{is planned}} to be {{installed}} in the Pohang Light Source (PLS) storage ring. Its strong mag-netic field is likely to disturb {{the motion of the}} circulating electron beam. Even though the wiggler field shape does not allow the analytic approach, a <b>computer-dependent</b> semi-analytic method can be adopted. Due to rectangular geometry of the wiggler, the horizontal focusing vanishes leaving only the vertical focusing. The linear and nonlinear effects are classified and discussed. Results indicate that nonlinearities of the superconducting wiggler are not as big as one might expect. Therefore the dynamic aperture is still big enough for operation. Finally the modification of t,he electron beam parameters is presented. 1...|$|E

The establishment of a Navy community of practice (CoP) for programmers and developers can significantly increase knowledge sharing, provide mentorship opportunities, increase cybersecurity of <b>computer-dependent</b> systems, and expose the Navy and industry to each other's cybersecurity needs and requirements, as well as best practices, tools, and techniques. The design for a Navy CoP should be human centered and should reflect the key characteristics shared among successful communities of practice. Through the use of surveys, interviews, and observations conducted at the June 2016 HACKtheSKY Navy hackathon, {{it was discovered that}} there is a need and want for such a Navy CoP. CoP design and specific Tenth Fleet recommendations were drafted with focus on social interactions, operational structure, and lifecycle characteristics.

40|$|A chapter {{report issued}} by the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "To better protect the nation's critical <b>computer-dependent</b> infrastructures from computer-based attacks and disruption, the President issued Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63 in 1998. The directive established the National Infrastructure Protection Center as a national focal point for gathering information on threats and facilitating the federal government's response to computer-based incidents. This report evaluates the center's progress in (1) developing national capabilities for analyzing cyber threat and vulnerability data and issuing warnings, (2) enhancing its capabilities for responding to cyber attacks, and (3) developing outreach and information-sharing initiatives with government and private-sector entities. GAO found that although the center has taken some steps to develop analysis and warning capabilities, the strategic capabilities described in PDD 63 have not been achieved. The center has provided important support to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigations of computer crimes by coordinating investigations and providing technical assistance. The center has also developed crisis management procedures and drafted an emergency law enforcement sector plan, which is now being reviewed by sector members. The center's information-sharing relationships are still evolving and will probably have limited effectiveness until reporting procedures and thresholds are defined and trust relationships are established. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Government and private-sector entities rely on satellites for services such as communication, navigation, remote sensing, imaging, and weather and meteorological support. Disruption of satellite services, whether intentional or not, can have a major adverse economic impact. Techniques to protect satellite systems from unauthorized use and disruption {{include the use of}} robust hardware on satellites, physical security and logical access controls at ground stations, and encryption of the signals for tracking and controlling the satellite and of the data being sent to and from satellites. When using commercial satellites, federal agencies reduce risks by securing the data links and ground stations that send and receive data. However, federal agencies do not control the security of the tracking and control links, satellites, or tracking and control ground stations, which are typically the responsibility of the satellite service provider. It is important to the nation's economy and security to protect against attacks on its <b>computer-dependent</b> critical infrastructures (such as telecommunications, energy, and transportation), many of which are privately owned. In light of the nation's growing reliance on commercial satellites to meet military, civil, and private sector requirements, omitting satellites from the nation's approach to protecting critical infrastructure leaves an important aspect of our nation's infrastructures without focused attention. ...|$|E
40|$|Military {{is one of}} many {{industries}} that is more <b>computer-dependent</b> than ever before, from soldiers with computerized weapons, and tactical wireless devices, to commanders with advanced battle management, command and control systems. Fundamentally, command and control is the process of planning, monitoring, and commanding military personnel, weaponry equipment, and combating vehicles to execute military missions. In fact, command and control systems are revolutionizing as war fighting is changing into cyber, technology, information, and unmanned warfare. As a result, a new design model that supports scalability, reusability, maintainability, survivability, and interoperability is needed to allow commanders, hundreds of miles away from the battlefield, to plan, monitor, evaluate, and control the war events in a dynamic, robust, agile, and reliable manner. This paper proposes a service-oriented architecture for weaponry and battle command and control systems, made out of loosely-coupled and distributed web services. The proposed architecture consists of three elementary tiers: the client tier that corresponds to any computing military equipment; the server tier that corresponds to the web services that deliver the basic functionalities for the client tier; and the middleware tier that corresponds to an enterprise service bus that promotes interoperability between all the interconnected entities. A command and control system was simulated and experimented and it successfully exhibited the desired features of SOA. Future research can improve upon the proposed architecture so much so that it supports encryption for securing the exchange of data between the various communicating entities of the system.

40|$|Can {{those of}} us living in hi-tech, <b>computer-dependent</b> {{parts of the world}} imagine a future without the Internet? By that I mean {{everyday}} life without the means of 24 / 7 communication with family, friends and colleagues, access to information resources, professional or leisure-based products and services? Even those without full access, who use the web reluctantly or have unplugged themselves from the global information infrastructure that underpins the disjunctures and differences of the world today still have to work and live {{with the rest of us}} who take these facilities for granted. This reflection considers what form and substance a future information society, however defined, might take as if this were purely a problem-solving exercise is to let the tail wag the dog. First I discuss the way different assumptions about the relationship between technology on the one hand and society on the other underscores deliberations further upstream. The second section looks at how these ideas resonate in popular science fiction; a literary and entertainment genre that provides a productive filter through which to look at ongoing and emerging debates about the Internet and society. The third section returns to live issues; where the Internet, as part of the latest generation of new media has become a focal point for political and social mobilization. With these reflections I hope to trigger some alternative ways to start thinking futures. My goal is to show that while there are many unarticulated scenarios to consider and prepare for, others are available in fictional form. Many others are already in the making; revolutions and counter-revolutions are being digitized as we browse, click, or twee...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a procedure {{to use a}} model interactively to investigate future land use by studying {{a wide range of}} scenarios defining climate, technological and socio-economic changes. A full model run of several hours {{has been replaced by a}} metamodel version which takes a few seconds, and provides the user with an immediate visual output and with the ability to examine easily which factors have the greatest effect. The Regional Impact Simulator combines a model of agricultural land use choices linked with models of urban growth, flooding risk, water quality and consequences for wildlife to estimate plausible futures of agricultural land on a timescale of 20 – 50 years. The model examines the East Anglian and North West regions of the United Kingdom at a grid resolution of 5 × 5 km, and for each scenario estimates the most likely cropping and its profitability at each location, and classifies land use as arable, intensive or extensive grassland or abandoned. From a modelling viewpoint the metamodel approach enables iteration. It is thus possible to determine how product prices change so that production meets demand. The results of the study show that in East Anglia cropping remains quite stable over a wide range of scenarios, though grassland is eliminated in scenarios with the 2050 s High climate scenario – almost certainly due to the low yield in the drier conditions. In the North West there is a very much greater range of outcomes, though all scenarios suggest a reduction in grassland with the greatest in the 2050 s High climate scenario combined with the “Regional Stewardship” (environmental) socio-economic scenario. The effects of the predicted changes in land use on plant species showed suitability for species to vary greatly, particularly between the socio-economic scenarios, due to detrimental effects from increases in nitrogen fertilisation. A complete simulation with the Regional Impact Simulator takes around 15 seconds (<b>computer-dependent),</b> which users who responded felt was adequate or better than adequate. The main areas for future improvement, such as the speed of the system, user interaction and the accuracy and detail of the modelling, are c...|$|E
