40|$|The detail {{design of}} the under the wing {{experimental}} composite nacelle components is summarized. Analysis of an inlet, fan bypass duct doors, <b>core</b> <b>cowl</b> doors, and variable fan nozzle are given. The required technology to meet propulsion system performance, weight, and operational characteristics is discussed. The materials, design, and fabrication technology for quiet propulsion systems which will yield installed thrust to weight ratios greater than 3. 5 to 1 are described...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} {{flow field}} analysis is presented {{of the effect}} of <b>core</b> <b>cowl</b> porosity on shock cell strength for a modern separate flow nozzle at cruise conditions. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify the primary physical mechanisms by which the application of porosity can reduce shock cell strength and hence the broadband shock associated noise. The flow is simulated by solving the asymptotically steady, compressible, Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes equations on a structured grid using an implicit, up-wind, flux-difference splitting finite volume scheme. The standard two-equation k - epsilon turbulence model with a linear stress representation is used with the addition of a eddy viscosity dependence on total temperature gradient normalized by local turbulence length scale. Specific issues addressed in this study were the optimal area required to weaken a shock impinging on the <b>core</b> <b>cowl</b> surface and the optimal level of porosity and placement of porous areas for reduction of the overall shock cell strength downstream. Two configurations of porosity were found to reduce downstream shock strength by approximately 50 %...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation is}} carried out to optimize the engine/airframe integration of closely coupled engines on a twin-jet regional transport aircraft in cruise flight condition. Since the engine position variation cannot be efficiently applied for such closely coupled engines, the optimization of the engine integration is performed by modifying the pylon, wing and engine. This investigation shows that pylon contour modifications enable an optimization of the engine integration. The modification of the pylon geometry within the jet stream dominates the engine interference on the wing since it changes {{the characteristics of the}} jet stream so that the tunnel effects are reduced significantly. The modification of the pylon geometry outside of the jet stream leads only to an insignificant change of the engine interference on the wing. Therefore the wing modification does not hold promise for a superior optimization of the engine integration. Furthermore, the jet stream can be also influenced by modifying the engine <b>core</b> <b>cowl.</b> The investigation shows that a small change on the <b>core</b> <b>cowl</b> contour reduces the engine interference on the wing considerably...|$|E
50|$|On January 19, 2010, a Mexicana Airbus A318, flight MX-368 from Cancun to Mexico City, with 45 {{passengers}} {{suffered a}} mishap at takeoff. Both the outboard and inboard <b>core</b> <b>cowling</b> {{of the left}} hand engine separated, hitting the fuselage and the semi-left wing leaving residues on the runway; a few minutes later, a Click Mexicana Boeing 717, flight QA-7323 from Havana to Cancun suffered the puncture of two tires while landing; in both incidents no casualties or injured passengers were reported.|$|R
50|$|Sheik Khalid Al-Qasimi {{stated that}} the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of the United Arab Emirates has {{launched}} {{an investigation into the}} crash. It is reported that one area of inquiry is the engines. The Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder were recovered and sent to the United Kingdom for analysis. In February 2010, it was reported that both recorders were not functioning, and no data was recovered from them. In January 2011, the GCAA released an interim report. An engine cowling fell away from the No. 4 engine shortly after take off. The final report stated the cause of the accident was the aircraft exceeding the maximum bank angle. This caused a stall and loss of control that was not recoverable. The crew were responding to a perceived power loss of engine #4, although their response was inappropriate. The #4 engines <b>core</b> <b>cowls</b> departed from the engine and this led to the separation of the Engine Pressure Ratio flex line.|$|R
40|$|Inlet airloads were {{measured}} by integration of pressures recorded at 252 locations {{on the right}} hand inboard (JT 9 D- 7 A) nacelle of the Boeing 747 aircraft. Pressures were recorded at 45 locations on the right hand outboard nacelle for comparison. Inertial loads {{were measured}} on both nacelles using accelerometers and rate gyros. Flight conditions included takeoffs at several gross weights, high g turns, and a simulated acceptance flight. Airloads at takeoff rotation {{were found to be}} larger than at any other normal service condition because of the combined effects of high angle of attack and high engine airflow. Inertial loads were smaller than previous estimates had indicated. A procedure is given for estimating inlet airloads at low speeds and high angles of attack for any underwing high bypass ratio turbofan installation approximately resembling the one tested. Flight procedure modifications are suggested that may result in better fuel economy retention in service. Pressures were recorded on the <b>core</b> <b>cowls</b> and pylons of both engine installations and on adjacent wing surfaces for use in development of computer codes for analysis of installed propulsion system aerodynamic drag interference effects...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out within a DLR/DNW/NLR {{co-operation}} on two Ultra-High Bypass Ratio engine simulators. These so-called CRUF (Counter Rotating Ultra-high bypass Fan) simulators were tested in isolation at low speed (July 1994) in the German Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW) at the so-called Single Engine Support Stand (SESS). The CRUF calibrations, needed for thrust bookkeeping, {{were carried out}} in the NLR model Engine Calibration Facility (ECF, November 1994). The average fan pressures of bothe CRUF units agree fairly well for the SESS and ECF tests. Both CRUF units show a rather large nacelle and pylon drag increase with increasing engine thrust. The prevention of ice build-up at core cowling and rake via a hot film at the outer <b>core</b> <b>cowl</b> surface worked properly and is strongly recommended for proper thrust bookkeeping...|$|E
40|$|Following {{from early}} {{experience}} with polyimides on the SST program and Shuttle aft flap studies the Boeing Company {{is now working}} on collaborative programs with its principal nacelle suppliers to pursue the development of Gr/PMR- 15 nacelle components. Two programs are currently in effect. The first program is directed specifically towards the flight test and service evaluation at the earliest possible date of a 747 nacelle <b>core</b> <b>cowl</b> structure. The second program seeks to firmly establish the producibility and cost of a 757 thrust reverser C duct in a production environment. The near term objectives of these programs include: (1) the comparison of estimated cost and weight of Gr/PMR- 15 versus metal structure, (2) the engine test of representative composite structure, (3) the preliminary design {{and analysis of the}} C duct structure, and (4) the preparation of cost data and time schedules for the development and producibility program. In addition to powerplant structure, the propulsion ducting system has shown to be a strong candidate for Gr/PMR- 15 application. Currently, the Boeing 747 Organization is evaluating the use of PMR- 15 matrix composites to replace nearly 800 lbs of titanium ducting per airplane...|$|E
40|$|Carbon fiber {{thermoset}} {{polymer matrix}} composites (PMC) with high temperature polyimide based in-situ polymerized monomer reactant (PMR) resin {{has been used}} for some time in applications which can see temperatures up to 550 F. Currently, graphite fiber PMR based composites are used in several aircraft engine components including the outer bypass duct for the GE F- 404, exit flaps for the P&W F- 100 - 229, and the <b>core</b> <b>cowl</b> for the GE/Snecma CF 6 - 80 A 3. Newer formulations, including PMR-II- 50 are being investigated as potential weight reduction replacements of various metallic components in next generation high performance propulsion rocket engines that can see temperatures which exceed 550 F. Extensive FEM thermal modeling indicates that these components are exposed to rapid heat-up rates (up to - 200 F/sec) and to a maximum temperature of around 600 F. Even though the predicted maximum part temperatures were within the capability of PW-II- 50, the rapid heat-up causes significant through-thickness thermal gradients in the composite part and even more unstable states when combined with moisture. Designing composite parts for such extreme service environments will require accurate measurement of intrinsic and transient mechanical properties and the hygrothermal performance of these materials under more realistic use conditions. The mechanical properties of polymers degrade when exposed to elevated temperatures {{even in the absence of}} gaseous oxygen. Accurate mechanical characterization of the material is necessary in order to reduce system weight while providing sufficient factors of safety. Historically, the testing of PMCs at elevated temperatures has been plagued by the antagonism between two factors. First, moisture has been shown to profoundly affect the mechanical response of these materials at temperatures above their glass transition temperature while concurrently lowering the material's Tg. Moisture phenomena is due to one or a combination of three effects, i. e., plastization of polymeric material by water, the internal pressure generated by the volatilization of water at elevated temperatures, and hydrolytic chemical decomposition. However, moisture is lost from the material at increasing rates as temperature increases. Second, because PMCs are good thermal insulators, when they are externally heated at even mild rates large thermal gradients can develop within the material. At temperatures where a material property changes rapidly with temperature the presence of a large thermal gradient is unacceptable for intrinsic property characterization purposes. Therefore, long hold times are required to establish isothermal conditions. However, in the service environments high-heating-rates, high temperatures, high-loading rates are simultaneous present along with residual moisture. In order to capture the effects of moisture on the material, holding at- temperature until isothermal conditions are reached is unacceptable particularly in materials with small physical dimensions. Thus, the effects due to moisture on the composite's mechanical characteristics, ie., their so-called analog response, may be instructive. One approach employed in this program was rapid heat-up (approx. 200 F/sec.) and loading of both dry and wet in-plane compressive specimens to examine the effects of moisture on this resin dominated mechanical property of the material...|$|E
40|$|Inferences {{from the}} {{asymmetry}} {{in time of}} the solar sunspot number, taken over many cycles, yields evidence for the relict magnetic field in the solar <b>core</b> which <b>Cowling</b> (1945) suggested would not decay, over the solar system's lifetime, given sufficiently high bulk electrical conductivity. Whether such a relict field is present can be ascertained either by searching {{for the presence of}} a 22 -year line quintet in the Fourier spectrum of the sunspot index or by processing the time sequence in order to highlight an offset. Since the solar cycle is unstable to frequency drifts, the presence of frequency modulation can lead to a spurious relict field signal...|$|R
