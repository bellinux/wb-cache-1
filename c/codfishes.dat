5000|$|The Gadidae are {{a family}} of marine fish, {{included}} in the order Gadiformes, known as the cods, <b>codfishes</b> or true cods. [...] It contains several commercially important fishes, including the cod, haddock, whiting, and pollock.|$|E
40|$|<b>Codfishes,</b> of {{the order}} Gadiformes (Anacanthini), puborder Gadoidei, are {{moderate}} to deep water fishes which have a worldwide distribution. The group is best represented in temperate and cold waters, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, where it contains {{some of the most}} valuable commercial species found anywhere in the world. Predominantly bottom-dwelling omnivores, these fishes characteristically have moderately elongate bodies covered with small scales, a tail fin free from dorsal and anal fins, a dorsal fin divided into two, or three parts, pelvic fins jugular in position, all fins being without true spines. The mouth is large and terminal, the chin often has a sensory barbel. In New Zealand waters, <b>codfishes</b> are represented by six families, twelve genera, and fifteen species. Many of these are little known deep water species. Unexploited and seldom seen by New Zealand fishermen, their occurrence in our waters in any quantity has only recently become known through the reports of foreign fishing fleets. The best known of New Zealand's <b>codfishes</b> is the red cod Pseudophycis bacchus (Forster in Bloch and Schneider, 1801). Of all the cods, this species most closely resembles its northern hemisphere counterparts. Elongate with a stout body, it is distinguished from other southern species by its red-grey colour, square-cut tail, body proportions, the number of rays in its fins (first dorsal 9 - 12, second dorsal 39 - 48, anal 40 - 50, caudal 32 - 36, pectorals 22 - 26, pelvics 5 - 6), and by a black spot {{on the side of the}} body near the pectoral fins. Averaging 2 kg (to 6. 3 kg) in weight and 55 cm (to 120 cm) in length, the red cod is an active wandering marine fish with a range which extends from the shore into depths of over 750 metres (Shuntov, pers. comm.). Fast growing and of relatively short lifespan, this primarily ground-dwelling predator moves throughout the levels of the sea at times, feeding on a wide range of marine animals...|$|E

In this work, the volatile profile of different commercially available salted dried <b>codfishes</b> was characterized by HS-SPME/GC-IT-MS. Samples of three species (Gadus morhua, Gadus macrocephalus and Theragra calchogramma), subjected to two curing processes (Traditional and Yellow curing) for different durations caught in distinct pools, were studied. Thirty compounds were fully characterized and 25 were tentatively identified and comprising several chemical classes (amines, hydrocarbons, esters, chlorinated compounds, aldehydes, aromatic, alcohols, acids, sulphur compounds, ethers, ketones and terpenes), with 26 of them being reported for the first time in codfish. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed major differences for the yellow cured sample and for T. chalcogramma species. Yellow cured codfish presented a higher content of compounds of almost all classes. T. chalcogramma exhibited a high content of terpenes and a low amount of aldehydes...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{increases}} of jellyfish has {{occurred during the}} last several decades. A dense population of a large scyphozoan jellyfish, Periphylla periphylla, has established itself as top predator in the Trondheimsfjord in Norway, impacting traditional fisheries. On this background we discuss the adaptive capacity of artisanal fishers and stakeholder involvement in environmental management. A serendipitous discovery was that fishers report that their capacity {{to adapt to the}} presence of jellyfish in fact was sufficient. What they could not adapt to, within the context of jellyfish proliferation, was top–down decisions from the national government allowing purse seiners into the fjord to harvest Sprat Sprattus sprattus and Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus rest quotas and thereby also large bycatches of the local <b>codfishes.</b> This harvest was perceived more detrimental to their fishery than was the jellyfish invasion. Relative to fisheries management’s choice of regulatory mechanisms during times of climatic change, we argue that by involving stakeholders intimately, the resulting policy advice will be experienced bottom–up and, thus, more legitimate and serendipitous results of a critical nature are more likely to surface...|$|E
40|$|Introduction <b>Codfishes</b> in the {{subfamily}} Gadinae {{are probably}} the most studied of all fishes owing to their great importanc tocJW erckj fisheries (Cohen et al. 1990). However, only two phylogenetic analyses of these fishes have been published. Dunn (1989) presented an analysis based on 28 morphologic lc harac 99 J of 11 genera (all gadine genera excra Drjagin, 1932), represented by 11 spec ies. Carr et al.

Both studiescudi uded that more work is needed. There is general agreement that the 12 genera in Gadinae (sensu Svetovidov 1948) form a monophyletic group, representing the most derived subfamily of cW]k hes. This group has been raised to family rank by several authors (e. g. Cohen 1984; Dunn 1989; Markle 1989). The assumed monophyly of the group is based on several apomorphic cph achi states...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{communication}} {{is central to}} the reproductive ecology of many fish species, particularly when conditions prevent the use of visual mating cues. The Burbot Lota lota is a freshwater codfish that spawns in a light-limited, under-ice environment. Both sexes possess swim bladder muscles, suggesting that both sexes engage in vocalization and that auditory cues are important to their mating system, but research on acoustic communication has been very limited in this species. In the current study we assessed the hearing sensitivity of Burbot from different size-classes. Burbot hearing was found to be more sensitive in juveniles than in adults, but across size-classes it was most sensitive at lower frequencies, which is similar to results with other <b>codfishes</b> and corresponds to the sounds produced by gadoids. Anthropogenic noise has the potential to disturb fish. The information gained in this study can be useful in assessing the impact of such noise, particularly under ice cover when Burbot are spawning. Further research is required to determine whether winter-based resource development activities that generate under-ice noise are disruptive to Burbot communication and reproduction...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} article {{outlines of}} {{an assessment of}} the adaptive capacity of stakeholder groups in the Trondheimsfjord region to the impacts related to local changes in Periphylla periphylla (jellyfish) concentrations. This paper addresses the interaction between the socio-ecological system and the marine ecosystem and the management challenges inherent therein by focusing on a serious management problem that is occurring in several Norwegian fjords. This is the recent superabundance of the lower trophic level jellyfish species P. periphylla, which competes with commercial Norwegian fish species {{for a wide variety of}} pelagic organisms including redfeed (Calanus finmarchicus), a key species in the coastal ecosystem and a particularly important food item for all <b>codfishes</b> in coastal waters. P. periphylla has, however, also some properties that might make it a valuable new resource in Norwegian waters, namely its potential for being a new and abundant source of collagen. The question addressed here is how to manage this jellyfish species in a manner that is rational from both socio-political and ecological perspectives, exploring stakeholder perceptions concerning their adaptation options and capacity to implement these options to this new resource and management mitigation options based on a set of stakeholder driven future scenarios.

40|$|Abstract Expression and {{processing}} of mitochondrial gene transcripts are fundamental to mitochondrial function, but information from early vertebrates like teleost fishes is essentially lacking. We have analyzed mitogenome sequences of ten <b>codfishes</b> (family Gadidae), and provide complete sequences from three new species (Saithe, Pollack and Blue whiting). Characterization of the mito-chondrial mRNAs in Saithe and Atlantic cod identified {{a set of}} ten poly(A) transcripts, and six UAA stop codons are generated by posttranscriptional polyadenylation. Struc-tural assessment of poly(A) sites is consistent with an RNaseP cleavage activity 50 of tRNA acceptor-like stems. COI, ND 5 and ND 6 mRNAs were found to harbor 30 UTRs with antisense potential extending into neighboring gene regions. While the 30 UTR of COI mRNA is complemen-tary to the tRNASer (UCN) and highly similar to that detected in human mitochondria, the ND 5 and ND 6 30 UTRs appear more heterogenic. Deep sequencing confirms expression of all mitochondrial mRNAs and rRNAs, and provides information about the precise 50 ends in mature transcripts. Our study supports an overall evolutionary conservation in mitochondrial RNA processing events among vertebrates, but reveals some unique 50 and 30 end characteristics in codfish mRNAs with implications to antisense regulation of gene expression...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{reproductive}} biology of the <b>codfishes</b> (Gadidae). Lacking direct observation, the study of secondary sexual characteristics can provide cues to their reproductive biology and behaviour. We reviewed here published accounts on sexual dimorphisms in 25 gadids in light of their general lifestyle, i. e. pelagic or demersal, and social behaviour. In addition, complementary data on fin lengths and drumming muscle size in haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and cod (Gadus morhua) are presented. Capacity for sound production occurred in almost half of the studied species, but was most prevalent in demersal species, where it is probably used in resource contests and to attract mates. For semi-pelagic gadids, we postulate that sound production may be lined to the formation of male-biased spawning shoals and the attraction of females towards such shoals; we identify candidate species to further test this hypothesis. Although rarely studied, sexual fin dimorphisms occur in several gadids. Cod, saithe and blue whiting males have longer pelvic fins than females, whereas no such dimorphism was observed in haddock. In cod and haddock, males use pelvic fins during courtship of females and agonistic encounters with other males. Pelvic fins probably also have a similar function in other gadids. The hitherto available information on sexually dimorphic traits and/or courtship behaviour in seven gadid species suggests that complex mating systems and non-random mate choice occurs frequently in this important goup of exploited fishes...|$|E
40|$|The Manfredonia City Marine is {{the third}} in Italy both for its size and for its nation-wide importance, {{in the last decade}} a {{considerable}} crisis has been registered in this economic sector as shown by the always decreasing number of fishing boats registered in the Harbour-Office. As a result of such a {{reduction in the number of}} fishing boats, a remarkable fall-off in the production occurs. The fishing activity registers a deep legislative, organizational and operational trans-formation. The European Community, in order to face the indiscriminate impoverishment of the ichthyic inheritance, has provided incentives for the fishing boats ’ casting off, by mean of an adequate reward. This paper aims to quantita-tively analyze the fishing activity in the Gulf of Manfredonia in order to present a significant picture of the forthcoming situation on the basis of real data. To this end, we adopt a Prey-Predator model in discrete time that is suitable to de-scribe properly the dynamics of an ecosystem in which just two species interact: predator and prey. The results show worrying forecasts. The fishing boats ’ number presents a decreasing dynamic and, above all, we record a remarkable reduction in the stock of fishes in the Gulf of Manfredonia. The quantity of fishes, in twenty years, will be reduced of 28 %. The Gulf sea, once rich in <b>codfishes,</b> mullets, cuttlefishes, octopus etc., runs the risk (on the basis of the results obtained in this paper) of making such species rare.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The diet of bearded seals, Erignathus barbatus, near St. Matthew Island, Bering Sea, was studied {{during the}} early spring of 1981. Eighty-six percent of the 78 seals ’ stomachs {{examined}} contained fish. Other prey taxon groups, in decreasing order of their percentages of occurrence, were crabs (73 %), clams (55 %), snails (47 %), amphipods (32 %), shrimp (Is%), mysids (13 %), marine worms (13 %) and cephalopods (4 %). The most frequently occurring prey species were capelin, Mallotus villosus (82 %); <b>codfishes,</b> Gadidae (64 %); narrow snow crab, Chionoecetes opilio (63 %); eelpouts, Lycodes spp. (56 %); longsnout prickleback, Lumpenella longirostris (49 %); nutshell clams, Nuculana sp. (42 %); and moon snails, Polinices sp. (27 %). Seventy-seven percent of the seals examined had consumed prey from three or more different taxon groups. We identified seven food items not previously reported as prey of the bearded seal in the Bering Sea. No differences were detected between the diets {{of males and females}} and between adults and juveniles, indicating no apparent segregation of foraging by sex or age. Bearded seals in the St. Matthew Island region of the Bering Sea forage {{in a manner similar to}} their conspecifics in other areas where fish constitute a major portion of their diet. Prey selection is probably dependent on availability, and diet may be highly diversified even within a relatively small area during a short period of time. Variety in prey consumption exemplifies the ability of the bearded seal to forage in the seasonally changing habitat associated with the advance and retreat of the ice front.

40|$|Trondheimsfjorden {{is one of}} {{approximately}} one dozen Norwegian fjords where the crown jellyfish, Periphylla periphylla (Scyphozoa, Coronatae) has had massive blooms. It has established large local populations {{during the last two}} decades. The population in Trondheimsfjorden is mainly established in three innermost basins. The growth and proliferation have been under close monitoring by regular research vessel cruises done by Trondheim Biological Station (TBS), Department of Biology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The Periphylla population seems to have reached a local carrying capacity year 2007. Simultaneously with the increase in the jelly population, local artisanal fisheries for <b>codfishes</b> have suffered from reduced catches. The reduction in catches is caused by clogged nets, fish quality reduction due to burn marks, and longer working hours caused by longer travelling distances and cleaning of nets. Together these factors have resulted in a negative economic development, and reduced the number of fishermen. This study estimates the economic consequences of the Periphylla bloom in the Trondheimsfjord. A simple ecologic model, public available fisheries statistics from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries, and data provided by Yajie Liu, have been applied. The model is based on calculations and estimations of the energy budget (measured in units of carbon), for the growth and maintenance of the current Periphylla population. The calculations include estimates of biomass and density, respiration rates, carbon demand and size distribution of Periphylla in the entire fjord. The economic and ecologic impacts have focused on the inner fjord basins: beyond the shallow sills at Tautra. The results show a total biomass of Periphylla of 101 466 tons, an average density of 1. 83 gm- 3, average production of 2. 01 gCm- 2 year- 1, and an average carbon turnover rate of 0. 0175 per day. The size distribution of the jellies is quite different between the four basins. The distribution are also changing on year to year basis within the basins. The yearly average possible codfish production, which could have been produced with this carbon budget, is estimated at approximately 70 tons. After the year 2007 when the jelly population assumingly reached the local carrying capacity, this would sum up to an average amount of 600 000 900 000 NOK per year, for the fisheries. For the entire period 2007 - 2015 the total loss is estimated to be 900 000 - 950 0000 NOK...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} 20 years, genome {{sequencing}} and assembly projects have changed from requiring large international collaborations to {{a task that}} {{a handful of people}} can plan and conduct. This has been driven by improvements in sequencing technology and computational methods. More and more sequencing and assembly projects are being conducted, with older assemblies being updated and improved, resulting in deeper understanding of the biology of a large and steadily growing number of species. The projects described in this thesis focus on genome assemblies created from species of the order Gadiformes, an order containing commercially and ecologically important fishes. Here, these assemblies are investigated in detail and compared to other teleost genome assemblies, with special attention to immune genes and short tandem repeats. We have updated and substantially improved the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) genome assembly with the use of different sequencing technologies and computational approaches. A major finding was that the presence of short tandem repeats (STRs) is the main factor that led to the fragmentation of the previous assembly. STRs are hypermutating loci that occur at high frequency (loci/Mbp) and high density (bp/Mbp) in the cod genome, surpassing that of other published genome assemblies. The STRs likely contribute to substantial genetic variation in natural cod populations. The Atlantic cod lacks genes involved in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II pathway, which is the pathway that normally detects and initiates a response against bacterial pathogens and thus is a crucial part of the adaptive immune system. To infer when in the ancestry of cod these genes were lost, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of 66 teleost species. We found that the loss is shared by all species in the order Gadiformes, and that there is an expanded repertoire of MHCI genes in the Gadiformes, which is likely connected with the large number of species in this order. Since the 66 new teleost (including gadiform) genome assemblies are fragmented, the properties of STRs and multi-copy immune genes are not easily investigated. To further elucidate their role in Gadiformes, we sequenced and assembled the genome of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), a relative of cod. Our result shows that the high density and frequency of STRs is a feature likely shared by all <b>codfishes</b> (a family inside Gadiformes), and possibly all Gadiformes. Cod and haddock share a similar repertoire of the innate immune Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes, with both losses and expansions. The expansions might be part of a compensatory mechanism for the absence of MHCII. Another class of genes, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) has been reported in large numbers in species without an adaptive immune system. We find that cod and haddock as well as most other teleosts generally have a high number of NLRs, with a likely expansion at the root of this clade. Thus, a high number of NLRs in teleosts {{does not seem to be}} connected with the presence or absence of MHCII. This thesis shows what kind of questions genome assemblies created for different purposes can answer. Ideally, genome assemblies for all kinds of species should be created, upgraded and updated based on the best available technologies. But this is costly. With the right planning and set-up, assemblies based on low-coverage sequencing can be very powerful with regards to topics such as the presence/absence of genes and for phylogeny. Also, even with moderate amounts of long-read PacBio sequencing, it is possible to create highly contiguous genome assemblies addressing issues that are impossible to elucidate with fragmented assemblies, such as the amount of multi-copy immune genes...|$|E
