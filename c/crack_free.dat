5000|$|New welding {{technique}} enables <b>crack</b> <b>free</b> welding of high silicon Al-Si controlled expansion alloys and aluminum 4047 for aerospace electronic packages - Using a novel concept, Amada Miyachi America enabled <b>crack</b> <b>free</b> welding of 70 percent silicon alloys, which are lightweight, high thermal conductivity alloys that {{are increasingly being}} used for RF and microwave packages and other critical heat sinking applications for the aerospace industry. Amada Miyachi America modified the solidification process without using post weld heat treatment. By using a fillet weld geometry and moving the weld {{close to the edge}} of the package the isotherms around the weld are modified such that the thermal gradient is reduced and re-orientated. The result included <b>crack</b> <b>free</b> welds in the highest silicon content alloy CE7. In addition the laser parameters process windows for lower silicon content alloys was significantly increased.|$|E

Radiata is used chipped to make particle board sheets, commonly used in flooring. Other sheet products are hardboard, softboard and ply. Most ply is structural and available in 7-22 mm sizes. A small amount of higher grade ply is used to produce thinner (4 and 7 mm) ply suitable for furniture, cabinet work and boat building.
