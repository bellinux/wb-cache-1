40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{contemporary}} issue of municipal finance. Municipalities in Czech Republic make up important part of public sector and influence the fiscal performance of Czech economy. Simultaneously, the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities has {{a crucial role in}} shaping of the entrepreneurial environment and of an environment in the widest sense. The goal of this paper was to analyse the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities in Czech Republic from the national economy point of view and to analyse the financing of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> between 1994 and 2003. The emphasis was given to the relation between the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> and the indebtedness of municipalities. The analysis reveals that the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> make significant share of overall public <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the share exceeds 50 %. The <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities also participate considerably on gross fixed capital formation (10. 57 % in 2003) and therefore on GDP formation (2. 83 % in 2003). However, considering the economic cycle, <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities has pro-cyclical effect. Analysis the structure of financing of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the operating surplus is very important resource. However, it is not sufficient one even considered together with capital incomes and capital subsidies. It results in using loans to finance the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure.</b> This happened between 1994 and 2003, with the exclusions of 1998 and 1999. Because of the future high need of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure,</b> it can be expected that municipalities will employ even more loans. The link between <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> and indebtedness of municipalities can be identified. There is another factor in effect. The volume of operating (especially tax) incomes is not sufficient. The state decentralizes significant portion of activities without providing municipalities with corresponding income. Municipalities then are not able to generate adequate operating surplus to finance the deficit on capital budget. Consequently, the rate of growth of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities declines as well as the share of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> on overall municipal expenditure...|$|R

[...] As private equity reemerged in the 1990s it began to earn a new degree of legitimacy and respectability. [...] Although in the 1980s, many of the acquisitions made were unsolicited and unwelcome, private equity firms in the 1990s focused on making buyouts attractive propositions for management and shareholders. [...] According to The Economist, “ig companies that would once have turned up their noses at an approach from a private-equity firm are now pleased {{to do business with}} them.” Additionally, private equity investors became increasingly focused on the long term development of companies they acquired, using less leverage in the acquisition. [...] In the 1980s leverage would routinely represent 85% to 95% of the purchase price of a company as compared to average debt levels between 20% and 40% in leveraged buyouts in the 1990s and {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. [...] KKR's 1986 acquisition of Safeway, for example, was completed with 97% leverage and 3% equity contributed by KKR, whereas KKR's acquisition of TXU in 2007 was completed with approximately 19% equity contributed ($8.5 billion of equity out of a total purchase price of $45 billion).

[...] Brownlee guaranteed loans to the Pool, but told the legislature {{that he did not}} expect this guarantee to prove necessary, since the large portions of the 1929 crop already sold at higher prices would provide sufficient cushioning unless wheat prices fell [...] "to a level never reached on Canadian markets". [...] In October 1930, with the Pool receiving a price for its wheat well below the $1.00 per bushel that it guaranteed its farmers, the banks refused to loan more money unless the Pool appointed to its Central Selling Agency (CSA) a general manager acceptable to the banks. [...] Brownlee and Premiers John Bracken of Manitoba and James Thomas Milton Anderson of Saskatchewan met in Ottawa with acting Prime Minister Sir George Perley, seeking direct federal aid to the Pools. [...] The premiers' pleas rejected, CSA President Alexander James McPhail offered the banks the names of two possible general managers. [...] The first was John McFarland, former president of the Alberta Pacific Grain Company. [...] The second was Brownlee. [...] The banks chose McFarland. [...] Brownlee too imposed conditions on the AWP as a condition of provincial assistance: he wanted the provincial government to be consulted on all AWP managerial decisions and given the right to veto <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures,</b> and he required it to increase its sales commission from three quarters of a cent per bushel to one cent. [...] While these conditions met with resistance from farmer leaders who believed that they would transform the AWP from a farmers' organization to a grain company like any other, Brownlee was supported by UFA President Henry Wise Wood, the AWP was reliant on provincial support, and the conditions were accepted.|$|E
