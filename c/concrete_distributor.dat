Increasing levels of monolithic {{building in the}} Russian construction sector and construction equipment manufacturing automobile concrete pumps, stationary concrete pumps and pneumatic blower promote the use of high-performance, cost-based ways {{to the construction of}} monolithic concrete and reinforced concrete structures. Special concreting methods, including the method of discharge concrete using concrete pumps, stationary concrete pumps, pneumatic blower, switch arrows and mechanical <b>concrete</b> <b>distributor,</b> found a good use in the foreign and Russian construction practice. The method of concreting pressure scientifically sound and environmentally feasible for the construction of monolithic construction of foundations, including, for the monolithic structures erected by way of the "wall in the ground " [1, 4]. One of the ways to improve the efficiency of concrete-pumping is the concentration of the means of transport and production specialization. Organizational and technical system that combines concrete transportation and concrete placer technique has been implemented in the last century i...|$|E
40|$|Writing of this master thesis was {{stimulated by}} my {{participation}} on compulsory {{practice and the}} level of its interest. The master thesis includes the description and technical documentation for the construction of the reinforced concrete building foundations. The aim of this thesis is to solve the method and potential problems of the concreting. As for the concreting machinery, I suggested to use the machines (mixer truck and mobile concrete pump) from the nearby concrete plant to reduce the total transportation costs. Iâ€™ve made an analysis of machine renting fees and price of fresh <b>concrete</b> between local <b>distributors.</b> The main contribution of the master thesis is acquaintance with the construction of the apartment building and with a practical side of preparations before the construction begins...|$|R
40|$|The review {{highlights}} {{the main features}} of internal audit by focus on distribution of medicinal products. Recent data suggest internal audit {{as an antidote to}} effects of economic recession. The present review reveals internal audit as a tool for competitiveness through implementation of good practices. The purpose of the review is to describe the advantages of internal audit in new institutional frame. The object of analysis is the distribution practice, and more <b>concrete,</b> the wholesale <b>distributors.</b> The analysis was perform by factor analysis and done in response to the tendency for outsource of distribution activities and practical interest in the use of internal audit by implementation of requirements and recommendations for good practices. The results showed that the internal audit in pharmaceutical industry is determinate by two factors: regulatory requirements and complexity of supply chain. The external and the internal environment define five features of internal audit in pharmaceutical industry. ...|$|R
