60|$|The Ma'ázah is a Syro-Egypto-Bedawi clan, {{originally}} Arab, {{or rather}} Syrian, but migratory, as are all Arabs. It now extends high {{up the valley}} of the Nile, and it is still found in the Wady Musá (of Suez) and on the Za'faránah block. Even in Egypt it is turbulent and dangerous: the men are professional robbers; and their treachery is uncontrolled by the Bedawi law of honour--they will eat bread and salt with the traveller whom they intend to murder. For many years it was unsafe to visit the camps within sight of Suez, until a <b>compulsory</b> <b>residence</b> at head-quarters taught the Shaykhs manners. The habitat in Arabia stretches from the Wady Musá of Petra, where they are kinsmen of the Tiyáhah, the Bedawin of the Tíh-desert; and through Ma'án as far as the Birkat el-Mu'azzamah, south of Tabúk.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{development}} {{over the last}} 20 years of the section 8 powers under the Children Act 1989. In particular, it examines residence, especially shared residence, contact, prohibited steps and specific issue orders. In respect of each order, the review compares the current position with what was originally intended and more generally anticipated. The article concludes that whereas prohibited steps and specific issue orders have broadly worked as expected and intended, <b>residence</b> <b>orders</b> and contact have not. <b>Residence</b> <b>orders</b> {{have been used to}} allocate parental responsibility, which was not intended, and shared care arrangements have become much more common than anticipated. Contrary to expectation, contact disputes have proved to be exceptionally problematic and there have been consequential reforms to deal with issues. Despite these developments the overall conclusion is that the section 8 orders have generally {{stood the test of time}} and should not be regarded as being beyond their ‘sell-by’ date...|$|R
40|$|While section 9 (2) of the Children Act 1989 {{prevents}} a Local Authority from {{applying for}} a child arrangements order directly, a case file study of <b>residence</b> and contact <b>orders</b> made in 2011 found {{that a significant number}} of applications for <b>residence</b> <b>orders</b> in the County Court were supported and sometimes even instigated by local authority children’s services (Harding & Newnham, 2015). The findings of the study demonstrate that <b>residence</b> <b>orders</b> often formed part of solutions offered to the family and can even operate as an alternative to formal public law remedies in situations where the parents are no longer able to provide care, and grandparents or other relatives take over. In these ‘hybrid cases’ private law orders are used to resolve situations on the fringes of public law action and, in some cases, divert cases from voluntary accommodation or formal care proceedings. This article raises questions about whether cases are being diverted to private law remedies in an appropriate manner and argues that closer scrutiny of the practice is required to ensure that the rights of parents, children and kinship carers are appropriately respected...|$|R

5000|$|This was the {{approach}} in D v D (Shared <b>Residence</b> <b>Order)</b> (2001) 1 FLR 495 http://www.familieslink.co.uk/pages/law_ukcases_dvd.htm, {{in which it}} was held that residence of the children involved could be shared, even when one of the parents was hostile to the idea. The principle was clearly stated: {{it is not necessary to}} show that exceptional circumstances exist before a shared <b>residence</b> <b>order</b> may be granted. Nor is it probably necessary to show a positive benefit to the child. What is required is to demonstrate that the order is in the interest of the child in accordance with the requirements of s1 Children Act 1989 which makes the interests of the children the first and paramount concern of the Courts in any litigation. In the case of very young children, there is an informal rebuttable presumption in disputed cases that a very young child's interests are more likely to be served by having a single 'base' with one parent, regardless of how the other has performed. This may be rebutted by evidence to demonstrate that the child's interests will be better served by shared residence, or by sole residence with one spouse or with other significant persons.
