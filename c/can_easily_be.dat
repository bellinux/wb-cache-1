5|$|Although sodium is less {{reactive}} than potassium, {{this process}} works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> distilled off, {{so that the}} equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.|$|E
5|$|Cold {{seawater}} {{is used in}} the Seawater Greenhouse to both {{cool and}} humidify the interior of greenhouse-like structure. The cooling can be so effective that not only do the plants inside benefit from reduced transpiration, but dew collects {{on the outside of the}} structure and <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> collected by gutters.|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> {{identified}} by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw {{are covered with}} knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} is, however, gradually decreasing due to habitat loss, {{caused by}} expanding human settlements and poaching for its superior meat. As they are docile and inactive {{most of the}} time, they <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> killed. The species became extinct in Swaziland and Zimbabwe, but has been reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|Especially in warmer areas, {{the house}} sparrow may build its nests in the open, on the {{branches}} of trees, especially evergreens and hawthorns, or in the nests of large birds such as storks or magpies. In open nesting sites, breeding success tends to be lower, since breeding begins late and the nest <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> destroyed or damaged by storms. Less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs, favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds, which are then domed over.|$|E

5|$|Queen Mary had the tiara {{altered to}} {{accommodate}} 15 of the Cambridge cabochon emeralds. The original drop pearls <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> replaced {{as an alternative}} to the emeralds. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara directly from her grandmother in 1953. It is almost exclusively worn together with the Cambridge and Delhi Durbar parures, also containing large emeralds. Elizabeth wore the tiara in her official portrait as Queen of Canada as none of the Commonwealth realms besides the United Kingdom have their own crown jewels.|$|E
5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a right angle to the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E

5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> dissolved {{to provide}} electrolyte solutions. This {{is a simple}} way to control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E
5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but {{is much less}} expensive to build because a single transmitter and receiver {{is used for the}} entire system. The same antenna array <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power.|$|E
5|$|The brolga <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} with the sarus crane, but the latter's red head-colouring extends partly down the neck, while the brolga's is confined to the head. The brolga is more silvery-grey in colour than the sarus, the legs are blackish rather than pink, and the trumpeting and grating calls it makes are at a lower pitch. Additionally, in Australia {{the range of the}} sarus is limited to a few scattered localities in northern Australia, compared to the more widespread distribution of the brolga.|$|E

Raphael Robinson, in a 1971 paper which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles.|$|E
5|$|The species <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> {{identified}} from {{recordings of}} its echolocation call. The call {{consists of a}} component with constant frequency followed by a short one with changing frequency. The call takes 6.5 to 13.5ms, averaging 10.1ms, and the period between two calls is 22.7 to 86.3ms, averaging 42.7ms. The maximum frequency averages 94.2kHz, the minimum frequency averages 82.0kHz, and the call emits the most energy at a frequency of 93.2kHz.|$|E

5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E
5|$|Edward built further luxurious, {{self-contained}} lodgings for {{his court}} around {{the east and}} south edges of the Upper Ward, creating the modern shape of the quadrangle. The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward. In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside. The earliest weight-driven mechanical clock in England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354. William of Wykeham went on to build New College, Oxford and Winchester College, where the influence of Windsor Castle <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> seen.|$|E
5|$|Food {{security}} and food power {{are not the}} same thing. However, they are often directly related. Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active, healthy life. Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get something in return. Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's food security. A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens. This want, however, <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power.|$|E
