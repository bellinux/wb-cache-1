50|$|From the 1950s {{dairying}} in the Gladstone hinterland {{declined in}} favour of beef cattle and tropical fruit, and the PCD, following a national trend, turned to bulk milk rather than butter production, establishing milk pasteurising facilities and a bottling plant at its Gladstone factory in 1955-57. The factory building was refurbished to accommodate milk processing to meet codes of practice and included {{the introduction of a}} lower ceiling in the milk processing room and the re-finishing of the floor. Milk from the dairies was transported to the site by road and by rail. It was received at the northern end of the factory, whereupon the cans were weighed, milk was checked for freshness, sample cups were taken from each supplier and daily cream dockets were issued. The cans were placed upon a conveyor which tipped the milk into troughs and milk was strained into vats. The cans went to the <b>can</b> <b>washer</b> where they were cold rinsed, caustic washed, hot washed and steamed dried before being returned to the supplier for removal. The milk was centrifugally tested and pasteurised in the with the salt hole and pump house on the site providing the water for the vacuum before being bottled and then transported by conveyor to the stores.|$|E

50|$|At the start, {{one of the}} machine's major {{drawbacks}} was {{the necessity}} of using one wash formula for all items. Modern computerized tunnel <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> monitor and adjust the chemical levels in individual pockets, effectively overcoming this problem.|$|R
50|$|<b>Washers</b> <b>can</b> damage surfaces: {{water can}} be forced deep into bare wood and masonry, leading to an {{extended}} drying period. Such surfaces can appear dry after a short period, but still contain significant amounts of moisture that can hinder painting or sealing efforts.|$|R
50|$|Most {{large-scale}} industrial washers are horizontal-axis machines, but {{may have}} front-, side-, or top-load doors.

5000|$|Bulk vending {{machines}} {{are susceptible to}} fraud. Unlike other {{vending machines}}, most bulk vending machines do not read coins' [...] "metallic signature," [...] and a worthless token {{of the same size}} as a coin (e.g. a wooden nickel or a <b>washer)</b> <b>can,</b> in most cases, operate a bulk vending machine equally as well as a coin can.|$|R

5000|$|Mechanical Filtration {{addresses}} {{only two}} issues in wash rack wash water: suspended solids larger than 30 µm, and free {{oil and grease}}. Emulsified oil and grease cause damage to the media filters, resulting in very high maintenance costs. Electrocoagulation addresses any size of suspended solids (including destructive >30 µm particles and heavy metals that <b>can</b> wear-and-tear pressure <b>washers</b> and pose an environmental and employee hazard).|$|R
5000|$|Rigid valves using {{plastic or}} metal washers that fit tightly into the PVC pipe as the rope is dragged through are also used. If the fit is tight, the <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> be spaced {{up to half}} a meter apart. The deeper the well, the smaller the pipe inner {{diameter}} must be, given the available power constraints. These rope pumps are often worked with a hand crank ...|$|R
50|$|Ball <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> be {{operated}} either manually or electronically. Ball washers for cleaning individual balls {{consist of a}} cylindrical housing, in which the ball to be cleaned is inserted. The cleaning of the ball takes place via circulating brushes. For cleaning {{a larger number of}} golf balls, machines are used which suck up the balls like a vacuum cleaner, wash them, {{and put them in a}} separate net afterward.|$|R
50|$|If {{friction}} and bottoming-out effects are ignored, {{the spring rate}} of a stack of identical Belleville <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> be quickly approximated. Counting {{from one end of}} the stack, group by the number of adjacent washers in parallel. For example, in the stack of washers to the right, the grouping is 2-3-1-2, because there is a group of 2 washers in parallel, then a group of 3, then a single washer, then another group of 2.|$|R
50|$|Most {{consumer}} washers are electric- or petrol-powered. Electric washers {{plug into}} a normal outlet, are supplied with tap water, and typically deliver pressure {{up to about}} 2,000 psi (140 bar). Petrol <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> deliver twice that pressure, but due to the hazardous nature of the engine exhaust they are unsuitable for enclosed or indoor areas. Some models can generate hot water, which can be ideal for loosening and removing oil and grease.|$|R
50|$|After all 4 washers {{have been}} thrown, points are tallied. It is {{possible}} for a washer to knock another washer into a better OR worse position during play. If one washer should move, shift or alter another washer during a throw, the final resting places of both washers are noted and scores tallied accordingly. Because <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> hit each other during play and affect their final position, do not move any washers until all are thrown.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, [...] "A small drip from a worn faucet <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> waste 20 {{gallons of water}} per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons". When washing dishes by hand, {{it is not necessary}} to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Some rotary {{switches}} are user configurable {{in relation to}} the number of positions. A special toothed washer that sits below the holding nut can be positioned so that the tooth is inserted into {{one of a number of}} slots in a way that limits the number of positions available for selection. For example, if only four positions are required on a twelve position switch, the <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> be positioned so that only four switching positions can be selected when in use.|$|R
40|$|By {{rotation}} of washerlike part, mechanical indicator shows when predetermined compression or tension load has been reached. Indicator consists of bolt, sleeve, load-indicating washer, and nut. Besides application as load indicator, device has uses as remote indicator of mechanical action. Rotating <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> also act as sequencer, signaling action to begin upon attainment of certain load. It can be used, for example, to initiate work cycle after stored energy {{has been built}} up in hydraulic or pneumatic power equipment. It {{can also be used}} as remote, nonelectrical switch in hazardous environments...|$|R
50|$|An {{anchor bolt}} is a {{fastener}} used to attach objects or structures to concrete. There are {{many types of}} anchor bolts, consisting of designs that are mostly proprietary to the manufacturing companies. All consist of a threaded end, to which a nut and <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> be attached for the external load. Anchor bolts are extensively used on all types of projects, from standard buildings to dams and nuclear power plants. They {{can also be used}} to firmly affix embed plates to a concrete foundation when used with a structural steel element.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{much the}} {{developing}} world, laundry is {{done the same}} way {{today as it was}} thousands of years ago. The strenuous and time consuming task of clothes washing often falls on the women, who spend many hours every week on household chores. A low cost mechanical <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> reduce the time and physical toil of doing laundry by hand. The washer was designed for the lowest cost, using a hybrid manufacturing strategy that leverages the flexibility of industrial manufacturing with the low cost advantages of local assembly. The <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> be constructed from a kit that weighs only 8 lbs and packs in less than one cubic foot. The kit is centrally manufactured at at estimated cost of $ 25, and would reach the final user at maximum of $ 45. The washer is then assembled on location by a local welder, using locally available materials. The installation costs for rural Guatemala are estimated at less than $ 90, for a total installed unit cost of $ 135. Marketing partnerships with producers of chemical powder detergents, who could use the washer as a promotional effort, can further reduce the cost. The unit is affordable, especially when shared by groups of families or larger communities. It is designed to be easily serviced on location, and can be easily adapted and enhanced by a skilled local worker based on the needs of the user. In order to meet the dissemination goal of 1 million units installed in Guatemala over 5 years, the design had to be optimized not only for low production cost but also ease of dissemination. Because of the reduced weight and volume, the <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> be disseminated along existing product distribution channels {{in the form of a}} kit. By simplifying local assembly, the dissemination of the design can be done through a simple set of instructions. Since all distribution costs are paid for by the end user, this dissemination approach is not only sustainable, but also scalable, allowing the product to succeed based solely on its level of usefulness and affordability. by Radu Raduta.

25|$|Fang bolts or {{rail anchor}} bolts {{have also been}} used for fixing rails or chairs to sleepers. The fang bolt is a bolt {{inserted}} {{through a hole in}} the sleeper with a fanged nut that bites into the lower surface of the sleeper. For fastening flat-bottomed rails, an upper-lipped <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> be used to grip the edge of the rail. They are more resistant to loosening by vibrations and movement of the rail. They are thought more effective than spikes and screws and so are used in positions such as switch (point) tieplates and on sharp curves.|$|R
50|$|So, a 2-3-1-2 stack (or, since {{addition}} is commutative, a 3-2-2-1 stack) gives {{a spring}} constant of 3/7 {{that of a}} single washer. These same 8 <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> be arranged in a 3-3-2 configuration (K = 6/7k), a 4-4 configuration (K = 2k), a 2-2-2-2 configuration (K = 1/2k), and various other configurations. The number of unique ways to stack n washers {{is defined by the}} integer partition function p(n) and increases rapidly with large n, allowing fine-tuning of the spring constant. However, each configuration will have a different length, requiring the use of shims in most cases.|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{the use of}} “end of pipe” clean {{technologies}} for steel making in oxygen converter are presented. The exhaust gases resulted from steel making process contain dust, smoke and oxides as pollutants. For restraining them electric filter or washers are used. The <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> be scrubbers and/or multitube Venturi. The equipment in which the pollutants are restrained depends on the oxygen blast into the converter: when the blast is done from up to down through a spear the electric filter is used, but when the blast is done from down to up through bottom of the converter the washers are used. electric filter, blast, converter, washers, dust, steel...|$|R

25|$|Lever drags {{work through}} cam action to {{increase}} or decrease pressure on the drag washers located on the spool itself. Most lever drags offer preset drag positions for strike (reduced drag to avoid tearing the hook out of the fish), full (used once the hook is set) and freespool (see above). Lever drags are simpler and faster to adjust during the fight. And, since they use the spool for the washer stack rather than the drive gear, the <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> be larger, offering more resistance and smoother action. The disadvantage is that in freespool, there can be residual and unwanted resistance since the drag mechanism may not be {{completely out of the}} picture without resorting to more complex mechanics.|$|R

5000|$|As with {{front-loading}} washers, clothing {{should not}} be packed tightly into a top-loading washer. Although wet fabric usually fits into a smaller space than dry fabric, a dense wad of fabric can restrict water circulation, resulting in poor soap distribution and incomplete rinsing. Extremely overloaded top-loading <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> either jam {{the motion of the}} agitator, overloading or damaging the motor or gearbox, burning drive belts, or tearing fabrics - many Whirlpool/Kenmore machines even have a mechanical [...] "fuse" [...] designed to break before the expensive motor is damaged. Extreme overloading can also push fabrics into the small gap between the underside of the agitator and the bottom of the wash basket, resulting in fabrics wrapped around the agitator shaft, possibly requiring agitator removal to unjam.|$|R
50|$|Through the years, {{the request}} of an always greater {{precision}} in calibrations process, the availability of new materials and new and more accurate calculation methods, led {{to the introduction of}} the disc spring into all areas of technology and now disc springs are used in a lot of industries: automotive, building, defense and so on. In the different fields, if they are used as springs or to apply a pre-load of flexible quality to a bolted joint or bearing, Belleville <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> be used as a single spring or as a stack. In a springs stack, disc springs can be stacked in the same or in an alternating direction and of course it possible to stack packets of multiple springs stacked in the same direction.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{screw-down}} tap mechanism was patented {{and manufactured}} by the Rotherham brass founders Guest and Chrimes in 1845. Most older taps use a soft rubber or neoprene washer which is screwed down onto a valve seat {{in order to}} stop the flow. This is called a [...] "globe valve" [...] in engineering and, while it gives a leak-proof seal and good fine adjustment of flow, both the rubber washer and the valve seat are subject to wear (and for the seat, also corrosion) over time, so that eventually no tight seal is formed in the closed position, resulting in a leaking tap. The <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> be replaced and the valve seat resurfaced (at least a few times), but globe valves are never maintenance-free.|$|R
30|$|The {{synthetic}} detergents {{used in a}} clothes <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> clean clothes effectively; however, they can also remove the fatty finish and lubricating waxes on the fabric when they remove dirt and oil, thereby changing the fabric hand of the washed garment (McCarthy and Drozdowski 1989). Fabric softeners {{were introduced to the}} US market in the early 1950 s to provide a pleasant odor and improve the hand of laundered clothes (Simpson 1958). Fabric softeners can make the washed fabric soft and smooth by coating the washed fabric with lubricants and humectants. Since the introduction of fabric softeners to the market, their use has grown continuously. Currently, most households (about 80 %) in the US regularly use fabric softeners during home laundering (American Association on Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) 2012).|$|R
5000|$|An {{industrial}} <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> {{be mounted}} on heavy-duty shock absorbers {{and attached to}} a concrete floor, {{so that it can}} extract water from even the most severely out-of-balance and heavy wash loads. Noise and vibration is not as unacceptable as in a domestic machine. It may be mounted on hydraulic cylinders, permitting the entire washer to be lifted and tilted so that fabrics can be automatically dumped from the wash drum onto a conveyor belt once the cycle is complete. [...] One special type of continuous-processing washer is known as the tunnel washer. This specialized high-capacity machine does not have a drum where everything being washed undergoes distinct wash and rinse cycles, but moves the laundry slowly and continuously through a long, large-diameter horizontal-axis rotating tube in the manner of an assembly line, with different processes at different positions.|$|R
50|$|A parts <b>washer</b> <b>can</b> be {{characterized}} by its power density. The power density is calculated by dividing the total horsepower of all the pump systems providing the wash function by the total work volume for that washing function. Typical units are horsepower per cubic foot. The results of this calculation offer a beginning point in comparing various parts washing systems. The power density number is also useful when it is desired {{to achieve the same}} cleaning standard and throughput in a different work volume. Note that the power density calculation {{does not take into account}} the pump system efficiency and assumes that all of the energy delivered to the pump is delivered to the wash load. A more accurate power density would consider the pump system efficiency as efficiencies vary greatly even from an identical pump as the efficiency is highly dependent on the pump operating point, the piping design and the friction losses in the system.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to saving water, HE <b>washers</b> <b>can</b> also save energy. As much as 80 – 90 % {{of the energy}} used by washers is for heating the water used in the washing cycle (Electric Power Research Institute 2010). Because less water is required in HE washers, if the garments are washed in either hot or warm water, less energy is needed to heat the water. Another energy saving benefit of HE washers is a shorter drying time. Since HE washers have a significantly higher spin speed than conventional <b>washers,</b> water <b>can</b> be extracted more effectively. Less water means a shorter drying time after washing, resulting in energy cost savings {{of as much as}} 50 % (United States Environmental Protection Agency, Energy Start 2012). According to ENERGY STAR, a program developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Energy Star (2017), which promotes energy efficiency in products, a HE clothes washer needs to use at least 33 % less water and 28 % less energy than the minimum efficiency standards required by conventional washers to be able to carry the ENERGY STAR logo.|$|R
