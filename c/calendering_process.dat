40|$|While {{existing}} carbonaceous anodes for {{lithium-ion batteries}} (LIBs) are approaching a practical capacitive limit, Si {{has been extensively}} examined as a potential alternative because it shows exceptional gravimetric capacity (3579 mA h g- 1) and abundance. However, the actual implementation of Si anodes is impeded by difficulties in electrode <b>calendering</b> <b>processes</b> and requirements for excessive binding and conductive agents, arising from the brittleness, large volume expansion (> 300 %), and low electrical conductivity (1. 56 × 10 - 3 S m- 1) of Si.

5000|$|In {{the early}} models of hard disk drives, {{stiction}} {{was known to}} cause read/write heads {{to stick to the}} platters of the hard drive due to the breakdown of lubricants used to coat the platters. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the size of hard drive platters decreased from the older 8" [...] and 5.25" [...] sizes to 3.5" [...] and smaller, manufacturers continued to use the same <b>calendering</b> <b>processes</b> and lubricants used on the older, larger drives. The much tighter space caused much higher internal operating temperatures in these newer smaller drives, often leading to an accelerated breakdown of the surface lubricants into their much stickier components. When the drive was powered off and would cool down (for example {{at the end of the}} day when a user went home and shut off their PC), these now-broken-down lubricants would become quite viscous and sticky, sometimes causing the read/write heads to literally stick to the platter. One response to this problem was to remove the affected drive and strike it gently but firmly on the side, then try to start it while connected to but not necessarily fitted inside the machine. This might break the heads free for long enough to spin up the drive and recover the data from it without powering it down. Once started, it would continue to run indefinitely, but might not start again if powered down. Instead of tapping the drive, rotating it sharply by hand could start it.

The fibers are assumed to be flexible to allow bending over one another during the compression process. Lateral displacement is not allowed during the compaction process.

Bending of the fibers is modeled either by considering a constant “slope of bending” or constant “span of bending. ” The influence of the bending parameters on the propagation of compression through the material’s thickness is discussed.

The calendering phenomena of a material ?ow betweentwo co-rotating rolls to produce sheets of speci?c thicknessand ?nal appearance is an important process in many industries, such as the plastics, paper, rubber and steel industries {{for the production of}} rolled sheets of speci?c thickness and ?nal appearance. In particular, the calendering of molten polymers is a process for the production of continuous sheet or ?lm by squeezing the melt between a pair of heated counter-rotating rolls. A bench-top apparatus simulates the process. In this study two types of calendering processes are considered. In the ?rst process, a molten material is transformed into a sheet by passing through a pair of rollers, whereas in second process a uniform ?lm of liquid is deposited on a moving sheet. These two processes are quite similar, there is a convergingdiverging character to the kinematics, and we can expect the dynamics to be similar to that described in the ?rst process. The major di?erence is in the character of the separation region, where the material splits and adheres to both moving surfaces. In the ?rst process, it is assumed that the material separates clearly from the roll, whereas, in a second process, it is assumed that the material evenly wets both the roll and the sheet. The lubrication approximation theory (LAT) is outlined together with its calculations for viscoelastic and viscoplastic materials.

40|$|ABSTRACT During calendering, {{which is}} done {{in order to improve}} its {{printing}} properties, the paper is compressed in one or more roll nips. Paper is a viscoelastic material and this will influence its performance during calendering. At least for woodfree paper, the imposed compressive stress has a much greater influence on the remaining deformation (after unloading) than the duration of the compression. A consequence of this is that a soft calender nip will produce a lower deformation than a hard calender nip at a given line load. Furthermore, a soft nip does not suppress surface topography in a size region corresponding to fibre flocs as much as a hard nip. In this perspective, soft-nip calendering constitutes a more uniform treatment than hard-nip calendering. However, the in-plane density variations increased with both types of calender nips, although less pronounced in the case of soft nip calendering. 	Calendering at a high temperature leads to a selective deformation of the surface region. This phenomenon can be used to optimise the relationship between mechanical and surface properties. At a given degree of deformation, properties like stiffness and gloss depends on the conditions at which the deformation was achieved. Calculations of an effective bending modulus can be used to characterise the stratification of the structure induced by the high-temperature calendering. A similar effect can in principle also be attained by establishing a moisture gradient in the thickness direction of the sheet. Moisture is more difficult to use (than temperature) for such a purpose. A water box application directly on a calender was one working strategy employed here in order to obtain moisture gradient calendering. 	A positive effect of precalendering a woodfree sheet with regard to surface smoothness could be seen also after coating and final calendering, although it is expected that some of the precalendering effect is offset due to contact with the aqueous phase. Final calendering led to some development of gloss variations. This might indicate an uneven surface porosity, which may have a negative influence on printing properties. However, the precalendering facilitated a more uniform coating layer, which is expected to {{have a positive effect on}} printing properties. In total, it seemed that precalendering was on the whole beneficial for the final properties of the paper product. The degree of precalender deformation controlled the final properties. Speed, type of nip or temperature as such in the precalender operation, appeared not to have major influence on the final properties. 	Water/paper interactions is a common denominator in many cases of interplay between process steps in papermaking. Minimising these interactions appears in many cases to be a useful route to improve the relation beneficial between mechanical and surface properties, since water exposure can lead to an irreversible deformation of the surface structure. Penetration of water and water-based fluids appeared to be controlled mostly by the openness, or porosity of the surface and on the external pressure used when applying the fluid. Wet-pressing and <b>calendering</b> are <b>processes</b> that lead to closure of the surface, which helps to minimise the water penetration in subsequent process steps, e. g. surface sizing and coating...|$|R

40|$|<b>Calendering</b> is a <b>process</b> {{used for}} the {{production}} of rolled sheets or films of specific thickness and final appearance, and involves the feed of a pair of co-rotating heated rolls (usually with radius to minimum gap ratio, R/H 0 ? 100) with a material to form a sheet. The process is widely used in a variety of industries, such as plastics, rubber, food, aluminium, paper, etc. Many materials used in calendering are frequently non-Newtonian, exhibiting either pseudoplastic (viscosity dependant on shear rate) or viscoplastic (presence of a yield stress) rheological behaviour. The present Doctoral Thesis falls into the fields of computational rheology and rheometry, and in processing of materials, and aims at the full analysis and understanding of the process for the above rheologically complex materials. Experimental measurements were carried out for two pseudoplastic -viscoplastic materials which are widely used in the food industry, namely “mozzarella” cheese and bread dough. Rheological characterization experiments were conducted for both materials, followed by rolling experiments (R/H 0 < 10). Regarding the rolling experiments, the response of final thickness and torque was studied with regard to changes in roll speed and initial thickness of the samples. Finally, a stable experimental window was determined for the rolling of both materials, based on device limitations and surface defects. With regard to the theoretical-computational part, the analysis of the process was first carried out using the Lubrication Approximation Theory (LAT) and the Herschel-Bulkley model of viscoplasticity. The mathematical modeling and the computer programs that were created, resulted in the solution of the problem for various non-Newtonian materials, which exhibit, or not, slip at the wall, {{as well as for the}} two cases of desired initial or final sheet thickness. A full parametric study was performed, and results include the calculation of the sheet thickness and key engineering values (pressure, force, torque), as well as yielded areas for viscoplastic materials exhibiting yield stress. A comparison of LAT simulation results with experimental results is also presented for pseudoplastic materials (using results available in the literature) and for viscoplastic materials (using the experiments of the present Thesis). For pseudoplastic fluids, it was proved that LAT with slip correctly predicts the shape of pressure distribution and the values of the rest of the quantities of interest, such as final sheet thickness and torque. For viscoplastic materials, there is qualitative agreement, as LAT is based on shear flow. A full two-dimensional analysis was next conducted based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), for the solution of the conservation equations and the rheological constitutive equations. Non-isothermal solution with slip at the wall confirmed previous results for PVC. For viscoplastic materials the 2 -D analysis proved the inability of LAT to correctly predict yielded-unyielded areas, which were then correctly predicted. As opposed to LAT, the comparison with the experimental results showed that there is good quantitative agreement for the torque for both materials, and brought out the need to integrate all stresses (shear and normal) for the calculation of torque, since the flow is fully two-dimensional. For the final sheet thickness, only qualitative agreement was found, with the simulations under-predicting the experimental values. This brought out viscoelastic recoil after detachment, where the material acquires a free surface. Viscoelasticity was not however included in the present Thesis. The present Doctoral Thesis led to a better understanding of the <b>process</b> of <b>calendering</b> and rolling for non-Newtonian materials, such as polymers and some foods that exhibit pseudoplastic and viscoplastic behavior. A number of problems have been solved and others were presented, that are conducive for further research. The better understanding of the process for non-Newtonian materials can help in the efficient design of the process, which can prove beneficial for both research and industrial production. ...|$|R

The effect of fabrication process on the properties of YSZ electrolyte thick film is discussed in the paper. With YSZ nano-powders of about 20 - 60 nm as raw material, YSZ green adobe was fabricated by tape <b>calendering</b> <b>process.</b> Three-step sintering process was performed firstly holding at 1000 °C for 2 h, then raising to 1300 ~ 1400 °C, then decreasing to 1200 ~ 1300 °C within 30 minutes, and finally calcining at 1200 ~ 1300 °C for 5 ~ 20 hrs. Dense YSZs with relative density of 96 - 99 % are obtained; the grain size of YSZ was reduced to 0. 5 - 3 µm. During the process of grain growth, there are both grain boundary diffusion and grain boundary migration. The feasibility of densification without grain growth relies on the suppression of grain boundary migration while keeping grain boundary diffusion active at a temperature as low as 1200 ~ 1300 °C. Whereas the electric conductivities of the YSZs are even higher than that obtained in conventional single step sintering process. The process {{is applied to the}} anode-supported SOFCs co-fired at 1250 ~ 1300 °C, and the cathode-supported SOFCs co-fired at 1200 ~ 1250 °C...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of a fully {{three-dimensional}} computational study of the <b>calendering</b> <b>process</b> of thermoplastics using the fluid dynamics software OpenFOAM. Our aim is to elucidate unique 3 D features of the process, such as spreading and melt flow. We assume that the material is fed {{in the form of}} a sheet of finite thickness and detaches from the cylinders at a prescribed thickness. The rotational motion of the cylinders, the consequent pressure build-up (both in the machine and the transverse directions) and the presence of the free surfaces (sides) of the calendered sheet-both deformable and at ambient pressure-forces the thermoplastic melt to spread in the transverse direction. A decoupled iterative procedure is used to predict the shape of the spreading side surfaces under different conditions. A spiraling transverse flow pattern in the melt feeding section is shown to exist, which determines the actual flow path of the calendered material in a nonintuitive way. We show that insofar as the material redistribution (from the fed sheet to the produced film) during the process is concerned, the results of the present analysis predict a 3 D spiral flow pattern and a redistribution of the fed material from the central region of the fed sheet to the sides of the calendered product.

40|$|Controlling the {{wettability}} {{between the}} porous electrode and the electrolyte in lithium ion batteries can improve both {{the manufacturing process}} and the electrochemical performance of the cell. The wetting rate, which is the electrolyte transport rate in the porous electrode, can be quantified using the wetting balance. The effect of the <b>calendering</b> <b>process</b> on the wettability of anode electrodes was investigated. A graphite anode film with an as-coated thickness of 59 μm was used as baseline electrode film and was calendered to produce films with thickness ranging from 55 to 41 µm. Results show that wettability is improved by light calendering from an initial thickness of 59 μm to a calendered thickness of 53 μm where the wetting rate increased from 0. 375 to 0. 589 mm/s 0. 5. Further calendering below 53 µm resulted in a decrease in wetting rates to a minimum observed value of 0. 206 mm/s 0. 5 at a calendered thickness of 41 μm. Under the same electrolyte, wettability of the electrode is controlled {{to a great extent}} by the pore structure in the electrode film which includes parameters such as porosity, pore size distribution, pore geometry and topology. Relations between the wetting behavior and the pore structure as characterized by mercury intrusion and electron microscopy exist and can be used to manipulate the wetting behavior of electrodes...|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of the {{calendering}} of paper which incorporates relationships for both roll local thermal deformation and the stress-strain behaviour of paper in and after the nip was developed, validated, then used to demonstrate its application to model predictive control of calendering. The experimental determination of the stress-strain behaviour of paper included documenting the effect of initial temperature and moisture content as well as process parameters, and was expressed as the in-nip calendering equation. The rheological behaviour of commercial newsprint made from thermomechanical pulp {{was found to be}} a strong nonlinear function of temperature and moisture content over the wide range of 20 to 80 °C and 1 to 14 % moisture. A simplified model for the transient local deformation of a calender roll in response to a local cross-machine (CD) control action was determined and validated against the previous complete numerical analysis solution for a variety of roll designs and thermal boundary conditions. This model, appropriate for use in real-time control, was shown to be effective in seeking a compromise between the conflicting CD control objectives of large roll deformation, fine CD resolution and fast control response time. From the above two elements a dynamic {{model of the}} <b>calendering</b> <b>process</b> was developed by appropriate combination of the model of transient local calender roll deformation with the in-nip calendering equation used to estimate, at a specific CD position, in-nip strain from permanent strain. Use of the model shows that paper response to a control action is highly sensitive to local nip load and to temperature and moisture content of the paper. After validation with published measurements on an industrial calender, the effectiveness of this model for minimizing thickness nonuniformity in the CD dimension through implementation of model predictive control of calendering was demonstrated. For a multi-roll calender stack of industrial specifications this demonstration showed an impressive reduction in CD control response time through use of multi-step control action. This model opens the prospect of a significant industrial innovation through the introduction of model predictive control to the difficult problem of CD control of calendering...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work performed by Hybrid Power Generation Systems, LLC (HPGS) under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 2601 NT 40779 for the US Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (DoE/NETL) entitled ''Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Hybrid System for Distributed Power Generation''. The main {{objective of this}} project is to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a highly efficient hybrid system integrating a planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and a gas turbine. A conceptual hybrid system design was selected for analysis and evaluation. The selected system is estimated to have over 65 % system efficiency, a first cost of approximately $ 650 /kW, and a cost of electricity of 8. 4 cents/kW-hr. A control strategy and conceptual control design {{have been developed for}} the system. A number of SOFC module tests have been completed to evaluate the pressure impact to performance stability. The results show that the operating pressure accelerates the performance degradation. Several experiments were conducted to explore the effects of pressure on carbon formation. Experimental observations on a functioning cell have verified that carbon deposition does not occur in the cell at steam-to-carbon ratios lower than the steady-state design point for hybrid systems. Heat exchanger design, fabrication and performance testing as well as oxidation testing to support heat exchanger life analysis were also conducted. Performance tests of the prototype heat exchanger yielded heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics consistent with the heat exchanger specification. Multicell stacks have been tested and performance maps were obtained under hybrid operating conditions. Successful and repeatable fabrication of large (> 12 -inch diameter) planar SOFC cells was demonstrated using the tape <b>calendering</b> <b>process.</b> A number of large area cells and stacks were successfully performance tested at ambient and pressurized conditions. A 25 MW plant configuration was selected with projected system efficiency of over 65 % and a factory cost of under $ 400 /kW. The plant design is modular and can be scaled to both higher and lower plant power ratings. Integrated gasification fuel cell systems or IGFCs were developed and analyzed for plant sizes in excess of 200 MW. Two alternative integration configurations were selected with projected system efficiency of over 53 % on a HHV basis, or about 10 percentage points higher than that of the state-of-the-art Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{geometric}} and electrochemical {{characteristics of}} different lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are investigated in this study. The core {{work is to}} study {{the impact of the}} <b>calendering</b> <b>process</b> on NMC cathode electrodes performance. X-ray CT image processing by Python, MATLAB, ImageJ and Avizo is utilized in this study. NMC electrodes with different calendering conditions were fabricated to calculate electrochemical properties of the cells. Charge/discharge of the electrodes under 0. 1 C, 0. 2 C, 0. 4 C, 1 C, 2 C, 4 C and 0. 1 C (retention test) rates were cycled for three times respectively between 4. 2 V and 3. 0 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy testing was used to further explain the effects of NMC density on rate capability. Geometric properties of NMC electrodes with different calendering conditions were calculated from the computed tomography data of the electrodes. A synchrotron transmission X-ray microscopy tomography system at the Advanced Photon Source of the Argonne National Laboratory was employed to obtain the tomography data. X-ray CT image processing before the data analysis was introduced. Python based Tomopy and ASTRA toolbox were used to filter the original HDF 5 data and reconstruction. ImageJ was used to help remove noise, adjust contrast and cropping. Iso 2 mesh and image processing tool box were used in MATLAB to generate meshed 3 D structure of CT data. Geometric properties of NMC electrodes including porosity, pore size distribution, particle size distribution, specific surface area and tortuosity were calculated from the computed tomography data of the electrodes. The geometric and electrochemical analysis show that calendering can increase the electrochemically active area, which lead to improving of the rate capability. However, more calendering will result in crushing of NMC particles, which can reduce the electrode capacity at relatively high C rates. This study shows that the optimum electrochemical performance of NMC electrode at 94 : 3 : 3 weight ratio of NMC:binder:carbon black can be achieved by calendering to 3. 0 g/cm 3 NMC density. LTAP solid electrolyte and NMC cathode material mix electrode-electrolyte X-ray CT data was studied in last chapter. By using 8 kev X-ray energy, we could distinguish NMC active material, LTAP solid electrolyte and the others three phase. On the basis of NMC electrode image processing method, dilation and multiply threshold method is applied to get three-phase 3 D geometry. A comparing of connection area between NMC and LTAP of 700 psi and 1300 psi electrode was analyzed. Geometric properties like tortuosity, di_usion length and e_ective di_usivity were generated from the CT data...|$|E
