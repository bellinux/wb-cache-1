5000|$|The {{village of}} Bovenden is first {{mentioned}} in a deed by Otto I from February 2, 949, {{in which the}} future emperor certifies a barter with Hersfeld Abbey. In this first designation the toponym was Bobbenzunon. In the following years the village was {{also referred to as}} Bobbantun (1141), [...] Bobentun (1170), and Bobentum (1191). Since the 13th century the name Boventen was commonly used and {{since the end of the}} 16th century today's designation Bovenden was introduced. The origin of the town name is contended. One derivation is the combination of the personal name Bovo or Bob(b)o with the suffix -tun. The suffix -tun is Low German and means [...] "fence, confinement, or fenced area". Consequently, the name might refer to a settlement founded or governed by Bobo. Another interpretation is that the stem of the name is derived from bioðan (=„above“, cf. Low German boven), referring to the <b>contrained</b> settlement above the flood plain of the Leine.|$|E

Abstract [...] Recent advances {{in computer technology}} have spurred new interest {{in the use of}} feedback controllers based upon the use of on-line optimization.

In this paper we propose a feedback controller based upon the use of on-line <b>contrained</b> optimization in the feedback loop. The optimization problem is simplified by making use of the special structure of time-optimal systems, resulting in a substantial dimensionality reduction.
