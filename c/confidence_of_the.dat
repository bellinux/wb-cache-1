Even though he escaped the disastrous Battle of Edgecote, he was executed by a mob at Bridgwater on 17 August 1469. Considered an overambitious man by many, Stafford was nevertheless a capable administrator, who enjoyed the absolute <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king.|$|E

5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E

5|$|By {{launching}} such a spoiling {{attack against}} PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), {{which was already}} high {{in the wake of}} the successful Cambodian Campaign of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.|$|E
5|$|Each {{parliament}} {{lasts for}} {{a maximum of}} five years from the date of its first sitting, and once a parliament has been dissolved a general election must be held within three months. Following a general election, the President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, is likely to command the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority of the MPs. In practice, the Prime Minister is usually {{the leader of the}} political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament. The President also appoints other Ministers from among the MPs, acting in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice.|$|E
5|$|En route, Riker and Troi observe as Enterprise is {{contacted}} by Shran, a former Andorian Imperial Guard who Archer believed was dead. Apparently his young daughter has been kidnapped, and {{he asks for}} Archer's help in rescuing her from Rigel X. Archer decides to assist, despite Commander T'Pol's warning {{that they may be}} late returning for the ceremony. Riker joins the Enterprise crew as it assaults Shran's enemies and brings his daughter safely back. Troi also advises that Riker assume the role of ship's chef, hoping to earn the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simulated crew. As he prepares food with the crew, he learns more about their memories and impressions of Tucker.|$|E

Marshal Pietro Badoglio, placed {{in charge of the}} government, soon surrendered to the Allies. Throughout 1943 and 1944, the Soviet Union steadily forced Hitler's armies into retreat along the Eastern Front. On 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France in one of the largest amphibious operations in history, Operation Overlord. Many German officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under Hitler's leadership would result in the complete destruction of the country.|$|E
5|$|Harper's Cabinet was {{defeated}} in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, after being found in contempt of parliament. Harper thus, in accordance with constitutional convention, advised the Governor General to call a general election. This was the first occurrence in Commonwealth history of a government in the Westminster parliamentary tradition losing the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower house {{on the grounds of}} contempt of parliament. The no-confidence motion was carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion and 145 against.|$|E
5|$|Many {{analysts and}} the media {{suggested}} that Malaysia Airlines would need to rebrand and repair its image and/or require government assistance to return to profitability. The loss of Flight 17 in July greatly exacerbated Malaysia Airline's financial problems. The combined effect on consumer <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss of Flight 370 and Flight 17; and the airline's poor financial performance; led Khazanah Nasional—the majority shareholder (69.37 percent) and a Malaysian state-run investment arm—to announce on 8 August its plan to purchase {{the remainder of the}} airline, thereby renationalising it.|$|E

5|$|The 2003–04 {{season was}} {{difficult}} for the club, and Gordon Strachan resigned in March. Higginbotham felt that his replacement, Paul Sturrock, was unable to handle the pressure at St Mary's, but denied press rumours that Sturrock had lost the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players. Steve Wigley took charge for 2004–05 and the club's decline continued. Wigley demoted Higginbotham to the reserves after following a falling out between the pair, though he soon reversed the decision and returned him to the first team. Harry Redknapp replaced Wigley as manager in December2004 but failed to arrest the decline, and Southampton were relegated in last place. Higginbotham had scored the equalising goal in the penultimate match of the season at Crystal Palace, but a final day defeat to Manchester United left Southampton two points from safety.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Minister of Karnataka is {{the chief}} {{executive}} of the south Indian state of Karnataka. As per the Constitution of India, the governor is a state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, the state's governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given that he has the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits.|$|E

5|$|The Prime Minister of Canada is an {{official}} {{who serves as}} the primary minister of the Crown, chair of the Cabinet, and thus head of government of Canada. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elected House of Commons. Normally, this {{is the leader of}} the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But, if that leader lacks support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By constitutional convention, a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|The {{province}} has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, {{in which}} the Premier {{is the leader of}} the party that controls the most seats in the House of Assembly. The Premier is Newfoundland and Labrador's head of government, and the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador, and presides over that body. Members are first elected to the House during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also take place if the governing party loses the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.|$|E
5|$|To {{become law}} or bill, a {{constitutional}} amendment {{had to have the}} assent of both the Diet and the Emperor. This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree he still had a veto over the Diet. The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and so, under the Meiji constitution, Prime Ministers often were not chosen from and did not enjoy the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Diet. The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget. While the Diet could veto the annual budget, if no budget was approved the budget of the previous year continued in force. This all changed with the new constitution after World War II.|$|E
