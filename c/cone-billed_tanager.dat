5000|$|<b>Cone-billed</b> <b>tanager</b> (Conothraupis mesoleuca), undetected from 1938 to 2003, but rediscovered in {{gallery forest}} in Emas National Park.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cone-billed</b> <b>tanager</b> (Conothraupis mesoleuca) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thraupidae.It is endemic to Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The {{black-and-white}} tanager (Conothraupis speculigera) is a tanager {{found in}} the Tumbes region of southwestern Ecuador and northwestern Peru; it migrates eastwards as far as Acre. The only other member of its genus is the recently rediscovered <b>cone-billed</b> <b>tanager.</b>|$|E
50|$|It has a {{total length}} of 16 cm. (6Â½ in) and weighs 23-28 g. (0,8-1 oz). The male is black with a grey rump, white underparts {{and a white}} wing-speculum. It is longer-billed than the superficially similar {{black-and-white}} seedeater and lacks the black flanks and chalk-white bill of the related <b>cone-billed</b> <b>tanager.</b> The female is olive with faintly mottled, yellow-tinged underparts. Both sexes have a reddish iris and a greyish bill.|$|E
40|$|The `Critically Endangered` <b>Cone-billed</b> <b>Tanager</b> Conothraupis mesoleuca was {{described}} in 71 93 9, based on a single specimen collected {{in the state of}} Mato Grosso, western Brazil. Not seen again in the wild until 2003, this poorly-known species was rediscovered in Emas National Park, in the Brazilian state of Goias. We describe here the discovery of a new population of <b>Cone-billed</b> <b>Tanager</b> in Chapada dos Parecis, along the upper Juruena River basin, in the state of Mato Grosso. The birds were always detected in (or near) flooded habitats along rivers. At least 40 individuals were found, but the population may be larger since areas of potential habitat are available in the upper Juruena basin and these have not yet been surveyed. We also provide here the first information on the biology and behaviour of the species based on observations in Juruena and Emas, as well as a first description of the female. Historical documents and our records support our suggestion that ""Juruena"", i. e. the type locality of the <b>Cone-billed</b> <b>Tanager,</b> refers to the Juruena telegraph station (12 degrees 50 `S, 58 degrees 55 `W). Considering that the range of the species is being settled, research on different aspects of its biology are urgent.
