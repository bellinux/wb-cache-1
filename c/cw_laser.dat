[...] It can produce over a megawatt of output {{for up to}} 70 seconds, making it the most powerful continuous wave (<b>CW)</b> <b>laser</b> in the US. Its original goal was {{to be able to}} track and destroy anti-ship cruise missiles, but in later years it was used to test phenomenologies associated with national anti-ballistic and anti-satellite laser weapons. Originally tested at a contractor facility in California, as of the later 1990s and early 2000s, it was located at a facility (...) in the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.|$|E

To estimate the small signal response and pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) modulation of our <b>CW</b> <b>lasers,</b> we employed a new signal detection technique that employs a superconducting single photon detector and a time-correlated single photon counting module.

40|$|A {{model for}} a continuous-wave (<b>CW)</b> iodine <b>laser</b> has been {{developed}} and compared with the experimental results obtained from a solar-simulator-pumped <b>CW</b> iodine <b>laser.</b> The agreement between the calculated laser power output and the experimental results is generally good for various laser parameters even when the model includes only prominent rate coefficients. The flow velocity dependence of the output power shows that the <b>CW</b> iodine <b>laser</b> cannot be achieved with a flow velocity below 1 m/s for the present solar-simulator-pumped <b>CW</b> iodine <b>laser</b> system...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the optical power spectrum and coherence properties of Fabry-Perot semiconductor lasers under gain-switched operation. We demonstrate that the distribution of longitudinal modes under gain-switched operation is described to high accuracy by a Gaussian envelope, in contrast to continuous wave (<b>CW)</b> <b>lasers</b> where the distribution is Lorentzian. We show that the minimum values of coherence under gain-switched operation are two orders of magnitude lower than under CW operation. We also demonstrate that intensity noise generated through interferometric conversion of mode partition noise is markedly different for gain-switched and <b>CW</b> <b>lasers.</b> The results are important {{for a host of}} potential applications that use low-coherence interferometry...|$|R
50|$|The LADA {{technique}} targets {{a variable}} power continuous wave (<b>CW)</b> <b>laser</b> at specific device transistors. The laser is typically {{of a short}} wavelength variety {{on the order of}} 1064 nm. This allows the laser to generate photo carriers in the silicon without resulting in localized heating of the device. The LADA technique is somewhat similar in execution to the Soft Defect Localization (SDL) technique, except that SDL uses a longer wavelength laser (1340 nm) in order to induce localized heating rather than generate photo carriers. Both techniques require the device to be scanned with a laser while it is under active stimulation by the tester.|$|E
50|$|For surface {{absorbers}} {{the thickness}} of the absorption layer is very thin (0.1 - 100 µm) and so is the total absorption length. It is used for power measurements of lasers with long pulse length (generally for <b>CW</b> <b>laser).</b> If a laser with pulse length in the range of 10−7 - 10−4 sec is used the sensor can be damaged by either dielectric break-down or thermal effects. In case of thermal damage, heat is deposited in a short time and cannot be dissipated until the next pulse arrives. This leads to an accumulation of energy in a thin layer leading to partial vaporization. For dielectric breakdown, the peak energy density during a pulse is high enough to locally ionize the sensor surface.|$|E
50|$|Understanding of the {{principle}} of operation of Vernier spectroscopy requires an understanding of frequency comb lasers. The oscillating electric field of a laser (or any time dependent signal) can be represented by a sum of sinusoidal signals in the frequency domain using the Fourier series. The oscillating electric field of a coherent, continuous-wave (<b>cw)</b> <b>laser</b> is represented as a single narrow peak in the frequency domain representation. If the laser is amplitude-modulated to produce a stable train of very short pulses (usually through mode-locking), the equivalent frequency domain representation is a series of narrow frequency peaks centered around the laser's original cw frequency. These frequency peaks are separated by the frequency of the time domain pulses. This is called the repetition rate of the frequency comb.|$|E
40|$|Strategies {{utilizing}} {{continuous wave}} (<b>CW)</b> <b>lasers</b> are considered which {{are capable of}} simultaneously measuring the flow parameters of velocity, temperature, and pressure at sampling rates exceeding 3 kHz. Velocity is determined from the Doppler shift of the spectral profile, temperature is extracted from intensity ratios of multiple lines, and pressure is measured from either the collision of broadening or the magnitude of absorption. Distinctions between strategies concern the specifics of probe spacies (NO, OH, O 2, and H 2 O) in terms of nominal probe wavelength, equipment, and detection scheme. <b>CW</b> <b>lasers</b> were applied to path-integrated absorption measurements of transient shock-tube flows and spatially resolved laser-induced fluorescence measurements of underexpanded jets...|$|R

5000|$|The {{conventional}} photo-reflectance experimental setup uses a xenon or tungsten based lamp source {{passed through}} a monochromator to form the incident probe beam. The pump beam may be formed by the output of a continuous wave (<b>CW)</b> <b>laser</b> (e.g. a He-Ne or He-Cd laser) passed though a chopper wheel, or may be formed by the output of a directly modulated semiconductor diode laser. The pump beam is focused to {{a spot on the}} sample where it interacts with the sample. The probe beam is co-focused onto the sample where it is reflected. The reflected probe beam is collected and {{passed through a}}n optical filter to eliminate any unwanted pump light and/or photoluminescence signal. Thereafter the probe beam is directed onto a photodetector (e.g. a Si or InGaAs photodiode), which converts the probe intensity to an electrical signal. The electrical signal is processed to eliminate unwanted noise, typically using a lock-in circuit referenced to the modulation frequency. The photo-reflectance signal is then recorded as a function of probe beam wavelength using a computer or the like.12 ...|$|E
5000|$|The optical {{resonator}} {{is sometimes}} referred to as an [...] "optical cavity", but this is a misnomer: lasers use open resonators as opposed to the literal cavity that would be employed at microwave frequencies in a maser.The resonator typically consists of two mirrors between which a coherent beam of light travels in both directions, reflecting back on itself so that an average photon will pass through the gain medium repeatedly before it is emitted from the output aperture or lost to diffraction or absorption.If the gain (amplification) in the medium is larger than the resonator losses, then the power of the recirculating light can rise exponentially. But each stimulated emission event returns an atom from its excited state to the ground state, reducing the gain of the medium. With increasing beam power the net gain (gain minus loss) reduces to unity and the gain medium is said to be saturated. In a continuous wave (<b>CW)</b> <b>laser,</b> the balance of pump power against gain saturation and cavity losses produces an equilibrium value of the laser power inside the cavity; this equilibrium determines the operating point of the laser. If the applied pump power is too small, the gain will never be sufficient to overcome the resonator losses, and laser light will not be produced. The minimum pump power needed to begin laser action is called the lasing threshold. The gain medium will amplify any photons passing through it, regardless of direction; but only the photons in a spatial mode supported by the resonator will pass more than once through the medium and receive substantial amplification.|$|E
5000|$|CARS {{is often}} {{compared}} to Raman spectroscopy as both techniques probe the same Raman active modes. Raman {{can be done}} using a single continuous wave (<b>CW)</b> <b>laser</b> whereas CARS requires (generally) two pulsed laser sources. The Raman signal is detected on the red side of the incoming radiation where it might {{have to compete with}} other fluorescent processes. The CARS signal is detected on the blue side, which is free from fluorescence, but it comes with a non-resonant contribution. The differences between the signals from Raman and CARS (there are many variants of both techniques) stems largely from the fact that Raman relies on a spontaneous transition whereas CARS relies on a coherently driven transition. The total Raman signal collected from a sample is the incoherent addition of the signal from individual molecules. It is therefore linear in the concentration of those molecules and the signal is emitted in all directions. The total CARS signal comes from a coherent addition of the signal from individual molecules. For the coherent addition to be additive, phase-matching must be fulfilled. For tight focusing conditions this is generally not a restriction. Once phase-matching is fulfilled the signal amplitude grows linearly with distance so that the power grows quadratically. This signal forms a collimated beam that is therefore easily collected. The fact that the CARS signal is quadratic in the distance makes it quadratic with respect to the concentration and therefore especially sensitive to the majority constituent. The total CARS signal also contains an inherent non-resonant background. This non-resonant signal can be considered as the result of (several) far off-resonance transitions that also add coherently. The resonant amplitude contains a phase shift of π radians over the resonance whereas the non-resonant part does not. The spectroscopic line shape of the CARS intensity therefore resembles a Fano profile which is shifted with respect to the Raman signal. To compare the spectra from multi-component compounds, the (resonant) CARS spectral amplitude should be compared to the Raman spectral intensity.|$|E

40|$|We phase-coherently {{measure the}} {{frequency}} of continuous-wave (<b>CW)</b> <b>laser</b> light by use of optical-phase modulation and f- 2 f nonlinear interferometry. Periodic electro-optic modulation (EOM) transforms the <b>CW</b> <b>laser</b> into a continuous train of picosecond optical pulses. Subsequent nonlinear-fiber broadening of this EOM frequency comb produces a supercontinuum with 160 THz of bandwidth. A critical intermediate step is optical filtering of the EOM comb to reduce electronic-noise-induced decoherence of the supercontinuum. Applying f- 2 f self-referencing with the supercontinuum yields the carrier-envelope offset frequency of the EOM comb, which is precisely the difference of the <b>CW</b> <b>laser</b> frequency and an exact integer multiple of the EOM pulse repetition rate.
