40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) are {{solvents}} {{of interest}} for applications such as electroplating, winning, and refining of metals. In this study, the conductivity of the AlCl 3 –trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride ([P 14, 6, 6, 6]Cl) system was characterized {{over a wide range}} of AlCl 3 concentration and temperature. Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine the electrochemical window of the neat IL using a Pt substrate. The anodic and <b>cathodic</b> potentiodynamic <b>polarization</b> behavior of Al was measured in AlCl 3 –[P 14, 6, 6, 6]Cl at an AlCl 3 concentration of 0. 67 mol fraction (XAlCl 3). Aluminum was electrodeposited at a constant potential over a range of potentials (0. 3 – 0. 75 V); the deposit morphology, current efficiency, and power consumption are provided. The presence and effects of impurities such as H 2 O and HCl in the ionic liquid are also addressed...|$|R
40|$|Electrogenerated {{chemiluminescence}} (ECL) of lucigenin is induced at oxide-coated aluminum electrode in {{aqueous solution}} by <b>cathodic</b> pulse <b>polarization.</b> This ECL can be enhanced {{by the presence of}} coreactants such as peroxodisulfalte. The present method is based on the injection of hot electrons into the aqueous electrolyte solution, which probably results in the generation of hydrated electrons as reducing mediators. The successive one-electron redox reactions result in the excited states of lucigenin or its fragmentation products. The method can detect lucigenin over several orders of magnitude of concentration with detection limit below nanomolar concentration level. In addition, the relatively long lifetime of the ECL of lucigenin makes time-resolved detection possible. This study suggests that the derivatives of lucigenin can be utilized as electrochemiluminescent labels {{in aqueous solution}} in bioaffinity assays at thin insulating film-coated cathodes. The cathodic ECL reaction mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemistry}} of crystalline and porous silicon and the luminescence from porous silicon {{has been}} studied. One chapter {{deals with a}} model for the anodic dissolution of silicon in HF solution. In following chapters both the electrochemistry and various ways of generating visible luminescence from porous silicon is investigated. Both under <b>cathodic</b> and anodic <b>polarization</b> emission can be observed in the presence of oxidizing and reducing agents, respectively. Also in indifferent electrolyte solutions visible light is found due to oxidation of the porous semiconductor...|$|R
