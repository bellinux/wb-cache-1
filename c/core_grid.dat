40|$|BACKGROUND: Tissue MicroArrays (TMAs) {{represent}} a potential high-throughput {{platform for the}} analysis and discovery of tissue biomarkers. As TMA slides are produced manually and subject to processing and sectioning artefacts, the layout of TMA cores on the final slide and subsequent digital scan (TMA digital slide) is often disturbed {{making it difficult to}} associate cores with their original position in the planned TMA map. Additionally, the individual cores can be greatly altered and contain numerous irregularities such as missing <b>cores,</b> <b>grid</b> rotation and stretching. These factors demand the development of a robust method for de-arraying TMAs which identifies each TMA core, and assigns them to their appropriate coordinates on the constructed TMA slide. METHODOLOGY: This study presents a robust TMA de-arraying method consisting of three functional phases: TMA <b>core</b> segmentation, <b>gridding</b> and mapping. The segmentation of TMA cores uses a set of morphological operations to identify each TMA <b>core.</b> <b>Gridding</b> then utilises a Delaunay Triangulation based method to find the row and column indices of each TMA core. Finally, mapping correlates each TMA core from a high resolution TMA whole slide image with its name within a TMAMap. CONCLUSION: This study describes a genuine robust TMA de-arraying algorithm for the rapid identification of TMA cores from digital slides. The result of this de-arraying algorithm allows the easy partition of each TMA core for further processing. Based on a test group of 19 TMA slides (3129 cores), 99. 84 % of cores were segmented successfully, 99. 81 % of <b>cores</b> were <b>gridded</b> correctly and 99. 96 % of cores were mapped with their correct names via TMAMaps.
