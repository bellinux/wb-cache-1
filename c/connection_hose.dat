5000|$|... #Caption: German {{underground}} hydrant with Storz <b>hose</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1968 {{introduction}} of garden <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> system (Original GARDENA System) ...|$|R
50|$|The main {{benefit to}} using Storz {{couplings}} is speed of <b>hose</b> <b>connection,</b> as a <b>hose</b> can be locked with a quarter-turn. By comparison, locking hoses using threaded couplings often takes several turns. Because of this, Storz couplings are {{widely viewed as}} a safer alternative to using threaded couplings. A secondary benefit over threaded couplings is that the connecting faces and hooks are less prone to damage if the coupling is dropped onto, or dragged over, a hard surface.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, most {{hydrants}} {{are located}} below ground (Unterflurhydrant) and are reached by a Standrohr (riser), which provides the <b>connections</b> for the <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dixon FireManufacturer and {{distributor}} {{of fire and}} forestry products including fire department <b>connections,</b> fittings and <b>hoses,</b> valves for fire protection systems and accessories for sprinkler systems.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} brands, {{including}} Quickfit, have begun using threaded <b>connections</b> for <b>hose</b> barbs. This allows the barb to be unscrewed from the glassware, the hose pushed {{on and the}} setup screwed back together. This helps avoid accidentally breaking the glass and potentially doing serious harm to the chemist, as will sometimes occur when pushing the hoses directly onto the glass.|$|R
50|$|A bayonet garden <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> with an o-ring to {{o-ring seal}} {{designed}} and patented in 1998. It is popular in Australia, with limited {{distribution in the}} UK and the US.|$|R
50|$|Storz {{connectors}} {{are usually}} made of brass or aluminium. They can be manufactured by casting for general <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> and low pressure applications, but for firefighting, {{it is better}} to use forgings to guarantee the safety and durability of the coupling.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hose</b> <b>connections</b> {{are often}} made from brass, though {{hardened}} aluminum connections are also specified. In countries which use quick-action couplers for attack hoses, forged aluminum {{has been used}} for decades because the weight penalty of brass for Storz couplers is higher than for threaded connections.|$|R
50|$|The suit's {{primary air}} supply comes through a <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> to {{purified}} air; a {{self-contained breathing apparatus}} provides 8 to 10 minutes of escape air in case the primary supply is disrupted. A heart monitor around the wearer's chest checks for signs of distress.|$|R
50|$|The {{water supply}} can be via a suction port from public waters or from fire <b>hoses.</b> <b>Hose</b> <b>connections</b> for {{fire-fighting}} tasks are also present. The valves {{are designed to}} fight against nucleation in the absorbed water, and chlorine is also added to the water to keep it clean.|$|R
5000|$|A cam and groove {{coupling}}, {{also called}} a cam lock fitting or cam lever coupling, [...] {{is a kind}} of quick connect coupling usually used in industries as a <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> to avoid leakage. This kind of coupling is popular because it is a simple and reliable means of connecting and disconnecting.|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{cable or}} {{hydraulic}} <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> is made {{through one of}} the stationary shafts and is sealed with compression seals. Shaft and connection sealing is made using high quality materials such as; NBR, FPM or carbon. Lubrication is achieved with oil or grease. Oil also helps to cool the motor, or motors can be air cooled.|$|R
50|$|The 1140 mm {{fuel hose}} {{was made of}} {{reinforced}} rubber tubing, with brass fittings on both ends. The flame gun, three to four feet long, was a 25 mm diameter tube with a fuel ejection handle located near the <b>hose</b> <b>connection,</b> and a 6 mm (1/4-inch) nozzle with the firing mechanism attached to the other end.|$|R
5000|$|Features {{common to}} caravan parks include {{location}} near a main road, a prominent entrance, on-site caretakers/proprietors, recreation room, levelled concrete slabs, landscaped grounds, <b>hose</b> <b>connections,</b> electricity, large amenities block with washing machines and hot showers. Many parks offered on-site vans for rental. Park listings in 1961 record [...] "tradespeople" [...] calling to parks, to deliver essentials like bread and milk.|$|R
50|$|Coventry's darkest hour {{came during}} World War II when Adolf Hitler singled out Coventry for heavy bombing raids. Large {{areas of the}} city were {{destroyed}} in a massive German bombing raid during the night of 14/15 November 1940. Firemen from throughout the Midlands came to fight the fires but found that each brigade had different <b>connections</b> for their <b>hoses.</b> Consequently, much fire-fighting equipment could not be used.|$|R
50|$|Another {{benefit of}} an in-tank mounted fuel pump {{is that a}} suction pump at the engine could suck in air through a (difficult to diagnose) faulty <b>hose</b> <b>{{connection}},</b> while a leaking connection in a pressure line will show itself immediately. A potential hazard of a tank-mounted fuel pump {{is that all of}} the fuel lines are under (high) pressure, from the tank to the engine. Any leak will be easily detected, but is also hazardous.|$|R
50|$|The National Fire Protection Association {{adopted a}} {{national}} standard for fire hydrant and <b>hose</b> <b>connections.</b> However, inertia remained. Conversion {{was slow and}} still remains incomplete. One hundred years after the Baltimore Fire, only 18 of the 48 most populous American cities {{were reported to have}} national standard fire hydrants. Hose incompatibility contributed to the Oakland Firestorm of 1991: although the standard hose coupling has 2.5 in diameter, Oakland's hydrants had 3 in couplings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suction unit}} is roughly rectangular-block-shaped, about 2.5 metres wide and 3.6 metres high, {{and is usually}} mounted and used {{on the back of}} a truck, which must have power {{takeoffs}} to run the suction unit's air impeller and hydraulics. When it is emptying its load out, the spoil tank lid (with the <b>hose</b> <b>connection)</b> hinges off to the right, then the spoil tank (with the filters) tips about 90° over to the left to tip its load out.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} gates {{across the open}} ends of their cabs and pipes under the running board on the right side, which terminated in <b>hose</b> <b>connections</b> below the front buffer beam, so that water tenders could be coupled {{to the front and}} they could be run cab forward. The reason was that they were used on a single line which was still being constructed into the desert from Wadi Halfa and which initially had no water supply at the far end.|$|R
5000|$|A Storz {{coupling}} is a quarter-turn or sexless coupling, {{commonly used}} to connect to fire hydrants. It is easy to connect, has no particular male or female end, and lugs are {{on the inside of}} the joint. This is the standard coupling on fire hoses in Denmark, Germany, Austria, Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Greece. [...] It is also widely used in Australia. It can be manufactured by casting for general <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> and low pressure applications, but for firefighting, it is better to use forgings to guarantee the safety and durability of the coupling.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{regional}} nomenclature, the term [...] "dry riser" [...] may {{refer to a}} standpipe, intended to provide water to fire <b>hose</b> <b>connections,</b> or a vertical main pipe in an automatic dry pipe fire sprinkler system. A dry standpipe comprises a fire department connection, e.g. Storz, which is an external access point at ground level through which water can be pumped from the fire department's fire engine pump to firefighters' fire hose attachments on each floor, whereas a dry pipe fire sprinkler system is a network of pipes connected to fixed sprinklers inside a building, which are full of air until one of the sprinklers is triggered.|$|R
500|$|It uses suction gaskets. [...] Gaskets in {{standard}} fire hose ("pressure gaskets") {{are designed to}} minimize the water leaking out between couplings. [...] The gaskets connecting hard suction hose sections, pump, and strainer must instead prevent air from entering at the coupling, since that would spoil the vacuum and allow air into the pump intake. Large diameter ( [...] or greater) hard suction hose will typically use Storz fittings, which are genderless. [...] or smaller hard suction hose will typically use threaded fittings. [...] In each case, the hard suction <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> will match the fittings of the pump intake and supply hose, so that hard suction hose {{can be used in}} place of supply hose as appropriate.|$|R
5000|$|The tool used {{to flare}} tubing {{consists}} of a die that grips the tube and a mandrel that is forced into {{the end of the}} tube to form the flare by cold working. The most common flare fitting standards in use today are the 45-degree SAE style, and the 37-degree AN style, also used with the JIC system. The AN/JIC style generally has a higher pressure rating for a given size tubing. SAE and AN/JIC fittings are completely incompatible due to the different flare angle. Further, AN fittings (or those complying with subsequent standards) and JIC fittings are not interchangeable for design-controlled applications due to differing quality standards. The refrigeration and air conditioning industry usually uses 45° flare <b>connections</b> while hydraulic <b>hoses</b> are usually 37-1/2° flare connections.|$|R
50|$|A third {{test method}} to {{determine}} if ductwork is leaking to the outside {{is to use a}} pressure pan, which is a register cover with a pressure tap for a <b>hose</b> <b>connection.</b> With the house pressurized (or depressurized) to 50 Pa (-50 Pa) using a blower door, a pressure gauge is attached to the pressure pan by means of a hose. If the pressure difference is near zero, this indicates that the ductwork associated with that particular register is not connected to the outside. A pressure 5 Pa or above indicates that the duct work is connected to or leaking to the outside. A smaller pressure difference indicates greater leakage. This method does not quantify duct leakage, but serves to identify locations of ductwork runs that are leaking to the outside. It is more of a qualitative measure, used for fault isolation.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic hose is graded by pressure, temperature, {{and fluid}} compatibility. Hoses are used when pipes or tubes {{can not be}} used, usually to provide {{flexibility}} for machine operation or maintenance. The hose is built up with rubber and steel layers. A rubber interior is surrounded by multiple layers of woven wire and rubber. The exterior is designed for abrasion resistance. The bend radius of hydraulic hose is carefully designed into the machine, since hose failures can be deadly, and violating the hose's minimum bend radius will cause failure. Hydraulic hoses generally have steel fittings swaged on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure <b>hose</b> is the <b>connection</b> of the <b>hose</b> to the fitting. Another disadvantage of hoses is the shorter life of rubber which requires periodic replacement, usually at five to seven year intervals.|$|R
40|$|Aviation Power Supply's mobile {{firefighting}} module called Firefly II {{is mounted}} on a trailer pulled by a pickup truck. Trailer unit has two three- inch water cannons, and the pickup carries a six inch cannon. Completely self contained, module pumps 3, 000 gallons of water a minute from hydrants or open bodies of water. Stream can {{go as far as}} 400 feet or can be employed in a high-loft mode to reach the tops of tall refinery towers. Compact Firefly II weighs only 2, 500 pounds when fully fueled. Key component is a specially designed two stage pump. Power for the pump is generated by a gas turbine engine. Module also includes an electronic/pump controller, multiple <b>hose</b> <b>connections,</b> up to 1, 500 feet of hose and fuel for four hours operation. Firefly trailer can be backed onto specially-built large fireboat...|$|R
50|$|Connections {{may include}} tie-in of a {{pipeline}} to a platform riser, wellhead, manifold, or another pipeline by end or tee connection, insertion of valves, and <b>connection</b> to flexible <b>hoses</b> at single point moorings. The work may include measurement and {{survey of the}} components to be connected, welded and flanged connections, including inspection, alignment, surface preparation, fitting of gaskets and bolts, tensioning of bolts and testing. Disconnecting may also be necessary, which may involve splitting, cutting and burning work. When welding is necessary a hyperbaric welding chamber may be fitted around the pipeline so that welding {{can be done in}} an inert gaseous environment rather than wet, as this improves the weld quality. Depending on circumstances, the chamber may be large enough for the welder to work inside, but as the chamber must be accessed at depth and is under ambient pressure, the work must be done by a diver.|$|R
5000|$|Oscar Cobb of Chicago {{designed}} the three-story {{building and the}} Broadway Real Estate Company awarded the architecture-construction contract to H.L. Rowe of Lexington. The theatre originally seated 1,250 people and was constructed of two balconies with two boxes {{on each side of}} the stage. The theatre consisted of two parts: a 3,360 square-foot auditorium and a 2,220 square-foot stage area. Perhaps the greatest spectacle of the Opera House was its intricate design work. The 596 seats were upholstered with Turkish Morocco and velvet, and each box included its own hat rack, cane and umbrella holder. There were 250 gaslights, 37 sets of scenery and a drop curtain. The stage development was undoubtedly progressive and featured innovations such as the Edison light board and a series of trap doors to enable animals to be used during productions. To avoid another fire, the Opera House had standpipes with water pressure and <b>hose</b> <b>connections</b> that could flood the stage, if needed.|$|R
50|$|Alterations in {{thermoregulation}} {{in association}} with spaceflight could significantly affect a variety of spaceflight-associated activities including exercise as a countermeasure to muscle atrophy, cardiac deconditioning, and bone loss; extravehicular activity (EVA); and vehicle landing and egress. EVA suits and launch and entry or advanced crew escape suits (ACES) worn by ISS and Shuttle crewmembers are designed to provide an impermeable barrier between the wearer and the external environment. To compensate for lack of heat exchange through the fabrics of these suits, the EVA suit provides both liquid (conductive) and air (convective) cooling, while a liquid cooling garment is worn under the ACES {{in addition to a}} <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> to forced orbiter cabin air. Thus, crewmembers with altered thermoregulatory capabilities are at even greater risk should failure of the cooling systems of these garments occur. Manifestations of altered thermoregulation include increased heart rate and body temperature during exercise, decreased work capacity and endurance, decreased postflight orthostatic tolerance, decreased cognitive ability, and a delay in recovery of exercise capacity and endurance after flight.|$|R

5000|$|Three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) were {{mounted on}} the orbiter's aft {{fuselage}} {{in the pattern of}} an equilateral triangle. These three liquid-fueled engines could be swiveled 10.5 degrees vertically and 8.5 degrees horizontally during the rocket-powered ascent of the orbiter in order to change the direction of their thrust. Hence, they steered the entire Space Shuttle, as well as providing rocket thrust towards orbit. The aft fuselage also housed three auxiliary power units (APU). The APUs chemically converted hydrazine fuel from a liquid state to a gas state, powering a hydraulic pump which supplied pressure for all of the hydraulic system, including the hydraulic sub-system that pointed the three main liquid-fueled rocket engines, under computerized flight control. The hydraulic pressure generated was also used to control all of the orbiter's [...] "flight control surfaces" [...] (the elevons, rudder, speed brake, etc.), to deploy the landing gear of the orbiter, and to retract the umbilical <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> doors located near the rear landing gear, which supplied the orbiter's SSMEs with liquid hydrogen and oxygen from the external tank.|$|R
40|$|In the Portuguese city of Évora a {{parabolic}} salt loop {{is being}} constructed {{in order to}} demonstrate the viability of this system. Different partners have teamed-up for this task. Siemens takes the project lead in the German HPS consortium. The solar demonstration plant will be capable to produce high live steam parameters in an once-through steam generation system (SGS). The SGS is designed for 580 °C and 140 bar. The live steam parameters and {{the design of the}} SGS and the overall plant provide a highly flexible steam production. Since the solar field needs to provide heat at higher temperatures than typical solar field set-ups and uses molten salt as heat transfer fluid, different adoptions have had to be made. Several of these adoptions are described in the paper. Furthermore the layout of the flexible <b>connections</b> consisting of <b>hose</b> and rotary must be re-designed. Targets of the developments are: both thermal expansion of the absorber pipe and rotation of SCA must be compensated for reasonable number of lifetime cylcles and the complete system must be designed in order to prevent any freezing of the salt within the component...|$|R
5000|$|The {{increasing}} number of caravan users in turn stimulated development of caravan parks. Private developers {{were the first to}} offer caravan parks from the late 1930s with modern facilities and structured layout. However, in the early 1950s, relatively few sites in Queensland offered the necessary infrastructure to accommodate caravanning needs. Calls for improvements to sites and facilities accompanied increased caravan usage. Advocates looked to the United States and the United Kingdom for examples of best practice in caravan parks. Caravanning guides and journals offered suggestions for layout and features. The publication Modern Caravan Parks offered advice to local authorities and others interested in establishing caravan parks. Suggestions included a more formal arrangement of space than camping required, characterised by grid or circular layouts and landscaped grounds. Features of caravan parks became a location near a main road, a prominent entrance, recreation room, brick amenities block, levelled concrete slabs, landscaping, <b>hose</b> <b>connections,</b> hot showers and electricity. They also had on-site caretakers/proprietors. Many parks offered on-site vans for rental. [...] "Tradespeople" [...] called to deliver essentials like bread and milk. A common characteristic of public (and private) camping grounds and caravan parks has been the continual updating of their facilities.|$|R
5000|$|Water damage can {{originate}} {{by different}} {{sources such as}} a broken dishwasher hose, a washing machine overflow, a dishwasher leakage, broken/leaking pipes, and clogged toilets. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 13.7% of all water used in the home today {{can be attributed to}} plumbing leaks. [...] On average that is approximately 10,000 gallons of water per year wasted by leaks for each US home. A tiny, 1/8-inch crack in a pipe can release up to 250 gallons of water a day. According to Claims Magazine in August 2000, broken water pipes ranked second to hurricanes in terms of both the number of homes damaged and the amount of claims (on average $50,000 per insurance claim) costs in the US. Experts suggest that homeowners inspect and replace worn pipe fittings and <b>hose</b> <b>connections</b> to all household appliances that use water at least once a year. This includes washing machines, dishwashers, kitchen sinks and bathroom lavatories, refrigerator icemakers, water softeners and humidifiers. A few US companies offer whole-house leak protection systems utilizing flow-based technologies. A number of insurance companies offer policy holders reduced rates for installing a whole-house leak protection system.|$|R
40|$|The testing {{described}} above {{demonstrates that the}} experimental sprinkler designed by Argonne could be successfully, and safely, used by the Village of Utica for irrigation of the town's playing fields, using contaminated (by carbon tetrachloride) groundwater from the shallow aquifer beneath the town. Routine operation of the sprinkler {{within the range of}} parameters identified by the testing program would effectively reduce carbon tetrachloride concentrations in the discharged spray reaching the ground to levels below the MCL (5 {micro}g/l). CCC/USDA and Argonne propose to test use of the experimental sprinkler by the Village of Utica during the next (Summer 2001) growing season, under Argonne supervision. Water will be supplied from the well to the sprinkler drive unit using a temporary, flexible (high-pressure <b>hose)</b> <b>connection.</b> Argonne will provide training to Village staff in the setup and use of the sprinkler, and will conduct periodic monitoring (proposed biweekly, initially) of the watering operations and sampling and analysis of the spray discharge from the unit, to ensure that the specified groundwater cleanup performance of the sprinkler system (to carbon tetrachloride values < 5 {micro}g/L) is maintained. If testing of the sprinkler in this manner proves successful during 2001, CCC/USDA will seek to permanently transfer ownership and operation responsibilities for the sprinkler to the Utica Village Board...|$|R
