50|$|Centrex {{was invented}} in the mid 1960s by the Engineering Department of New York Telephone to replace the PBX switchboards of large customers. It was a feature package of the 5XB <b>crossbar</b> <b>system.</b> Much {{equipment}} had to be redesigned, including incoming trunks and markers. The redesigned equipment was so expensive that usually a separate 5XB switch was used just for Centrex customers, while POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) customers were wired to an unmodified exchange.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to this, ATE, and later Plessey, {{developed their own}} <b>crossbar</b> <b>system,</b> the 5005, and pushed for the GPO to adopt it as an interim measure. Normally the GPO preferred to develop systems in co-operation with the manufacturing companies, from whom they could then purchase competitively rather than allowing one manufacturer to sell it a proprietary system. The situation however was becoming critical, waiting lists for telephone service in the UK were growing embarrassingly long and the manufacturers were {{becoming more and more}} reluctant to supply Strowger in the quantities needed by the GPO. Eventually the GPO relented and decided to accept Crossbar equipment into its network.|$|E
50|$|This meant common control, as {{described}} above: all the digits were recorded, then {{passed to the}} common control equipment, the marker, to establish the call at all the separate switch stages simultaneously. A marker-controlled <b>crossbar</b> <b>system</b> had in the marker a highly vulnerable central control; this was invariably protected by having duplicate markers. The great advantage was that the control occupancy on the switches was {{of the order of}} one second or less, representing the operate and release lags of the X-then-Y armatures of the switches. The only downside of common control was the need to provide digit recorders enough to deal with the greatest forecast originating traffic level on the exchange.|$|E
50|$|These codes were {{allocated}} to two Ericsson <b>Crossbar</b> <b>systems</b> used as international gateways in London. TXK5 was LM Ericsson ARM200 and TXK6 {{was the same}} manufacturer's AKE13 system.|$|R
50|$|A junctor is {{a circuit}} used in analog {{telephone}} exchanges, including the Number One <b>Crossbar</b> Switching <b>System,</b> Number Five <b>Crossbar</b> Switching <b>System,</b> Panel switch, 1ESS switch and other switches.|$|R
50|$|However, later <b>crossbar</b> <b>systems</b> used {{computer}} {{control of their}} switching matrices and would be considered full SPC systems. Examples include the Ericsson ARE 11 (local) and ARE 13 (transit) and the ITT Metaconta 11, once found throughout Western Europe and in many countries around the world.|$|R
50|$|When World War II ended, the UK {{telephone}} exchange suppliers supported the GPOâ€™s {{decision to stay}} with Strowger until a viable electronic system became available. The GPO largely did this to protect their success in the export market, but it actually {{had the effect of}} ultimately destroying it. This allowed competitors to develop their own improved switching systems ahead of the GPO. In 1960 the situation rapidly changed when the Australian PO rejected a system from a consortium of British manufacturers who offered a register-controlled version of a motor-uniselector system in favour of a <b>crossbar</b> <b>system</b> from the Swedish firm of Ericsson. Suddenly the rules had changed and the race was on to develop an electronic {{telephone exchange}} that could operate with the current GPO Telephones used in the UK, including shared service.|$|E
50|$|An {{equipment}} practice was needed quickly, {{and it was}} realised that a matrix of reed relays would be {{about the same size}} as a crossbar switch. Therefore, the {{equipment practice}} of AT&E's <b>crossbar</b> <b>system</b> was adopted for the TXE1 apart from the STC common control, which had its own equipment practice. The STC common control consisted of 14 racks and made up a complete suite of the exchange. It was made entirely from discrete components as integrated circuits were not yet in common use. There was much discussion by all contractors as to whether at the time there was a reliable connector so as to provide the ability to withdraw and replace units. STC decided to have the units that could be withdrawn and AT&E and AEI did not. It turned out that the connectors used by STC were reliable and they had a great advantage in fault finding. It also allowed the STC engineers to place a suspect faulty unit in an outrigger so it could be tested in situ.|$|E
50|$|During the {{development}} of the TXE3 it became apparent that the system would be too expensive for the competitive export market, so AEI split its team into two: one to do whatever the BPO wanted and the other to produce a reduced version for export. The trial was started in April 1968 and the model worked very well at Armour House and the BPO ordered the first half dozen exchanges. Jim Warman moved his team back from Blackheath to Woolwich to start a new department with its own manufacturing and marketing. The equipment for the first exchange had been manufactured with a 9600 capacity and was being installed on site at Royal exchange in London in 1968 when GEC made a takeover bid for AEI who were in financial difficulties brought about by {{the development}} costs of TXE1 and TXE3. The takeover bid was successful and GEC decided, unbelievably, that they preferred the <b>crossbar</b> <b>system</b> to TXE3 and promptly cancelled the contract to supply TXE3 to the BPO. Royal first exchange was dismantled before its installation had been completed and all the TXE3 equipment was broken up and supplied to universities for observation.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{difference}} between fault tolerance and systems that rarely have problems. For instance, the Western Electric <b>crossbar</b> <b>systems</b> had failure rates of two hours per forty years, and therefore were highly fault resistant. But when a fault did occur they still stopped operating completely, and therefore were not fault tolerant.|$|R
50|$|Some later {{switching}} systems used digit registers which doubled the allowable pulse rate to 20 pulses per second, and the inter-digital pause {{could be reduced}} as the switch selection {{did not have to}} be completed during the pause. These included some <b>Crossbar</b> <b>systems,</b> the later version (7A2) of the Rotary system, and the earlier 1970s stored program control exchanges.|$|R
50|$|While some designs {{experimented with}} {{multiple}} shared buses, the eventual approach was {{to adapt the}} crossbar switch model from telephone switches, in which every forwarding engine had a hardware path to every other forwarding engine. With {{a small number of}} forwarding engines, crossbar forwarding fabrics are practical and efficient for high-performance routing. There are multistage designs for <b>crossbar</b> <b>systems,</b> such as Clos networks.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the failure}} to win major {{contracts}} in Australia in 1960 and the subsequent failure of Highgate Wood, {{it was necessary for}} the British manufacturers {{to come up with something}} different until a fully digital system could be developed (this eventually turned out to be System X and System Y). L M Ericsson of Sweden had 20 years of experience of manufacturing the <b>crossbar</b> <b>system</b> and reducing its cost, so there was no point in trying to compete with them (Plessey Telecommunications, a subsidiary company of The Plessey Company, took a different view and continued to urge the GPO to adopt crossbar). At this time, in the US, Bell Labs were developing a system based on electronically controlled reed relays, and this looked promising. One of Ericsson's marketing points for crossbar was that it used precious-metal contacts, but reed relays would be even better as their precious metal contacts were hermetically sealed. Also their very short operating and release times (<1 ms) made them ideal for electronic control, and these reed-electronic exchanges were considered the most practical switching system to proceed with at the time and electronic enough, until a truly electronic system could be developed, although Tommy Flowers did not approve as he advocated going straight to a digital system.|$|E
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this effort was to perform the {{detailed}} design, development, and construction of a prototype 8 x 8 all-optical fiber optic crossbar switch using low power liquid crystal shutters capable of operation in a network with suitable fiber optic transmitters and receivers at a data rate of 1 Gb/s. During the earlier Phase 1 feasibility study, {{it was determined that}} the all-optical <b>crossbar</b> <b>system</b> had significant advantages compared to electronic crossbars in terms of power consumption, weight, size, and reliability. The result is primarily {{due to the fact that}} no optical transmitters and receivers are required for electro-optic conversion within the crossbar switch itself...|$|E
40|$|Multiprocessor {{systems can}} provide higher performance, reliability, and {{availability}} than single processor systems. In order to properly assess {{the effectiveness of}} multiprocessor systems, measures that combine performance and reliability are needed. Most previous studies have considered the performance and reliability/availability separately. Only {{a limited number of}} studies have been carried out by considering the performance and reliability together {{in the presence of a}} uniform traffic in the network. Hot spots in a multiprocessor system result in a non uniform traffic in the network and results in a degradation in the performance of the network. The aim of this paper is to study the combined performance and reliability of a <b>crossbar</b> <b>system</b> in the presence of a hot spot in the system. Computation availability is taken as the criteria for measuring the combined performance and reliability. Markov chain models have been developed to compute the above measurement criteria. 1 Introducti [...] ...|$|E
25|$|Crossbar offices {{used more}} shared, common control circuits. For example, a digit {{receiver}} (part of an element called an Originating Register) would {{be connected to}} a call {{just long enough to}} collect the subscriber's dialed digits. Crossbar architecture was more flexible than step offices. Later <b>crossbar</b> <b>systems</b> had punch-card-based trouble reporting systems. By the 1970s, automatic number identification had been retrofitted to nearly all step-by-step and crossbar switches in the Bell System.|$|R

40|$|A central {{challenge}} for the scaling of quantum computing systems {{is the need to}} control all qubits in the system without a large overhead. A solution for this problem in classical computing {{comes in the form of}} so called crossbar architectures. Recently we made a proposal for a large scale quantum processor~[Li et al. arXiv: 1711. 03807 (2017) ] to be implemented in silicon quantum dots. This system features a crossbar control architecture which limits parallel single qubit control, but allows the scheme to overcome control scaling issues that form a major hurdle to large scale quantum computing systems. In this work, we develop a language that makes it possible to easily map quantum circuits to crossbar systems, taking into account their architecture and control limitations. Using this language we show how to map well known quantum error correction codes such as the planar surface and color codes in this limited control setting with only a small overhead in time. We analyze the logical error behavior of this surface code mapping for estimated experimental parameters of the <b>crossbar</b> <b>system</b> and conclude that logical error suppression to a level useful for real quantum computation is feasible.

40|$|Nowadays, every {{electronic}} system, {{ranging from}} a small mobile phone to a satellite sent into space, has a System-on-Chip (SoC). SoCs have undergone rapid evolution and are still progressing at a swift pace. Due to explosive evolution of semiconductor industry, the devices are scaling down at a rapid rate and hence, the SoCs today have become communication-centric and shared bus system and <b>crossbar</b> <b>system</b> were fail to performed communication in side SoC. Interconnection networks offer an alternate solution to this communication paradigm and are becoming persistent in SoC. A NoC based interconnect network is a well-organized and efficiently use of limited communication channel while maintaining low packet latency, high saturation throughput, high communication bandwidth amongst different IPs core with a minimum area and low power-dissipation. In this thesis we present details performance analysis of four interconnect network mesh, torus, fat tree and butterfly in term of latency and throughput under uniform, tornado, neighbour, bit reversal and bit complement traffic using cycle accurate simulator. We also implement NoC interconnect networks on FPGA and see the effect of NoC parameters(FDW,FBD,VC) on FPGA, and validate their performance through FPGA synthesis. We found that the FDW and buffer depth have the great effect on FPGA resources, Virtual Channels (VCs) with all NoC parameter have considerably effect on buffer size and routing and logic requirements at NoC. We also analysis all interconnect networks in term of power and area at 65 nm technology by using synopsis tool. We found that butterfly interconnect network has highest power and Area efficient interconnect network but it will suffer heavily degradation on performance at high load so fat tree network is efficient network among all interconnect network...|$|E
40|$|Emerging {{nano-scaled}} electronics such as silicon nanowires (NW) and quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) demonstrate {{great potential}} for continuing the technology advances toward future nanocomputing paradigm. However, excessive defects from bottom-up stochastic assembly have emerged as a fundamental obstacle for achieving reliable computation using these nano-scaled electronics. In this dissertation we present an information-theoretic approach to investigate the intrinsic relationship between defect tolerance and inherence redundancy in systems built upon nanowires and QCAs. By modeling these defect-prone electronics as a non-ideal information processing medium, we determine the information transfer capacity, which {{can be interpreted as}} the bound on reliability that a molecular <b>crossbar</b> <b>system</b> can achieve. The proposed method allows us {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} redundancy-based defect tolerance a quantitative manner. Employing this method, we derive the gap of reliability between redundancy-based defect tolerance and ideal defect-free molecular systems. ^ Besides the reliability issue, high energy dissipation of modern VLSI systems has been another concern of great importance due to the large scale, ultra high clock frequency, and very complex mechanisms implemented in those systems. Since nano-scaled electronics such as nanowire have shown their {{great potential for}} building memories and memory-like structures consume large amount of energy, this dissertation also discusses techniques to reduce the energy consumption of a memory-like structure, on-chip caches, which contribute large part of energy dissipation consumed by microprocessors. Specifically, this dissertation explores two directions in developing new cache architectures to improve the energy efficiency of data caches in microprocessors at the cost of negligible performance degradation. One is referred to as way-tagged (WT) cache while the other is named as early tag access (ETA) cache. WT cache records the way information of data, which indicates which way the data resides in the L 2 cache. In write-through cache systems, if there is a write hit in the L 1 data cache, the subsequent cache access on the L 2 cache only needs to activate its destination way with the help of the recorded way information for the data. ETA cache performs early accesses to an additional tag array to determine the destination way information prior to actual cache accesses. It thus allows only the destination way to be accessed if a hit occurs during the early tag access. Due to these new features, the potential cache architectures are very effective in reducing the number of ways accessed during cache accesses. This enables significant energy reduction with negligible or even no performance overhead. ...|$|E

50|$|When {{the office}} {{classification}} system for DDD was established, the principal designs in use for Class-5 in the US were Strowger-type step-by-step systems, Panel switches, and <b>crossbar</b> <b>systems.</b> 5XB <b>crossbar</b> switches were installed {{in large numbers}} in the 1950s and 60s, and 1ESS switches and variants starting in the 1960s. Most of these systems were removed in the late 20th century, primarily replaced in North America by DMS-10, DMS-100 and 5ESS switches in the Bell operating territories and the GTD-5 EAX in the GTE operating areas.

25|$|The {{design and}} {{maintenance}} procedures of all systems involved methods {{to avoid that}} subscribers experienced undue changes {{in the quality of}} the service or that they noticed failures. A variety of tools referred to as make-busys were plugged into electromechanical switch elements upon failure and during repairs. A make-busy identified the part being worked on as in-use, causing the switching logic to route around it. A similar tool was called a TD tool. Delinquent subscribers had their service temporarily denied (TDed). This was effected by plugging a tool into the subscriber's office equipment on <b>Crossbar</b> <b>systems</b> or line group in step-by-step switches. The subscriber could receive calls but could not dial out.|$|R

50|$|The Number One <b>Crossbar</b> Switching <b>System</b> (1XB switch), was {{the primary}} {{technology}} for designing urban telephone exchanges in the Bell System in the mid-20th century. Its switch fabric used the new electromechanical crossbar switch to implement the topology of the panel switching system of the 1920s. The first 1XB system was installed in the PResident-2 office at Troy Avenue in Brooklyn, New York which became operational in February 1938.|$|R
2500|$|The {{panel switch}} {{is an example}} of a power drive system, in that it used 1/16 {{horsepower}} motors to drive the selectors vertically to hunt for the desired connection, and back down again when the call was completed. In contrast, Strowger or <b>crossbar</b> <b>systems</b> used individual electromagnets for operation, and in their case the power available from an electromagnet limits the maximum size of the switch element it can move. [...] With Panel having no such restriction, its dimensions were determined solely by the needs of the switch, and the design of the exchange. The driving electric motor can be made as large as is necessary to move the switch elements. Thus, most calls required only about half as many stages as in earlier systems. Motors used on panel frames were capable of operating on alternating (AC) or direct current (DC), however they could only be started with DC. In the event of an AC power failure the motor would switch to its DC windings, and continue running until AC power was restored.|$|R
50|$|The No. 4 <b>Crossbar</b> {{switching}} <b>system</b> {{had been}} introduced in the 1940s to switch four-wire circuits and replace the incoming operator. With semiautomatic operation analogous to {{the early days of}} the panel switch, the operator in the originating city used a multifrequency keypad to dial an access code to connect to the correct city and to send the seven digit number to incoming equipment at the terminating city. This design was further refined to serve DDD.|$|R
5000|$|The Number Five <b>Crossbar</b> Switching <b>System</b> (5XB switch) is a {{telephone}} switch for telephone exchanges designed by Bell Labs and manufactured by Western Electric starting in 1947. It {{was used in}} the Bell System principally as a Class 5 telephone switch in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) until the early 1990s, when it was replaced with electronic switching systems. Variants were used as combined Class 4 and Class 5 systems in rural areas, and as a TWX switch.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of class-4 switches in the Bell System during the 1950s and 1960s used crossbar switches, {{such as the}} Crossbar Tandem (XBT) variant of the Number One <b>Crossbar</b> Switching <b>System,</b> or 1XB switch. The Number 4 Crossbar ("4XB") tandem switch {{was used in the}} North American toll network from 1943 until the 1990s, when it was replaced by more modern digital switching equipment, such as the Lucent 4ESS switch or the Nortel DMS-200. The last 4XB switch in the United States was installed in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Perfect {{arbitration}} {{would result}} in throughput limited only by the maximum throughput of each crossbar input or output. For example, if all traffic coming into line cards A and B is destined for line card C, then the maximum traffic that cards A and B can process together is limited by C. Perfect arbitration {{has been shown to}} require massive amounts of computation, that scales up much faster than the number of ports on the <b>crossbar.</b> Practical <b>systems</b> use imperfect arbitration heuristics (such as iSLIP) that can be computed in reasonable amounts of time.|$|R

The building was sold {{and is now the}} home of the Palo Alto Internet Exchange. The former CO building is marked by a bronze plaque and is located {{on the north side of}} Bryant Street between University Avenue and Hamilton Avenue. It was called Davenport after the exchange name at the introduction of dial telephone service in Palo Alto. For example, modern numbers starting with 325- were Davenport 5 in the 1950s and '60s. The Step-by-Step office was scrapped and replaced by stored-program-controlled equipment at a different location about 1980. Stanford calls ran on a Step-by-Step Western Electric 701 PBX until the university purchased its own switch about 1980. It had the older, traditional Bell System 600 Hz+120 Hz dial tone. The old 497-number PBX, MDF, and battery string were housed in a steel building at 333 Bonair Siding. From 1950s to 1980s, the bulk of Palo Alto calls were switched on Number 5 <b>Crossbar</b> <b>systems.</b> By the mid-1980s, these electromechanical systems had been junked.

40|$|Abstractâ€”This work revisits {{the design}} of {{crossbar}} and high-radix interconnects in light of advances in circuit and layout techniques that improve crossbar scalability, obviating the need for deep multi-stage networks. We employ a new building block, the Swizzle-Switchâ€”an energy- and area-efficient switching ele-ment that can readily scale to radix 64 â€”that has recently been validated via silicon test chips in 45 nm technology. We evaluate the Swizzle-Switch as both the high-radix building block of a Flattened Butterfly and as a single-stage interconnect, the Swizzle-Switch Network. In the process we address the architectural and layout challenges associated with centralized <b>crossbar</b> <b>systems.</b> Com-pared to a conventional Mesh, the Flattened Butterfly provides a 15 % performance improvement with a 2. 5 reduction in the standard deviation of on-chip access times. The Swizzle-Switch Network achieves further gains, providing a 21 % improvement in performance, a 3 reduction in on-chip access variability, a 33 % reduction in interconnect power, and a 25 % reduction in total system energy while only increasing chip area by 7 %. Finally, this paper details a 3 -D integrated version of the Swizzle-Switch Network, showing up to a 30 % gain in performance over the 2 -D Swizzle-Switch Network for benchmarks sensitive to interconnect latency. One major concern with 3 -D designs is thermal dissipa-tion. We show through detailed thermal analysis that with the highly energy-efficient Swizzle-Switch Network design that the thermal budget is well within that of passive cooling solutions.
