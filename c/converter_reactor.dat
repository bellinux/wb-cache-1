40|$|In view of {{the fact}} that the world's {{high-grade}} natural uranium resources are limited, alternative ways of using these resources more efficiently are of interest in the line of research undertaken by IIASA's Energy Systems Program. Sole reliance on the currently predominant Light Water Reactors (LWRs) would mean to deplete these natural uranium resources rapidly. The present paper considers different strategies of uranium use involving, in addition to burners (LWRs), Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) and Advanced <b>Converter</b> <b>Reactors</b> (ACR) with an extremely high efficiency in using natural uranium. Breeder reactors in fact require only depleted natural uranium (left over from enriched LWR fuel), once a certain endowment of fissile plutonium (from burnt LWR fuel) has accumulated. Given such an endowment, the breeder output can be increased on the basis of self-generated plutonium. Although the efficiency in using natural uranium is less in advanced <b>converter</b> <b>reactors,</b> their uranium savings are enormous compared to the amounts used up in burners. Such considerations of a more efficient future uranium use by deploying advanced reactors in addition to burner reactors are based on a hypothetical trajectory of a total installed nuclear capacity increasing to 10 TW(e) by the year 2030. The analysis shows that a combination of advanced and burner reactors, as compared to the use of burners only, could lead to cumulative, high-grade uranium savings greater than 70...|$|R

In the minimization of the Gibbs free energy function the Davidon– Fletcher–Powell (DFP) optimization procedure using the penalty terms in the well-defined objective function was used.

40|$|Under present {{technological}} and economic conditions, minimum fuel costs in thermal reactors {{are associated with}} systems having conversion ratios less than unity; however, when recycle of bred fuel becomes inexpensive (associated with rapid and inexpensive fuel fabrication, movement and processing), minimum fuel costs appear to occur with reactors having relatively high breeding ratios. Although the thorium cycle permits a higher breeding ratio than the uranium cycle, the fertile material and reactor concept which gives minimum fuel costs under present conditions is not clearly defined. This {{is due in part}} to inadequate information on the variation of eta with energy for the various fuels, particularly the eta values of Pu$^{ 239 }$ and Pu$^{ 241 }$, and to uncertainties in economic factors. Development of an "advanced" technology which permited inexpensive recycle of bred fuel would decrease the fuel cost in <b>converter</b> <b>reactors</b> as well as in breeders, and increase the conversion or breeding ratio of minimum-fuel-cost systems. With such development, the minimum U. S. nuclear power level at which breeder reactors were required was 250 million kw(e) (or equivalent), if U.

However, prior toattaining this power level, an advanced technology can be justified on the basis of fuel-cost savings in <b>converter</b> <b>reactors.</b> Thus, emphasis should be placed on the development of an inexpensive fuel cycle rather than the development of a thermal breeder.

The growth of energy market {{and the development of}} the HVDC technology cause the multi-terminal HVDC system based on half-bridge MMC {{is one of the best}} option of transmission system, especially for offshore power grids. The aim of designing transmission systems is to obtain a network with high reliability. In this master thesis the reliability modelling of multi-terminal HVDC system based on half-bridge MMC is analysed as an important step to designing transmission networks. Firstly, the reliability of all subsystems related to the HVDC connection is modelled. The Modular Multi-Level Converter - Voltage Source Converter (MMC-VSC) is discussed from the lowest stage. After that, the converter unit and other components such as transformer, <b>converter</b> <b>reactor,</b> control system and DC switchyard in the connection are described by their reliability and is combined into a reliability model of a converter station. Two types of converter stations (onshore and offshore) and the cables assemble the system based on the case study. Two systems are modelled: Point-to-point and three-terminal configuration. In the three-terminal configuration, two scenarios are performed: with and without possibilities. The reliability modelled is performed using two approaches: analytical approach and Monte Carlo simulation. The reliability model of the subsystems and systems involve the availability, unavailability, outage duration, energy not transmitted, failure frequency, average duration per interruption, and the range of time between failures. After having the model and the reliability parameter, the reliability analysis is performed. From the analysis, it is found that the highest unavailability and thus the outage duration in onshore and offshore converter station are the transformer and the <b>converter</b> <b>reactor,</b> respectively. The offshore converter station is found to have the highest unavailability.

Thorium {{reactors}} breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium, but require a small amount of fissile material for initial start up. There is relatively little of this material available. This raises {{the problem of how to}} start the reactors in a short time frame. One option is to produce U-233 [...] in today's solid fueled reactors, then reprocess it out of the solid waste. An LFTR can also be started by other fissile isotopes, enriched uranium or plutonium from reactors or decommissioned bombs. For enriched uranium startup, high enrichment is needed. Decommissioned uranium bombs have enough enrichment, but not enough is available to start many LFTRs. It is difficult to separate plutonium fluoride from lanthanide fission products. One option for a two-fluid reactor is to operate with plutonium or enriched uranium in the fuel salt, breed U-233 in the blanket, and store it instead of returning it to the core. Instead, add plutonium or enriched uranium to continue the chain reaction, similar to today's solid fuel reactors. When enough U-233 is bred, replace the fuel with new fuel, retaining the U-233 for other startups. A similar option exists for a single-fluid reactor operating as a <b>converter.</b> Such a <b>reactor</b> would not reprocess fuel while operating. Instead the reactor would start on plutonium with thorium as the fertile and add plutonium. The plutonium eventually burns out and U-233 is produced in situ.

To observe more solidification effects to Fe compound in the used-catalyst, which has released or leached from monolith structure, the research sampling of used-catalyst tying to become a strong structure has been elected, that is Paving Block. The research method used is Case Study in the Ammonia Plant of PT. KPA Bontang, where on November 2003, unloading activity performed for used-catalyst in Ammonia converter 2 "d stage. The above used catalyst, along with sand as the "aggregates" mixed with cement, then pressed to be a paving block and has been tested by TCLP (Toxicity Concentration Leaching Procedure) to find-out the leaching Fe possibility of the paving block and strength test {{to ensure that the}} strength are not lower than paving block sold in the market. For TCLP test, research variable choose is soaking duration and the composition of used-catalyst waste added t o the paving b lock processing. Whilst for strength test, choose lifetime and the composition of used-catalyst waste added to the paving, as the variable. From the research sampling obtained, with soaking duration vary, shown that Fe leached between 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days — all are still below than limitation standard (1 ppm, as clean water requirement). So is the effect of the used-catalyst composition, as a mixture of basic material, the fact shown that it is not much affecting Fe leached. This shown that tying of cement to aggregate material (read• catalyst & cement) can be stated perfect and accepted by environment. Whilst the strength test pressing, from the research result found that lifetime of paving block will causing the trend increasing of strength test significantly enough. Moreover the effect of ex-catalyst added, generally will increase the strength, but within a maximum limitation, where from the trial result - obtained strength test with optimum condition is on the following compare composition: Cement : Sand : Used-catalyst = 0. 25 : 1. 00 : 1. 50 As a whole, strength test of this used-catalyst paving block is bigger than common paving block, from the trial-result at day 215 t of used-catalyst paving, for common paving — average result is 89. 2 Kg/cm 2, whilst for used-catalyst paving on the sample composition I (the lowest used-catalyst content) is 132. 07 kg/cm 2.

40|$|DoctorThree-Way Catalysts (TWCs) {{containing}} noble metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh) {{have been}} commonly employed {{for reducing the}} emissions of air pollutants in the exhaust gas stream from conventional automotive gasoline engines. TWCs {{have been designed to}} simultaneously convert all three major air pollutants including CO, HC and NOx into CO 2, H 2 O and N 2 and are highly effective under the stoichiometric exhaust gas conditions. For the development and operation of the effective TWC, the fundamental reaction kinetics of TWC has been developed. Although a variety of kinetic models, including those of Voltz et al. and Subramaniam and Varma, have been developed to reduce the time and resources required for {{the development and implementation of}} catalytic converters with improved emission control performance, more accurate TWC reaction kinetics based on reliable reaction mechanism in realistic exhaust streams is needed to improve the emission performance prediction capability of catalytic converter models. In the present study, the detailed reaction kinetics based on reliable reaction mechanism has been established to predict the TWC performance under realistic feed stream conditions. On the basis of this effort, the monolith reactor models have been developed to simulate the performance of a modern three-way catalytic converter. In order to examine the catalytic activity under the realistic feed conditions, the TWC including Pd and Pt/Rh/Ce aged by an engine-dynamometer from 4 k to 100 k miles has been provided by GM. A molten-salt bath reactor system was designed and built to develop the steady-state reaction kinetics over the TWC under near-isothermal conditions. The Pd catalyst was effective for removing CO and C 3 H 6 at low temperatures, while the Pt/Rh/Ce catalyst was most efficient for NO reduction attributed to Rh existed on the catalyst surface. The light-off temperatures (LOTsT 50) of the simultaneous oxidations of CO, C 3 H 6 and H 2, and NO reduction shifted to higher reaction temperatures as the catalyst mileage increased from 4 k to 100 k miles. As the catalyst mileage increased, the BET surface area and the metal dispersion of the catalyst decreased as determined by the catalyst characterization study. However, no alteration of the activity ranking has been observed in the order of H 2 ≒ NO > CO > C 3 H 6, regardless of the both Pd and Pt/Rh/Ce catalyst and their mileages. The promotional effects of water and hydrogen on the three-way catalytic activity were examined using in-situ surface FTIR for the oxidation reactions over the both Pd and Pt/Rh/Ce catalysts. Water improved the CO oxidation activity by the formation of reaction intermediate including carboxylate and carbonate. Hydrogen also promoted the CO oxidation reaction similar to water. In addition, the presence of H 2 in the feed stream containing NO significantly enhanced the TWC activity mainly due to the H-assisted dissociation reaction of NO. Moreover, a series of variable-composition experiments, in which the feed composition was systematically varied to elucidate the differences in the reactivity of CO, C 3 H 6 and H 2 toward O 2 or NO (partitioning experiment), were conducted to determine and verify the unified kinetic parameters for a given reaction between 300 and 450 oC. Also, by the isothermal experiments, the enhancement and inhibition of CO conversion activity have been examined as key components were added to and removed from the feed under a systematic steady-state isothermal reaction condition at 275 oC for 45 h. Based upon the variety of the kinetic results and the catalyst characterization, a detailed reaction kinetic model to predict the activity of the modern TWC has been developed by incorporating all the important reactions on the basis of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The enhancement effects of H 2 O and H 2 on the oxidation reactions and H-assisted NO dissociation reaction have been included in the kinetic model. In particular, the secondary reactions such as NH 3 oxidation and NH 3 -SCR reactions were also considered for predicting N 2 O and NH 3 as the reaction byproducts formed over the both Pd and Pt/Rh/Ce catalysts. The model predictions adequately describe the general trend of the measured conversions of CO, C 3 H 6, NO and H 2. N 2 O and NH 3 formed during the TWC reaction can also be predicted by the model developed in the present study. Moreover, the decrease in activity of the 100 k mile-aged catalyst can be well described by decreasing the frequency factors of the rate constants estimated for their 4 k mile-aged counterparts, without alteration of the activation energies and the adsorption equilibrium constants estimated under the realistic full feed conditions. The resulting detailed reaction kinetics developed using the powder samples was incorporated into a monolith reactor model to simulate the performance of a commercial modern TWC <b>converter.</b> The <b>reactor</b> model directly employed the kinetic parameters estimated from the present reaction kinetic study without any parameter adjustment. Initially, a one-dimensional (1 D) reactor model developed based on the mass balance for the bulk gas phase and the washcoat layer within the monolith channels was used to predict species concentrations as a function of the average reactor temperature along the monolith reactor length. However, the model was not capable of describing the catalytic performance of the both Pd and Pt/Rh/Ce monolith reactors. To resolve the drawback of the 1 D model, a 2 D non-isothermal reactor model has been developed to more accurately predict the conversion performance and thermal behavior of the catalytic monolith. The 2 D model with the both heat and mass transfers and detailed reaction kinetics well describe the TWC performance, including the gas compositions and the temperature distribution as a function of both axial and radial positions for the single-bed monolith containing either Pd or Pt/Rh/Ce catalyst as well as the dual-bed monolith system including both Pd (front) and Pt/Rh/Ce (rear) catalysts. The model was further validated by predicting the TWC performance of the dual-bed reactor under the steady-state sweep test (st-ST) conditions (A/F= 14. 23 ~ 15. 03) ...|$|R
