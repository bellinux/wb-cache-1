5000|$|Early the {{following}} year, {{the marketing of}} battery-electric road vehicles was split off from the core business of Hindle Smart by {{the formation of a}} new company, Helecs Vehicles Ltd. The new company was also responsible for the appointment of distributors and agents for the vehicles. In March 1952 they announced a new pricing structure for their vehicles, which were listed as the Tough Ten and the Intruder. Prices for both ranges were quoted for a bare chassis, a <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> <b>cab,</b> and a chassis, cab and milk float body. Helecs received a second order for seven vehicles, a mixture of Tough Ten and Intruder models, from their agent in Toronto, Canada in August 1952. They were supplied in chassis form, with bodies for bread delivery built locally. The Tough Ten model was also displayed at the Canadian National Exhibition, held in Toronto, and the model on show was a bread van.|$|E
50|$|The M939 to M945 were <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> <b>cabs,</b> {{meant to}} carry {{specialized}} bodies. They {{were available in}} long and extra long wheelbases, and with or without front winches.|$|R

5000|$|During the Second World War, British car {{companies}} produced simple Utility load carriers, the Car, Light Utility or [...] "Tilly". For Hillman {{it was the}} Hillman 10HP, a Minx <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> two-person <b>cab</b> and covered load area behind. The basic saloon was also produced for military and essential civilian use from 1940 to 1944.|$|R
50|$|The Scotsman was {{replaced}} for the 1960 model {{year by the}} Studebaker Champ pickup, {{which was based on}} the same truck <b>chassis</b> but <b>with</b> a <b>cab</b> derived from the contemporary Lark four-door sedan.|$|R
5000|$|With this system, a {{grapple loader}} {{is mounted on}} the rear of a short frame <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> an operator's <b>cab</b> mounted between loader and chassis cab. The loader is {{operated}} from this cab, and all driving controls are also routed to the operator's cab enabling the [...] "rear steer" [...] unit to drive backwards along the route and load into separate haul trucks.|$|R
50|$|In period it's {{unlikely}} that a relatively modern military lorry {{would have been}} sacrificed in this way, being too valuable to replace losses after Dunkirk. The museum's Bison was built relatively recently, from an original rear pillbox on a different original <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> the front <b>cab</b> section being a modern reproduction by the Museum of Army Transport in Beverley. The suspension of this example rests on axle stands to avoid flattening the tyres.|$|R
2500|$|The Series IIA FC {{launched}} in 1962 {{was based on}} the Series IIA 2.25-litre petrol engine and [...] <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> the <b>cab</b> positioned over the engine to give more load space. Export vehicles were the first Land-Rovers to get the 2.6-litre petrol engine. Most examples had an ENV (heavy duty) rear axle, a matching front axle came later. Tyres were large 900Ã—16 types on deep-dish wheel rims to spread the ground weight of this heavy vehicle. These vehicles were somewhat underpowered for the increased load capacity (...) , and most had a hard working life. Less than 2,500 were made, and most had a utility body, but surviving examples often have custom bodywork. With an upgraded powertrain, they {{can be used as a}} small motorhome.|$|R
5000|$|Within the industry, a {{motor home}} {{based upon a}} cutaway van chassis is a Class C motor home. It is built on a truck <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> an {{attached}} <b>cab</b> section, which is usually cutaway van chassis based (but may also be pickup truck based or even large truck based). They are often (but not necessarily) characterized by a distinctive [...] "cab-over" [...] profile, {{the portion of the}} coach over the cab containing a bed or an [...] "entertainment" [...] section.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, a {{collaboration}} with the Tanfield Group of the UK saw the introduction of an [...] "electric Avia", <b>with</b> AALM providing <b>chassis</b> <b>cabs</b> less engines, gearboxes and other diesel truck components to Tanfield subsidiary Smith Electric Vehicles {{for inclusion in the}} Smith's Newton all electric truck. This proved to be a highly successful {{collaboration with the}} shipment of engineless trucks forming a large proportion of Avia's sales. In the U.S. runs hundreds of Smith Electric electric cars <b>with</b> <b>chassis</b> and <b>cabs</b> from Prague.|$|R
5000|$|A {{particular}} {{family of}} vehicles {{that seems to be}} a characteristic Greek development starting in the mid-1960s, was a rather odd, light farm tractor-truck combination usually on three-wheel <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> or without <b>cab.</b> Some were constructed by smaller companies, or even small workshops, but a number of more significant companies evolved, especially in Crete (where they are called [...] "skaftikies"), including (except for Candia) Record, Kronos, Knossos, Minos, Minotavros, Talos, Jupiter etc.; other companies included Demetra in Volos, Diana, Standard, Zeus Hellas in Athens, and many others. Engines used included Sachs, Ilo, local models by Mekmotors (Ruggerini licence), Petropoulos, Malkotsis etc. By the early 1980s this kind of vehicle was so widespread, that had become characteristic of the Greek countryside.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967, a Bedford SB3 <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Plaxton's Panorama <b>cab</b> {{was used}} in the {{construction}} of seven custom mobile cinema units that toured British factories for the Ministry of Technology to [...] "raise standards". The body was custom fabricated from extruded aluminium by Coventry Steel Caravans. One of these restored units is used as a vintage mobile cinema. The vehicle dubbed [...] 'The Reel History Bus' [...] {{was used in}} the Melvyn Bragg BBC TV series, Reel History of Britain showing little known or totally unseen archive film of historical events, to the surviving participants and their families on board. They showed their reaction and interviewed audience members about their often newly jogged memories of events. The Vintage Mobile Cinema has appeared on The One Show and George Clarke's Small Spaces, and continues to appear around the UK.|$|R
50|$|The new-for-1987 F-Super Duty was {{essentially}} a Class 4 truck built as a <b>chassis</b> <b>cab,</b> <b>with</b> an aftermarket bed (specific to its future use) added after the truck was built. The F-Super Duty came with dual fuel tanks with a dash-mounted toggle switch to switch between each tank, while using only a single fuel gauge. It came with a PTO used to power attachments, such as winches or a dump bed, directly from the transmission. F-Super Duty models were rated at about 15000 lb GVWR and came with either the standard 7.5 L (460 CID) gas V8 or the optional 7.3 L (444 CID) diesel V8. All wheels were 10-lug with dual wheels in the rear. This model {{should not be confused}} with the later Super Duty commercial line of trucks starting with the 1999 model year.|$|R
5000|$|Several designs, {{such as the}} Danish Hydrema 910, {{are based}} on a truck <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> an {{armoured}} <b>cab</b> and a flail mounted behind on what would otherwise be the cargo space. They are able to drive to the mined site like any other road vehicle. During flailing operations, they slowly drive in reverse over the mine field - in this way, the cab is kept as far as possible from any detonations. Some mine-flail vehicles are operated under remote-control for safety. The Swiss Digger DTR D-2 is a smaller, four ton, remote-controlled vehicle that is more easily moved to remote or inaccessible locations and may be used in more confined areas. Tanks are still used to carry flails; examples include the Norwegian Army's Leopard AMCV - a Leopard tank that was modified by Hagglunds to carry an Aardvark flail system. The German Army is equipped with the Keiler [...] (mine clearing tank [...] "wild boar"), based on a M48 Patton main battle tank. The first of 24 Keilers was supplied to the German Army by Rheinmetall in 1997.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1994, {{with the}} {{development}} of the four issue at GAZ diesel turbo air cooling GAZ-5441 115 hp, a model GAZ-3309 carrying capacity 4,5 t, completely unified on the <b>chassis</b> and <b>cab</b> <b>with</b> GAZ-3307 (only looks different engine air intake pipe {{on the left side of}} the cab). By mid-1996, it completely replaced with a conveyor truck carburetor 3307. In mid-1997 its own production of diesel [...] " [...] air-vent [...] " [...] at GAZ was considered uneconomical, resulting in release of the model 3309 has been suspended until the end of 2001, and was restored in the production of 4,5-thin carburetor GAZ-3307. Subsequently, gas switched to purchase Belarusian diesels MMZ D-245.7 (similar turbo water cooling installed on ZiL-5301 [...] "Bull") Minsk Motor Plant (MMZ), which is installed in the production resumed in 3309 model.|$|R

2500|$|Two {{engineer}} {{bodies were}} standard on long wheelbase <b>chassis.</b> A flatbed <b>with</b> a <b>cab</b> protector and mid-ship mounted winch {{was used for}} self-loading and carrying large equipment. A [...] van body was used for map-making and printing sections.|$|R
25|$|The {{suspension}} {{components of}} the Sportline package were available as an option on all cars, including estates, as option 650â€”sports <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> 15-hole alloy rims and option 653â€”sports <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> eight-hole light alloy rims.|$|R
50|$|The cab was {{manufactured}} {{in several different}} versions, such as a closed <b>cab,</b> <b>cab</b> <b>with</b> long <b>cab</b> (crew cabin <b>with</b> fire engines), <b>cab</b> <b>with</b> soft top and a <b>cab</b> <b>with</b> fold-down windshield.|$|R
50|$|GE {{was almost}} {{commissioned}} by ATSF {{to make a}} B unit (cabless booster unit) version of this model, but because the price {{would have been the}} same for B40-8Ws <b>with</b> <b>cabs</b> or without, ATSF decided to order units <b>with</b> <b>cabs</b> only.|$|R
50|$|This {{vehicle is}} amphibious, and uses its wheels to propel itself when afloat. It has a water-displacing {{hermetic}} hull which provides improved fording performance and a 4x4-type <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> independent suspension and a centralized system of tire-pressure control. The ground clearance is 475 mm. The standard undercarriage <b>with</b> a <b>cab</b> can be {{fitted with a}} number of different modules with various number of passenger seats and cargo compartments, seating up to 10 people.
