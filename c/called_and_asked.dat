25|$|The Garnett trade {{left the}} roster {{depleted}} and depth became an immediate concern. Eventually, the Celtics signed guards Eddie House and Jackie Manuel on August 1, {{just two days}} after the Garnett trade, and center Scot Pollard on August 9. Later, Ainge <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> 5-time All-Star Reggie Miller to return from his 2-year retirement and join the roster in a reserve role. Miller strongly considered the possibility of playing alongside Garnett, but ultimately announced on August 23 that he would not join the Celtics. On August 27, forward James Posey signed with the team and was considered a decisive signing which instantly gave the Celtics a drastic improvement to their bench.|$|E

She intended to finish the album by the end of 2000 and resumed its recording while filming in Australia for Queen of the Damned (2002), as she shot her part for the film during the day and recorded songs at night. She said in an interview for Billboard, [...] "there were nights when I didn't go into the studio—I was too tired. On the weekends, I always made it."

Several days after the Pumpkins confirmed they would accompany the Chili Peppers, former Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> the band to allow his friend's new group, Pearl Jam, to open for them on the forthcoming tour. The first show following the release of Blood Sugar Sex Magik was at the Oscar Mayer Theater in Madison, Wisconsin, which was met with positive reactions from the Milwaukee Journal: [...] "the audience was a swirling mass of airborne cups, ice cubes, shoes, shirts, pogo dancers, body-passers and stage divers. And it wasn't purely a boy's club in the moshpit—many females bought into the mayhem, stripping down to their bras and flinging themselves about madly as the band tore through 'Higher Ground', 'Suck My Kiss', and 'Give it Away', which was Goth-ed up by Frusciante when he added a riff from Black Sabbath's 'Sweet Leaf'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thicker than Water {{came out}} with good reviews, but by then even her {{publisher}} Liveright was feeling the pangs of the Great Depression and Caspary was again nearly broke. [...] In March 1933, a Fox story editor <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> for another original just like Suburb, which had been filmed as the Night of June 13. [...] She spent that summer in Hollywood, writing a treatment for Fox and working on a play with Samuel Ornitz. [...] Caspary could not sell that play and by winter she was broke again, but Ornitz insisted they write another and {{brought her back to}} Hollywood where her luck was always better. Within a week she had sold three stories to studios and gotten a five hundred dollar-a-week contract. She bought herself a completely new wardrobe and brought her mother from New York. Like most people, Caspary did not get along with Harry Cohn, and after one spat, she no longer received writing assignments. Since her contract had five more months, she merely stopped going to the studio and spent her days at the beach while her agent picked up her paycheck. Again wanting to write her own material she got her contract canceled and set sail for New York.|$|E

60|$|He strode {{off with}} {{the air of a}} conqueror, and having {{occasion}} to go to the village looked in at the shoe-maker's window as he passed and smiled broadly. For years Little Haven had regarded Mr. Quince with awe, as being far too dangerous a man for the lay mind to tamper with, and at one stroke the farmer had revealed the hollowness of his pretensions. Only that morning the wife of a labourer had <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> him to hurry the mending of a pair of boots.

And sure enough nearly a week later, on Tuesday, the 16th, at about 1 p.m., the same shabbily dressed individual <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> for his umbrella.
