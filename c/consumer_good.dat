25|$|For a given {{quantity}} of a <b>consumer</b> <b>good,</b> the {{point on the}} demand curve indicates the value, or marginal utility, to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer {{would be prepared to}} pay for that unit. The corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost, the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a perfectly competitive market, supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|In {{the much}} smaller, {{voluntary}} market, individuals, companies, or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own {{greenhouse gas emissions}} from transportation, electricity use, and other sources. For example, an individual might purchase carbon offsets {{to compensate for the}} greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel. Many companies (see list) offer carbon offsets as an up-sell during the sales process so that customers can mitigate the emissions related with their product or service purchase (such as offsetting emissions related to a vacation flight, car rental, hotel stay, <b>consumer</b> <b>good,</b> etc.). In 2008, about $705 million of carbon offsets were purchased in the voluntary market, representing about 123.4 million metric tons of CO2e reductions. Some fuel suppliers in the UK offer fuel which has been carbon offset such as Fuel dyes.|$|E

25|$|Since its foundation, {{the socialist}} party has opposed every war – {{including}} both World War I and World War II. Although, in its early years, party writers frequently would contrast the numbers of dead in wars with the numbers killed and maimed in industrial incidents (by {{way of trying to}} contrast the passions and efforts put into war with the lack of response to the conditions of capitalism) the party argued that wars in capitalism were fought {{in the interests of the}} capitalist class and – as with their case against nationalism – the workers did all the dying for no gain for themselves. Further, they emphasised that while the press and politicians tried to call for strike moderation, the capitalists would continue the class war despite hostilities, forcing down wages and up <b>consumer</b> <b>good</b> prices. During both wars, some members won Conscientious objector status.|$|E

2500|$|After a second, briefer {{period of}} Soviet {{military}} occupation, János Kádár, Nagy's former Minister of State, {{was chosen by}} the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling Socialist Workers' Party (MSzMP). Kádár quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released {{the majority of those}} imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. Kádár proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, [...] "Those who are not against us are with us." [...] Kádár introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (háztáji gazdálkodás). The living standard rose as <b>consumer</b> <b>good</b> and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{in-depth}} {{study of the}} structural change and transition of the Chinese <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> market from 1954 to 1991 using disequilibrium econometric methodology. The model for the Chinese <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> market {{is based on the}} Portes-Winter disequilibrium model for centrally planned economies (1980). The demand function is derived from the Houthakker-Taylor savings function. The supply function is composed of approximations to the government 2 ̆ 7 s long-term and short-term plans. The transaction quantity in the market is defined as the smaller of effective demand and supply. Using the traditional global fitting method, three models are evaluated: one model that assumes no structural change, and two models that assume structural change. The estimations show that the structures of the demand and supply functions of the Chinese <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> market have changed since the economic reform in 1980. An innovative non-parametric method of locally weighted optimization is applied to further test the variations in model parameters during the period between 1954 and 1991 without assuming explicit functional forms of demand and supply. The estimation results show that the Chinese <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> market fits the Portes-Winter model well in the earlier years. The results confirm that the structures of demand and supply functions have changed since the economic reform. In the late 19802 ̆ 7 s, the Chinese <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> market is shown to have shifted away from a pure centrally planned system. Other main conclusions of this study include, first, that chronic shortage does not exist in the Chinese <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> market from 1954 to 1991. Second, a rigid price level has not caused the market to be persistently in disequilibrium. Third, the classical disequilibrium model of <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> market in centrally planned economies does not fit the Chinese <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> market in the later years...|$|R
