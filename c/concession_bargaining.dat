American employers {{may not have a}} solution to the long-term crisis of the world economy, but they have developed a coherent strategy to weaken the labor movement. Through a combination of <b>concessions</b> <b>bargaining,</b> plant shutdowns, capital mobility, and probusiness government policies, they have succeeded in intimidating unions and dividing workers. As a result, the labor movement grows weaker, and workers lose what little protection they now have for their standard of living and basic rights. Unions will become a marginal force in society unless the labor movement develops a viable strategy for responding to these employer attacks. The current program and policies of most sections of the trade union leadership are clearly inadequate. The labor movement urgently needs a new strategy...|$|R

40|$|La négociation concessive est souvent présentée comme une manifestation éloquente de la {{transformation}} du système des relations industrielles américain qui découlerait notamment d'une concurrence plus vive sur le marché du produit. Cet article propose des réponses à deux questions. La négociation concessive a-t-elle été au Canada cette dynamique de concessions réciproques importantes et persistantes exprimant une transformation en profondeur de son système de relations industrielles ou un phénomène circonscrit et passager résultant d'une conjoncture particulièrement difficile ? Est-ce un phénomène qui s'est généralisé à l'ensemble de l'économie canadienne ou s'il a plutôt marqué les secteurs d'activité où la concurrence est plus vive, suite à une hausse de la concurrence internationale ou à la présence plus importante d'entreprises non syndiquées ? Des réponses à ces questions sont suggérées par une analyse de l'évolution du contenu d'un échantillon de 60 conventions collectives du secteur manufacturier canadien sur une période d'une douzaine d'années. <b>Concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> {{is often}} {{presented as a}} telling illustration of {{the transformation of the}} North-American industrial relations System — the result of fiercer product market competition. Whatever the imprecisions in definition and measurement, the notion of <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> is based on an understanding widely held by unionized workers and their employers of a mutual but not necessarily equal exchange of concessions. It is generally defined as a type of bargaining which leads to union concessions on past gains in exchange, most of the time, for employer concessions on subjects which, in the North American industrial relations context, have been considered management rights. In light of the paucity of Canadian research on this subject, the present article seeks to respond to two questions. First, has <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> in Canada given lise to a spiral of reciprocal concessions, signalling an indepth transformation of the industrial relations System, or to a merely temporary and contained phenomenon resulting from particularly difficult economic circumstances? Second, has this phenomenon spread to the entire Canadian economy or has it only affected the industries where competition is fiercest? The answers to these questions are based on the analysis of the evolution from the early 1980 s to the early 1990 s of two content indicators of a sample of 60 collective agreements in the Canadian manufacturing sector. The first indicator measures the frequency of gains and concessions made by the parties on 12 collective agreement clauses. The second indicator, the annual variations in real wages, measures a posteriori the effect of the agreements on wages and their indexation to the cost of living. The analysis of the indicator of agreement content shows that union concessions were more frequent during the economic recovery {{in the latter half of}} the 1980 s, whereas employer concessions were more numerous during the 1982 recession and in the late 1980 s. In fact, the number of union gains was higher than the number of concessions made for each of the four bargaining rounds studied. These results are far from being consistent with the win-win dynamic of <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Unionized workers seem to make more concessions when they obtain fewer gains and vice versa. The significant lag between the relative frequency of union concessions and gains over time contradicts the idea of a mutual exchange of concessions between the parties. However, the type of concessions and gains corresponds more closely to the terms of exchange that have been observed in <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Thus, the unions mainly make concessions on wages and on control over job content in exchange for improvements to the clauses related to job security and participation in management. A more detailed data analysis nevertheless shows that unions which have made these gains are certainly not those who have made concessions. The concept of a <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> characterized by reciprocal concessions made on certain gains is not supported by the examination of the first indicator of the evolution of collective agreement content. If this indicator of the relative frequency of gains and concessions shows that there were fewer union concessions during the 1982 recession than during the economic recovery and expansion period which followed, it may be because the indicator did not accurately measure the real significance of these gains and concessions. The estimate of average annual variations in real wages, the second indicator examined, shows that wage conditions greatly deteriorated during the 1982 recession round, but then improved and nearly caught up in real terms during the two following rounds. On the basis of the latter findings, it is difficult to maintain that <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> is other than a conjunctural phenomenon affecting more vulnerable firms and industries. The phenomenon of union (and management) concessions is far from being widespread in all industries. Although most of the agreements contained only a few union concessions in all the rounds, in a quarter of the agreements examined, there was at least one concession out of every ten clauses. Moreover, the variations in real wages indicate that the concessions might not only have been more significant than frequent, they also show the considerable differences between the improved agreements (more than 4 out of 10 agreements) and the average annual losses in real wages in the majority of agreements. In fact, it seems that nearly half of the unions involved took advantage of a more favourable context and were thus able to hold on to even improve gains made in the late 1970 s. This hypothesis of the positive impact of a favourable context, and the negative impact of an unfavourable context, is supported in part by our multiple regression analysis. While the simple model of bargaining power cannot account for the relative frequency of concessions and gains, it was found that, for all the bargaining rounds, the average annual variations in real wages were negatively affected by greater product market competition, that is by a lower degree of concentration in the manufacturing sector and a higher level and growth of imports in the industry. The variations in real wages are also negatively correlated with the level of unionization. This more surprising result could be explained by the relatively significant gains made by workers in highly unionized sectors during the 1960 s and 1970 s, unionized workers who had more to lose in a context of strong competitive pressures on their firm. The analysis of these two content indicators for 60 collective agreements over more than a decade shows that neither the concept of <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> based on a win-win dynamic nor the generalization of union concessions can be supported in the case of the Canadian manufacturing sector. The frequency and significance of the concessions fluctuate not only over time, but also by industry. In industries that are more affected by product market competition, there are more wage concessions. Although these results concur with those of American studies, they must be interpreted with caution given the limitations of the two indicators of the transformation of collective agreement content, the small size of the sample, the sometimes questionable quality of some sectoral data and the absence of indicators measuring firms' specific economic situation. Our research highlights not only the difficulty in interpreting collective agreements but also the range of compromises generated by the collective bargaining process. Union concessions do not appear to have spread in the Canadian manufacturing sector, and the very concept of <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> drawn from the American literature does not appear to be highly relevant to the experience of this major sector. It may be risky to generalize the results of a study on the evolution of 60 collective agreements over a dozen years. However, these same results enjoin us to be just as cautious about generalizing the highly publieized <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> cases in the 1980 s and those of the "social contracts" negotiated more recently by several major firms in Quebec.

40|$|In all the {{literature}} on the theory and practice of negotiation, the governing metaphor remains consistently one of war or fighting. This is true not only for tactical schools of power-based negotiation, but even for more constructive, interest-based approaches. Our language is infused with talk of tactics, flanks, concessions, gaining ground and winning. This article explores the possible consequences of abandoning this picture in favor of the far too little explored metaphor of the dance. We will see that both the content and the process of negotiation can change dramatically once when we think of bargaining as an aesthetic activity which provides intrinsic joy as well as extrinsic benefits. In such a dance, there is plenty of room for competition as well as cooperation, as movements can be spirited and confrontational as well as smooth and harmonious. We identify many forms of dance in negotiation, and explore three: the dance of positioning, where passions and presentations interact proudly; the dance of empathy, when the partners come to better understand each other; and then the dance of concessions, where the deal is struck and the music comes to an end. Finally, we will try to show how the dance can be employed pedagogically, in teaching and training negotiation and mediation. In particular, the Brazilian dance of capoeira illustrates holistically and experientially how movement and rhythm can be interpreted both as fight and as a dance and how we can come to see a process as both aesthetic and purposeful at the same time. First feeling, then thinking and finally speaking, we can use this medium to explore the dynamics of confrontation and cooperation in a negotiation setting.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{explore the}} effect of performance information and production uncertainties on (i) subjective entitlements derived from the production process and (ii) bargaining over the jointly produced surplus. We hypothesize that performance information and details of the production process affect entitlements, which in turn influence bargaining behavior. We find that, without performance information, subjective entitlements are mostly mutually consistent, and bargaining mainly ends with an equal split. In stark contrast, negotiators derive strong, mutually inconsistent, subjective entitlements when there is performance information. These subjective entitlements affect opening proposals, <b>concessions,</b> and <b>bargaining</b> duration and lead to asymmetric agreements. Moreover, given performance information, endogenous variations in entitlements influence bargaining, suggesting an independent role of subjective entitlements.

Economic pressures drive managers to innovate across {{a range of}} possibilities, from outsourcing and union busting to work reorganization and labor-management partnership.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper briefly {{examines}} the merits of neo-classical arguments regarding the causes of the recent upsurge in Greek unemployment. It shows that the view according to which high unemployment in Greece is caused by high wages rests on a weak empirical foundation. Moreover, by examining features of the Greek labour market (especially the large and eminently ‘flexible ’ informal sector) it suggests that the experience of Greece casts doubt on the view that labour-market flexibility can serve as a cure to unemployment. The second, and major part, examines trade union decline. Unlike the situation in most European countries, rising unemployment has not affected the mobilizing capacity of the Greek labour movement. More than a century after its emergence, however, this movement has yet to overcome its historically embedded low trade-union density. This does not prevent the outbreak of militant strikes, but hampers their effectiveness. In recent years union leaders have attempted to address this problem by trying to curb the movement’s traditional penchant for confrontational action, in favour of a co-operative model of industrial relations. In the background of a weak and retrenching welfare state, however, this has led to <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> which, instead of improving, has further worsened the problem of declining union credibility and density. The paper ends with some tentative suggestions on how to reverse this process...|$|E

They challenged the basic characters of the labor {{relations in the}} North American automobile industry but could not change them. Since 1979, however, the North American automobile industry has experienced the drastic changes of the labor relations. The Japanese transplants and lean production system have affected it. First, they brought the workers participating system or the employee involvement system including the QC circle and the team concept. Second, the increase of the Japanese car sales made the UAW negotiate the <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> that deviated from the pattern bargaining. Third, they weakened the job control unionism. Finally, they did away with the detailed work rule and {{made it difficult to}} file the grievances...|$|E
30|$|In Southern Europe the {{hierarchical}} layering of agreements {{based on the}} favourability principle has usually found strict legal application (Sciarra 2006). However, under heavy international pressure, recent legal changes have opened Pandora’s box. In Italy lowering sectorally agreed pay norms had been possible from 2001 in some ‘underdeveloped’ regions with high unemployment {{if there is a}} tripartite employment pact. The tripartite national pact of 2009, without approval of the largest union confederation, conceded the possibility to suspend the sectoral wage increase in firms that had fallen on hard times. In 2010 Fiat tested the pact by a round of <b>concession</b> <b>bargaining</b> including radical changes in working practices and dismissal protection in two of its plants, on threat of closure and relocation. Workers voted in favour in ballots organized by the company and the two plants were removed from the sector agreement. Soon after Fiat withdrew from the sector agreement. In June 2011 a new central agreement, with the signature of all three union confederations, stipulated that enterprise agreements can introduce temporary and experimental modifications of provisions in sector agreements within established limits and with approval by a majority of union delegates at the local level. These new rules have been applied in a few industry agreements since. When in August 2011 the government introduced, under pressure of the ECB, a decree-law with the possibility of derogation, by collective agreement, from legally-established dismissal protection guarantees, the main employers’ confederation could only rescue the central agreement it had just signed by promising not to use the new law. This has prompted Fiat to leave the confederation.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2012, Lawrence Watkins Jr. was {{selected}} {{to serve as the}} Districts Interim Superintendent. Watkins was a longtime Flint School District employee. He graduated from Flint Central High School in 1971 and then graduated from Hillsdale College on a football scholarship in 1975. He's worked for the district, in some capacity, [...] "since I was 14 years of age," [...] he has said. He was a locker room attendant in high school. After college, Watkins became varsity wrestling coach at Central High. In 1986, he became staff assistant for the district's office of pupil personnel services. He held several other positions in the administration office before retiring as director of pupil personnel services in 2012. He also served as director of school safety and security. Larry Watkins helped the Flint School District usher in a comprehensive educational plan, negotiate <b>concessions</b> from <b>bargaining</b> units and collaborate with community organizations to bring back the community education model that put Flint schools on the map. At the same time, Watkins saw Flint schools' deficit grow from $4 million to $21.9 million in a little over two years, thousands of students leave the district and numerous school buildings closed. On April 8, 2015, Mr. Watkins announced his retirement.|$|R
40|$|A two-persons {{bargaining}} problem often {{consists of}} initially incompatible demands {{that can be}} unilaterally reduced by sequential concessions. In a 2 × 2 × 2 – factorial design we distinguish between reliable and unreliable concessions, between a static and dynamic settings and between symmetric and asymmetric initial demands. Whereas reliable concessions change the threat point, unreliable concessions do not. In the dynamic setting each player’s concession can be conditional on the previous history of play; in the static setting a player’s <b>concessions</b> for all <b>bargaining</b> trials are determined {{at the beginning of}} the game. In all situations conflict is triggered if neither gives in, or if a maximum number of trials is reached without a feasible agreement. Although our results indicate that conflict is more likely if concessions are reliable, the overall efficiency of both institutions is similar...|$|R
2500|$|By December 1984, {{significant}} differences in the value of negotiated contracts, and divergent union objectives had {{set the stage for the}} creation of the CAW, a process documented in the Genie Award winning film, Final Offer. In 1984, the Canadian section of the UAW, under the leadership of Bob White and his assistants Buzz Hargrove and Bob Nickerson, broke from the UAW, led by Owen Bieber, because the American union was seen as giving away too much in the way of <b>concessions</b> during collective <b>bargaining.</b> Additionally, the UAW had been lobbying the U.S. Congress to force the transfer of auto production from Canada to the U.S. and the Canadian branch felt there was a lack of a representative voice during UAW's conventions. By [...] 1985 the split from the American union was complete and Bob White was acclaimed as the first President of the CAW. He served three terms as president..|$|R
