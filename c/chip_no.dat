When compared to their macrocounterparts, scaling down of electrochemical systems via a microelectrode array (μEA) is anticipated to make the sample size as well as concentration smaller and the electron transfer faster ([Wang et al. 2009]). Measurement of the concentration of species relies on the chemical phenomena that involve charge transfer (like redox reactions) from or to the electrode. The amount of charge transferred is a direct signal of the concentration of the species, and this can be measured as the charge itself (coulometry), as a current ([amperometry; Wang et al. 2009][; Quintino et al. 2005]), or as a voltage ([potentiometry; Wilson and Dewald 2001][; Mu&#x 00 F 1;oz and Palmero 2005]).|$|E
40|$|Dissecting {{the genetic}} basis of {{phenotypic}} variation in natural populations is a long-standing goal in evolutionary biology.

However, power of the 50 K SNP chip to detect large-effect loci was nearly 0. 8 in simulations with a small effective population size of 1500. These results suggest that reliably detecting large-effect trait loci in large natural populations will often require thousands of individuals and near complete sampling of the genome.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2015. Major: Health Services Research, Policy and Administration. Advisors: Roger Feldman, Jeffrey McCullough. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 120 pages. Plasma-Induced Damage (PID) {{has been an}} important reliability concern for equipment vendors and fabs in both traditional SiO 2 based and advanced high-k dielectric based processes. Plasma etching and ashing are extensively used in a typical CMOS back-end process. During the plasma steps, the metal interconnect, commonly referred to as an “antenna,” collects plasma charges and if the junction of the driver is too small to quickly discharge the node voltage, extra traps are generated in the gate dielectric of the receiver thereby worsening device reliability mechanisms such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB). The foremost challenge to an effective PID mitigation strategy is in the collection of massive TDDB or NBTI data within a short test time. In this dissertation, we have developed two array-based on-chip monitoring circuits for characterizing latent PID including (1) an array-based PID-induced TDDB characterization circuit and (2) a PID-induced BTI characterization circuit using the 65 nm CMOS process. As the research interest on analog circuit reliability is increasing recently, a few studies analyzed the impact of short-term Vth shift, not a permanent Vth shift, on a Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and revealed that even short-term Vth shifts in the order of 1 mV by short stress pulse (e. g., 1 μs) on the comparator input transistors may cause to degrade the resolution of the SAR ADC even for a fresh <b>chip</b> (<b>no</b> experimentally verified). In this dissertation, we quantified this effect through test-chip studies and propose two simple circuit approaches {{that can be used to}} mitigate short-term Vth instability issues in SAR ADCs. The proposed techniques were implemented in 10 -bit SAR ADC using the 65 nm CMOS process. Spintronic circuits and systems have several unique properties including inherent non-volatility that can be uniquely exploited for achievable functional capabilities not obtainable in conventional systems. Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) technology has matured to the point where commercial spin transfer torque MRAM (STT-MRAM) chips are currently being developed. This work aims at leveraging and complimenting on-going development efforts in MTJ technology for non-memory mixed-signal applications. In this dissertation, we developed two spintronics-based mixed-signal circuit designs: (1) an MTJ-based True Random Number Generator (TRNG) and (2) an MTJ-based ADC. The proposed TRNG and ADC have the potential to achieve a compact area, simpler design, and reliable operation as compared to their CMOS counterparts...|$|E
40|$|Recently, optical {{tweezers}} {{have been used}} for isolating and manipulating single cells in PDMS microwell arrays showing great potential for cell fusion, fertilization, and cell migration [1, 2]. However, a similar tool has not been developed for single magnetic particles seeded in a Teflon microwell array. The combination of magnetic particles and microwells allows the implementation of digital bioassays for detecting single protein or DNA molecules. This work describes the integration of {{optical tweezers}} (Fig. 1 A) with a digital microfluidic (DMF) chip bearing a Teflon microwell array (Fig. 1 B), to develop a platform for the manipulation of single magnetic particles, functionalized with biomolecules. To obtain this, a double-plated DMF device was used. The DMF top-plate was coated with a thick Teflon layer in which a microwell array was fabricated using a dry lift-off technique [3]. The fabrication process results in a hexagonal array of femtoliter-sized microwells. The microwells are 4. 5 μm in diameter and can accommodate only one magnetic particle (Fig. 1 B). Figure 1 A illustrates the optical tweezer setup used for manipulating single magnetic particles. The infrared laser was focused into an inverted microscope using a beam expansion telescope, beam steering lenses and a high numerical aperture objective. To achieve stable particle trapping, the light intensity gradient force must exceed the light scattering force. Once the focused laser beam was aimed on a particle in a microwell, the particle got attracted to the point of highest light intensity, which is right above the microwell plane. By changing the focus, the magnetic particle could be released in the above droplet (Fig. 2). Using electrowetting-on-dielectric method, the droplet was dragged off the array collecting released particles. It was demonstrated that particles could be retrieved from the microwells only in the presence of certain non-ionic surfactants, which prevent particles from adhering to both Teflon and glass. In order to find a relationship between bead surface properties and retrieval performance differently functionalized particles were tested. Beside the particle retrieval, also the transportation and positioning in other microwells were demonstrated. The following link gives access to a movie illustrating the mechanism of particle retrieval: ([URL] We have combined a microwell array on a DMF chip and optical tweezers technology to obtain a single magnetic particle manipulation tool. This tool shows great potential for bio-receptor screening, digital assays and aptamer selection. The technique also offers the possibility to combine single molecule detection with other on-chip methods (like sequencing), without removing the particles from the chip. [1] X. Wang, X. Gou, S.

40|$|In this dissertation, fluxless silver (Ag) -indium (In) {{binary system}} bonding and Ag {{solid-state}} bonding are used between different bonded pairs which have large {{thermal expansion coefficient}} (CTE) mismatch and flip-chip interconnect bonding application. In contrast to the conventional soldering process, fluxless bonding technique eliminates contamination and reliability problems caused by flux to fabricate high quality joints. Due to large CTE mismatch, high quality joints are important to manage the shear strain which develops in the bonded objects. Besides, the resulting Ag and Ag-In joints have relative high melting and operating temperature which can be utilized in high temperature packages. There are two section are reported. In the first section, the reactions of Ag-In binary system are presented. In the second section, the high melting temperature, thermal and electrical conductivity joint materials bonding by either Ag-In binary system bonding or solid-state bonding processes for different bonded pairs and flip-chip application are designed, developed, and reported. Our group have studied Ag-In system {{for several years and}} developed the bonding processes successfully. However, the detailed reactions of Ag and In were seldom studied. To design a proper bonding structure, it is necessary to understand the reaction between Ag and In. The systematic experiments were performed to investigate these reactions. A 40 um Ag layer was electroplated on copper (Cu) substrates, followed by indium layers of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 um, respectively. The samples were annealed at 180 °C in 0. 1 torr vacuum. For samples with In thickness less than 5 um, the joint compositions are Ag 2 In only (1 um) or AgIn 2, Ag 2 In, and Ag solid solution (Ag) after annealing. No indium is identified. For 10 and 15 um thick In samples, In covers almost over the entire sample surface after annealing. Later, an Ag layer was annealed at 450 °C for 3 hours to grow Ag grains, followed by plating 10 um In and annealing at 180 °C. By annealing Ag before plating In, more In is kept in the structure during annealing at 180 °C. Based on above results, for those designs with In thinner than 5 um, the Ag layer needs to be annealed, prior to In plating {{in order to make a}} successful bonding. In this section, we further studied the Ag-In bonding and solid-state bonding for different bonded pairs and flip-chip application. For the silicon (Si) and aluminum (Al) pair, Al has been used as the material for interconnect pads on the ICs. However, its high CTE (23 × 10 - 6 /°C) and non-solderable property limit its applications in electronic products. To overcome these problems, a fluxless Ag-In bonding was developed. Al was deposited Cr/Cu layer on the surface by E-beam evaporator to make it solderable. 15 um of Ag and 8 um of In were sequentially plated on the Al substrates and 15 um of Ag was on Si chips with Cr/Au coating layer. The bonding was performed at 180 °C in 0. 1 torr vacuum. The joint consists of Ag/(Ag) /Ag 2 In/(Ag) /Ag. The joint can achieve a solidus temperature of beyond 600 °C. From shear test results, the shear strengths far exceed the requirement in MIL-STD- 883 H. Al is not considered as a favorable substrate material because it is not solderable and has a high CTE. The new method presented in this thesis seems to have surmounted these two challenges. Since Ag 2 In is weak inside the joint in Ag-In system, an annealed process was used to convert the joints into Ag solid solution (Ag) to increase the joint strength and ductility. Two copper (Cu) substrates were bonded at 180 °C without flux. Bonding samples were annealed at 200 °C for 1, 000 hours (first design) and at 250 °C for 350 hours (second design), respectively. Scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis results indicate that the joint of the first design is an alloy of mostly (Ag) with micron-size Ag 2 In and Ag 3 In regions, and that of second design has converted to a single (Ag) phase. Shear test results show that the breaking forces far exceed the requirement in MIL-STD- 883 H. The joint solidus temperatures are 600 °C and 800 °C for the first and second designs, respectively. The research results have shown that high-strength and high temperature joints can be manufactured using fluxless low temperature processes with the Ag-In system and are valuable in developing high temperature package. For real applications, a serious concern is the long-term reliability of the joints under thermal stress caused by CTE mismatch between the chip and the package. Thereby, the reliability of Ag-In joints in thermal cycling (TC) environment is assessed. Si chips and Cu substrates were bonded at 180 °C without flux, and then annealed at 250 °C to convert the joint into an alloy of intermetallic grains and (Ag). Si-Cu pair is chosen because of the large CTE mismatch. Two TC tests were performed. 10 samples were examined from - 40 °C to 85 °C for 100 cycles first and - 40 °C to 200 °C for 5, 000 cycles later. Seven of ten samples survived beyond 5, 000 cycles. Based upon these results, the Ag-In joints not only have high melting temperature but also can survive harsh TC environment. To further investigate other alternative bonding method, the solid-state atomic bonding technique is introduced. High quality joints are crucial to bonding materials with CTE mismatch since shear stress develops in the bonded pair. Since stress concentrated at the voids in these joint, the breakage probability could increase. In addition, intermetallic compound (IMC) formation between the solder and under bump metallurgy (UBM) is essential for interconnect joint formation in the conventional soldering process. However, the interface between the IMC and solder is shown to be the weakest interface that tends to break first during thermal cycling and drop tests. Thus, we developed a solid-state bonding process along with ductile joint materials that no molten phase was included. Thus, the IMC and its related issues are eliminated. In the first bonding experiment, 10 um Ag layer with cavities were produced on the Si chips with Cr/Au coating layer and then bonded to the Cu substrates at 300 °C with 1, 000 psi (6. 9 MPa) static pressure in vacuum. Due to cavities, the bonding pressure can be reduced to 600 psi (4. 1 MPa). No underfill or flux is needed. From cross-section SEM images, Ag joints are well bonded between Si chips and Cu substrates. The shear test results show that bonding strengths pass the MIL-STD- 883 H, except one sample. It eliminates a concern from the bonding strength for practical applications. Due to the miniaturization of large-scale-integration of circuits on Si chip technology, the joint size and the pitch of the flip-chip joints have to be scaled down. As the joint shrinks, reliability issues and manufacturing difficulties emerge. One of these difficulties is elevated shear strain due to the increase of the intermetallic compound (IMC) layer ratio. Therefore, we demonstrated the Ag flip-chip interconnect process using solid-state bonding at 250 °C with a static pressure 800 psi in vacuum. Each Si chip has an array of 50 × 50 × 13 Ag flip-chip joints with 20 um in pitch and 10 um joint in diameter on Si <b>chip.</b> <b>No</b> flux or underfill is needed. The cross-section SEM image shows that the Ag flip-chip joints were well bonded to the Cu substrate without cracks. Despite a large CTE mismatch between Si and Cu, no joint breakage is observed. The ductile Ag joint well manage the stress induced by significant CTE mismatch. The melting temperature of joints is 962 °C. Thus, high operating temperature device such as 200 - 450 °C becomes possible. To further evaluate this, a pull-off-test was performed. The breaking force was 1. 5 times larger than the MIL-STD- 883 H criterion. There are several advantages to this solid-state Ag flip-chip bonding technology: high electrical and thermal conductivities, no IMCs and their related issues, a complete lack of flux, high ductility for managing CTE mismatch between chips and packages, high operating temperature, and possibility for a high aspect ratio of the interconnect. To figure out the stress-strain of Ag and (Ag) at room temperature and elevated temperature, a typical ingot with 9. 5 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length was fabricated. The main ingots were machined into ASTM tensile test samples by EDM. The stress-strain curves of Ag were measured at room temperature, at 221 °C (Th = 0. 4), and at 350 °C (Th = 0. 5), respectively, where Th is the homologous temperature. For Ag ingot, at room temperature, the yield strength (YS) ranges from 51 to 106 MPa and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is from 138 to 208 MPa which are comparable with the published data but the elongation (0. 27 - 0. 49) is about twice of the published value. At higher temperatures, the YS and UTS decrease but elongation varies little. Silver solid solution with 20 at. % In ((Ag) -In 20) samples were also measured at room temperature, at 156 °C (Th = 0. 4), and at 265 °C (Th = 0. 5), respectively. (Ag) -In 20 test samples have better results than pure Ag test sample. The YS is 14 MPa which is smaller than pure Ag test sample but UTS (308 MPa) and elongation (0. 73) are 1. 5 times of pure Ag sample...|$|E

Wire-speed data forwarding and encryption are processed in fast path, while local data and protocol data which are non-real time tasks are processed in slow path, in which IPsec security policy (SP) and security association (SA) are also transferred.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the design of an external multiplication package which can be utilized as an I/O device with a PDP- 8 /L computer. The multiplier and multiplicand are assumed to be 12 bit integers. The 24 bit product can be transferred back to the accumulator of computer 12 bits at a time. The control pulses for the operation are supplied by the computer through I/O transfer instructions. The multiplication package was constructed on three printed-circuit cards, using only standard TTL IC <b>chips.</b> <b>No</b> other components were needed. It is simple, inexpensive and much faster than the method of repeated addition which must ordinarily be used in the PDP- 8. This paper also shows a division algorithm using the multiplier and trial-and-error. This method of division is faster than repeated subtraction...|$|R
