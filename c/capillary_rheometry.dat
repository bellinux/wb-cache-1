40|$|A {{filament}} stretching extensional rheometer and capillary breakup extensional rheometer {{are used}} to measure the extensional rheology of a series of wormlike micelle solutions experiencing a uniaxial elongational flow. The experiments are performed using a series of wormlike micelle solutions of both cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium salicylate (NaSal) in an aqueous sodium chloride solution and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and NaSal in de-ionized water. The linear viscoelasticity of all the wormlike micelle solutions is well described by a Maxwell model with just one or two relaxation times while the steady shear measurements all demonstrate characteristics of shear banding at large shear rates. In transient homogeneous uniaxial extension imposed by a filament stretching rheometer, each of the wormlike micelle solutions demonstrate significant strain hardening. At large extension rates, the wormlike micelle solution filaments are all found to fail through a dramatic rupture near the axial midplane at a constant stress independent of imposed extension rate. The result is an extensional viscosity that decays linearly with increasing extension rate. This filament failure likely stems from the local scission of individual wormlike micelle chains. For the more concentrated solutions, as the imposed extension rate is reduced, a critical extension rate is found below which the filament does not rupture, but instead elastocapillary pinch off is recovered and the elastic tensile stresses achieved in the fluid filament grow far beyond the value observed at rupture. This dramatic upturn in the elastic tensile stress and the extensional viscosity at low extension rates is not intuitively expected and is most likely a result of structural changes to the entangled wormlike micelle solution. Strain hardening is also observed in <b>capillary</b> breakup <b>rheometry</b> experiments, however, when the results of filament stretching and <b>capillary</b> breakup <b>rheometry</b> measurements at nominally the same extension rate are superimposed, the results do not agree; the extensional viscosity measurements from filament stretching are in some instances more than an order of magnitude larger.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{determine}} the overall energy balance of neat PLA processing in a batch mixer was proposed. Energy consumption calculations rely upon shear rate and viscosity calculations using a double-Couette approximation. In the case of PLA mixing, {{it was found that}} the energy consumption is increased with an increasing rotor speed and decreased with an increasing temperature. During the melting phase the energy consumption is not strongly affected by the process parameters and the energy efficiency is close to 1. During the mixing phase, for a given viscosity, the energy efficiency is increased with increasing rotor speed or temperature and a method to optimise the process parameters to obtain a low viscosity with limited degradation and high energy efficiency was proposed. Moreover a comparison is given between the double-Couette approximation and conventional <b>rheometry</b> (rotational and <b>capillary).</b> Conventional <b>rheometry</b> translates into an overestimation of the viscosity especially at low temperature.

This study aimed to increase the emulsification resistance of silicone oil 1, 000 {{to be at least}} as resistant as silicone oil 5, 000 while maintaining the shear viscosity < 5, 000 mPa/s to aid injection and removal. Methods: High-molecular-weight (423 kDa) poly(dimethyl siloxane) was added to silicone oil 1, 000 at 5 % and 10 % w/w concentration. The shear and extensional viscosity of 1, 000 and 5, 000, a 50 : 50 mixture of 1, 000 and 5, 000 and 5 % and 10 % w/w additive blends, respectively, of silicone oil were measured using capillary breakup extensional, rotational shear, and <b>capillary</b> extrusion <b>rheometry.</b> In vitro emulsification was assessed qualitatively after agitation using Pluronic F 68 or a protein solution as the emulsion stabilizer. Results: The addition of high-molecular-weight polymer increased the extensional viscosity of the blends at high strain rates to levels equal to or greater than silicone oil 5, 000. In all cases, the shear viscosity of the blends was lower than that of silicone oil 5, 000. The additive blends were qualitatively as emulsification-resistant as silicone oil 5, 000. Conclusion: The addition of low concentrations of very-high-molecular-weight polymers of the same chemistry as the bulk oil has the potential to increase the emulsification resistance of the tamponade agents while maintaining ease of injection and removal.

This {{study is}} the second {{of a series of}} two papers on the {{rheological}} properties of VGCF/thermoplastic composites, its aim being to compare the performance of different thermoplastic matrices when reinforced with sub-micron Vapor Grown Carbon Fibers (VGCF). For this purpose, two polymers (polypropylene, PP, and polycarbonate, PC) were used to produce composites with different levels of fiber incorporation. The highest content VGCF composites were produced, in pellet form, using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. These were subsequently diluted during the injection molding stage to obtain composites with different levels of fiber content. The rheological characterization was performed, using the latter materials, by means of both <b>capillary</b> and rotational <b>rheometries,</b> results being presented and discussed in terms of reinforcing capability and its susceptibility to temperature, for the relevant functions in both shear (steady and oscillatory) and extensional flows. The results show that VGCF have a higher reinforcing capability, both rheological and mechanical, when incorporated in the PP matrix. This better performance can be due either to better adhesion between the fibers and PP in comparison to PC, or to a higher degree of melt penetration of non-wetted fiber rich areas and lower fiber length degradation, owing to the lower viscosity of PP in the extrusion shear rate range...|$|R

However, the flow property profile of aqueous solutions of cellulose derivatives is not only depending on the chemical composition and substitution pattern, solvent, temperature and concentration {{but also on the}} molar mass and the particle size in solution. A correlation of these structure properties with the shear flow properties like the viscosity yield of a cellulose derivative can be obtained for each homologous derivative series of a specific degree of substitution via empirical relationships as the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada-relationship ([]-M- relationship), the  0 -[]-c relationship or the -[]-c and the N 1 -[]-c relationship for the elastic properties of a solution. The elastic response can also be captured via oscillatory agitation of a sample that yields the moduli and hence the network parameters of the cellulose derivative in solution.

In CaBER experiments, it has been theoretically predicted and experimentally verified that the filament radius R decreases exponentially with time (R ∝ exp(-t/ 3 λ)) when the elastic stresses in the filament are sufficiently high to balance the surface tension, enabling the determination of the extensional relaxation time λ. However, in this paper we demonstrate that, while the CaBER experiments exhibit a characteristic time scale of 3 λ (which has been utilized so far also for the evaluation of ROJER experiments), a different scaling seems to hold for jetting experiments in ROJER-type setups, independently of experimental and geometrical parameters. In this paper, we want to give an explanation for this apparent discrepancy, exploiting a novel jetting setup combined with high resolution high-speed imaging. The study of the filament breaking dynamics of model dilute weakly elastic polymer solutions, comparing both jetting and static capillary breakup, as well as theoretical considerations of the correct force balance governing the thinning dynamics, lead {{to a better understanding of}} the correct scaling laws and on how to correctly determine millisecond extensional relaxation times. status: publishe...|$|R

Bulk rheological properties identified an optimal Laponite concentration of 2 % with Pluronic L 62 ranging from 2. 5 % and 6. 5 %, due to the ease of flow for the dispersion. The Pluronic L 62 was observed to enhance the Laponite bulk rheological properties in solution. Additionally TGA showed a similar trend in thermal resistance to water with both addition of Laponite and Pluronic L 62. XRD demonstrated that 0. 25 % Pluronic intercalated into Laponite from dried 2 % Laponite films. XRD demonstrated that the Laponite matrix was saturated at 1 % Pluronic L 62.
