40|$|A {{practical}} {{control chart}} is introduce, <b>called</b> multivariate <b>Set-Up</b> Process Algorithm (m-SUPA), {{which can be}} used to signal when a process is statistically off-target. This control chart uses a traffic light system to provide simple information to an operator about how close a measured part is to its global target. The chart works with a simple rule set resulting in process adjustments at a calculated point, rather than relying on rule-of-thumb methods. A final consideration is calculating the size of process adjustment, when one control adjustment has multiple effects on different design features. Simple feedback controllers are suggested for calculating process adjustments, providing consistency to an action taken. Simulation results suggest that m-SUPA with adjustments based on this kind of controllers is able to steer the process to a desired performance region...|$|R
40|$|The Intelligent Network {{architecture}} {{is an extension}} of the existing telephone network architecture to provide centralised definition and control of services. This architecture allows enormous flexibility in introduction of new services, and allows customers to define and control their own services with a large degree of independence from network providers. This thesis is concerned with systematic modelling and analysis Intelligent Networks and Intelligent Network services. There is a significant body of prior art on queueing network modelling of the signalling networks and switching equipment which comprise Intelligent Networks. The first part of the dissertation defines a scheme for systematically translating intelligent network service definitions into parameters for such queueing network models. A representation syntax for services is defined for this purpose, and the steps required to translate a service to analysable form are defined with the aid of this syntax. The second part of the dissertation extends existing queueing network analysis techniques to obtain certain performance measures which are important in the analysis of Intelligent Networks, and which are lacking in previous work. In particular, the calculation of completion time distributions for entire <b>call</b> <b>set-ups,</b> as opposed delays at individual devices, is calculated. Telecommunications switches may use simple priority-based approaches to preserve throughput under congestion conditions. Such measures have previously been observed to cause oscillatory behaviour in voice switches, through a mechanism known as 2 ̆ 2 traffic synchronisation 2 ̆ 2. Similar behaviour is observed in a seemingly straight-forward model of a signalling network supporting Intelligent Network transactions. This is investigated fully in the third part of this thesis. Traffic synchronisation in Intelligent Networks leads to connection establishment delays significantly greater than those predicted by standard queueing analysis techniques. A n analysis technique quantifying these delays is developed and validated by comparison with simulations. The trade-off between prevention of traffic synchronisation at normal loads and preserving throughput at overloads is also considered. A congestion avoidance technique which prevents traffic synchronisation at little performance cost is described and analysed...|$|R

40|$|In {{traditional}} high-volume manufacturing applications, {{the timing}} of control adjustments to processes is based on parametric Statistical Process Control (SPC) methods, such as Shewhart X & R charts. In high-value, high-complexity and low-volume industries, where production runs are {{in the order of}} tens rather than thousands, traditional SPC approaches are not easily applicable. A manufactured component's complexity, with multiple critical features to monitor, increases the difficulty for a process operator to maintain all of them within their design tolerances. In response to this, this paper presents a framework of nonparametric SPC, <b>called</b> multivariate <b>Set-Up</b> Process Algorithm (mSUPA), for managing control adjustment when required. mSUPA uses a simple to interpret traffic light system for alerting process operators when an adjustment is required. mSUPA is underpinned by multivariate statistics and probability theory for validating a process set up.
