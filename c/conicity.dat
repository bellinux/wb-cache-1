5000|$|<b>Conicity</b> is a {{parameter}} {{based on}} lateral force behavior. It is the characteristic {{that describes the}} tire’s tendency to roll like a cone. This tendency affects the steering performance of the vehicle. [...] In order to determine <b>Conicity,</b> lateral force must be measured in both clockwise (LFCW) and counterclockwise direction (LFCCW). <b>Conicity</b> is calculated as one-half the difference of the values, {{keeping in mind that}} CW and CCW values have opposite signs. <b>Conicity</b> is an important parameter in production testing. In many high-performance cars, tires with equal <b>conicity</b> are mounted on left and right sides of the car in order that their <b>conicity</b> effects will cancel each other and generate a smoother ride performance, with little steering effect. This necessitates the tire maker measuring <b>conicity</b> and sorting tires into groups of like-values.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefit of}} linked wheels {{derives from the}} <b>conicity</b> of the wheel treads—the wheel treads are not cylindrical, but conical. On {{idealised}} straight track, a wheelset would run centrally, midway between the rails.|$|E
50|$|Radial run-out, Lateral run-out, <b>Conicity,</b> and Bulge {{measurements}} are also {{performed on the}} tire uniformity machine. There are several generations of measurement technologies in use. These include Contact Stylus, Capacitive Sensors, Fixed-Point Laser Sensors, and Sheet-of-Light Laser Sensors.|$|E
50|$|The tire {{is first}} centered, and the bead areas are {{lubricated}} to assure a smooth fitment to the measurement rims. The tire is indexed into the test station {{and placed on}} the lower chuck. The upper chuck lowers {{to make contact with}} the upper bead. The tire is inflated to the set point pressure. The load wheel advances to contact the tire and apply the set loading force. The spindle drive accelerates the tire to the test speed. Once speed, force, and pressure are stable, load cells measure the force exerted on the load wheel by the tire. The force signal is processed in analog circuitry, and then analyzed to extract the measurement parameters. Tires are marked according to various standards that may include RFV high point angle, side of positive <b>conicity,</b> and <b>conicity</b> magnitude.|$|E
50|$|The {{guidance}} system of practical railway vehicles {{relies on the}} steering effect of the <b>conicity</b> of the wheel treads on moderate curves (down to a radius of about 500 m, or about 1,500 feet). On sharper curves flange contact takes place, and the guiding effect of the flange relies on a vertical force (the vehicle weight).|$|E
50|$|Following {{the basic}} {{principle}} of the heckelphone, the piccolo heckelphone in F has an extremely wide bore with large tone holes. The angle of the instrument's <b>conicity</b> is quite wide (though not as wide {{as that of a}} saxophone), giving it a characteristically strong and powerful tone. The instrument is built in one section with a detachable bell, and has simple-system German fingering.|$|E

"Acoustically, the {{introduction}} of nodal vent holes, which need to be positioned relative to the total length of tubing, necessitates tuning slides (usually made from machine-drawn tubing), separate back bows, [...] "yards" [...] and mouth-pipes for different keys; meaning thicker walls, bows and variations in bore and <b>conicity</b> in the wrong places; needing compensation with a conical lead-pipe, which changes bell acoustics, and so on." ...|$|E
50|$|Radial and Lateral Force Variation can {{be reduced}} at the Tire Uniformity Machine via {{grinding}} operations. In the Center Grind operation, a grinder {{is applied to the}} tread center to remove rubber at the high point of RFV. On the top and bottom tread shoulder grinders are applied {{to reduce the size of}} the road contact area, or footprint, and the resulting force variation. Top and bottom grinders can be controlled independently to reduce <b>conicity</b> values. Grinders are also employed to correct excessive radial run-out.|$|E
50|$|Tire Uniformity {{refers to}} the dynamic {{mechanical}} properties of pneumatic tires as strictly defined {{by a set of}} measurement standards and test conditions accepted by global tire and car makers. These measurement standards include the parameters of radial force variation, lateral force variation, <b>conicity,</b> plysteer, radial run-out, lateral run-out, and sidewall bulge. Tire makers worldwide employ tire uniformity measurement as a way to identify poorly performing tires so they are not sold to the marketplace. Both tire and vehicle manufacturers seek to improve tire uniformity in order to improve vehicle ride comfort.|$|E
5000|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of the wagons was the problem, but the solution adopted was {{to reduce the}} permitted speed of the wagons to 45 mph, and to reduce the track gauge by one-eighth of an inch, to 4 ft 8⅜in (1432mm) for new installations of continuously welded track on concrete sleepers. Of course the long life cycle of the track meant that this conversion process would take 30 years or more to complete. However, {{the basis of the}} gauge narrowing was mistaken. The idea seems to have been to reduce the free space for lateral movement of the wagons, so that they would be [...] "contained" [...] to run in a straight line. In fact, railway vehicles are not contained by the flanges of the wheels except in very sharp curves, and in normal running the steering effect due to the <b>conicity</b> of the wheels is dominant. In reducing the track gauge, the effective <b>conicity</b> is increased - worsened - and the tendency of the wagons to yaw and roll was increased. Many derailments took place on relatively new continuously welded rail track, and often such a derailment destroyed about a mile of the new track, as the freight train might take that distance to stop; the concrete sleepers were not robust under a derailed wagon's wheels.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the strong}} interdependencies of vehicle and {{infrastructure}} parameters in high-speed rail technology, the G7 program first focused on the compatibility with other components like track, catenary, signalling, and train control. [...] Sub-projects dealt with bridge design, improved pantograph design, and catenary in tunnels. [...] Technologies used in high-speed line construction, including rails and catenary in tunnels, were adapted for use in conventional line upgrades, to enable the operation of KTX trains on such lines. [...] The program also dealt with problems discovered during the operation of KTX-I trains, including a snaking movement of the articulated train around a speed of 150 km/h in winter, which was addressed by increasing wheel <b>conicity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most train wheels have a semi-conical taper {{of about}} 1 in 20. The semi-conical shape helps steer the wheel set around curves, {{so that the}} wheel flanges do not {{come in contact with}} the rail sides. The rails {{generally}} slant inwards {{at the same rate as}} the wheel <b>conicity.</b> As the wheels approach a curve, they tend to continue in a straight path due to the inertia of the rail car. This inertia makes the wheel set to shift sideways as the track curves under it. Due to this fact, the effective diameter of the outer wheels needs to be greater than that of the inner ones. Since the wheels are joined rigidly by the axle, the outer wheels travel farther, then causing the train to naturally follow the curve. For more information on this process, see Hunting oscillation.|$|E

Methods. A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out. Ophthalmological examination including objective refraction, biometry, noncontact tonometry, and Scheimpflug imaging (Pentacam®, Oculus) was performed including automated measurement of iris <b>conicity.</b> 3708 phakic subjects, 144 subjects with bilateral and 39 subjects with unilateral pseudophakia were included. Multivariable analyses were carried out to determine independently associated systemic and ocular factors for iris <b>conicity</b> in phakic eyes. Results. Mean iris <b>conicity</b> was 8. 28 °[*]±[*] 3. 29 ° (right eyes). Statistical analysis revealed associations between steeper iris <b>conicity</b> and shallower anterior chamber depth, thicker human lens and higher corneal power in multivariable analysis, while older age was related to a flatter iris <b>conicity.</b> Refraction, axial length, central corneal thickness, pupil diameter, and intraocular pressure were not associated with iris <b>conicity.</b> Pseudophakia resulted in a 5. 82 ° flatter iris <b>conicity</b> than in the fellow phakic eyes.

MethodsA total of 116 selected subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging, 28 healthy volunteers, 29  patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and 59 patients with ischemic heart disease (26 with left ventricular aneurysm; 33 with no aneurysm). The apical <b>conicity</b> ratio was calculated as the ratio of left ventricular apical area over apical triangle. ResultsDiastolic apical <b>conicity</b> ratio of patients with left ventricular aneurysm was 1. 62  ± 0. 20 and systolic apical <b>conicity</b> ratio was 1. 78  ± 0. 43. After left ventricular reconstruction, the diastolic apical <b>conicity</b> ratio decreased to 1. 47  ± 0. 23 and the systolic ratio to 1. 51  ± 0. 21, which came close to the normal level, whereas other global indices remained. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, sphericity index and eccentricity index increased significantly without changes in the apical <b>conicity</b> ratio. Among patients with ischemic heart disease, the apical <b>conicity</b> ratio of the group with left ventricular aneurysm {{was significantly higher than}} that of the group without an aneurysm when the other indices between the 2 groups showed no statistically difference.

40|$|Wheelset is {{the basic}} {{component}} of a railway vehicle system. The wheel set has two wheels rigidly connected by an axle. There are mainly two non-constant values related to the wheelset {{that need to be}} estimated. They are the wheelset’s <b>conicity</b> and creep coefficients. <b>Conicity</b> (X) is a term related to the coning of the wheel tread and its value depends on the track and wheel profiles. For wheelset with profiled wheels, the <b>conicity</b> values is non-linear and depends on the relationship between the wheelset’s rolling radius difference and its lateral displacement Meanwhile, the creep coefficients (fit and fn) are related to the relative velocities of the wheel and the rail. This creep coefficient is non-linearly dependent on the normal force between the wheel and rail, and the value of this force is changing especially during curving. The values of the <b>conicity</b> and creep coefficients as well can be changed by other factors such as surface contamination, varying surface condition and railhead shapes. This project outlines the parameter estimator that can effectively estimate and track the time-varying <b>conicity</b> and creep coefficients. The performances of the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and Recursive Instrumental Variable (RIV) used to estimate the <b>conicity</b> and creep coefficients values are compared. Via simulations, it is shown that the <b>conicity</b> and creep coefficients estimation using RLS algorithm takes longer time to converge to the true values {{and at the same time}} contains large amount of bias and oscillation.

40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy and the cutoff {{point of the}} variables <b>conicity</b> index, waist to height ratio and fat percentage to detect urinary incontinence in physically active older women. Method A total of 152 women were analyzed. The instruments used were the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ [Area 4]) to check the level of physical activity, and the Diagnostic Form to obtain sociodemographic data and presence of urinary incontinence. To calculate the <b>conicity</b> index, waist to height ratio and fat percentage, body mass, height and waist circumference were measured. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used. Cutoff points, sensitivity (S) and specificity (SP) were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A 5 % significance level was adopted. Results The prevalence of urinary incontinence was of 32. 2 %. The cutoff point with better sensitivity and specificity for the <b>conicity</b> index was 1. 23 (S = 87. 8; SP = 35. 9); for the waist to height ratio, it was 0. 57 (S = 79. 6; SP = 45. 6); and for the fat percentage, it was 39. 71 (S = 89. 8; SP = 42. 7). The area under the ROC curve was 0. 666 for the <b>conicity</b> index, 0. 653 for the waist to height ratio, and 0. 660 for the fat percentage. Conclusions The cutoff points for the anthropometric measurements <b>conicity</b> index, waist to height ratio and fat percentage indicate that these measures {{can be used to}} predict urinary incontinence in physically active older women.

40|$|The worn wheel {{profiles}} {{generated by}} uni-directional wagon travel produce different profile shapes {{on the leading}} and trailing wheelsets of each bogie. In the case examined both leading and trailing wheels wear to profiles having greater effective wheel <b>conicity.</b> The leading worn wheels exhibit flange and tread wear and the worn profile has highly non-linear <b>conicity</b> having little vertical displacement over the middle range of lateral displacement. A large vertical displacement is still achieved by the worn leading wheel profile in the last section of the flangeway clearance. The worn trailing wheels have only tread wear with near linear effective <b>conicity</b> across the flangeway. The hunting instability performances of the vehicle with the uni-directional wheel wear profiles is shown {{to have a higher}} critical speed than new wheel profiles due to the mismatch of the leading and trailing wheel profiles. The leading wheels of the bogie hunt with a wavelength of 26 - 30 m whilst the trailing wheels hunt at a wavelength of 12 - 16 m. Because of the differing frequency responses in the front and rear wheelsets of each bogie, lateral instability is damped for the worn wheel profiles. The worn profiles’ curving performance is also improved due to increases in the total profile <b>conicity.</b> Individually the leading wheel worn profile with its non-linear <b>conicity</b> across the flangeway has lower critical speed than a new wheel profile, the non-linear shape leading to chaotic lateral instability. The trailing wheel profile with its highly linear <b>conicity</b> across the middle of the flangeway has classic sinusoidal hunting at a much reduced critical speed and much reduced wavelength. The worn wheel profiles by themselves for both leading wheel and trailing wheel are found to have critical speeds 80 % of the new wheel profile critical speed. In combination as found in a wagon operating in one direction, the leading and trailing wheel profiles produce a critical hunting speed 125 % of the new wheel profiles’ critical hunting speed...|$|E

Three different single-hole nozzles were used: (1) nozzle N 1 - outlet diameter 140 µm with k-factor 0; (2) nozzle N 2 - outlet diameter 140 µm with k-factor 2; (3) nozzle N 3 - outlet diame-ter 136 µm with k-factor 2. Two constant gas densities of 15 kg/m 3 and 30 kg/m 3 were maintained under non-evaporating (ambient temperature 40 ºC) and evaporating (ambient temperature 400 ºC) conditions. The range of injection pressure was from 800 bar to 1600 bar. Liquid phase spray penetration and local spray cone angle along the spray profile were measured based on high speed shadowgraph images.

The study included 736 women (≥ 18 years). Anthropometric variables (weight, height, waist circumference) were collected for the determination of body mass index, waist-height ratio, and <b>conicity</b> index. Body image perception was evaluated using a nine-body silhouette scale. The prevalence of body image dissatisfaction was 73 % (dissatisfaction due to excess weight = 67. 4 %; dissatisfaction due to thinness = 5. 6 %). Overweight women (PR= 1. 34; 95 %CI= 1. 23 - 2. 49, p< 0. 001) and women with an inadequate <b>conicity</b> index (PR= 1. 12; 95 %CI = 1. 02 - 1. 24, p= 0. 016) presented a higher prevalence of body image dissatisfaction. The prevalence of body image dissatisfaction is high and the proportion of inadequate anthropometric indicators requires attention. Moreover, body dissatisfaction was more prevalent among overweight women and women with an inadequate <b>conicity</b> index.

40|$|Background: A central fat {{pattern has}} adverse health implica-tions in both {{children}} and adults. Because adiposity tracks from childhood into adulthood, the ability of simple anthropometric techniques to correctly measure truncal adiposity in childhood needs to be assessed. Objectives: We sought to assess the validity of waist circumfer-ence, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and the <b>conicity</b> index as indi-cators of trunk fat mass in children and adolescents. Design: Trunk fat mass (kg) was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 278 girls and 302 boys aged 3 – 19 y. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUCs) for the ROCs were calculated to compare the relative abilities of the anthropometric measures to correctly identify children with high trunk fat mass (z score for our study population of ≥ 1). Results: The 80 th percentile for waist circumference correctly identified 89 % of girls and 87 % of boys with high trunk fat mass (sensitivity) and 94 % of girls and 92 % of boys with low trunk fat mass (specificity). Waist circumference performed significantly better as an index of trunk fat mass than did WHR or the <b>conicity</b> index, {{as shown by the}} AUCs in girls and boys, respectively: waist circumference AUCs = 0. 97 and 0. 97, <b>conicity</b> index AUCs = 0. 80 and 0. 81, and WHR AUCs = 0. 73 and 0. 71.

40|$|Introduction. Current {{clinical}} practice requires simple and available tools for cardiovascular risk assessment in diabetic patients. Material and methods. This study included 290 type 2 diabetics of both sexes. The following anthropometric parameters were measured: body mass index, waist circumference, sagital abdominal diameter, while ensuing parameters included: waist-to-stature ratio(WSH), ratio of abdominal sagital diameter to height (SADE), and <b>conicity</b> index. Metabolic status was evaluated based on lipidograms and HbAlc, and of cardiovascular parameters {{blood pressure was}} measured. Results. Female patients were obese, with central accumulation of fat, elevated blood pressure and lipid disorders such as hypo-HDL cholesterolemia. The applied anthropometric parameters and indicators ensuing from them (WSH, SADH and <b>conicity</b> index), are reliable indicators of elevated blood pressure in diabetic patients. Conclusion.
