5|$|Although {{selenium}} is {{an essential}} trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis. This 400µg Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (<b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shale)</b> have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded.|$|E

40|$|Studies on the {{initiation}} and propagation of mine fires have dealt almost exclusively with coal. It has been {{assumed that the}} self-heating potential of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shales</b> and coal wastes is relatively low. However, in abandoned coal mines and waste banks, initiation and propagation of fires may be strongly dependent on the self-heating tendency of these materials. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the self-heating probability of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shales</b> and coal wastes to that of coals. This study utilized a modified differential thermal analysis method, in which the combustion furnace temperature was the reference to which the sample temperature was compared. Based on the distribution of the maximum temperature differential and the sample heating rate, a self-heating probability value (SHPV) was calculated that corresponded to observed self-heating behavior. In this study, several of the <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shales</b> and one coal waste had relatively high SHPV. The SHPV did not correspond directly to heating values or to differences in sulfur concentration...|$|R

2500|$|Geologically, the Milk River Natural Area {{is part of}} the Oldman and Foremost Formations, {{consisting}} of sandstone, siltstone, and <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shale,</b> with isolated occurrences of igneous Sweetgrass Hills intrusives. The most prominent feature of the natural area is the Milk River Canyon. At up to 1,500 meters wide and 150 meters deep, it is the deepest in the Canadian plains. One of only five exposed igneous dikes in the Canadian plains, nicknamed the [...] "Rooster Comb" [...] for its distinctive size and shape, lies in the natural area. The Milk River itself is the only river in Alberta that flows to the Gulf of Mexico, joining the Missouri River near Nashua, Montana. Throughout the region lie a multitude of Cretaceous-era dinosaur fossils, as well as many archaeological sites, a legacy of the Blackfoot indigenous people who hunted, gathered, and camped in the area prior to European contact.

60|$|The {{sedimentary}} strata {{alternating with}} the lavas {{on the crest}} and western side, are of an almost infinitely varying nature; but {{a large proportion of}} them closely resemble those already described on the eastern flank: there are white and brown, indurated, easily fusible tuffs,--some passing into pale blue and green semi-porcellanic rocks,--others into brownish and purplish sandstones and gritstones, often including grains of quartz,-- others into mudstone containing broken crystals and particles of rock, and occasionally single large pebbles. There was one stratum of a bright red, coarse, volcanic gritstone; another of conglomerate; another of a black, indurated, <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shale</b> marked with imperfect vegetable impressions; this latter bed, which was thin, rested on a submarine lava, and followed all the considerable inequalities of its upper surface. Mr. Miers states that coal has been found in this range. Lastly, there was a bed (like No. 10 on the eastern flank) evidently of sedimentary origin, and remarkable from closely approaching in character to an imperfect pitchstone, and from including extremely thin layers of perfect pitchstone, as well as nodules and irregular fragments (but not resembling extraneous fragments) of this same rock arranged in horizontal lines: I conceive that this bed, which is only a few feet in thickness, must have assumed its present state through metamorphic and concretionary action. Most of these sedimentary strata are much indurated, and no doubt have been partially metamorphosed: many of them are extraordinarily heavy and compact; others have agate and crystalline carbonate of lime disseminated throughout them. Some of the beds exhibit a singular concretionary arrangement, with the curves determined by the lines of fissure. There are many veins of agate and calcareous spar, and innumerable ones of iron and other metals, which have blackened and curiously affected the strata to considerable distances on both sides.|$|E

6000|$|... "(3) The microscopical {{structure}} and chemical {{composition of the}} beds of cannel coal and earthy bitumen, and of the more highly bituminous and <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shale,</b> show them to have been {{of the nature of}} the fine vegetable mud which accumulates in the ponds and shallow lakes of modern swamps. When such tine vegetable sediment is mixed, as is often the case, with clay, it becomes similar to the bituminous limestone and calcareo- bituminous shales of the coal-measures. (4) A few of the under-clays, which support beds of coal, are {{of the nature of the}} vegetable mud above referred to; but the greater part are argillo-arenaceous in composition, with little vegetable matter, and bleached by the drainage from them of water containing the products of vegetable decay. They are, in short, loamy or clay soils, and must have been sufficiently above water to admit of drainage. The absence of sulphurets, and the occurrence of carbonate of iron in connection with them, prove that, when they existed as soils, rain-water, and not sea-water, percolated them. (5) The coal and the fossil forests present many evidences of subaërial conditions. Most of the erect and prostrate trees had become hollow shells of bark before they were finally embedded, and their wood had broken into cubical pieces of mineral charcoal. Land-snails and galley-worms (Xylobius) crept into them, and they became dens, or traps, for reptiles. Large quantities of mineral charcoal occur on the surface of all the large beds of coal. None of these appearances could have been produced by subaqueous action. (6) Though the roots of the Sigillaria bear more resemblance to the rhizomes of certain aquatic plants; yet, structurally, they are absolutely identical with the roots of Cycads, which the stems also resemble. Further, the Sigillarioe grew on the same soils which supported Conifers, Lepidodendra, Cordaites, and Ferns-plants which could not have grown in water. Again, with the exception perhaps of some Pinnularioe, and Asterophyllites, there is a remarkable absence from the coal measures of any form of properly aquatic vegetation. (7) The occurrence of marine, or brackish-water animals, in the roofs of coal- beds, or even in the coal itself, affords no evidence of subaqueous accumulation, since the same thing occurs in the case of modern submarine forests. For these and other reasons, some of which are more fully stated in the papers already referred to, while I admit that the areas of coal accumulation were frequently submerged, I must maintain that the true coal is a subaërial accumulation by vegetable growth on soils, wet and swampy it is true, but not submerged." ...|$|E

The process water requirements per unit of heaing value obtained for gasification of the <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shales</b> tended to be 5 to 15 percent higher than that for coal. Cooling water requirements were similarly higher due to the greater quantity of ask quenching water needed for the shales.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The Upper Cretaceous to Eocene Montgomery Creek Formation {{is exposed}} between the Klamath and Cascade Mountains in the {{vicinity}} of Big Bend and Montgomery Creek, northern California. The formation is divided into a northern and a southern section. The rocks consist of a basal conglomerate succeeded by feldspathic to lithic graywackes, conglomerates, <b>shales,</b> <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shales,</b> and minor lignites. The northern section is 3, 188 feet thick. Fining upward point bar deposits, abundant foreset- and cross-bedding, and thick flood-basin deposits indicate the northen section strata were deposited by meandering rivers. <b>Carbonaceous</b> <b>shales,</b> lignites and fossil leaves define the swamps that were present in the basins. The southern section is 4, 596 feet thick. Thick and laterally extensive sandstone bodies, numerous conglomerate interbeds, and abundant planar cross-bedding suggest that these strata were deposited by braided rivers. A few outcrops low in the section resemble the northern section strata, and are interpreted to be meandering river deposits. A progressive change in composition of the sandstones from the base {{to the top of the}} formation occurs in both the northern and southern sections. This reflects the change from metamorphic and plutonic source rocks of the Klamath Mountains to volcanic source rocks of the early Cascade Range. The southern section maintains a more lithic-rich composition, reflecting higher discharge rates and steeper gradients responsible for braided-river deposition. Paleocurrent readings from foreset bedding and imbricated pebbles indicate a north-to-south transport direction in most of both sections. Some westerly transport occurred high in the southern section. Eocene strata four miles north of the northern section reflect a meandering river depositional environment. These strata have a higher shale-to-sandstone ratio, larger proportions of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shales</b> and coal, and a different sandstone mineralogy than Eocene rocks to the south. Analysis revealed that the Montgomery Creek Formation <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>shales</b> and coal are sufficiently rich in organic carbon to be hydrocarbon source rocks.
