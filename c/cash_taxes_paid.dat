40|$|This study {{examines}} a {{setting in which}} a tax-reporting decision is delegated to a firm's tax manager. Using financial accounting measures of tax expense to evaluate the tax manager allows the firm to efficiently attain the level of tax avoidance it prefers, {{despite the fact that}} the consequences of the tax-reporting decision will occur in the future. The study also examines how well two accounting measures of tax aggressiveness - <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> and the unrecognized tax benefit - distinguish between conservative and aggressive firms...|$|E
30|$|It {{is unclear}} why the {{coefficient}} on StB is not significant when ETR is the dependent variable. This could be ascribed to different definitions and {{meanings of the}} respective effective tax rate. The ETR includes current tax expenses but also deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Thus, only with CurrETR and CashETR does it become apparent if companies undertake efforts to lower the current tax expense and <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> by deferring the latter to subsequent periods. Disclosing low current tax expenses and paying low taxes could attract the tax authorities’ attention (see Bozanic et al. 2014). Tax certified individual auditors seem {{to be associated with}} a reduced risk of such attention.|$|E
30|$|In this context, ETR {{represents}} {{the relationship between}} overall tax expense, including deferred taxes, and pre-tax earnings of the year. Thus, by taking into account provisions for deferred taxes that were simultaneously set aside, this rate disregards any effects that shift current tax expenses or tax payables to later accounting periods. In contrast to this, CurrETR depicts only the current tax expenses excluding deferred taxes, and CashETR indicates the relative size of <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> (Hanlon and Heitzman 2010). As in most cases of international double taxation the German tax system imposes the exemption method by following the worldwide approach to taxing foreign income, Germany-based multinationals can easily use the benefits of lower foreign tax rates (Spengel 2005). Consequently, profit shifting should not lead to excessively high deferred tax liabilities which could potentially bias tax rate measures.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{influence}} of corporate governance and quality of external auditor quality on tax management of the company. Independent variable used in this study are corporate governance which is measured by proxies of number of commissioner, percentage of independent commissioner, compensation of board of commissioner and board of directors while external auditor quality which is proxied by size of public accountant firm. Dependent variable is tax management which is measured by effective tax rate (ETR) The population used in this study consist of manufacture firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2009 - 2014.

50|$|Depending on {{the reason}} for the {{differences}} between profit before tax and taxable profit, the company may show a deferred tax or tax asset to account for future taxes. Depending on the circumstances and accounting standards, <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> in <b>cash</b> and <b>taxes</b> shown on the profit and loss statement may also differ.|$|R
30|$|Because <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> are not {{provided}} by individual financial statements according to German GAAP, ETRGAAP and CurrETRGAAP are the effective tax rates applicable for this setting. 16 I run the regression similar to Eq. (1) after running a similar entropy balancing like in Table  5. However, for doing so, I adjust both the entropy balancing and the regression equation for those numbers provided by individual financial statements according to German GAAP (entropy balancing not displayed to brevity’s sake). The respective results {{are given in}} Table  8, Panel B and show that the association of individual engagement partners with tax certification is even stronger for the parents’ individual financial statement. These {{results indicate that the}} association found between individual auditors and the reported level of corporate effective tax rates on the consolidated group level still holds for individual financial statements consistent with German GAAP.|$|E
40|$|We analyze survey {{responses}} from nearly 600 corporate tax executives to investigate firms' incentives and disincentives for tax planning. While many researchers hypothesize that reputational concerns affect {{the degree to}} which managers engage in tax planning, this hypothesis is difficult to test with archival data. Our survey allows us to investigate reputational influences and, indeed, we find that reputational concerns are important— 69 percent of executives rate reputation as important and the factor ranks second in order of importance among all factors explaining why firms do not adopt a potential tax planning strategy. We also find that financial accounting incentives play a role. For example, 84 percent of publicly traded firms respond that top management at their company cares at least as much about the GAAP ETR as they do about <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> and 57 percent of public firms say that increasing earnings per share is an important outcome from a tax planning strategy.

40|$|How {{prevalent}} is long-run {{corporate tax}} avoidance? Surprisingly, {{there appears to}} be no published academic work addressing this basic question. We define tax avoidance based on the ability to sustain a cash effective tax rate (the ratio of <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> to pretax income) below the statutory tax rate. It is important to note that avoiding taxes does not imply that a firm has done anything improper. There are numerous provisions in the tax code that allow or encourage firms to reduce their taxes. We investigate the extent to which firms are able to engage in corporate tax avoidance over periods as long as ten years. We find that 437 firms, comprising 22 percent of our sample, were able to sustain a cash effective tax rate of less than 20 percent over a ten year period. An initial examination of the characteristics of successful long-run tax avoiders shows that they are spread across industries but cluster somewhat in certain industries such as oil and gas extraction, insurance, and real estate. Other characteristics associated with long-run tax avoidance include having large firm size, being incorporated in a tax haven, having high ratios of property, plant and equipment to assets, being intangible intensive, and being highly levered...|$|E

40|$|Prior {{literature}} {{examines the}} determinants {{and consequences of}} tax avoidance in relation to earnings. Extending this research {{to the role of}} cash in motivating corporate tax avoidance, I consider a firm 2 ̆ 7 s liquidity, as measured by the quick ratio and free cash flows, insufficient cash holdings, as estimated by a model developed by Opler et al. (1999) and expanded by Oler and Picconi (2010), and its performance, relative to the consensus analyst operating cash flow per share forecast, as potential determinants of tax avoidance. Dyreng et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (2008) cash effective tax rate is chosen as the tax avoidance metric of interest since it captures only avoidance that impacts the actual <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> and ultimately a firm 2 ̆ 7 s cash balance. In initial tests, I find tax avoidance is decreasing in liquidity and increasing in insufficient cash, in addition to evidence of an increase in tax avoidance for firms which meet or just beat the consensus cash flow forecast. After controlling for real activities-based earnings management, as measured following Roychowdhury (2006), results for liquidity are not robust for all measures, and insufficient cash is no longer significantly associated with the cash effective tax rate. These results highlight such controls as important considerations in future tax avoidance research. Finally, I find a decrease in the likelihood of more liquid firms entering into tax shelters based on the Lisowsky (2010) model. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains two}} separate {{essays on the}} implications of the complex financial reporting rules of stock option compensation outlined under ASC 718. The first essay examines the effect of the tax benefit from employees 2 ̆ 7 exercise of stock options on the cash effective tax rate. While not explicitly stated, many tax avoidance studies implicitly want to investigate tax avoidance that is the result of firms 2 ̆ 7 intentional choices. Although stock option exercise reduces firms 2 ̆ 7 tax burden, the firm does not control the timing of option exercise and the accompanying tax benefit. When the realized tax benefit deviates from the firm 2 ̆ 7 s expected cost, stock option exercise results in unanticipated changes in the <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>paid.</b> The cash effective tax rate (CASHETR), a common measure of tax avoidance, reflects both the anticipated and unanticipated cash tax savings from employees 2 ̆ 7 exercise of stock options. CASHETR 2 ̆ 7 s inclusion of unanticipated cash tax savings mismeasures intentional tax avoidance. Using both parametric and non-parametric analysis I show that the unanticipated tax benefit from employees 2 ̆ 7 stock option exercise can cause firms to be identified as more aggressive tax avoiders. I also show that, among other differences, firms with greater unanticipated tax benefits from employees 2 ̆ 7 exercise of stock options are more profitable, are less levered, have more extensive R 2 ̆ 6 D, and have larger market-to-book ratios. Because these firm characteristics are often used as controls in studies of tax avoidance, the relationship between them and CASHETR 2 ̆ 7 s mismeasurement of intentional tax avoidance creates an endogeneity problem for researchers and could lead to incorrect inferences. I use a research simulation to inform researchers of an implication of this endogeneity concern when CASHETR is used to measure firms 2 ̆ 7 intentional tax avoidance. I construct a hypothetical firm characteristic that is correlated to varying degrees with stock growth. This hypothetical firm characteristic represents a number of firm operating characteristics that could be variables of interest in studies of tax avoidance. Using a common model of tax avoidance, I test the null hypothesis that this hypothetical firm characteristic is not a determinant of tax avoidance. I show CASHETR 2 ̆ 7 s inclusion of the unanticipated tax benefits from employees 2 ̆ 7 exercise of stock options leads to inflated rejection rates of the null hypothesis and can change inferences about determinants of intentional tax avoidance. Tax avoidance researchers can avoid the problems caused by the unanticipated tax benefit from stock options in two ways. First, they can use the effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes (GAAPETR). Because the financial reporting rules prohibit firms from including the unanticipated tax benefit from stock options in the calculation of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s tax expense, the unanticipated tax benefit from stock options does not affect GAAPETR. Second, researchers can use the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options disclosed by firms to adjust CASHETR to remove these unanticipated cash tax savings (CASHETRWITHOUT). The second essay in this dissertation examines the difference between firms 2 ̆ 7 recognized and realized costs from stock option compensation. Under ASC 718 a firm recognizes the estimated value of stock options at their grant date as an expense for financial reporting purposes. This estimate often differs from the realized cost of the stock options, which consists of the cash proceeds forgone because the stock is issued to an option holder at a below-market exercise price. When ASC 718 was implemented, critics contended that these reporting rules allowed firms to avoid recognizing the full amount of wealth transferred from shareholders to employees. Consistent with this concern, I find that the realized cost of stock options exceeds the recognized cost of options for the median firm in my sample by 0. 99 million, or 1. 46 percent of pretax book income, in each year of my sample period. This translates into a wealth transfer from shareholders to employees in each year of my sample period of three cents per share in excess of recognized costs for the median firm. I also find that the realized cost from stock option compensation exceeds the recognized cost by 7. 8 million, or 4. 96 percent of pretax book income, in each year of my sample period for twenty-five percent of firms. The shareholders of these firms are transferring to employees 11. 58 cents per share in excess of the recognized cost of stock options in each year of the sample period. Overall, these results suggest that firms using stock option compensation generally avoid recognizing the full realized cost of stock options...|$|E

40|$|Corporate tax related {{empirical}} research often uses effective tax rates to investigate cross- sectional {{differences in the}} tax attributes of companies. Effective tax rates are often defined as (current or total) tax expense over financial accounting income before taxes, where the (current or total) tax expense is {{an estimate of the}} actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid.</b> This approximation of the actual tax payment by using tax expense is often used, as the actual tax payment and taxable income were or are proprietary information, thereby rendering it difficult if not impossible to use this information to calculate effective tax rates. Due to changes in financial accounting standards more information on the actual tax payment and taxable income is now generally available in US financial statements. This paper argues that the use of an effective tax rate measure utilizing tax expenses has some inherent dangers which are to a lesser extent the case in an effective tax rate using actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid.</b> Two inherent dangers of a tax expense based ETR measure are the quality of the tax expense measure as an estimation of the actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> and timing differences between tax expense and actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid.</b> The differences between tax expenses and actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> ETRs are researched in an empirical study as well as other proposed ETR measures.
