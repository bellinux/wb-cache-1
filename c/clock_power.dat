We employed bootstrapped nMOS switches to simplify the nRERL circuits. With the simula-tion results for a full adder, we confirmed that the nRERL circuit consumed substantially less energy than the other adiabatic logic circuits at low-speed operation. We evaluated a test chip implemented with 0. 8 - m CMOS technology, which included a chain of nRERL inverters integrated with a <b>clocked</b> <b>power</b> generator. The nRERL inverter chain of 2400 stages consumed the minimum energy at dd = 3 5 V at 55 kHz, where the adiabatic and leakage losses are about equal, which is only 4. 50 % of the dissipated energy of its corresponding CMOS circuit at dd = 0 9 V. In conclusion, nRERL is more suitable than the other adiabatic logic circuits for the applications {{that do not require}} high performance but low energy consumption.

5000|$|The Solid State {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{computers}} to use some solid-state components. However, much of the computer's logic was made out of magnetic amplifiers, not transistors. The decision to use magnetic amplifiers was made because the point-contact germanium transistors then available had highly variable characteristics and were not sufficiently reliable. The magnetic amplifiers were based on tiny (about 1/8" [...] ID) toroidal stainless steel spools wound with two or so layers of 1/32" [...] wide 4-79 moly-permalloy magnetic material to form magnetic cores. These cores had two windings of #60 copper wire surrounding the 4-79 molypermalloy. [...] The magnetic amplifiers required clock pulses of heavy current that could not be produced by the transistors of the day. The system used a clock derived from a timing band recorded on the main storage drum. This signal was read and amplified, processed and sent to the driver tubes, a pair of 6146 power pentode output tubes. The output from these tubes then fed the main <b>clock</b> <b>power</b> amplifier consisting of six 4CX250B metal/ceramic power tetrode tubes running in push-pull/parallel, yielding an output of a kilowatt. The powerful high-voltage signal was stepped down to a 36-volt, high-current clock by oil-filled transformers that were distributed about the machine. The SS80/90 computer could be heard quite clearly in the AM broadcast band at 707 kHz and 1414 kHz. The 4CX250B tetrodes used a grounded plate (anode) due to forced aircooling requirements. This tube is still in demand by amateur radio operators. The clock tube was enclosed in a shielding box that constrained both radio emissions and viewing by eyes of other than Univac's field engineers. The power supply output was -1.6 kV for cathode supply and -800 V screen grid supply at 1.8 A capacity. The supply weighed nearly 100 pounds and was mounted at the very top of the power supply stack. Thus the SS 80/90, for the heart of its operation, depended on the very technology it claimed to replace, a marketing tactic.|$|E

For each linear program, the sensitivities of clock path delay with respect to buffer widths are efficiently updated by applying time-domain analysis to the clock network in a divide-and-conquer fashion.

40|$|Abstract — Clock {{signals are}} {{responsible}} for a significant por-tion of dynamic power in FPGAs owing to their high toggle fre-quency and capacitance.

40|$|Abstract—Since the <b>clock</b> <b>power</b> {{consumption}} in today’s pro-cessors is considerably large, reducing the <b>clock</b> <b>power</b> consump-tion {{contributes to the}} reduction of the total power {{consumption in}} the processors. Recently, a gated flip-flop is proposed for reducing the <b>clock</b> <b>power</b> consumption of flip-flop circuits. The gated flip-flop employs a clock-gating circuit which cuts off an internal clock signal if the data stored in the flip-flop {{does not need to be}} updated. This reduces the clocking power consumption. However, the power dissipated in the clock-gating circuit is still large. For reducing the power dissipated in the clock-gating circuit, this paper proposes a technique for unifying the multiple clock-gating circuits, which reduces the overhead of the clock-gating circuit. Experimental results obtained using an RTL model of a commercial embedded processor demonstrate that our technique reduces the power consumption of register circuits in the processor by 44 % on an average and 53 % at the best case compared to the register circuits composed of the conventional gated flip-flops.

40|$|Losses due to gate-leakage-currents {{become more}} {{dominant}} in new technologies as gate leakage currents increase exponentially with decreasing gate oxide thickness. The most promising Adiabatic Logic (AL) families use a <b>clocked</b> <b>power</b> supply with four states. Hence, the full V DD voltage drops over an AL gate {{only for a}} quarter of the clock cycle, causing a full gate leakage only {{for a quarter of}} the clock period. The rising and falling ramps of the <b>clocked</b> <b>power</b> supply lead to an additional energy consumption by gate leakage. This energy is smaller than the fraction caused by the constant V DD drop, because the gate leakage exponentially depends on the voltage across the oxide. To obtain smaller energy consumption, Improved Adiabatic Logic (IAL) has been introduced. IAL swaps all n- and p-channel transistors. The logic blocks are built of p-channel devices which show gate tunneling currents significantly smaller than in n-channel devices. Using IAL instead of conventional AL allows an additional reduction of the energy consumption caused by gate leakage. Simulations based on a 90 nm CMOS process show a lowering in gate leakage energy consumption for AL by a factor of 1. 5 compared to static CMOS. For IAL the factor is up to 4.
