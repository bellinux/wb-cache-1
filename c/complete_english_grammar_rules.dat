40|$|Everyone commits errors when {{learning}} a second language. Even native speakers when they speak {{in their own}} language. Therefore, teachers and students in the teaching/learning process {{do not have to}} get surprised when they commit such errors. Everyday in the learning process learners are prone to make errors whenever they try to express new utterances. Teaching English to students in intermediate level is a challenge because everyone has different interests and needs so teachers should look for several ways of motivating them to get interested in the acquisition of the second language. Besides that, teachers {{have to take into account}} that in this level speaking errors are committed frequently since students have not had enough contact with the target language and some of them are still in the basic level. During the leaning process students commit different kinds of errors such as; omission, addition, ordering and selection. However, teachers have to be careful when correcting those errors without discouraging them. There are many correction techniques to correct those kinds of speaking errors, for instance; pointing, repeating, gesturing, cuing, and others that the teachers can use in an EFL classroom. On the other hand, teachers have to pay attention to the factors behind of speaking errors. These are causes why students in intermediate level commit speaking errors such as; interference with mother tongue, generalizing <b>English</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>rules</b> among others. Therefore, this research is presented with the purpose of giving readers some choices to be used while facing speaking errors in an EFL classroom made up of the intermediate English students. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how students, aged 13 - 15, {{with a mother}} tongue other than Swedish, experience learning English in school. This is important since there is {{an increasing number of}} bilinguals and multilinguals learning English in schools in Sweden and around the world. Several concepts are presented and discussed that have been argued to pose barriers to bilingual and multilingual language learning. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with ten students, aged between 13 and 15. The empirical material shows that bilingual and multilingual students usually refer to Swedish, even when their mother-tongue may be a better reference for learning English. This is because teachers commonly refer to Swedish <b>grammar</b> <b>rules</b> in attempting to clarify <b>English</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>rules</b> and the textbooks used to support the learning process are in Swedish. This may pose problems for the learning process, particularly for students who are not proficient in Swedish. The study also highlights the importance of diagnosing bilingual students' L 1 and L 2 on a regular basis to see when the optimum time is to be exposed to English language learning rather than the current approach of immersing them in English learning without considering the other language learning processes the student may be engaged in. The study also found that students commonly perceived their English to be proficient even though they had poor grades. One possible {{reason for this is that}} they manage well in their day-to-day engagement with computer games, films and social media while formal English learning, including aspects such as grammar and writing, require a different type of application. Finally, the thesis describes how important high metalinguistic awareness is for language learning and it is suggested that additional research focuses on how this conceptual understanding can be translated in practitioner tools useful for teachers. Schools need to create an environment that values and supports multilingual students’ language competence and an early national diagnostic test would help to support those conditions...|$|R

For this reason through this paper we seek {{an answer to the}} following question: What mainly lead our students to commit such number of errors when writing in English? And what measures should be taken to eliminate their occurrences again?. This presentation aims at spotting the light on those factors behind EFL students’ deficiencies in the writing skill and finding the way that help them write correctly and effectively. We relied mainly on:. 1. Observation made while correcting students’ exam papers, homework, research papers, and classroom production and the number of errors they commit. 2. Questionnaires addressed to around 25 teachers of the English Department Mohamed Khider University (full-time and part-time teachers) in addition to 60 students of different levels (10 students of each level L 1, L 2, L 3, M 1, M 2 and 4 th Classic) to collect information about their awareness of the writing skill importance, their motivation to write in English and the way they correct their errors. More than 60 % of the respondents from the teachers pointed out those EFL students are unaware {{of the importance of the}} writing skill, in addition to their poor level in writing. Over 50 % of the informants from the students link their weaknesses in writing to their lack of concentration while writing, and around 30 % of them stated that they have a lack in mastering <b>English</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>rules</b> and that they are unaware of the writing skill importance. students’ deficiencies in the writing skill are the result of their poor background knowledge in the target language and the lack of practice, and their low motivation to write in English.

50|$|Sign {{language}} {{is the most}} important instrument for communication between deaf people and the Deaf culture. Using sign language deaf people can join social networks, local and globally, which join the Deaf culture together. Sign Language is a loose term for people that are deaf or hard of hearing and use signs to communicate. American Sign Language (ASL) is most closely related to the older form of French Sign Language, as Laurent Clerc, who was deaf and a teacher, was brought to the America's by Thomas Hopkins Gaulladet. Though Clerc brought French Sign Language, there was already sign language being used. Martha's Vineyard had more than average deaf people who had created their own Sign Language. The French Sign Language and the Sign Language that was already in use, became American Sign Language. Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities are closely drawn together due to their culture and use of Sign Language. Sign language, like English, is always changing. If you learn Sign Language on the West coast and then travel to the East Coast, you will find a different dialect of ASL; although very similar, there are differences. In the United States you will find many dialects of Sign Language - from SEE sign (Signed Exact English), which follows <b>English</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>rules</b> when using modified ASL signs, to the Rochester Method, where every single word is finger spelled out in the English Language, generally without the use of signs. There is a grey area in between 'English' and 'ASL' known as Contact Variety (previously referred to as Pidgin Sign Language, or PSE), which uses any number of combinations of English word order/grammar combined with aspects of ASL (or SEE). You then have people that are not originally from the United States that move here and once they acclimate to ASL, what they sign becomes a mixture of ASL, SEE and their native countries' Sign Language, creating yet another dialect of Sign Language.|$|R

A research question was also posed to examine how learners rate the ARCS embedded CAL materials used in the learning of <b>English</b> <b>grammar.</b> Sixty randomly selected Form 1 secondary school students from SMK Bandar Tasik Puteri, Rawang. Selangor, participated in the study. The experimental group (n= 30) was exposed to the research treatments; while, the control group (n= 30) went through the learning via the traditional teaching using 'calk and talk' approach. The selected subjects were of the same English level competency. Two instruments were used to solicit students" <b>English</b> <b>grammar</b> performances and their responses towards CAL materials using the ARCS model. Paired Sample T-Tests analyzing variations between groups and pre-post tests were conducted. The analyses reported (a) a significant difference (p=. 001) between the performance of the experimental group students when compared to the control group students in the <b>English</b> <b>grammar</b> (tenses) posttest; (b) a significant difference (p=. 000) between the performance of the experimental group students before and after they underwent their learning experiences using CAL materials; (c) no significant difference (p=. 194) between the posttest performances of the experimental group students based on gender differences. Students' responses on ARCS components revealed mostly positive responses on all test items. The use of CAL materials in classroom activities has improved students' performances. Both genders benefit from using CAL materials in their learning experiences. The stereotype assumption about male dominance in technology is not visible in this study. CAL materials selected are those that can capture learners' attention, relevant to the learners' experiences, can increase learners' motivation and can give satisfaction to the learners. Finally, understanding students' learning motivation is essential as it determines the quality of the students' academic accomplishment.
