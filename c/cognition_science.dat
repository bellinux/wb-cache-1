It starts by exploring how humans specialization in producing knowledge ensures our success in dominating the environment but also changes fast our environment. So fast that it did not give time to natural selection to adapt our biology, causing it to be potentially maladapted in important dimensions. A main function of institutions is therefore to fill the gap between the demands of our relatively new environment and our biology, still adapted to our ancestral environment as hunter-gatherers. Moreover, institutions are built with the available elements, which include our instincts. A deeper understanding of both aspects, their adaptive function and this recruitment of ancestral instincts, will add greatly to our ability to manage institutions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cognitive Science {{appeared}} {{about 40}} years ago, {{subsequent to the}} challenge of the Artificial Intelligence, as common territory for several scientific disciplines such as: IT, mathematics, psychology, neurology, philosophy, sociology, and linguistics. The new born science was justified by the complexity of the problems related to the human knowledge on one hand, and on the other by the fact that none of the above mentioned sciences could explain alone the mental phenomena. Based on the data supplied by the experimental sciences such as psychology or neurology, models of the human mind operation are built in the <b>cognition</b> <b>science.</b> These models are implemented in computer programs and/or electronic circuits (specific to the artificial intelligence) – cognitive systems – whose competences and performances are compared to the human ones, leading to the psychology and neurology data reinterpretation, respectively to the construction of new models.

40|$|A fully {{developed}} nomology {{for the study}} of games requires the development of explanatory theoretical constructs associated with validating observational techniques. Drawing from <b>cognition</b> <b>sciences,</b> a framework is proposed based upon the integration of schema theory with attention theory. Cognitive task analysis provides a foundation for preliminary schema descriptions, which can then be elaborated according to more detailed models of cognitive and attentional processes. The resulting theory provides a rich explanatory framework for the cognitive processes underlying game play, as well as detailed hypotheses for the hierarchical structure of pleasures and rewards motivating players. Game engagement is accounted for as a process of schema selection or development, while immersion is explained in terms of schema execution. This framework is being developed not only to explain the substructures of game play, but also to provide schema models that may inform game design processes and provide detailed criteria for the design of patterns of game features for entertainment, pedagogical and therapeutic purposes...|$|R

Brain-like computer research and development have been growing rapidly in recent years. It is necessary to design large scale dynamical neural networks (more than 106 neurons) to simulate complex process of our brain. But such a kind of task {{is not easy to}} achieve only based on the analysis of partial differential equations, especially for those complex neu-ral models, e. g. Rose-Hindmarsh (RH) model. So in this paper, we develop a novel approach by combining fuzzy logi-cal designing with Proximal Support Vector Machine Classifiers (PSVM) learning in the designing of large scale neural networks. Particularly, our approach can effectively simplify the designing process, which is crucial for both <b>cognition</b> <b>science</b> and neural science. At last, we conduct our approach on an artificial neural system with more than 108 neurons for haze-free task, and the experimental results show that texture features extracted by fuzzy logic can effectively in-crease the texture information entropy and improve the effect of haze-removing in some degree...|$|E

About {{a third of the}} book is dedicated to the construction of a detailed, multi-facetted model of worldviews, based on philosophy, social psychology and <b>cognition</b> <b>science.</b> BERGER also describes and legitimates his choice of qualitative research in detail. A methodological innovation is the use of "incubation questionnaires" preceding the interview itself. The third section of the book informs the reader about the history of computer science, about computer science at school—especially in North Rhine Westphalia—, and about computer culture in everyday life. In the last section he presents empirical results based on interviews (N= 28) with computer science schoolteachers. This part concentrates on their habitualized worldview, especially in regard to the role computers play, their view on computer science and the various styles of teaching and thinking, which he classifies as either "creative" or "formal". Both the construction of a differentiated model of worldviews and the empirical results concerning the teaching of computer science in schools have value.

40|$|Finding typical {{instances}} is {{an effective}} approach to understand and analyze large data sets. In this paper, we apply the idea of typicality analysis from psychology and <b>cognition</b> <b>science</b> to database query answering, and study the novel problem of answering top-k typicality queries. We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answer questions like “Who are the top-k most typical NBA players?”, the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questions like “Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players?”, the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed. Computing the exact answer to a top-k typicality query requires quadratic time which is often too costly for online query answering on large databases. We develop a series of approximation methods for various situations. (1) The randomized tournament algorithm has linear complexity though it {{does not provide a}} theoretical guarantee {{on the quality of the}} answers. (2) The direct local typicality approximation using VP-trees provides an approximation quality guarantee. (3) A VP-tree can be exploited to index a large set of objects. Then, typicality queries can be answered efficiently with quality guarantees by a tournament method based on a Local Typicality Tree data structure. An extensive performance study using two real data sets and a series of synthetic data sets clearly show that top-k typicality queries are meaningful and our methods are practical...|$|E

30|$|The {{concept that}} cancer cells {{can have a}} {{significantly}} separate identify from their background cellular ecology of origin is not new. Others have even suggested that cancer cells are an expression of speciation [76, 96]. In typical Darwinian terms, the slow kinetics of carcinogenesis has been explained by the low probability of random chromosome re-assortment that could yield an aggressive proliferating phenotype. However, beyond any academic consideration of the accuracy of considering differing cancer cell lineages as separate species with all its attendant definitional problems, the issue can be more directly addressed by acknowledging that cancer represents a differing self-referential agency within any localized microenvironment. Its actions thereby extend beyond random occurrences. CBE proposes that cancer cells have a purposeful connection with their information space and access it according to their separable faculties in service to problem-solving within their context. This becomes a self-referential feedback loop whose effectiveness can be considered an example of recursive causality. This concept represents the idea that every biological effect on an organism feeds back to its own cause. Noting the continuing problem connecting genes and forms solely through adaptation and selection, and the variable impacts of epigenetic impacts and transcriptional regulation, Haslberger et al. [97] suggested that a framework of recursive causality would provide a robust link between molecular biology, <b>cognition</b> <b>science</b> and systems theory. Cancer becomes {{an example of the}} extent of that feedback to its roots and its unique linkage to its contemporary circumstances and its own information space.|$|E
40|$|Location based {{services}} (LBS) {{is one of}} {{the quickest}} developing technology in the past 20 years. But its QoS (quality of service) is one of critical issues and bottleneck handicapping further development and more application. The current LBS QoS problems include: data especially non-spatial data is out-of-data and/or error, data updating completely by special data provider cannot meet the increasing user demand; what the consumers paid for is not exactly what they wanted most; LBS service and system design are not ego centric but allocentric; and no valid alternative service or measures when network connection is unstable. This paper presents an innovative cell-based multi-level hierarchy data-service infrastructure which is composed of ubiquitous computing technique, GIS and <b>cognition</b> <b>science</b> can partly solve aforementioned problems. In the data-service infrastructure spatial and non-spatial are stored and indexed in cells in various granularity according to various granularity; data provider and individual provide heterogeneous spatial and non-spatial data through web services; data servers provide mobile client-end not allocentric but ego centric service based on context; there is some data replication being stored in mobile client-end, and when the client-end submits query to servers, the servers will check data version of ROI (Region of Interest) in database with the one stored in client-end. The mobile client-end will then decide whether download data package or not; the query result will be packed in one or more package(s) and the package(s) will be transferred sequentially according to their importance grade; the data flow between servers and mobile client-ends is bidirectional; data service consumers are data verifier, data evaluator and data provider too.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{contribute}} {{to a better understanding of}} the relation between organization theory and management practice. It is organized as a collection of two papers, a theoretical and conceptual contribution and an ethnographic study. The first paper is concerned with systematizing different literatures inside and outside the field of organization studies that deal with the theory-practice relation. After identifying a series of positions to the theory-practice debate and unfolding some of their implicit assumptions and limitations, a new position called entwinement is developed in order to overcome status quo through reconciliation and integration. Accordingly, the paper proposes to reconceptualize theory and practice as a circular iterative process of action and <b>cognition,</b> <b>science</b> and common-sense enacted in the real world both by organization scholars and practitioners according to purposes at hand. The second paper is the ethnographic study of an encounter between two groups of expert academics and practitioners occasioned by a one-year executive business master in an international business school. The research articulates a process view of the knowledge exchange between management academics and practitioners in particular and between individuals belonging to different communities of practice, in general, and emphasizes its dynamic, relational and transformative mechanisms. Findings show that when they are given the chance to interact, academics and practitioners set up local provisional relations that enable them to act as change intermediaries vis-a-vis each other’s worlds, without tying themselves irremediably to each other and to the scenarios they conjointly projected during the master’s experience. Finally, the study shows that provisional relations were accompanied by a recursive shift in knowledge modes. While interacting, academics passed from theory to practical theorizing, practitioners passed from an involved practical mode to a reflexive and quasi-theoretical one, and then, as exchanges proceeded, the other way around. ...|$|E
