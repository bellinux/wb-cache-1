In 2010, the Department of Finance launched consultations to investigate whether corporate taxation on a group basis should be reintroduced.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} tax-induced income shifting {{behavior among}} affiliated firms in Korean business groups (chaebols). Korean {{corporate income tax}} law does not require <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>returns,</b> and business groups {{with a large number}} of affiliated member firms have incentives to shift income across member firms to reduce the overall taxes of the group. For a large number of Korean companies that are subject to external audits, we perform univariate and multivariate regression analyses on the income shifting behavior of chaebol firms compared with non-chaebol control firms. Our evidence suggests that tax-motivated income shifting activities exist among chaebol firms, and that the extent of income shifting is found to depend on its effect on non-tax cost factors such as the earnings, leverage, and cash flow rights of the controlling shareholders. We also find that income shifting is more pronounced in chaebol firms where the control-cash flow divergence is relatively large, suggesting that income shifting is affected by the controlling shareholders' opportunism. Our study provides some insights on the intra-group income shifting activities where research is limited. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|E

40|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} between parent and subsidiary corporations often present particularly difficult issues to which state corporate law attempts to respond. This article addresses {{one of these}} issues: the appropriate allocation between a parent and its subsidiary of federal tax savings that arise when the two corporations file a <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>return.</b> <b>Tax</b> savings in this context arise because filing a consolidated return permits the corporations that join in the return to combine their income, deductions, credits, and other tax attributes and determine their federal tax liability largely {{as if they were}} divisions of a single corporation. For example, if a parent and subsidiary file a consolidated return, the subsidiary 2 ̆ 7 s deductions might completely offset the parent 2 ̆ 7 s income and eliminate the federal tax liability that the parent would have if it filed its own, separate <b>return.</b> The federal <b>tax</b> rules do not require a specific allocation of tax savings that a parent or subsidiary achieves; that issue is primarily the province of any agreement that the corporations enter into and of areas of law other than the federal tax laws, including state corporate law. The allocation issue is not a new one, but it is one that has proved especially difficult for the courts to resolve and that has arisen with increasing frequency in recent years, particularly in the bankruptcy context. Minority shareholders or creditors of a subsidiary have sought unsuccessfully in several cases to compel the parent either to share its tax savings or to restore to the subsidiary tax savings that the subsidiary was required to share with the parent. This lack of success exists because, despite the well-established rule that a parent corporation serves as a fiduciary of its subsidiary 2 ̆ 7 s minority shareholders and, in some circumstances, the subsidiary 2 ̆ 7 s creditors, the courts have developed what is tantamount to a per se rule that a parent has virtually unlimited discretion in allocating tax savings. In this article, the author demonstrates that the early judicial decisions primarily responsible for the development of this rule do not constitute an appropriate foundation {{for the construction of a}} normative rule. The author also discusses how the federal tax rules, despite their lack of a required allocation, reflect a policy directly contrary to the result of most recent judicial decisions. The author argues that allocations of tax savings between parent and subsidiary constitute self-dealing transactions that courts should review under an entire fairness standard and proposes an analytical framework under that standard designed to encourage the negotiation between parent and subsidiary of express tax-sharing agreements...|$|R
5000|$|Only {{entities}} {{organized in}} the United States and treated as corporations may file a <b>consolidated</b> Federal income <b>tax</b> <b>return.</b> [...] The return is filed by a “common parent” and only those subsidiaries in which the common parent owns 80% {{or more of the}} vote AND value.

Thereafter, all corporations that begin to meet the 80% vote and value test must join in the consolidated return. If a subsidiary ceases to meet the 80% vote and value test, it is removed from the group. Adjustments to basis and other tax attributes apply upon a subsidiary joining or leaving a group.|$|R
50|$|The top {{tax rate}} for {{individuals}} for tax year 1987 was lowered from 50% to 38.5%.

40|$|Annually, the U. S. {{government}} collects nearly $ 3 trillion {{of income}} and employment taxes. With respect to these collections, Form 1040 (U. S. Individual Income <b>Tax</b> <b>Return)</b> seeks to ensure taxpayer accuracy. Currently, two sets of players dominate the Form 1040 preparation and submission process: <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> preparers and <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> preparation software companies. The former guides taxpayers through the entire <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> preparation and submission process, and the latter provides taxpayers with the necessary tools to complete and submit <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> themselves. <b>Tax</b> <b>return</b> preparers and <b>tax</b> software companies thus stand as vital intermediaries {{between the government and}} taxpayers. Despite the key role that <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> submission plays in government function, Congress exercises virtually no oversight over the process. Currently, regardless of education, knowledge, or experience, any person can prepare <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> for compensation; similarly, almost no checks exist to ensure the substantive accuracy of <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> prepared with <b>tax</b> software. As a result of these shortcomings, taxpayers file millions of flawed <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> each year. Faulty returns shortchange the government of necessary revenue, deprive some taxpayers of crucial government benefits, and leave others liable for back taxes and penalties. This Article is the first to propose comprehensive <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> preparation process reform. It urges Congress to regulate both <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> preparers and <b>tax</b> preparation software companies. Adoption of {{one or more of the}} proposed reforms should lead to more accurate <b>tax</b> <b>returns,</b> protect taxpayers, and ensure a fairer and more efficient tax system...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> policies {{which have been}} implemented in Indonesia, after the introduction of self assessment system in 1984. Using a qualitative approach, the paper notes that the <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> policy swung from the equity perspective in 1984 to a more pragmatic policy in 1995. and finally it bounced back to the equity side in 2001. Furthermore, data reveals that the 2001 <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> policy, which obliges employee type individual taxpayers (EITs) to file <b>tax</b> <b>returns,</b> posted an obvious weakness from the effciency side. In the period of 2001 - 2010, the number of individual <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> increased significantly, but the individual tax revenues did not increase accordingly, {{and it was also}} marred by the occurrences of paradoxical situation in which number of <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> had negative relation with tax revenues.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For a {{considerable}} number of years, business income <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> attested by a certified public accountant (CPA) have enjoyed special tax incentives. There has, however, been no documentary evidence to justify the existing tax incentive policy. This study, which uses a Tobit model to undertake an analysis of business income <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> data, empirically demonstrates that CPA attested <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> are more compliant with the tax law than non-attested <b>tax</b> <b>returns.</b> This finding suggests that tax authorities should continue to promote the use of CPA attested <b>tax</b> <b>returns.</b> As well, this finding recommends the auditing of a greater proportion of non-attested returns {{in order to reduce the}} incidence of tax evasion...|$|R
