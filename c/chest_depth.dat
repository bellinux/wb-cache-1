However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, no previous study has reported the effects of this feedback on chest compressions in action. A randomized, parallel controlled study of 40 senior medical students was conducted to examine the effect of chest compression feedback via a smartwatch during cardiopulmonary resuscitation of manikins. A feedback application was developed for the smartwatch, in which visual feedback was provided for <b>chest</b> compression <b>depth</b> and rate. Vibrations from smartwatch were used to indicate the chest compression rate. The participants were randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups, and they performed chest compressions on manikins for 2 min continuously with or without feedback, respectively. The proportion of accurate <b>chest</b> compression <b>depth</b> (≥ 5 cm and ≤ 6 cm) was assessed as the primary outcome, and the <b>chest</b> compression <b>depth,</b> <b>chest</b> compression rate, and the proportion of complete chest decompression (≤ 1 cm of residual leaning) were recorded as secondary outcomes. The proportion of accurate <b>chest</b> compression <b>depth</b> in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group (64. 6 ± 7. 8 % versus 43. 1 ± 28. 3 %; p = 0. 02). The mean compression depth and rate and the proportion of complete chest decompressions did not differ significantly between the two groups (all p> 0. 05). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation-related feedback via a smartwatch could provide assistance with respect to the ideal range of <b>chest</b> compression <b>depth,</b> and this can easily be applied to patients with out-of-hospital arrest by rescuers who wear smartwatches...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the importance of the <b>depth</b> of <b>chest</b> compression in producing effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in animals, as indicated by cardiac output and mean arterial blood pressure. Cardiac output was measured by a modified indicator dilution technique in 8 anesthetized dogs, 6 to 12 kg body weight, during repeated 2 -minute episodes of electrically induced ventricular fibrillation and CPR provided by a mechanical chest compressor and ventilator (Thumper®). Chest compression exceeding a threshold value (x 0) between 1. 5 and 3. 0 cm was required in each animal to produce measurable cardiac output. In particular, cardiac output (CO) was linearly related to <b>chest</b> compression <b>depth</b> (x) by an expression of the form CO = a(x-x 0) for x 3 ̆e x 0, and CO = 0 for x £ x 0. The mean value of x 0 was 2. 3 cm. A similar threshold for measurable blood pressure was observed in 7 of the 8 dogs, with a mean value of 1. 8 cm. For chest compression of 2. 5 cm or greater, relatively modest increases in <b>chest</b> compression <b>depth</b> caused relatively large changes in cardiac output...|$|R
40|$|Objective. We {{investigated}} whether {{data collected}} using the Resusci Anne SkillReporter were comparable with those collected using the CPRmeter (cardiopulmonary resuscitation meter -an accelerometer feedback device {{used to provide}} high-quality chest compressions). Materials and Methods. Fifty continuous chest compressions were performed using a Resusci Anne SkillReporter and a CPRmeter under two conditions (Experiment 1 : complete chest wall recoil; Experiment 2 : incomplete chest wall recoil). The conditions were defined according to visual feedback signals provided by the CPRmeter. A single healthcare worker performed 20 repetitions under each experimental condition alternately. Chest compression data were collected and analyzed using the Laerdal PC SkillReporting System and QCPR Review software. Results. The mean difference in <b>chest</b> compression <b>depth</b> between the Resusci Anne SkillReporter and CPRmeter was 6. 7 ± 1. 2 mm in Experiment 1 (95 % CI: 6. 1 ~ 7. 3) and was significantly higher in Experiment 2 (17. 3 ± 1. 9 mm; 95 % CI: 16. 4 ~ 18. 2; p < 0. 001).

40|$|Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis {{tends to}} be {{complicated}} with spine and ribcage deformities. In addition to the coronal curvature, among the features of right thoracic scoliosis, flat chest, ribcage rotation, cardiac compression and an aortic left shift are also observed. Aorta is known to shift in a leftward direction, especially at the mid-thoracic level. The cause of aortic left shift in scoliosis is not known. To clarify the features of a scoliosis deformity, especially {{the relationship of the}} aortic left shift and the flat chest in scoliosis, we investigated the CT scan images of scoliosis patients. Methods : For the measurement of scoliosis patients, the pre-operative CT scans of 22 patients with non-congenital right thoracic scoliosis were recruited. For controls, 25 age-matched non-scoliosis patients were recruited. The aortic location, the ribcage rotation angle and <b>chest</b> <b>depth</b> were measured by CT scan. The <b>chest</b> <b>depth</b> was defined as the smallest inner chest cavity depth between the anterior vertebral body and the anterior inner chest wall. Results : <b>Chest</b> <b>depth</b> in scoliosis patients was found to be significantly narrower than the control group at every thoracic level, from T 6 to T 11. The aortic left shift was significantly larger in scoliosis patients at all measured levels. The <b>chest</b> <b>depth</b> correlated with an aortic leftward shift (r = 0. 49). The aortic location was found to be correlated with the ribcage rotation angle (r = - 0. 52), and the ribcage rotation angle correlated with the thoracic side curvature (r = 0. 61) Conclusions : In right thoracic scoliosis, an aortic left shift correlated with both flat chest and the ribcage rotation. 思春期特発性側弯症における脊椎及び体幹の変形は, 前額面での側弯のみでなくFlat chestや胸郭の回旋変形, そして大動脈の左方変位など複雑である. 側弯の原因を考える意味でも大動脈の左方変位が起こるメカニズムを明らかにすることは重要と考え, 特に胸郭回旋変形および胸郭前後径との関係について調べた. 方法 : 術前CTを撮影した 22 例の思春期特発性側弯症患者および対象群として健常人（他疾患スクリーニング目的CT撮影者） 25 例について計測を行った. 計測項目は, 大動脈の位置, 胸郭回旋角度, 胸郭前後径であり, それぞれCT画像上でT 6 からT 11 までの各レベルで計測し, それぞれの相関について調べた. 結果 : 側弯症患者ではT 6 からT 11 全てのレベルにおいて有意に胸郭前後径が減少していた. 大動脈の位置はT 6 からT 11 全てのレベルにおいて有意に後左方に変位していた. 各変数の関係を見ると, 胸郭前後径と大動脈左方変位に相関を認めた（r＝ 0. 49 ）. また大動脈左方変位と胸郭回旋角度の間（r＝ 0. 52 ）および胸郭回旋角度と側弯Cobb角の間（r＝ 0. 61 ）に相関を認めた. 考察 : 胸郭前後径が小さい個体では, 胸郭内臓器の収まるスペースが減少するため心臓及び大動脈は正中から左側に押し出され, 椎体は逆に右側に押され, その結果として胸郭の回旋および側弯が 起こっている可能性があると考えた...|$|E

QTL analysis was performed by genotyping 132 half-sib progeny of 5 Japanese Black sires using 108 microsatellite DNA markers. Genotyped data on progeny and their sires were combined in a multi-point approach to calculate Identity-By-Descent (IBD) probability coefficients of inheriting allele 1 or 2 from the sire at specific chromosomal locations. The phenotypic data on progeny were regressed on these IBD coefficients in a within-common-parent regression analysis. A linear model containing the fixed effects of sex, parity and season of birth as well as age as a covariate, was fitted to the IBD coefficients and phenotypic data.

Despite the American Heart Association (AHA) emphasis on quality CPR for over 10 years, resuscitation teams do not consistently meet recommended CPR standards. The objective is to assess the impact on <b>chest</b> compression <b>depth</b> of factors including bed height, step stool utilization, position of the rescuer’s arms and shoulders relative to the point of chest compression, and rescuer characteristics including height, weight, and gender. Methods: Fifty-six eligible subjects, including physician assistant students and first-year emergency medicine residents, were enrolled and randomized to intervention (bed lowered and step stool readily available) and control (bed raised and step stool accessible, but concealed) groups. We instructed all subjects to complete all interventions on a high-fidelity mannequin per AHA guidelines. Secondary end points included subject arm angle, height, weight group, and gender. Results: Using an intention to treat analysis, the mean compression depths for the intervention and control groups were not significantly different. Subjects positioning their arms at a 90 -degree angle relative to the sagittal plane of the mannequin’s chest achieved a mean compression depth significantly greater than those compressing at an angle less than 90 degrees. There was a significant correlation between using a step stool and achieving the correct shoulder position.

Vertical dimensions show weak correlations with fatness, while body frame circumferences and transverse dimensions are consistently, significantly, and substantially correlated with fatness, each explaining from 3 to 44 % of variation in skinfold thickness. Skeletal dimensions explain up to 50 % of variation in skinfold thickness (multiple regression). Especially high correlations with skinfold thickness occur for <b>chest</b> width, <b>depth,</b> and hip width (r range from 0. 42 to 0. 66). Body frame dimensions reflect largely trunk volume and the trunk/limb proportions. Larger lean trunk size is associated with greater fatness. Since the size of the abdominal cavity, and thus the gastrointestinal system (GI), is reflected in the trunk size, we speculate that larger frame may predispose to obesity in two ways: (1) larger stomachs require greater bulk of food to produce feeling of satiety as mediated through antral distension, (2) larger GIs may absorb more nutrients. Frame size may help to detect the risk of obesity among young adults. Maciej Henneberg and Stanley J. Ulijasze...|$|R

40|$|PECTUS excavatum, or funnel chest, {{is said to}} {{have been}} first {{described}} by Bauhinus toward the end of the sixteenth Century. 1 Anatomically this deformity begins immediately below the manubrium, the sternum sloping posteriorly until its maximal concavity is reached, generally at the junction of the sternal body and the xiphoid. The center of the depression may be in the center of the chest or slightly to the right or left of the midline. As the ribs curve back to meet the depressed sternum a hollow is formed in the front of the <b>chest,</b> its <b>depth</b> depending upon the amount of sternal depres-sion. This may be shallow or, in some instances, quite deep, the posterior sternum approaching the anterior surface of the vertebral column. The etiology of this disorder has been ascribed in recent years to dia-phragmatic muscle imbalance, 2 shortened central tendon of the diaphragm, 3 and overgrowth of the ribs. 4 Older theories, such as pressure of a body part on the sternum in utero, rickets, or the occupation of shoemaking, have largely been discarded. The role of trauma has been considered 5 but no...|$|R
40|$|Transrectal or transabdominal {{examinations}} of 13 pluriparous reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) by ultrasonography {{from the start}} of mating until week 20 of gestation were conducted to find out when pregnancy could first be detected and to describe fetal development in early pregnancy. The examinations (n = 35 per animal) were performed with a 5 MHz linear transducer from 7 th October until 1 st January and with a 3 MHz sector transducer from that time until 24 th February. Time of pregnancy diagnosis by ultrasonography, the first fetal heartbeat and measurements of crown-rump length, chest width and <b>chest</b> <b>depth</b> were recorded during the examinations. Pregnancy was diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography between the weeks 3 and 7 of gestation. The accuracy of the pregnancy diagnosis, defined as the proportion of females correctly detected to be pregnant, was 15 % at week 3, 46 % at week 4, 77 % at week 5, and 92 % at week 6 of gestation. Fetal heartbeat was first detected between the weeks 5 and 8 of gestation. The first measurements of crown-rump length were made on week 3 of gestation, of chest width on week 4 and of <b>chest</b> <b>depth</b> on week 5 of gestation. Chest width and depth were detectable {{until the end of the}} study at week 20 of gestation. Transrectal ultrasonography is an efficient tool in early pregnancy diagnosis of reindeer. The fetal growth curves obtained by ultrasonography resembled those obtained in previous morphological studies. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was done at}} 292 head of Japanese black bull at Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectural Experimental Stations Japan {{to find out the}} relationship between ultrasonic estimates of carcass traits and body measurements as one of criteria to select Japanese black bull. The carcass traits of 20 months of age were predicted using the ultrasonic machine. The body dimensions were measured at the end of performance test (12 months of age) and 16 months of age. The ultrasonic evaluation techniques were used to estimate Musculus Longissimus thoracis area between 6 – 7 th and 12 - 13 th ribs (MLTA 6 - 7 and MLTA 12 - 13), Subcutaneous Fat Thickness (SFT), Intermuscular Fat Thickness (IMFT), Rib Thickness (RT) and Marbling Score (MS). Body measurements were taken on body weight (BW), withers height (WH), hip height (HH), body length (BL), chest girth (CG), <b>chest</b> <b>depth</b> (CD), chest width (CW), rump length (RL), hip width (HW), thurl width (TW) and pin bone width (PBW). Chest girth, chest width and <b>chest</b> <b>depth</b> at 12 and 16 months of age were showed the highest significant and positive correlations among the other body dimensions with ultrasonic estimated of carcass traits at 20 months of age. The ratio of contribution to predict MLTA 6 - 7, MLTA 12 - 13 and SFT at 20 months of age using the body dimensions at 12 months of age were higher than those of 16 months of age. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|Approximated genetic {{correlations}} between direct longevity and type traits {{were computed for}} a sire Holstein population. Data were based on results for type traits (77, 965 records) and for direct longevity (74, 289 records) from the INTERBULL routine run of November 2005. Most of type traits presented a high relationship with direct longevity (from 0. 06 up to 0. 29). The strongest positive correlation with longevity was for udder depth (0. 29) and the strongest negative correlation was for <b>chest</b> <b>depth</b> (- 0. 21). According the different results, an animal with a good direct longevity seemed to be smaller and less heavy than an animal with a shorter longevity. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Studies {{show that}} {{acquisition}} {{and retention of}} BLS skills is poor, and this may contribute to low survival from cardiac arrest. Feedback from instructors during BLS training is often lacking. This study investigates the effects of continuous feedback from a manikin on chest compression and ventilation techniques during training compared to instructor feedback atone. Materials and methods: A prospective randomised controlled trial. First-year healthcare students at the University of Birmingham were randomised to receive training in standard or feedback groups. The standard group were taught by an instructor using a conventional manikin. The feedback group used a 'Skillreporter' manikin, which provides continuous feedback on ventilation volume and <b>chest</b> compression <b>depth</b> and rate in addition to instructor feedback. SkiR acquisition was tested immediately after training and 6 weeks later. Results: Ninety-eight participants were recruited (conventional n = 49; Skillreporter n= 49) and were tested after training. Sixty-six students returned (Skillreporter n = 34; conventional n = 32) for testing 6 weeks later. The Skillreporter group achieved better compression depth (39. 96 mm versus 36. 71 mm, P < 0. 05), and more correct compressions (58. 0...|$|R
40|$|As obesity rates increase, the {{protection}} of obese occupants will become increasingly important in vehicle and restraint design. As {{a first step in}} this effort, this study seeks to compare the kinematics, dynamics, and injuries of obese post mortem human surrogates (PMHS) to (approximately) 50 th percentile adult male PMHS in frontal impact sled tests with a force-limiting, pre-tensioning restraint system. Forty-eight km/h, frontal impact sled tests were performed with a sled buck representing the rear seat occupant compartment of a 2004 mid-sized sedan. The restraint system consisted of a 3 -point belt with a pretensioner and a progressive force-limiter at the retractor. The test subjects were either obese PMHS or approximately 50 th percentile adult male PMHS. Instrumentation included accelerometer packages on the spine. Deformation of the subjects' chests were measured using chestbands placed nominally at the superior-inferior locations of the 4 th and 8 th ribs. Tension in the restraint system was measured at the upper shoulder belt, lower shoulder belt, and the lap belt. Motion of the head, shoulder, pelvis, and knee were recorded using high-speed video. Two obese PMHS (average mass 137 kg, average stature 186 cm) and three approximately mid-sized male PMHS (average mass 68 kg, average stature 176 cm) were tested. The obese PMHS exhibited significantly greater forward motion of the head and the pelvis compared to the mid-sized PMHS. The obese PMHS also exhibited backwards torso rotation at the time of maximum forward excursion, whereas the mid-sized PMHS did not. The obese PMHS exhibited average maximum chest compressions of approximately 44 % (± 9 % standard deviation) of their initial <b>chest</b> <b>depths,</b> and exhibited 26 g (± 2 g) average 3 ms clip maximum chest resultant acceleration. In comparison, the mid-sized PMHS exhibited averages of 29 % (± 9 %) maximum chest compression and 35 g (± 4 g) maximum 3 ms clip chest acceleration. The obese PMHS exhibited 7 and 2 rib fractures, with maximum chest AIS scores of 3 and 2. The mid-sized PMHS exhibited 12, 2, and 17 rib fractures, with maximum chest AIS scores of 4, 1, and 4, respectively. This study is the first (to the authors' knowledge) to compare the kinematic, dynamic, and injury behaviors of obese and mid-sized PMHS in frontal impact sled tests with a force-limiting, pretensioning restraint system. The unfavorable kinematics observed with the obese PMHS highlights the difficulty of designing restraint systems to adequately restrain obese occupants, even with currently available advanced restraint technologies...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{effects of}} {{exercise}} protocols on postural control {{changes have been}} supported, but {{the influence of a}} common and specific type neuromuscular exercise such as plyometric on postural control is not clear. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of plyometric type neuromuscular exercise on balance or postural control performance of young male volleyball players. Method: Ten professional young male volleyball players participated in this study and performed plyomeric exercises including 4  ×  10 squat jump, broad jump, tuck jump with knee to <b>chest,</b> and <b>depth</b> jump from 45 -cm box high 60 and 90  s rest between sets and exercises, respectively. Before and immediately after completing the plyometric exercise, postural control was assessed by the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) at 8 directions (anterior, A; anteromedial, AM; anterolateral, AL; medial, M; lateral, L; posterior, P; posteromedial, PM; and posterolateral, PL). Results: The results indicated that plyometric exercise induced deficits in reach directions and greater changes occurred in the M, P and AL directions. Conclusions: It can be recommend that strength and conditioning professionals in the field of volleyball do not perform other type of landing exercise in plyometric training sessions because of postural control impaired and consequently the probability of lower extremity injuries will increase...|$|R
