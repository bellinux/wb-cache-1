40|$|EP 253181 A UPAB: 19930923 A fixture for a {{grinding}} wheel to an electric angle grinder {{is based on}} a <b>clamping</b> <b>flange</b> by which the wheel is clamped to the abutment of the hollow spindle. This flange is screwed to the threaded pin of a clamping pin. The cavity between the surfaces is filled with a plastic matrial, e. g. PVC of a low degree of polymerisation which is poured in as a liq. when hot and becomes a jelly when cold. By applying the lever on the thrust disc, the plunger is moved to displace the jelly in one of the cavities for a firm connection between for the wheel clamped between. ADVANTAGE - This relieves the <b>clamping</b> <b>flange</b> only when the grinding disc is to be changed and is ideal for one-hand grinders...|$|R

40|$|Statement of the problem. Woodworking {{machinery}} is extensively used in {{the production}} of wood components for the construction of objects for various purpose. Operation of woodworking machinery is accompanied by high noise emissions. Circular woodworking machines are the most problematic in terms of their noise characteristics, and also most widespread. The dominating noise source is a saw disk. Results. Vibration-damping structure is suggested in the form of seals with dry friction placed be-tween <b>clamping</b> <b>flanges</b> and a saw disk. Vibration-damping properties of seals are experimentally examined using H. Oberst’s method. The analysis amounted to establishing how the value of the total loss coefficient is affected by the following factors: seal foundation type, frequency of excitation, particles size (dispersion), temperature factor. Based on the obtained results, an experimental study of acoustic efficiency of vibration-damping seals with dry friction was performed, varying being such parameters as the particles size (dispersion) and seal foundation type. Conclusions. The construction of vibration-damping seals with dry friction with the appropriate particle dispersion and foundation material is {{based on the results of}} the experimental study. The suggested construction has considerable advantages over polymeric seals...|$|R

40|$|Threaded {{fasteners}} play a {{major role}} in mechanical assemblies to <b>clamp</b> components or <b>flanges.</b> While bolted joints have been in use for many centuries and are simple to design and use, they are not foolproof; it is often difficult to achieve the required clamping force accurately by applying the designer-prescribed tightening torque, determined assuming ideal conditions of the contacting surfaces. Therefore, a concept that can directly measure tension on bolted joints is necessary. In this work, the concept of visual tension indicating fasteners is introduced and explained. After testing the feasibility of the concept, an automated assembly line is designed and fabricated in order to produce these fasteners with a more reliable manufacturing process...|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{bindings}} <b>clamped</b> {{onto the}} <b>flange</b> at the toe and {{heel of the}} boot, which were moulded into a roughly rectangular shape. The release action was controlled by cams in the binding, whose limited size limited the cams's size and travel. In {{the case of the}} Spademan, the boot plate itself was the cam surface, which gave the designers much more room to work with. Release directions could be adjusted simply by changing the shape of the plate, allowing the binding to release in any direction. This made the Spademan design dramatically safer than conventional systems; rental shops reported 1 fracture per 50,000 ski days with the Spademan, when the average was 1 in 20,000 (these numbers have since improved dramatically).|$|R

To these, mobile decompression chambers can be <b>clamped</b> on by <b>flanges.</b> They are transported if necessary (e.g. by SAR helicopters in low-altitude flight) to Kiel, where is the largest pressure chamber of the German Federal Navy, in which up to 12 people can be subjected to pressure, as a simulation of deep diving as part of training, or to treat decompression sickness. For this reason and due to the outstanding training, the number {{and the consequences of}} serious and deadly diving accidents with the {{mine clearance}} divers in the German navy are remarkably small compared to the comparable units in other countries.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} with a molten salt loop at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM to resolve issues associated with {{the operation of the}} 10 MW{sub e} Solar Two Central Receiver Power Plant located near Barstow, CA. The salt loop contained two receiver panels, components such as flanges and a check valve, vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters, and an impedance pressure transducer. Tests were conducted on procedures for filling and thawing a panel, and assessing components and instrumentation in a molten salt environment. Four categories of experiments were conducted: (1) cold filling procedures, (2) freeze/thaw procedures, (3) component tests, and (4) instrumentation tests. Cold-panel and -piping fill experiments are described, in which the panels and piping were preheated to temperatures below the salt freezing point prior to initiating flow, to determine the feasibility of cold filling the receiver and piping. The transient thermal response was measured, and heat transfer coefficients and transient stresses were calculated from the data. Freeze/thaw experiments were conducted with the panels, in which the salt was intentionally allowed to freeze in the receiver tubes, then thawed with heliostat beams. Slow thermal cycling tests were conducted to measure both how well various designs of flanges (e. g., tapered <b>flanges</b> or <b>clamp</b> type <b>flanges)</b> hold a seal under thermal conditions typical of nightly shut down, and the practicality of using these flanges on high maintenance components. In addition, the flanges were thermally shocked to simulate cold starting the system. Instrumentation such as vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters were tested alongside each other, and compared with flow measurements from calibration tanks in the flow loop...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} dynamic {{finite element}} code DYnamic Crash Analysis of STructures (DYCAST) {{was used to}} model an accident scenario that occurred at the National Transonic Facility (NTF) wind tunnel. A post mishap investigation revealed that {{a total of five}} upstream bulkhead fairing plates were missing, three in one location and two in another. These plates were drawn into the wind tunnel's composite fan blades causing extensive damage. A DYCAST model was developed to determine if one-half of a small thermal shield <b>flange</b> <b>clamp,</b> weighing approximately 2. 7 lbs., could have spun off the NTF drive shaft and impacted the bulkhead fairing plates with sufficient energy to cause failure of the attachment bolts. The clamp was presumed to have spun off at a tangent from the NTF drive shaft at a velocity of 1624 in/sec (drive shaft rotating at 580 rpm). The DYCAST analytical model predicts that impact of the 2. 7 lbs projectile failed all of the bolts in two of the fairing plates allowing them to escape from the bulkhead ring with a low velocity of a few in/sec...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{manufacturing}} {{of large-scale}} wind turbines requires the accurate tightening of multiple bolts and nuts, which connect the ball bearings - supporting {{wind turbine blades}} - with the hub, a huge mechanical component supporting blades pitch motion. An accurate tightening of bolts and nuts requires uniformly distributed <b>clamping</b> forces along <b>flanges</b> and surfaces of contact between hub and bearings. Due {{to the role of}} friction forces and the dynamics of the phenomenon, this process is nonlinear and currently performed manually; it is also time consuming, requiring high-cost equipment and expert operators. This paper proposes a set of neural networks, which infer the clamping force achievable with a tightening tool while fastening M 24 nuts on bolts. The tool embeds a torque sensor and shaft encoder, therefore two types of inputs of the neural networks are considered in order to fit the clamping force output: the time signals of (a) the applied torque of the tool and (b) the combination of the torque and of the angular speed of the tool. According to results, neural networks properly model the clamping force, both during the training stage and when exposed to unseen testing data. This approach could be generalized to other industrial processes and specifically to those requiring repetitive tightening tasks and involving highly nonlinear aspects, such as friction forces. ...|$|R
40|$|Seaway Heavy Lifting is an {{offshore}} contractor that transports, installs and decommissions offshore {{oil and gas}} platforms and offshore wind turbines. During transport, objects need to be secured on the deck, the so-called seafastening. In particular for parts of offshore wind turbines, called Transition Pieces, this proves to be difficult. The Transition Pieces are on average 25 m high tubular structures and weight 300 mT. The outside {{is covered with a}} special coating and various attachments, such as boat landings, ladders, and anodes for corrosion protection. The inside of the Transition Pieces contains various structures and equipment, such as groutskirts, shear keys, J-tubes and internal platforms. Seaway Heavy Lifting currently uses clamps on the lower flange to secure the Transition Pieces in an upright position to the deck of the ship. This causes relative high stresses in the flange and weld and {{turned out to be a}} critical limiting factor during transportation for several projects. Due to this limitation, the workability of the vessels is suboptimal. Many other offshore contractors use the same or similar method of <b>clamping</b> the lower <b>flange</b> to the deck. A new method for seafastening Transition Pieces is proposed to improve the securing strength, the safety, and workability of the vessels. This new method comprises of a tubular element, much like the monopile on which the Transition Piece will stand once on offshore location, welded onto the grillage. The Transition Piece can then be lifted over this tubular element. Mounted on the tubular element are hydraulic cylinders that extend outwards towards the inner wall of the Transition Piece. By exerting a force to the inner wall, the Transition Piece is effectively secured to the vessel. This method avoids using the rather weak lower flange. Strength calculations have shown that this new method can withstand accelerations and accompanying forces caused by the ships motions that are nearly twice as high as the current method allows. Because the new method is fully automated, it requires no manual labour and the seafastening can be activated and deactivated quickly, thus saving critical crane time. It also reduces the time frame where the Transition Pieces stands on the deck unsecured, as is the case with the current method which uses clamps and bolts, thus improving safety. This thesis covers the invention of the new method, calculating the critical structural parts, and detailing those element that are crucial to the design. Currently, a patent applications is pending.

40|$|The {{problems}} related to damage detection represents a primary concern, particularly {{in the framework of}} composite structure. In fact, for this kind of structures barely visible damage can occur. Moreover, one of the major in-service damage of composite aircraft strcutures is represented by disbonds between the stiffeners and the skin undergoing dynamic or post-buckling loads. The effective implementation of a SHM system relies on the synthesis of non-destructive technique (NDT), fracture mechanics, sensors technology, data manipulation and signal processing, and it can receive a great improvement through the use of an Artificial Neural Networks. Different architectures of Artificial Neural Networks for a structural damage detection are studied in order to detect damage without any prior knowledge of the model of the structure so as to serve as a real-time data processor for SHM systems. The standard feed-forward Multi Layer Perceptron and the Radial Basis Function ANNs are compared. In the former paradigm each neuron is arranged in a series of layer. There are no precise rules for the choose of the number of hidden neurons, only empirical indications. Three training algorithms are considered: the Levenberg-Marquardt, the Conjugate Gradient backpropagation and the Gradient Descent with momentum. Moreover different complexity of the network are considered, by varying the number of hidden neurons. On the other hand, the RBF can require more neurons than standard MLP networks but they can be often designed to reduce the training time with respect to MLP. Two types of RBF are trained. The first can produce a network with zero error on training vectors but the number of hidden neurons is very high since it must be equal to the number of input vectors. So a second type of RBF is created by adding one neuron at each training input, until the sum-squared error falls beneath an error goal or a maximum number of neurons is reached. For the second type of ANNs instead, assumed that the number of hidden neurons is fixed due to the number of training data used to build and train all networks, a parametric analysis is made by changing the spread parameter. A drop-ply delaminated structure employed to represent a bidimensional simplification of the adhesive joints between composite aircraft fuselage skins and stiffners is here analyzed to study the sensing capability of the SHM system proposed. The analyzed configuration consists of an host delaminated structure, made up by 0 ° and 90 ° graphite-epoxy (GE) plies and of a piezoelectric patch, employed to arrange the sensing device. The skin is arranged with unidirectional graphite-expoxy plies. The drop-ply assembly deforms under plane strain conditions and it is <b>clamped</b> at the <b>flange</b> root. The structure undergoes several treansverse shear loads per unit length F acting on the free-edge of the skin. Moreover, for dynamic analyses the load is modeled as a step load to simulate the sudden raise of the shearing postbuckling action. Lastly, a delamination of length a is assumed to occur at the skin-flange 0 °/ 90 ° interfaces. The piezoelectric patch is assumed to be bonded on the flange top surface. The training data are obtained, in term of a Damage Index ID distribution, from a Dual Reciprocity Boundary Element Method transient analysis of the host damaged structure and the bonded piezoelectric sensor. The BEM model allows to compute the electrical signals that are used to define the ID generated by an array of piezoelectric sensors bonded on a delaminated composite skin-stiffner. Thirty-two delamination length and twenty-one load cases are analyzed. It has been observed that the RBF NN tipically requires larger number of training patterns and also a larger network architecture to achieve the same lavel of desired accuracy as the MLP. On the other hand, an advantage of using RBF NNs is that they require a training time inferior than the MLP N...|$|R
