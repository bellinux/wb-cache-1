5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many <b>compartments</b> were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five <b>compartments.</b> Titanic was only designed to float with any two <b>compartments</b> flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four <b>compartments</b> (the first four) open to the ocean. With five <b>compartments,</b> the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Canadian Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine {{developed}} the Kidd/Stubbs serial decompression model. This differs from Haldanian models which are parallel models {{and assume that}} all <b>compartments</b> are exposed to ambient partial pressures and no gas interchange occurs between <b>compartments.</b> A serial model assumes that the diffusion takes place {{through a series of}} <b>compartments,</b> and only one is exposed to the ambient partial pressures and is in effect a compartmentalised version of the Hempelman bulk diffusion slab model.|$|E
5|$|The Kidd/Stubbs {{model has}} four serial <b>compartments,</b> {{each with a}} half time of {{approximately}} 21 minutes. Allowable surfacing supersaturation ratios for the initial two <b>compartments</b> are taken as 1.92 and 1.73, while the gas concentration {{in the last two}} <b>compartments</b> is not considered in the computation.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} groups of {{dissolved}} phase models: In parallel compartment models, several <b>compartments</b> with varying rates of gas absorption (half time), are considered to exist independently of each other, and the limiting condition {{is controlled by the}} compartment that shows the worst case for a specific exposure profile.

The second group uses serial <b>compartments,</b> which assumes that gas diffuses through one compartment before it reaches the next.|$|E

5|$|After the First World War, another {{programme}} of {{improvements to}} the locks was carried out, extending the locks to , which enabled trains of 19 <b>compartments</b> to operate regularly. Experiments with trains as long as 38 tubs were carried out, but the difficulty of splitting the train {{to pass through the}} locks meant that 19 was the usual maximum. The <b>compartments</b> continued until the late 1960s to carry around half a million tons of coal, long after most British canals had ceased to be used for commercial traffic, but the gradual demise of the coal industry led to compartment traffic ceasing in 1986.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections and separate first, second and third class <b>compartments</b> within each. This separation applied to both living and dead passengers. This was to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment, rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner; the <b>compartments</b> intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors. At 11.35am (11.20am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25pm (12.20pm on Sundays).|$|E
5|$|By about 19:30, Marlboroughs pumps had {{contained}} the flooding in the boiler rooms {{but she took}} {{on a list of}} around 7–8degrees. Instead of using counter-flooding to minimise the list, her crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first. The list caused the generators supplying power to the main battery turrets to flood, hampering the gun crews, particularly as shells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets. The blast from the torpedo was so powerful that forty watertight <b>compartments</b> were damaged, though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly damaged <b>compartments</b> were sufficiently shored up. Three more torpedoes approached Marlborough at 19:33. She evaded the first two and the third harmlessly passed under the ship.|$|E
50|$|Rodents {{typically}} {{spend more}} time in the dark <b>compartment</b> than in the light <b>compartment.</b> If rodents are injected with anxiolytic drugs, percentage of time spent in the light <b>compartment</b> will increase.

30|$|Diagnosis of <b>compartment</b> {{syndrome}} {{was made}} on the basis of tense swelling, pain out of proportion to injury, increased narcotic requirement, pain on passive stretching of the muscles of the involved <b>compartment,</b> and paresthesia. <b>Compartment</b> pressures < 30  mmHg of diastolic blood pressure were used as an adjunct to the clinical diagnosis [11]. In ten obtunded patients (from brain injury or medications), the diagnosis depended mainly on measuring the <b>compartment</b> pressure together with tense swelling of the <b>compartment.</b> Defining the exact onset of <b>compartment</b> syndrome is not an easy task. For patients who could describe an approximate timing of escalation of pain level, that timing was used as the onset of <b>compartment</b> syndrome. Patients who suffered from major injury to their extremities and then presented shortly after that to the emergency department with a clinical picture of <b>compartment</b> syndrome, we considered the time of injury as the time of onset of <b>compartment</b> syndrome.|$|R
40|$|A {{process and}} {{apparatus}} for measuring pressure buildup {{in a body}} <b>compartment</b> that encases muscular tissue.

An apparatus is used for measuring pressure build-up in the body <b>compartment</b> having components for imparting ultrasonic waves such as a transducer, placing the transducer to impart the ultrasonic waves, capturing the imparted ultrasonic waves, mathematically manipulating the captured ultrasonic waves and categorizing pressure build-up in the body <b>compartment</b> from the mathematical manipulations...|$|R
