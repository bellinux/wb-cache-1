Proceeds from the property's sale would go to a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation that will donate to children's <b>cancer</b> <b>causes.</b> In October, 2014, the ranch was offered for sale with an asking price of $32 million. The ranch failed to sell after repeated efforts to do so, leading Imus to put the property up for auction in May 2017. When sold, Imus has earmarked all proceeds from the sale for the foundation.|$|E
2500|$|Sociologist Gayle Sulik {{analysis}} of the she-ro's social role ascribes it qualities that include being an educated medical consumer with a brave, pleasant and optimistic public appearance and demeanor who aggressively fights breast cancer through compliance with screening guidelines and [...] "disciplined practice of 'breast health'". In America the she-ro is diagnosed early due to adherence to early screening recommendations, and, by definition, survives her diagnosis. The role emphasizes the femininity and female gender role of the she-ro, offsetting the masculine characteristics of assertiveness, selfishness and [...] "fighting" [...] cancer by cultivating a feminine appearance and concern for others. [...] After treatment, the she-ro regains her femininity by using breast reconstruction, prosthetic devices, wigs, cosmetics, and clothing to present an aesthetically appealing, upper-class, heterosexual feminine appearance and by maintaining relationships in which she can nurture other people. [...] Ensuring the proper feeling rules of the breast cancer culture is encouraged, including remaining optimistic of a full cure, rationalizing the selfishness of treatment as a temporary measure and feeling guilty that it forces her to put her needs momentarily above {{the needs of others}} or due to her perceived inadequacy in caring for her family or other women with cancer. Also included in the role is a form of have-it-all superwoman, cultivating a normal appearance and activity level and minimizing the disruption that breast <b>cancer</b> <b>causes</b> to people around her.|$|E

50|$|The risk of lung <b>cancer</b> <b>caused</b> by {{smoking is}} much higher than the risk of lung <b>cancer</b> <b>caused</b> by indoor radon.

It is generally believed that exposure to radon and cigarette smoking are synergistic; that is, that the combined effect exceeds the sum of their independent effects. This is because the daughters of radon often become attached to smoke and dust particles, and are then able to lodge in the lungs.|$|R
