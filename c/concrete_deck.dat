5|$|Chiswick Bridge is a {{reinforced}} <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> {{arch bridge}} over the River Thames in west London. One of three bridges opened in 1933 {{as part of an}} ambitious scheme to relieve traffic congestion west of London, it carries the A316 road between Chiswick on the north bank of the Thames and Mortlake on the south bank.|$|E
5|$|A bushfire burnt {{through the}} area in December 1993, {{destroying}} the former railway's bridge over Clackline Brook. Clackline Bridge survived, weakened but in a reasonable condition. The damage included internal expansion joints that had failed, split bedlogs, and other deteriorated timbers. Steel props were installed to support the bridge, and the substructure was repaired in 1995, which mainly involved replacing connecting bolts. A concrete approach slab was installed adjacent to the western abutment in 1998, and in 2013 the <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> near pier13 was repaired. Clackline Bridge was the crossing point for Great Eastern Highway until the highway's bypass of Clackline opened in February 2008. The bridge remains open to traffic, {{as part of the}} local road network. In July 2012 it once more carried highway traffic, excluding heavy vehicles, when an accident temporarily closed Great Eastern Highway at Spencers Brook Road.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, {{concerns}} {{with the leadership}} of the Battleship Texas Commission led to the decision by the State Legislature to turn over control of the ship to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). The legislature abolished the commission effective 31 August 1983, and TPWD assumed operational control the next day. One of the first actions by TPWD was to hire a firm of naval architects to survey the ship in order to assess the deterioration and make recommendations as to what actions should be taken to preserve the ship. The survey revealed that the ship's watertight integrity was badly compromised, the hull was open to the sea in many places, and many compartments were full of standing rain water. The architects determined that the ship needed to go to dry dock for major repairs to the hull and to keep rain water from coming through the porous <b>concrete</b> <b>deck.</b> As part of this plan, serious consideration was given to protecting sensitive fabrics and restoring the interior of the ship. After a five-year-long fund-raising campaign, $15 million was collected to dry dock the ship and complete necessary repairs.|$|E

25|$|The Dairy Goat Pavilion {{is located}} {{to the south}} of the Dairy Cattle Pavilion and to the north of Show Ring No.2. It is an {{elevated}} two-storey structure with an associated open <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> which overlooks the show ring and Sideshow Alley beyond. Storage areas and public amenities are located at the lower ground show ring level under the raised <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> while the structure itself is sited at the upper deck level. The building is of a simple rectilinear plan with a gable roof extending the full length of the building and being supported at its ends by concrete and steel columns. Both the walls and roof are clad with metal corrugated custom orb sheeting. Lining the perimeter of the <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> are a series of shade structures.|$|E

30|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate the seasonal variations in the relative permittivity of actual <b>concrete</b> bridge <b>decks</b> of various ages on Korea expressways, and to propose a practical way to calibrate two critical effects, to assess the condition of the <b>concrete</b> bridge <b>decks</b> with better accuracy. For these purposes, fifty-three actual <b>concrete</b> bridge <b>decks</b> on Korea expressways were scanned using an air-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR) system, and the relative permittivity of the concrete was evaluated from the GPR data in the field. A statistical analysis showed that the relative permittivity of the <b>concrete</b> bridge <b>decks</b> in Korea are closely correlated with seasonal changes and concrete ages. For <b>concrete</b> bridge <b>decks</b> aged 10  years or older, the effect of concrete age was not as significant as that of relative humidity of the air on relative permittivity of concrete. Based on the results, a simple calibration process was proposed to suppress the effects of seasonal variation and age of concrete on the measured relative permittivity of the <b>concrete</b> <b>decks</b> on actual bridges. As will be discussed, the resulting relative permittivity method produced better agreement with the current condition of the <b>concrete</b> bridge <b>decks</b> as determined by visual inspection and other complementary methods (energy attenuation of GPR signals and corrosion potential measurements) than without the calibration process.|$|R
25|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt in stages. The first stage was to erect the new steel arches under the two {{original}} wrought-iron tubes. The arches were completed, and single-line working was {{restored to the}} railway on 30 January 1972 by reusing one of the tubes. The next stage was to dismantle and remove the other tube {{and replace it with}} a <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> for the other rail track. Then the single-line working was transfered to the new track. That allowed the other tube to be removed and replaced with a <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> and the other rail track installed. A normal two-way rail service was then restored in 1974. Finally the upper road deck was installed and by July 1980, over 10 years after the fire, the new road crossing was completed, and formally opened by HRH the Prince of Wales, carrying a single-carriageway section of the A55 road.|$|E

During a Stanley Cup party hosted by drummer Vinnie Paul, the Stanley Cup was damaged when Guy Carbonneau attempted to throw the Cup from the balcony of Vinnie Paul's house into his pool. The Cup landed short on the <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> and had to be repaired by NHL commissioned silversmiths.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} handle the {{increasing}} size of ocean liners, new mooring systems have been introduced to allow successful berthing of these vessels. Most significantly was a special temporary mooring system, designed and implemented by engineering firm Arup Group in 2012 to allow the mooring of the Queen Mary II. This involved a series of temporary drag anchors to be installed on the seabed around Campbell's Cove and the passenger terminal to take the ship's bow lines. This temporary system has subsequently been kept for larger vessels to moor, pending the design and implementation of a more permanent design. As {{a result of this}} temporary mooring system's success, a permanent new mooring dolphin with both fixed above-water pile and a <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> mooring structure was introduced adjacent to Campbell's Cove {{to the north of the}} OPT.|$|E

30|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate seasonal variations and age-related changes in the relative permittivity of actual <b>concrete</b> bridge <b>decks</b> of various ages on Korea expressways, and to propose a practical way to calibrate the effects of the two critical parameters used for assessing the condition of the <b>concrete</b> bridge <b>decks,</b> for better accuracy. The data in this study were obtained from fifty-three <b>concrete</b> bridge <b>decks</b> in public service, using an air-coupled GPR system with 1  GHz antennas. Only bare <b>concrete</b> <b>decks</b> were included in this study because the presence of an asphalt concrete overlay results in a completely different deterioration mechanism, and accordingly, different influential factors would need {{to be involved in the}} GPR survey (e.g., the interface conditions between the overlay and the top concrete) (Rhee and Choi 2017; Rhee et al. 2017).|$|R
50|$|Resistance {{to use of}} an {{orthotropic}} deck relates {{mainly to}} its cost of fabrication, due {{to the amount of}} welding involved. In addition, it must be prefabricated rather than assembled on site, which offers less flexibility than in-situ <b>concrete</b> <b>decks.</b> Orthotropic decks have been prone to fatigue problems and to delamination of the wearing surface, which, like the deck, is also often of a very thin material to reduce weight.|$|R
500|$|The four-lane 12thStreet and 14thStreet viaducts, {{completed}} in 1927 and 1951 respectively, carry Route139 between Jersey Avenue at Boyle Plaza and the cut into Bergen Hill under Palisade Avenue. Ramps from {{western end of}} 12thStreet Viaduct connect to the upper level roadway {{at the top of}} Bergen Hill at the Palisade Avenue intersection. Westbound ramp on north side is separated from the main highway by a reinforced concrete retaining wall; the eastbound ramp on south side is supported by reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> arch spans. The western end of 12thStreet Viaduct transitions from two-way to one-way, four-lane eastbound traffic just east of the connection with the westbound 14thStreet Viaduct. The New Jersey Department of Transportation undertook a $92million project to renew the viaducts. The reason for this project was that the viaducts were structurally deficient. The steel beams on the viaducts had deteriorated and the concrete was just extra weight. [...] The project included replacement of the <b>concrete</b> <b>deck,</b> retrofitting for earthquakes, repair of the substructure and superstructure, and construction of a shoulder on westbound 14thStreet Viaduct. The rehabilitated viaducts were to also feature ornamental designs to recall the historical significance of the two viaducts. This project was {{completed in}} 2010.|$|E
500|$|A {{variety of}} people-oriented {{amenities}} are spread outdoors across {{the part of}} the refuge open to the public. One feature is an outdoor deck overhanging an embank that overlooks ponds at the refuge. This [...] long <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> is of a cantilevered design that extends [...] over the embankment. Other amenities include footbridges, education sites, and walking trails. [...] There are nearly five miles (8.0km) of trails, but they are closed in the fall and winter. Centennial and River are two of the viewing areas along the trails, each offering a place to view wildlife. Photographers have access to blinds which allow them to take pictures without disturbing the wildlife.|$|E
500|$|The {{new design}} {{utilizes}} basket-handle steel arches with clear spans of approximately [...] Inclined cables connect the steel blue arches to the pre-stressed <b>concrete</b> <b>deck.</b> By selecting a tied arch form, the Iowa Department of Transportation {{was able to}} keep disruption of traffic to a minimum during construction. An innovative curved screen system is used to enhance security and the appearance of the structure creating a visually appealing experience for pedestrians and bicyclists using the bridge. The resulting series of bridges has created a distinctive form that is unique to the city and the state. The city of Des Moines recently relit the bridges with LED lighting.|$|E

40|$|Reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>decks</b> {{submerged}} in water suffer from considerable deterioration owing to high cycle repetition of traffic loads with increasing rise of inter-crack water pressure, {{which leads to}} serious damages to the top surface of <b>concrete</b> <b>decks</b> due to dropping (disintegration) of cement binder. In this study, {{an attempt was made}} to incorporate the disintegration of concrete composites into a three-dimensional multi-scale finite element analysis, which is capable of tracing the path from the occurrence of cracking to the structural out-of-plane shear failure via crack propagation. Varying fatigue life is also discussed in accordance with different states of damage at the time when strengthening work is performed. Here, the deck strengthening methods of wide variety are compared with each other...|$|R

500|$|In 2015, {{plans for}} {{improvements}} to Deerfoot Trail near Southland Drive were cancelled and a study was initiated {{to determine the}} best course of action to begin improving the freeway. [...] The Calf Robe Bridge is also prone to collisions as its <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> becomes slick in cold weather, and large curves precede and follow the bridge. [...] A 1996 crash on the bridge claimed the life of a teenager when her northbound car struck the rear of a fire truck parked in the left shoulder attending to an accident in the southbound lanes. [...] Poor visibility due to the curve prior to the bridge was a contributing factor in a successful lawsuit by the girl's family against Calgary.|$|E
500|$|MDSHA {{replaced}} Motter Avenue's {{bridge over}} US15 because the <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> {{of the old}} bridge was deteriorating and the four-lane width of the bridge was insufficient for the traffic it carried.

500|$|Sir Owen Williams was {{commissioned}} {{to design the}} new hotel, using reinforced concrete to allow the creation of large internal spaces without support pillars, but he abandoned the project in February 1930 and was replaced with William Curtis Green. James Maude Richards, hired by Williams, served as an architectural assistant within the all-engineer staff. Percy Morley Horder, consulting architect to Gordon's Hotels, had not been consulted during the design process and, after seeing the plan, resigned from the project, remarking to The Observer that the design was ill-suited for the location, assuming the concrete was to be left unpainted and that the insulation would be minimal. Some 40,000 tonnes of earth were excavated {{to make room for}} the hotel's extensive basement which is one-third of the size of the hotel above the surface. The upper eight floors were erected in just 10 weeks, supported on a massive [...] thick reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>deck</b> that forms the roof of the first floor.

International Journal of Advanced Structural Engineering. [URL] paper presents a numerical study that investigates {{the behavior of}} continuous <b>concrete</b> <b>decks</b> doubly reinforced with top and bottom {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) bars subjected to top surface fire. A finite element (FE) model is developed and a detailed transient thermal analysis is performed on a continuous <b>concrete</b> bridge <b>deck</b> under the effect of various fire curves. A parametric study is performed to examine the top cover thickness and the critical fire exposure curve needed to fully degrade the top GFRP bars while achieving certain fire ratings for the deck considered. Accordingly, design tables are prepared for each fire curve to guide the engineer to properly size the top concrete cover and maintain the temperature in the GFRP bars below critical design values in order to control the full top GFRP degradation. It is notable to indicate that degradation of top GFRP bars do not pose a collapse hazard but rather a serviceability concern since cracks in the negative moment region widen resulting in simply supported spans...|$|R
