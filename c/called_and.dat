On June 11, Susan Snow, a 40-year-old Auburn bank manager, took two Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules for an early-morning headache.

5|$|Although the 1940 Olympic Games {{could not}} be held due to war, Brundage sought to {{organize}} Western Hemisphere games that {{might be able to}} proceed despite the troubled international climate. Brundage was one of the leaders in the founding of the Pan-American Games, participating in the initial discussions in August 1940 in Buenos Aires. On his return, he arranged for the American Olympic Association to be renamed the United States of America Sports Federation (USASF), which would organize the United States Olympic Committee (as the AOC would now be <b>called)</b> <b>and</b> another committee to see to American participation in the Pan-American Games. Brundage became an early member of the international Pan-American Games Commission, although the inaugural event in Buenos Aires was postponed because of the war and was eventually held in 1951, with Brundage present. Despite his role in founding them, Brundage viewed the Pan-American Games as imitative, with no true link with antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{reached the}} European Cup final again in 1970. Celtic knocked out Basel {{in the first}} round, then {{defeated}} Portuguese side Benfica 3–0 at Parkhead in {{the first leg of}} the second round. Celtic's performance was impressive, and they were unfortunate not to score more. Benfica rallied in the return match and put Celtic under intense pressure from the start. John Fallon was outstanding in goal for Celtic and with the game nearing its end had limited the score to 2–0 for the Portuguese side. Diamantino, however, scored direct from a free-kick in the final minute to level the tie on aggregate and force extra-time. No further goals were scored in the additional 30 minutes, and the tie was decided by the toss of a coin. Captain Billy McNeill successfully <b>called,</b> <b>and</b> Celtic progressed to the quarter-finals. Celtic were unhappy that the tie had been decided in this manner, and suggested to UEFA an alternative of using a scoreline {{based on the number of}} corners forced in extra-time. UEFA rejected this proposal, but soon afterwards introduced penalty kick shoot-outs in the European Cup to decide drawn ties after extra-time. Celtic went on to face Italian champions Fiorentina in the quarter-finals, winning 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E
