50|$|With {{the clutch}} pedal {{completely}} pressed or a motorcycle's lever pulled entirely towards you, {{there is no}} direct link between the engine and the driveshaft, so no power can pass from the engine to the driveshaft and wheels. With the pedal entirely released, there is full contact between the engine and the driveshaft, via the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate,</b> which means that the engine can apply power directly to the driveshaft. However, it is possible to have the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> partially engaged, allowing the clutch to slip. As a result, {{only a fraction of the}} power from the engine reaches the driveshaft which is commonly known as Half clutch.|$|E
50|$|The {{slipper clutch}} {{consists}} of two bases, one with dog clutches and ramps with ball bearings, a splined hub, and <b>clutch</b> <b>plates.</b> In normal operation, the dog clutches mate, driving the transmission. When a back torque comes from the transmission, the splined hub slides up the bearing ramps, disconnecting from the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> and allowing a limited slip between input and output.|$|R
5000|$|Mid-2011: New {{clutch basket}} with only 6 <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> (vs 7 since 1996). The change starts at engine number KL650AEA72320.|$|R
50|$|On {{motorcycles}} {{the clutch}} is {{operated by a}} hand lever on the left handlebar. No pressure on the lever means that the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> are engaged (driving), while pulling the lever back towards the rider disengages the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> through cable or hydraulic actuation, allowing the rider to shift gears or coast. Racing motorcycles often use slipper clutches to eliminate the effects of engine braking, which, being applied only to the rear wheel, can cause instability.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{will be a}} single-clutch automated manual variant, {{and delivers}} the power to the rear wheels. The use of a single <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> was meant to keep the car lightweight. It is unknown how fast the shifts will be.|$|E
50|$|In {{a manual}} transmission, the {{flywheel}} {{is attached to}} the engine's crankshaft and spins along with it. The clutch disk is in between the pressure plate and the flywheel, and is held against the flywheel under pressure from the pressure plate. When the engine is running and the clutch is engaged (i.e., clutch pedal up), the flywheel spins the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> and hence the transmission. As the clutch pedal is depressed, the throw out bearing is activated, which causes the pressure plate to stop applying pressure to the clutch disk. This makes the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> stop receiving power from the engine, so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When the clutch pedal is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and the clutch disk is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{electric}} starter works with gears and <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> linking the motor and the engine. The clutch {{is used to}} disengage when optimum speed is achieved. This is usually done automatically. The electric supply is used to start the motor {{as well as for}} ignition. The voltage is usually built up slowly as starter gains speed.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{applications}} for case hardening are gear teeth, cams, shafts, bearings, fasteners, pins, hydraulic piston rods, automotive <b>clutch</b> <b>plates,</b> tools, dies and tillage tools.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} is a 7-speed sequential transmission manufactured by Sadev, with long-lasting, anti-stall functioning <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> from ZF. The differential {{is a limited}} slip variety.|$|R

50|$|For instance, a gear {{mounted on}} a shaft might use a male spline on the shaft that matches the female spline on the gear. The splines on the pictured drive shaft match with the female splines {{in the center of}} the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate,</b> while the smooth tip of the axle is {{supported}} in the pilot bearing in the flywheel. An alternative to splines is a keyway and key, though splines provide a longer fatigue life.|$|E
50|$|A {{clutch servo}} {{powered by the}} vacuum at the {{induction}} manifold operated the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operated a solenoid valve {{so that when the}} gear lever was moved the clutch was disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.|$|E
50|$|Slipping {{the clutch}} (sometimes {{referred}} to as feathering the clutch) is a term used by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and releases the clutch to achieve some movement of the car. It's called slipping because the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> will slip against the flywheel surface when such an action is performed. Slipping the clutch {{is known to be}} hard on the clutch surface due to the sliding friction created.|$|E
5000|$|The clutch is {{typically}} disengaged by a thrust bearing that makes contact with pressure petals on the <b>clutch</b> ring <b>plate</b> and pushes them inward {{to release the}} clutch pad friction. Normally the bearing remains retracted away from the petals and does not spin. However, the bearing can be [...] "burned out" [...] and damaged by using the clutch pedal as a foot rest, which causes the bearing to spin continuously from touching the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R

Product ranges include cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, flywheels, flywheel housings, transmission casings, <b>clutch</b> <b>plates,</b> brake drums, intake manifolds and clutch housings for HCV, LCV and car segments.|$|R
50|$|When {{a car is}} {{in first}} gear, small {{variations}} in engine speed translate to large changes in acceleration and engine braking. However, {{with a combination of}} clutch control and careful use of engine speed, a much smoother ride can be achieved by allowing the clutch to slip. Variations in engine revs are not immediately translated into changes in drive shaft rotation speed, but rather the friction on the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> allows the drive shaft to gradually equalize with the speed of the engine.|$|E
50|$|Clutch control {{refers to}} the act of {{controlling}} {{the speed of a}} vehicle with a manual transmission by partially engaging the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate,</b> using the clutch pedal instead of (or in conjunction with) the accelerator pedal. The purpose of a clutch is in part to allow such control; in particular, a clutch provides transfer of torque between shafts spinning at different speeds. In the extreme, clutch control is used in performance driving, such as starting from a dead stop with the engine producing maximum torque at high RPM.|$|E
5000|$|... 1950: DNF, Jaguar XK120; {{clutch failure}} after 21 hours while lying third and {{catching}} the leader {{at a rate}} that would have seen the Jaguar in the lead before the full 24 hours had elapsedâ€”an effort that convinced William Lyons it was worth investing in success at Le Mans. Explaining the clutch failure, Jim McCraw wrote: [...] "Leslie Johnson ran as high as second during the middle portion of the race, but, in order to save brake wear, he kept downshifting the transmission at high speeds and eventually blew the clutch, which prompted the substitution of a solid-disc <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> from then on." ...|$|E
40|$|To {{transmit}} the drive, {{in form of}} rotation, produced during the combustion process in the cylinders to the gearbox, where it is transformed into different ratios, a coupling element is needed. This is {{the task of the}} clutch. The clutch is the part that enables a gear change. A disconnection between constantly-spinning crankshaft and the gearbox must be realized to be able to stand still as well as to change gears. Among many principles in design, the classical friction <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> has established it ` position in vehicle design. Especially, race car rules predict the use of conventional multi <b>plate</b> <b>clutches</b> (in some cases single <b>plate</b> <b>clutches</b> are also used) which transmit engine torque into the gearbox via friction. A traditional multi <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> is composed of three basic elements: the flywheel, the pressure <b>plate</b> and the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> (in race car practice, 4 plates are the limit). The flywheel is attached {{to the end of the}} main crankshaft and the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> are attached to the gearbox input shaft using a spline. When a axial load is applied to the assembly, the friction produced between plates prevents any rotation between them and a solid drive is established without any additional mechanical engagement. While a breakthrough was made with the new generation clutches in the 1980 `s, made with Carbon as friction material, the current situation in this field of the transmission is saturated. All inventions lead to some improvements in the general design field, where the main improvement happens in the whole concept of the transmission (DSG or CVT) ...|$|R
50|$|Hot rolling is used {{mainly to}} produce sheet metal or simple cross sections, such as rail tracks. Other typical uses for hot rolled metal {{includes}} truck frames, automotive wheels, pipe and tubular, water heaters, agriculture equipment, strappings, stampings, compressor shells, railcar components, wheel rims, metal buildings, railroad hopper cars, doors, shelving, discs, guard rails, automotive <b>clutch</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a {{technical}} {{change in the way}} oil pressure is regulated in the clutch, i.e. FWD switching. Oil pressure on the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> is now regulated by a centrifugal valve integrated in the electric axial six piston oil pump. Compared to the previous generation, the Haldex 5 system is 1.4 kg lighter (ca. 6.6 kg without oil) and simpler as it does not contain an oil pressure accumulator.|$|R
5000|$|Transmission {{is through}} a single -inch <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> along with a 4-speed-and-reverse gear box. The hand brake {{operated}} a transmission brake attached to the rear end of the gear box. A conventional Hardy Spicer prop shaft connected it to the axle. The rear axle is a worm and wheel with underslung worm, making for a low floor. Ratios 5.25, 5.75, 6.25/1. The brakes are Lockheed hydraulic acting on -inch drums with one leading and one trailing shoe on all 4 wheels. The petrol tank is at the rear, unlike Super 7â€™s which had a gravity tank. Fuel was pumped either by Autovac or SU Petrolift.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} the Rolls-Royce C6SFL 12.17l six-cylinder {{supercharged}} diesel. This engine was {{more powerful than}} other tractors of this age and weight, with 190 hp at the engine and 150 drawbar hp. However the fuel consumption was also high, at 9.8 gallons per hour at full rate. The transmission was initially three-speed manual and a high-low-reverse splitter gearbox with a relatively small Borg & Beck 18 inch single plate dry clutch. This small <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> {{had a reputation for}} early failure if worked hard. An improvement from mid-production was the option of a Rolls-Royce hydraulic torque converter, the same converters Rolls-Royce were supplying with the same engines for the new British Rail DMU fleet.|$|E
50|$|The gearbox {{differed}} {{little from}} the RC30â€™s; in fact, it {{even had the}} same gear ratios with only the primary and secondary ratios changed. The one-way sprag clutch was also carried over from the RC30 but was of NR750 design. This sprag clutch was a forerunner to todayâ€™s slipper clutches affording a slight amount of slip on overrun {{in the attempt to}} stop the back wheel from locking. The clutch plates were also from the NR750 and were much larger in diameter compared to the ones used in the RC30. The first gear was so tall that the increase in <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> diameter improved their longevity. All gears in the RC45â€™s gearbox were undercut to reduce the chance of a gear disengaging.|$|E
50|$|While {{most other}} {{manufacturers}} use wet clutches (with the spinning parts bathed in oil) Ducati previously used multiplate dry clutches {{in many of}} their motorcycles. The dry clutch eliminates the power loss from oil viscosity drag on the engine, even though the engagement {{may not be as}} smooth as the oil-bath versions, but the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> can wear more rapidly. Ducati has converted to wet clutches across their current product lines.|$|R
40|$|Multi <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} part in the power transmission systems. Good design of clutch provides better engine performance. Multi <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> is most widely used in racing cars and heavy duty vehicle where high torque transmission required and limited space is available. In this paper we designed a multi <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> by using empirical formulae. A model of multi <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> has been generated in CATIA V 5 and then imported in ANSYS workbench for Automobile Applications. We have conducted structural analysis by varying the friction surfaces material and keeping base material aluminium same. By seeing the results, Comparison is done for both materials to validate better lining material for multi <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> by doing analysis on clutch with help of ANSYS Workbench software for find out which material is best for the lining of friction surfaces...|$|R

50|$|Engine braking avoids wear on brakes, and {{can help}} a driver {{maintain}} control of the vehicle. Active use of engine braking by shifting into a lower gear is can help control speed while driving down very steep and long slopes, saving the brakes from overheating or excessive wear. If it is applied before the brakes have been used, it can leave the brakes available to make emergency stops. The desired speed is maintained by using engine braking to counteract gravitational acceleration. Potentially transmission wear caused by engine braking can be mitigated by certain techniques. Slipping the clutch to complete a downshift wears the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> as it slows the vehicle, doing {{the job of the}} brake pads or shoes. A well-executed rev-match in the same setting minimizes stresses on transmission components, so engine braking does the work of slowing the vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Additional engine changes {{include a}} lighter {{camshaft}} sprocket and increased valve spring pressure (two springs per intake valve) which allow for higher revving. There are new piston rings that slide with less friction and increased internal engine oil flow. Redline is now 14,200 rpm, 700 rpm {{higher than the}} previous year's F4. To increase the bike's pulling capabilities at high speeds, 5th and 6th gears have been shortened slightly and the rear sprocket was enlarged from 45 teeth to 46.Also adding one <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> for greater durability to now making 8. The oiling holes in the camshafts have been enlarged by 0.5 mm (to 2.5 mm) and piston ring friction has been decreased to aid cooling at the higher rev ceiling. Spring pressures on the intake and exhaust valves have been increased to avoid valve float. Also, there are now two valve springs (inner and outer) on the intake side instead of the single item that resides on the exhaust side.|$|E
50|$|Cross-drive {{transmissions}} also {{improved the}} drivability of the manual transmissions then in use. Manual transmissions were heavy and tiring to drive, requiring skill and strength from the driver, and also frequent adjustments as the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> wore. The pre-selector gearbox {{had been used}} to simplify the driving task, but at the cost of mechanical complexity. The cross-drive transmissions offered a mechanically-actuated self-changing gearbox, where the ratio selection could be either manual, automatic, or by pre-selection.|$|R
50|$|If one axle loses grip, {{different}} rotational speeds arise {{inside the}} differential which {{result in an}} increase in axial forces that force the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> to close. Once closed, the output shaft is locked resulting in the diversion {{of the majority of the}} torque to the axle achieving better traction. In the Crown Gear differential up to 85% of torque can flow to the rear, and up to 70% of torque can be diverted to the front axle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Nondestructive {{evaluation}} (NDE) {{represents an}} important {{phase in the}} life cycle of a product to detect defects both in service and in production. NDE techniques most commonly used to detect surface defects are visual inspection and methods based on eddy current and ultrasound. Laser and non-contact sensors have been recently used to inspect ultrasonically without contact. Components with complex geometry are usually inspected combining several NDE techniques, or simply visually where analysis and evaluation of results are performed by an operator based on specific parameters of acceptance. This last method is currently used to inspect the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> since their complex geometry, for the presence of grooves, limits the use of other methods. This work shows the possibility of using a non-contact ultrasonic technique and guided waves (Lamb) to detect surface defects in <b>clutch</b> <b>plates.</b> An appropriate source/receiver configuration allows to overcome the limitations due to the complexity of the geometry. This technique allows, compared to the visual inspection, to detect smaller and internal defects, and to obtain objective results, not depending on the evaluation of the operator. The inspection method can be very fast and applicable in the production line by using a fully automated control system...|$|R
