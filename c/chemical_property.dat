5|$|Electronegativity is a <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> that {{describes}} the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E
25|$|Electronegativity, symbol χ, is a <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> that {{describes}} the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated electronegativity number, the more an element or compound attracts electrons towards it.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} properties of deuterium compounds can exhibit significant kinetic isotope effects and other physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> differences from the hydrogen analogs. D2O, for example, is more viscous than H2O. Chemically, {{there are differences}} in bond energy and length for compounds of heavy hydrogen isotopes compared to normal hydrogen, which are larger than the isotopic differences in any other element. Bonds involving deuterium and tritium are somewhat stronger than the corresponding bonds in hydrogen, and these differences are enough to cause significant changes in biological reactions. Pharmaceutical firms are interested in the fact that deuterium is harder to remove from carbon than hydrogen.|$|E

25|$|Poisonous {{compounds}} may {{be useful}} either for their toxicity, or, more often, because of another <b>chemical</b> <b>property,</b> such as specific chemical reactivity. Poisons are widely used in industry and agriculture, as chemical reagents, solvents or complexing reagents, e.g. carbon monoxide, methanol and sodium cyanide, respectively. They are less common in household use, with occasional exceptions such as ammonia and methanol. For instance, phosgene is a highly reactive nucleophile acceptor, which makes it an excellent reagent for polymerizing diols and diamines to produce polycarbonate and polyurethane plastics. For this use, millions of tons are produced annually. However, the same reactivity makes it also highly reactive towards proteins in human tissue and thus highly toxic. In fact, phosgene {{has been used as}} a chemical weapon. It can be contrasted with mustard gas, which has only been produced for chemical weapons uses, as it has no particular industrial use.|$|E
500|$|This carbene, the {{forerunner of}} a large family of carbenes with the imidazol-2-ylidene core, {{was found to be}} indefinitely stable at room {{temperature}} (in the absence of oxygen and moisture), and melted at 240–241°C without decomposition. [...] Another interesting <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> of this ylidic compound was a characteristic resonance in the 13C NMR spectrum at 211 ppm for the carbenic atom. The X-ray structure revealed longer N–C bond lengths in the ring of the carbene than in the parent imidazolium compound, indicating that there was very little double bond character to these bonds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the term}} [...] "aromatic" [...] was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. [...] Hofmann used the term for a class [...] of benzene compounds, many of which have odors (aromas), unlike pure saturated hydrocarbons. Aromaticity as a <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> bears no general relationship with the olfactory properties of such compounds (how they smell), although in 1855, before the structure of benzene or organic compounds was understood, chemists like Hofmann were beginning to understand that odiferous molecules from plants, such as terpenes, had chemical properties that we recognize today are similar to unsaturated petroleum hydrocarbons like benzene.|$|E

To determine the soil <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> such as pH, organic matter (OM) (g/kg), total nitrogen (TN) %, total carbon (TC) %, C/N ratio, total phosphorus (TP) (g/kg), total potassium (TK) (g/kg), available phosphorus (AP) (mg/kg), available potassium (AK) (mg/kg), and hydrolysable nitrogen (HN) (mg/kg), the grid system (3 × 3 m 2) was applied for collecting the soil samples over the entire gap area at 20 cm depth. The results showed that most of the soil <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> varied significantly with respect to the gap sizes and the seasons. The summer season had greatly influenced all the <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> when compared with the winter season. However, the soil <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> exhibited irregular variation in different gap sizes. Moreover, a strong significant positive correlation among TN, TC, C/N, and OM was found.
