30|$|Comparing {{the results}} of the Hu and Wang model, the most SNR gain about 4 [*]dB is {{obtained}} in N 0 (pure tone) By analyzing the segregated speeches, we found that the Hu and Wang model groups many target units into the background. It is mainly because some segments include both target units and interference units. These kinds of segments are divided into small ones by harmonic order in our system. Therefore, it leads to the significant SNR gain. For N 2 (<b>click</b> <b>noise),</b> the SNR gain also due to the segmentation (see Figure 8). The difference is that the Hu and Wang model groups many interference units into foreground. It should be noticed that the gains of PESQ scores on these two noises are different, about 0.1 on N 0 and 0.5 on N 2, comparing with the Hu and Wang model. It implies that the second error, grouping intrusion units into foreground, has a greater impact on speech perceptual quality.|$|E

40|$|The NCP 2820 is a {{cost-effective}} mono Class-D audio power amplifier capable of delivering 2. 65 W of continuous average power to 4. 0 � from a 5. 0 V supply in a Bridge Tied Load (BTL) configuration. Under the same conditions, the output power stage can provide 1. 4 W to a 8. 0 � BTL load {{with less than}} 1 % THD+N. For cellular handsets or PDAs it offers space and cost savings because no output filter is required when using inductive tranducers. With more than 90 % efficiency and very low shutdown current, it increases the lifetime of your battery and drastically lowers the junction temperature. The NCP 2820 processes analog inputs with a pulse width modulation technique that lowers output noise and THD when compared to a conventional sigma-delta modulator. The device allows independent gain while summing signals from various audio sources. Thus, in cellular handsets, the earpiece, the loudspeaker and even the melody ringer can be driven with a single NCP 2820. Due to its low 42 ��V noise floor, A-weighted, a clean listening is guaranteed no matter the load sensitivity. With zero pop and <b>click</b> <b>noise</b> performance NCP 2820 A turns on within 1 ms versus 9 ms for NCP 2820 version...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in click model have established {{it as an}} attractive approach to infer document relevance. Most of these advances consider the user click/skip behavior as binary events but neglect {{the context in which}} a click happens. We show that real click behavior in industrial search engines is often noisy and not always a good indication of relevance. For a considerable percentage of clicks, users select what turn out to be irrelevant documents and these clicks should not be directly used as evidence for relevance inference. Thus in this paper, we put forward an observation that the relevance indication degree of a click is not a constant, but can be differentiated by user preferences and {{the context in which the}} user makes her click decision. In particular, to interpret the click behavior discriminatingly, we propose a Noise-aware Click Model (NCM) by characterizing the noise degree of a click, which indicates the quality of the click for inferring relevance. Specifically, the lower the <b>click</b> <b>noise</b> is, the more important the click is in its role for relevance inference. To verify the necessity of explicitly accounting for the uninformative noise in a user click, we conducted experiments on a billion-scale dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that as compared with two state-of-theart click models in Web Search, NCM can better interpret user click behavior and achieve significant improvements in terms of both perplexity and NDCG...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with continuous-time autoregressive (CAR) processes and their estimation using Bayesian techniques. First, the Bayesian approach to time series modelling is described, then established methods in the literature for estimating CAR processes are reviewed. The first problem that is addressed is that of estimating the CAR model parameters from discrete-time noisy observations when the model order P is known. Observations can be uniformly or non-uniformly sampled unlike discrete-time models where observations have to be uniform. A deterministic method is initially proposed that consists of an iterative least-squares (LS) algorithm which uses {{the output of the}} Kalman smoother as an estimate of the derivatives up to order (P - 1). The P th order derivative is approximated by a difference operator. The Kalman filter is then run with those parameters and the process is repeated until convergence. A bias in the parameter estimation is unavoidable for finite sampling interval and sample size. Results are compared to existing deterministic methods. The problem is then cast into a Bayesian framework. The posterior distribution is not analytical tractable, therefore we resort to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for simulating samples from the required distributions. A proposed based on the LS estimate is developed and combined with the random walk proposal to have a few successive samples drawn from each proposal. Performance is quantified in terms of the autocorrelation function. The more general case of data originating from a process of unknown order is then considered. Classical model selection criteria are defined in terms of the goodness of fit plus a penalty factor which penalizes complex models compared to simpler ones. As model selection is not the ultimate goal of our research, we resort to MCMC techniques. In particular, the reversible-jump MCMC method, which can move between models of different dimensionality in a flexible way, is used. A partial and a full-vector proposal are used and simulation results are presented. Results are compared to classical model selection techniques. We use the CAR process for restoring audio recordings and speech segments that are corrupted by broadband noise is tackled. The problem of <b>click</b> <b>noise</b> is also tackled.
