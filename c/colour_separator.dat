40|$|This work {{describes}} the experimental investigation of sediment transport, originated by {{the interaction between}} the flow around an elongated pier and an erodible bed of sediments. Sediment transport is strongly influenced by the horseshoe vortex that develops immediately upstream of the pier. The horseshoe vortex excavates the sediment bed originating a scour hole. As the sediments are suspended in the flow, they travel downstream and eventually sediment in regions of lower turbulence. Experiments were conducted in a 0. 4 m wide and 16. 7 m long flume. The test section consisted of a vertical rectangular pier with round nose shapes, 4 cm wide and 8 cm long. The pier was mounted vertically in a box, 10 cm deep and 1. 8 m long, filled in with uniform sand with a mean diameter of 0. 376 Â mm. For comparison purposes, the flow around the pier in case of a rigid flat bed with the same roughness was also studied. The flow rate was controlled by a gate valve and measured by an electromagnetic flow meter (ABB, model IDE 41 F). Water depth was controlled by a sluice gate at the downstream extremity of the flume. Measurements were made using two-component Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA). The light source was an Argon-ion Laser (Spectra-Physics, Model 177 -G 0232) and the optical system was a Dantec 60 X 41 FiberFlow, combined with an 85 mm probe together with a beam expander and 500 mm front lens, used in forward scatter mode. A <b>colour</b> <b>separator</b> (Dantec 55 X 35) split the collected light into 2 wavelengths before reaching the corresponding photomultipliers (Dantec 57 X 18). LDA data acquisition and processing were performed using BSA F 60 Flow Analyser (Dantec). Simultaneous measurements of longitudinal (horizontal) and vertical velocities were made using the overlapped coincidence method. The flow above the scour hole was studied for water depths of 5 and 15 cm and mean horizontal approach velocities between 0. 17 and 0. 30 ms- 1. Results include horizontal and vertical velocity fields, velocities probability density functions and Reynolds stresses...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} the free surface flow and clear water scour around an elongated vertical pier. Measurements were made using two-component Laser Doppler Anemometry, {{with the main}} objective of studying the turbulent sediment transport around elongated piers. The flow around a circular pier {{has been the subject}} of a large number of studies (e. g. Dargahi (1989), Graf (1998) Roulund et al. (2005)). When the pier is mounted on a sediment bed, the tri-dimensional flow field around the pier interacts with the bed of sediments (either cohesive or cohesionless) and originates clear water scour. The flow around a pier is characterized by the existence of a horseshoe vortex in front of the pier, which is responsible for the evolution of the scour process. The scour hole increases both in depth and in extension towards upstream, while the horseshoe vortex continues to excavate the sediment slope. As the sediments are suspended in the flow, they travel downstream and eventually fall and sediment in regions of lower turbulence. The scour cavity dimensions increase both upstream and downstream, until equilibrium is achieved. This phenomenon is usually studied by means of mathematical modelling (Kirkil et al. 2008, Kirkil et al. 2009), due to the experimental complexity of the scour process. The experimental work concerning initial conditions (Roulund et al., 2005), i. e. prior to scour cavities developing, can however provide adequate validation of models. Experiments were conducted in a 0. 4 m wide and 16. 7 m long flume, and the test section was installed approximately 9. 7 m downstream the beginning of the flume. The test section consisted of a rectangular vertical pier with round nose shapes. The pier was 4 cm wide and 8 cm long. Two alternative experimental configurations were studied: (i) the flow over a flat bottom and (ii) the flow over a sediment bed. In case (i) the pier was mounted in an acrylic plate 1. 8 m long, were a layer of uniform sand with 0. 376 mm mean diameter was glued, in order to reproduce the natural roughness of a river stream. In case (ii) the pier was mounted in a box, 10 cm deep and 1. 8 m long, filled in with uniform sand with a mean diameter of 0. 376 mm. The flow was controlled by a gate valve and measured by an electromagnetic flow meter (ABB, model IDE 41 F). Water depth was controlled by a sluice gate at the downstream extremity of the flume. The light source was an Argon-ion Laser (Spectra-Physics, Model 177 -G 0232) and the optical system was a Dantec 60 X 41 FiberFlow, including a 40 MHz frequency shifter and colour separation, combined with an 85 mm probe together with a beam expander and 500 mm front lens. A <b>colour</b> <b>separator</b> (55 X 35) split the collected light into 2 wavelengths before reaching the corresponding photomultipliers (Dantec 57 Ã 18). LDA data processing and acquisition was performed using BSA F 60 Flow analyser (Dantec). Simultaneous measurements of longitudinal (horizontal) and vertical velocities were made using the overlapped coincidence method. The flow was studied for water depths of 5 and 15 cm and mean horizontal approach velocities equal to 0. 17 and 0. 25 ms- 1. Measurements of horizontal and vertical velocities in the vicinity of an elongated pier show the strong interaction between the structure and the flow. In case (i) the flow decelerates as it approaches the pier, and is defected towards the bottom. In the wake of the pier there is a reverse flow until one pier diameter downstream, and then the flow starts to accelerate, as the influence of the pier disappears. In free surface flows Reynolds stresses usually present negative values, but in the present case, as the flow approaches the pier, Reynolds stresses become positive and increase. In case (ii) a similar flow pattern was found, but smaller turbulence intensities were measured...|$|E
