40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the factors affecting small scale <b>coffee</b> <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>Kenya.</b> The establishments under study were small-scale coffee farms in Githunguri District. It {{was to determine whether}} marketing factors, finances, government policies and physical and human resources affect coffee production in Githunguri District. Primary sources included use of questionnaires, observation and interviews. Secondary sources included desk research, library research on journals, text books and factory publications. The target population was over 700, 000 small-scale coffee producers in Kenya out of which the accessible population of 10, 000 producers drawn from Githunguri District in Kiambu County was selected which a sample size of 120 respondents was sampled. Stratified sampling technique was employed to compare views among coffee producers from the various coffee societies in the area. Data analysis was both qualitative and quantitative using descriptive statistics. Data presentation was in form of tables to help interpret findings and generate conclusions that aided solutions to identified problems. The research established that marketing factors, finances, government policies and physical and human resources greatly affected coffee production. The study recommended that the government should encourage coffee production by formulating favorable marketing factors and other policies and provide finances to small scale coffee producers. Producers on the other hand should strive to provide conducive working environment to their workers so as to sustain them in their farms. This will help to improve coffee yields and quality...|$|E
40|$|Coffee {{had for a}} {{long time}} been Kenya’s leading foreign {{exchange}} earner. In 1986 it accounted for 40 % of total foreign exchange earnings but this was to be the highest earnings ever since after that coffee contribution dropped continuously to stand at only 3 % in 2010. This was caused by a fall in coffee production from a peak of 128, 700 m. tons in 1987 / 1988 crop year to an average of 49, 088 m. tons {{in the last ten years}} with year 2010 recording a low production volume of 42, 000 m. tons. Since early 1990 s, the government liberalized the coffee sector believing that this would promote increased production and increase years since liberalization began, coffee production has declined and remained depressed and this phenomenon forms the research problem in which we ask: Is this drop in coffee production as a result o this study was therefore to find out the effects of liberalization on production of coffee in Kenya. The main objectives of the study were to find out how, removal of government controls, take farmers ’ committees and the removal of monopolies in the processing and marketing affected <b>coffee</b> <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>Kenya.</b> The study conducted a detailed case study on the effect of liberalization on coffee production in New Weithaga Farmers ’ Co-operative Union which was the main source of primary data.

40|$|Emerging {{challenges}} to farming drives farming systems {{to have three}} strategies; intensification options optimizing resources and technological innovations, firm diversification orchestrating interdependencies among sectoral boundaries, and transition to new system and trajectories. The trajectory shift emphasis on how new sectoral systems (dairy sector) emerges, {{and what is the}} link with the previous sectoral system (coffee) in terms of impact pathway. This paper, therefore, presents (1) how the transition from coffee to dairy based farming system in the coffee agroforestry systems of Murang?a County, central Kenya is taking place? (2) What derives for the transition from coffee to dairy based systems? And (3) what contributes the transition from intensified coffee based to dairy based farming system on household food security? Our data collection consists of three sources. Household survey (120), focus group discussions (9 FGDs) and stakeholders? interview (15 interviews). <b>Coffee</b> <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> has declined by 65 % in the last 30 years, and as much as 5 times in Murang?a County, a major coffee producing area. The dairy sector is, however, in opposite visualizing sharp increase in volume of production and price. The study finds that innovation process and actors? interaction differs for the coffee and dairy based systems. Actors in the coffee are limited, the system is highly centralized with limited options to farmers to process and market their product while the dairy sector is less informally controlled by demand based business, comparatively numerous actors with limited government intervention, various options to process and marketing products. Exponential increase in production cost which is a function of coffee diseases and institutional failure (financial and none financial) of the coffee sector while strong public and private intuitions are emerging in the dairy sector is the other driver of the transition...|$|E

Both certification regimes improved coffee returns, but Fairtrade was more effective in coffee processing, whereas Utz contributed to productivity. Under stagnating coffee prices, Fairtrade farmers increased their coffee specialization, while Utz farmers reduced coffee areas but increased yield. </p...|$|R
