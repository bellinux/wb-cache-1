60|$|Only {{very late}} did Burford come back, {{full of the}} account of the wreck and of the spoils, and the struggles between the wreckers for the flotsam and jetsam. There was much of savage {{brutality}} mated with a cool indifference truly horrible to Anne, and making her realise into what a den of robbers she had fallen, especially as these narratives were diversified by consultations over the Dutch letters and bills of exchange in the wrecked East Indiaman, and how to turn them to the best advantage. Barclay and Burford were so full of these subjects that they took comparatively little notice of the young lady, only when she rose to retire, Burford made a sort of apology that this little business had hindered his going after the parson. He heard that the Salamander was at the castle, and redcoats all about, he said, and if the Annick could be got out to- morrow they must sail any way; and if Pil was still so squeamish, a Popish priest <b>could</b> <b>couple</b> them in a leash as tight as a Fleet parson could. And then Peregrine demanded whether Burford thought a Fleet parson the English for a naval chaplain, and there was some boisterous laughter, during which Anne shut herself up in her room in something very like despair, with that one ray of hope that He who had brought her back from exile before would again save her from that terrible fate.|$|E

For instance, cytotoxic agents or siRNA could be encapsulated in liposomes or viral vectors that only become activated upon proteolytic cleavage by a target MMP. Finally, the tumor-targeting properties of MMP inhibitors offer a potential strategy for identifying small tumors. Researchers <b>could</b> <b>couple</b> MMP inhibitors to imaging agents to help detect tumors before they spread. Though initial trials yielded disappointing results, MMP inhibitors offer significant potential for improving cancer treatment by slowing the process of cancer cell invasion and metastasis.|$|E
50|$|The two-man turret was {{centrally}} located, and {{housed the}} tank's main armament, a 37 mm Skoda A7 gun with 90 rounds stored on board. It {{was equipped with}} a 7.92 mm machine gun {{to the right of}} the main ordnance. This turret machine gun was in a separate ball mount rather than a fixed coaxial mount. This meant the machine gun could be trained on targets independently. Alternatively, the commander/gunner <b>could</b> <b>couple</b> the machine gun internally to the main gun and use it as a coaxial machine gun. In all, over 1400 were manufactured. The chassis continued to be produced for Marder III (1942-1944) and Hetzer (1944-1945) tank destroyers, turretless assault guns, anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns.|$|E

50|$|In television, amateur radio, {{and other}} antenna {{installations}} and connections, baluns convert between impedances and symmetry of feedlines and antennas. For example, transformation of 300 Ω twin-lead or 450 Ω ladder line (balanced) and 75 Ω coaxial cable (unbalanced), or to directly connect a balanced antenna to unbalanced coaxial cable. To avoid feed line radiation, baluns are typically {{used as a}} form of common mode choke attached at the antenna feed point to prevent the coaxial cable from acting as an antenna and radiating power. This typically is needed when a balanced antenna (for instance, a dipole) is fed with coax; without a balun, the shield of the coax <b>could</b> <b>couple</b> with one side of the dipole, inducing common mode current, and becoming part of the antenna and unintentionally radiating.|$|E
50|$|The P.111 was {{designed}} as the smallest airframe which <b>could</b> <b>couple</b> an engine (Rolls-Royce Nene), an ejection seat (Martin-Baker), and a delta wing. The latter was aerodynamically thin and had a sweep angle of 45°. Without tip extensions the wing was strongly cropped at about 75% of the full delta. The aircraft could be flown with these wings or with one of two pairs of extensions, the larger ones making an almost perfect pointed delta shape. These extensions allowed {{an investigation of the}} aerodynamic effects of the tip shapes of delta wings. Unlike its contemporary the Avro 707, roll and attitude were both controlled by a pair of elevons. The fin had an unswept trailing edge and its tip also could be removed and altered, though it seems it always flew with a very pointed tip. The P.111 was fitted with one of the first fully powered control systems, hydraulically driven with electrical trim tabs. Because the Nene had a centrifugal compressor, the P.111 had a rather tubby fuselage, with an oval nose intake. The inward-retracting undercarriage had a noticeably wide track and a tall nosewheel leg placed it at 17° on the ground. The construction was all-metal {{with the exception of the}} wing extensions and the fin tip, which were of glass-reinforced plastic.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{retiring}} AWVR engineer Frank Barnes and conductor Will Colson, a new hire {{looking to}} turn his life around after an incident with his now estranged wife, are pulling several cars with SD40-2 #1206 from Stanton. Though originally aware of 777 coasting away from the Fuller train yard, they are ordered {{at the last minute}} to pull into a Repair-In-Place track, making it just in time as 777 races by and clipping the last few cars they are pulling. Barnes observes that the last car on 777 has an open knuckle, which means that if they could catch up to the train, they <b>could</b> <b>couple</b> their engine to 777 and use their own brakes to slow the train before it reaches Stanton. As Colson unhitches their cars to give them the best chance of catching up, Barnes reports his plan to Hooper and Galvin and warns them that the derailing idea will not work given 777's momentum, but Galvin threatens to fire Barnes if he continues. Given that AWVR has already given him a forced early retirement notice, Barnes ignores Galvin and sets 1206 on course to catch up with 777. As 777 passes Arklow, police attempt to shoot the fuel shutoff switch on the engine, but fail to hit it. As Barnes predicts, the train barrels through the derailers without slowing down or derailing. Hooper and Werner fully support Barnes' plan and take over control of the situation from Galvin.|$|E

40|$|The unusual {{adhesion}} G-protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) contain large extracellular N-terminal domains, which resemble cell-adhesion receptors, and C-terminal heptahelical domains, {{which may}} couple to G-proteins. These receptors are cleaved post-translationally between these domains into two fragments (NTF and CTF). Using the aGPCR latrophilin 1, we previously {{demonstrated that the}} fragments behave as independent cell-surface proteins. Upon binding the agonist, α-latrotoxin (LTX), latrophilin fragments reassemble and induce intracellular signaling. Our observations raised important questions: is the aGPCR signaling mediated by reassembled fragments or by any non-cleaved receptors? Also, can the fragments originating from distinct aGPCRs form hybrid complexes? To answer these questions, we created two types of chimerical constructs. One contained the CTF of latrophilin joined to the NTF of another aGPCR, EMR 2; the resulting protein did not bind LTX but, similar to latrophilin, <b>could</b> <b>couple</b> to G-proteins. In another construct, the NTF of latrophilin was fused with the C terminus of neurexin; this chimera bound LTX but could not signal via G-proteins. Both constructs were efficiently cleaved in cells. When the two constructs were co-expressed, their fragments could cross-interact, as shown by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, LTXN 4 C induced intracellular Ca 2 + signaling only in cells expressing both constructs but not each individual construct. Finally, we demonstrated that fragments of unrelated aGPCRs can be cross-immunoprecipitated from live tissues. Thus, (i) aGPCR fragments behave as independent proteins, (ii) the complementary fragments from distinct aGPCRs can cross-interact, and (iii) these cross-complexes are functionally active. This unusual cross-assembly of aGPCR fragments <b>could</b> <b>couple</b> cell-surface interactions to multiple signaling pathways...|$|E
