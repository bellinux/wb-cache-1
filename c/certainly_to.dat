5|$|According to John of Salisbury, {{who first}} {{reported}} {{this story in}} 1172 {{after the death of}} Thomas Becket, as a young clerk Roger was involved in a scandal involving a homosexual relationship with a boy named Walter. After Walter made the relationship public, Roger reacted by embroiling Walter in judicial case that ended with Walter's eyes being gouged out. When Walter then accused Roger of this crime, Roger persuaded a judge to condemn Walter to death by hanging. Becket supposedly was involved in the cover-up afterwards, by arranging with Hilary of Chichester and John of Coutances for Roger to swear an oath that he was innocent. According to John of Salisbury, Roger then went to Rome in 1152 and was cleared of involvement by Pope Eugene III. John of Salisbury further alleges that it was only after bribery that the pope cleared Roger. Frank Barlow, a medieval historian and Becket's biographer, points out in his biography of Becket that while Roger was accused of these crimes, and may even have been guilty of some sort of criminal homosexuality, John of Salisbury's motives for bringing up this story in 1172 were almost <b>certainly</b> <b>to</b> defame Roger. Such a story would naturally have put Roger in the worst possible light.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that whereas Roman vaults, like that of the Pantheon, and Byzantine vaults, like that at Hagia Sophia, were not protected from above (i.e. the vault from the inside was the same that one saw from the outside), the European architects of the Middle Ages, protected their vaults with wooden roofs. In other words, one will not see a Gothic vault from the outside. The reasons for this development are hypothetical, but the fact that the roofed basilica form preceded the era when vaults begin to be made is <b>certainly</b> <b>to</b> be taken into consideration. In other words, the traditional image of a roof took precedence over the vault.|$|E

By the end of the 18th century, Thomas Twining noted orange trees and a large plan of the complex suggests beds of various other fruits such as pineapples, pomegranates, bananas, limes and apples. The British, {{at the end of the}} 19th century thinned out a lot of the increasingly forested trees, replanted the cypresses and laid the gardens to lawns in their own taste.|$|E
25|$|Although Ciro Verdiani {{had been}} {{replaced}} and dispatched, he maintained his contacts and continued to meddle in Sicily. To spite Luca and their mutual superiors, in December 1949 he arranged for Jacopo Rizza of Oggi magazine to interview Giuliano and Pisciotta in the countryside near Salemi. The interview, published in successive issues of the weekly, caused a sensation and embarrassed the government. Verdiani did much more, meeting with Giuliano near Castelvetrano, also in December. He agreed to help Giuliano and Pisciotta into exile, although his ultimate aim was almost <b>certainly</b> <b>to</b> kill the bandits and claim credit for the deed.

500|$|It is {{believed}} that Shilkanni is a rendering of (U)shilkan, {{which in turn is}} derived from (O)sorkon – hence Osorkon IV – as first proposed by William F. Albright in 1956. This identification is accepted by several scholars while others remain uncertain or even skeptical. Shilkanni is reported by Assyrians as [...] "King of Musri": this location, once believed to be a country in northern Arabia by the orientalist Hans Alexander Winckler, is <b>certainly</b> <b>to</b> be identified with Egypt instead. In the same way, the [...] "Pir'u of Musri" [...] to whom Hanno of Gaza asked for help in 720 BC could only have been Osorkon IV. The identity of the biblical King So is somewhat less definite. Generally, an abbreviation of (O)so(rkon) is again considered the most likely by several scholars, but the concurrent hypothesis which equates So with the city of Sais, hence with King Tefnakht, is supported by a certain number of scholars.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert gave it 3 1/2 out of 4-stars {{and called}} the film [...] "a superbly drawn {{animated}} feature" [...] and, in his print review wrote, [...] "The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and <b>certainly</b> <b>to</b> Hamlet, is a learning experience {{as well as an}} entertainment." [...] On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to previous Disney films. Ebert and his partner Gene Siskel both gave the film a [...] "Thumbs Up" [...] but Siskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as Beauty and the Beast and was [...] "a good film, not a great one". Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called it [...] "an impressive, almost daunting achievement" [...] and felt that the film was [...] "spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney's feature-length animations", but was less enthusiastic {{toward the end of his}} review saying, [...] "Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids.

500|$|Contributing to psychedelia's {{emergence}} {{into the}} pop mainstream was {{the release of}} Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (May 1966) and the Beatles' Revolver (August 1966). Often {{considered one of the}} earliest albums in the canon of psychedelic rock, Pet Sounds contained many elements that would be incorporated into psychedelia, with its artful experiments, psychedelic lyrics based on emotional longings and self-doubts, elaborate sound effects and new sounds on both conventional and unconventional instruments. The album track [...] "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times" [...] contained the first use of theremin sounds on a rock record. Scholar Philip Auslander says that even though psychedelic music is not normally associated with the Beach Boys, the [...] "odd directions" [...] and experiments in Pet Sounds [...] "put it all on the map. ... basically that sort of opened the door — not for groups to be formed or to start to make music, but <b>certainly</b> <b>to</b> become as visible as say Jefferson Airplane or somebody like that." [...] Like Pet Sounds, Revolver explored musical soundscapes that could not be replicated in concert, even with the addition of an orchestra. The Beatles' May 1966 B-side [...] "Rain", recorded during the Revolver sessions, was the first pop recording to include reversed sounds. It makes full use of an assortment of studio tricks such as varispeed and backwards taping, combining them with a droning melody that further highlights a growing interest in non-Western musical form. Author Simon Philo believes the song to be [...] "the birth of British psychedelic rock". [...] Author Steve Turner recognises the Beatles' success in conveying an LSD-inspired worldview on Revolver, particularly on [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", as having [...] "opened the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)".|$|E

500|$|The {{most intense}} {{fighting}} involving 1 ATF since Long Tan, during Operation Bribie the Australians had suffered their highest casualties since August 1966. In {{terms of the}} number of Viet Cong bodies recovered compared to their own losses it was the worst result they had experienced in Vietnam to that point, while the task force had also been unable to destroy D445 Battalion. The results of the fighting continued to be debated long after its conclusion, and while Graham felt that 6 RAR had inflicted severe casualties on the Viet Cong and that the battle later had far reaching effects on the insurgency in Phuoc Tuy province, Vincent believed that any success had only been marginal at best. <b>Certainly</b> <b>to</b> many of the Australian soldiers that fought it, the battle had been no victory. Private Robin Harris of 5 Platoon later wrote: [...] "I think that on this occasion Charlie's losses were overstated. It was us who had copped a hiding." [...] This view was shared by APC commander David Clifton when he recalled: [...] "We had been soundly thrashed on Operation Bribie." [...] Perhaps though, as Mackay later wrote, the [...] "truth of Operation Bribie" [...] was that the Australians and Viet Cong had [...] "thoroughly belted each other". Overall, the Australians had lost the operational strength of a platoon, while the Viet Cong had effectively lost a company; arguably though it was questionable if such attrition would achieve any long-term gains in Phuoc Tuy for the Australians. The battle had a lasting effect on 1 ATF, and ultimately resulted in a number of measures to overcome a perceived weakness in firepower, while also confirming the need to limit the Viet Cong's freedom of movement.|$|E

2500|$|The precise {{reasons for}} Ottaway's {{elevation}} to the captaincy in 1872 are not known.

Alcock was injured playing for Old Harrovians some time before the international, and, writes Southwick, [...] "it being too late to call a committee meeting... it fell, almost <b>certainly,</b> <b>to</b> Alcock, and Alcock alone, [...] who would fill the breach." [...] The Field, on the other hand, suggested that {{the decision was made}} by general acclaim, writing: [...] "Mr C.J.

2500|$|The {{philosophy}} of tàijíquán is that, if one uses hardness to resist violent force, then {{both sides are}} <b>certainly</b> <b>to</b> be injured {{at least to some}} degree. Such injury, according to tàijíquán, is a natural consequence of meeting brute force with brute force. Instead, students are taught not to directly fight or resist an incoming force, but to meet it in softness and follow its motion while remaining in physical contact until the incoming force of attack exhausts itself or can be safely redirected, meeting yang with yin. When done correctly, this yin/yang or yang/yin balance in combat, or in a broader philosophical sense, is a primary goal of tàijíquán training. Lao Tzŭ provided the archetype for this in the Tao Te Ching when he wrote, [...] "The soft and the pliable will defeat the hard and strong." ...|$|E
