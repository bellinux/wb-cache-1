40|$|Abstract—This paper {{conducts a}} formal {{study of the}} shot {{boundary}} detection problem. First, a general formal framework of shot boundary detection techniques is proposed. Three critical techniques, i. e., the representation of visual content, the construction of <b>continuity</b> <b>signal</b> and the classification of continuity values, are identified and formulated in the perspective of pattern recognition. Meanwhile, the major challenges to the framework are identified. Second, {{a comprehensive review of}} the existing approaches is conducted. The representative approaches are categorized and compared according to their roles in the formal framework. Based on the comparison of the existing approaches, optimal criteria for each module of the framework are discussed, which will provide practical guide for developing novel methods. Third, with all the above issues considered, we present a unified shot boundary detection system based on graph partition model. Extensive experiments are carried out on the platform of TRECVID. The experiments not only verify the optimal criteria discussed above, but also show that the proposed approach is {{among the best in the}} evaluation of TRECVID 2005. Finally, we conclude the paper and present some further discussions on what shot boundary detection can learn from other related fields.

40|$|A major {{disadvantage}} {{of the current}} automated speech recognition systems is that they cannot {{make a distinction between}} background noise and speech, and interpret all input as speech. Tjeerd Andringa describes this in the first chapter of his thesis, called <b>Continuity</b> Preserving <b>Signal</b> Processing (CPSP) (Andringa, 2002). He and the company Human Quality Speech Technologies (HuQ for short) work on techniques that use characteristics of the human voice to separate speech from noise. In this process, voiced (Periodic) and unvoiced (aperiodic) parts are treated separately. Even though both voiced and unvoiced parts can serve as a basis for speech recognition, the unvoiced parts are more difficult to separate from the noise than the (robust) voiced parts. A tool is needed that can predict which voiceless parts (either in the future or in the past) can be expected (chapter 7, paragraph 2 of Andringa, 2002), using knowledge (or hypotheses) about the voiced parts of the signal. In this research, a perl script creates a language model of a corpus of spontaneously spoken language by extracting phonotactical rules from it. Phonotactical rules are rules that describe which sequences of letters, or in this case phonemes, exist in a language. With this language model, a guided search can be conducted for the correct voiceless phonemes. Goal of this research is to investigate the usefulness of knowledge gathered from a corpus in speech recognition. Two corpora with spoken Dutch have been selected for this purpose. They will be tested for representativeness. Representative language models created from the corpora will be tested for usefulness. There will be variations in the amount of data and knowledge, and a test is conducted to find out whether different speaking styles require different models to represent them. This paper is built up as follows: Chapter 1 is the theoretical background behind the research. It explains how current automated speech recognition works and how it fails, and proposes a new approach, using <b>Continuity</b> Preserving <b>Signal</b> Processing and language models. Chapter 2 presents the corpora used in this paper. Chapter 3 talks more about the language models used to improve automated speech recognition, and the test method. Chapter 4 tests the reliability of the language models created from the corpora outlined in chapter 2, while chapter 5 tests their usefulness, varying several parameters in testing. Finally, chapter 6 concludes and discusses the results. ...|$|R

40|$|Maintaining {{multimedia}} sessions {{by means}} of SIP [3] signaling has often been termed as application layer mo-bility management scheme [5]. There have been numerous proposals [1], [4], [2] to support different types of mobil-ity using SIP signaling which is generally used {{to set up and}} tear down the multimedia stream. Mobility manage-ment in heterogeneous networks plays a very important role since the user could be moving between multiple types of access networks involving many service providers dur-ing a multimedia session. These access networks could be 802. 11 b, CDPD, or GPRS based network supporting DHCP or PPP servers in the networks. The movement of the mobile host can be between the access networks where each access network may belong to the same subnet, same domain or different one. In this case the end-client would have access to both the networks at the same time, but con-nectivity to the network would be determined by any local policy defined in the client itself such as signal strength or any other measurement based on QoS parameter of the traffic.

The physical <b>continuity</b> of the <b>signal,</b> in which real silent pauses between words are lacking, makes it a difficult task.

Results The behavioral results showed that words were segmented better when stress was placed on the final syllables than when it was placed on the middle or first syllable. The electrophysiological results showed an increase in the amplitude of the P 2 component, which seemed to be sensitive to word-stress and its location within words. Conclusion The results demonstrated that listeners can integrate specific prosodic and distributional cues when segmenting speech.

40|$|The lexicon {{contains}} discrete entries, {{which must}} be located in speech input in order for speech to be understood; but the <b>continuity</b> of speech <b>signals</b> means that lexical access from spoken input involves a segmentation problem for listeners.

Mature language users {{in possession of a}} lexicon might be thought to be able to avoid explicit segmentation of speech by relying on information from successful lexical access; however, evidence from adult perceptual studies indicates that listeners do use explicit segmentation procedures. These procedures differ across languages and seem to exploit language-specific rhythmic structure. Efficient as these procedures are, they may not have been developed in response to statistical properties of the input, because bilinguals, equally competent in two languages, apparently only possess one rhythmic segmentation procedure. The origin of rhythmic segmentation may therefore lie in the infant's exploitation of rhythm to solve the segmentation problem and gain a first toehold on lexical acquisition.

40|$|During an {{autoland}} {{flight test}} of Stanford’s Integrity Beacon Landing System in October 1994, one approach was aborted before landing {{due to a}} temporary satellite outage. Analysis showed that both the aircraft and ground reference GPS receivers lost lock on one satellite for six seconds. In subsequent weeks, we observed similar outages {{on most of the}} Block II satellites. Analysis of this data did not indicate a cause for these outages. According to the satellite operators, this is a generic spacecraft problem. Command uplinks to Block II (but not IIA) satellites occasionally cause a conflict in the spacecraft computer. A conflict causes the spacecraft to emit a non-standard PRN code during one navigation data subframe (six seconds). These conflicts occur roughly 0. 3 times per satellite per day. A simple Monte Carlo analysis shows that, in the worst case, this phenomenon could reduce availability of GPS precision landing systems by a factor of ten. This type of outage is not described in the standard literature on GPS spacecraft reliability, nor is it monitored by the FAA’s Performance Analysis Network (PAN).
