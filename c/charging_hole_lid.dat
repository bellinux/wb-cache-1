40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{that the}} superconducting cosmic strings can be connected to an electrically <b>charged</b> black <b>hole,</b> and can be considerd as the hair of black hole. What the no-hair theorems show is that {{a large amount of}} information is lost when a body collapses to form a black hole. In addition, the no-hair theorem has not been proved for the Yang-Mills field. This paper proves and claims that the superconducting cosmic strings can be connected to an electrically <b>charged</b> <b>hole</b> when the current inside these strings and black holes approaches the critical value. Because, this state is the final state of the gravitational collapse, and the event horizon would be destroyed in this state. Therefore, these strings should be considered as hair of the <b>charged</b> black <b>holes,</b> and may be titled as BHCS (Black Hole Connected Strings). This means that at least the <b>charged</b> black <b>holes</b> have the hair.

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} fracture in concrete due to the deflagration phenomenon. For this purpose, the electric discharge impulse crushing method was selected, with liquid nitromethane (NM) taken as the deflagration agent. Employing this technique, NM is set inside <b>charge</b> <b>holes</b> and initiated by electric discharge. The pressure generated by the deflagration of NM in a steel chamber was modeled using the Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation of state. The modeled and measured pressures agreed well and {{the applicability of the}} pressure model was validated. Then, assuming controlled splitting along the expected fracture surface in concrete, dynamic fracture process analysis (DFPA) based on two-dimensional dynamic finite element method was conducted. The results showed that fracture patterns predicted in the DFPAs agreed well with those obtained from experiments. The mechanism of fracture in concrete due to deflagration was then discussed in terms of the fracture process in the controlled splitting. Owing to stress interference from each <b>charge</b> <b>hole,</b> compressive stress zones (CSZs) formed above and below the middle regions between <b>charge</b> <b>holes</b> where maximum and minimum principle stresses were both in compression.
