40|$|This paper explores India's <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> {{the food}} and energy sectors over the coming decades. For a poor, large and densely {{populated}} country like India, many <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> energy intensive sectors are still open, as the present level of energy consumption is low and large resources are not yet committed to particular technologies. The <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> energy supply and energy intensive sectors can be explored simultaneously. Also, this will determine {{a substantial part of}} the demand for energy. The model explores the choices available for the development of Indian agriculture in order to see whether development should be land intensive, irrigation intensive, or fertilizer intensive. Since land can also be used for growing firewood, irrigation needs energy, and since fertilizer feedstocks are also important fuels, these choices are explored together with <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> energy supply and energy-intensive uses...|$|R
