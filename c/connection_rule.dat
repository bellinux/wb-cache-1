40|$|Within social choice theory, the {{new field}} of {{judgment}} aggregation aims at reaching collective judgments {{on a set of}} logically interconnected propositions. I investigate decision problems, in which the agenda is a network, composed of atomic propositions and connection rules between them. Networks can represent various realistic decision problems, including most concrete examples given in the literature. Nevertheless, networks are unexplored so far due to problems when modelling connection rules in standard propositional logic. By extending the logic, I prove that, for any network, decision rules satisfying the common conditions always exist, in contrast to the literature's emphasis on impossibilities. I also characterise the class of such decision rules, and propose a simple way to select a decision rule. judgment aggregation, collective inconsistency, possibility theorems, network, <b>connection</b> <b>rule,</b> formal logic, material conditional, subjunctive conditional...|$|E
40|$|The {{empirical}} harmonic {{potential function}} of elastic network models (ENMs) is augmented by three- and four-body interactions {{as well as}} by a parameter-free <b>connection</b> <b>rule.</b> In the new bend-twist-stretch (BTS) model the complexity of the parametrization is shifted from the spatial level of detail to the potential function, enabling an arbitrary coarse graining of the network. Compared to distance cutoff-based Hookean springs, the approach yields a more stable parametrization of coarse-grained ENMs for biomolecular dynamics. Traditional ENMs give rise to unbounded zero-frequency vibrations when (pseudo) atoms are connected to fewer than three neighbors. A large cutoff is therefore chosen in an ENM (about twice the average nearest-neighbor distance), resulting in many false-positive connections that reduce the spatial detail that can be resolved. More importantly, the required three-neighbor connectedness also limits the coarse graining, i. e., the network must be dense, even in the case of low-resolution structures that exhibit few spatial features. The new BTS model achieves such coarse graining by extending the ENM potential to include three-and four-atom interactions (bending and twisting, respectively) in addition to the traditional two-atom stretching. Thus, the BTS model enables reliable modeling of any three-dimensional graph irrespective of the atom connectedness. The additional potential terms were parametrized using continuum elastic theory of elastic rods, and the distance cutoff was replaced by a competitive Hebb <b>connection</b> <b>rule,</b> setting all free parameters in the model. We validate the approach on a carbon-alpha representation of adenylate kinase and illustrate its use with electron microscopy maps of E. coli RNA polymerase, E. coli ribosome, and eukaryotic chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide 1, which were difficult to model with traditional ENMs. For adenylate kinase, we find excellent reproduction (> 90 % overlap) of the ENM modes and B factors when BTS is applied to the carbon-alpha representation as well as to coarser descriptions. For the volumetric maps, coarse BTS yields similar motions (70 %– 90 % overlap) to those obtained from significantly denser representations with ENM. Our Python-based algorithms of ENM and BTS implementations are freely available...|$|E

A <b>connection</b> <b>rule</b> between their ground state energies is found which allows the calculation of the energy levels of pyramidal dots using those of cuboids of suitably chosen dimensions, whose solution requires considerably less computational effort. The purpose of this work is to provide experimentalists with a versatile and simple method to analyze their spectra.

40|$|KOSMOS is {{the first}} online morph server {{to be able to}} address the {{structural}} dynamics of DNA/RNA, proteins and even their complexes, such as ribo-somes. The key functions of KOSMOS are the harmonic and anharmonic analyses of macromol-ecules. In the harmonic analysis, normal mode analysis (NMA) based on an elastic network model (ENM) is performed, yielding vibrational modes and B-factor calculations, which provide insight into the potential biological functions of macromolecules based on their structural features. Anharmonic analysis involving elastic network interpolation (ENI) is used to generate plausible transition pathways between two given conformations by optimizing a topology-oriented cost function that guarantees a smooth transition without steric clashes. The quality of the computed pathways is evaluated based on their various facets, including topology, energy cost and compatibility with the NMA results. There are also two unique features of KOSMOS that distinguish it from other morph servers: (i) the versatility in the coarse-graining methods and (ii) the various connection rules in the ENM. The models enable us to analyze macro-molecular dynamics with the maximum degrees of freedom by combining a variety of ENMs from full-atom to coarse-grained, backbone and hybrid models with one <b>connection</b> <b>rule,</b> such as distance-cutoff, number-cutoff or chemical-cutoff.

This tool is to show all of the steps in-between the internal flow of morphological analysis and furthermore the user can modify the graph structure {{and the value of}} its node in the middle of processing. The steps are briefly introduced as follows (see figure 1) : The First step is a pre-processing one to utilize the already well-analyzed results for frequent occurrences. A well-formed substring table is maintained for the purpose of fetching up the well-analyzed word phrases. We call this well-formed substring table as “eojeol dictionary ” where “eojeol ” stands for a word phrase or a spacing unit in Korean. For example, this eojeol dictionary contains the word phrases when they occur more than 1000 times in the KAIST POS-tagged corpus. In the second step, each word phrase is segmented into all possible sequences of words (or morphemes). This module consists of five sub-modules: dictionary searching, numeric expression identification, phonetic change recovery, unknown word guessing, and POS <b>connection</b> <b>rule</b> checking. The third step is a rule-based post-processing to cut off the ridiculous tag sequences when its extended contexts can be considered. Finally, a Korean tagger is applied with considering the word-phrase structure.

40|$|We {{begin by}} {{describing}} the classical {{point of view}} on connections, their curvature, and p-curvature, in terms of maps of sheaves on a scheme. 1. 1. Connections and derivations. Let S be a scheme, and X smooth and finite of 1 -forms on type over S throughout. We have the rank-n vector bundle Ω 1 X/S X over S. We also fix some notation in the case that S is of characteristic p: in this case, we denote by FT the absolute Frobenius map for any scheme T, by X (p) = X ×S S the p-twist of X over S, where the map used in the fiber product is FS: S → S, and F: X → X (p) the relative Frobenius map. We will also consider OX (p) as a sub-module of OX, identified with the kernel of d: OX → Ω 1 X/S. Definition 1. 1. Given any coherent sheaf E on X, a connection (called S-connection in case of ambiguity) on E is an OS-linear map ∇ : E → Ω 1 X/S ⊗ E satisfying the <b>connection</b> <b>rule</b> ∇(fs) = f∇(s) + df ⊗ s. Example 1. 2. If E = OX, the map d: OX → Ω 1 X/S is a natural connection. More generally, every connection on OX is of the form f ↦ → df + fω, for some ω ∈ Ω 1 X/S. Indeed, because the difference of any two connections is linear, we observe: Lemma 1. 3. The set of S-connections on E naturally form a End(E) ⊗ Ω 1 X/S-pseudotorsor: i. e., if the set is non-empty, it is a torsor over End(E) ⊗ Ω 1 X/S. Definition 1. 4. We also recall that a derivation on OX is an OS-linear map θ: OX → OX to itself satisfying the Leibniz rule θ(fg) = θ(f) g + fθ(g). Associated to θ is a unique OX-linear homomorphism ˆ θ from Ω 1 X/S to OX, which gives θ upon precomposition with d: OX → Ω 1 X/S (see [1, p. 386]). If we apply these definitions after restriction to open subsets, we obtain natural sheaves of connections on E and derivations, which we denote by Conn(E) and Der respectively. Note however that although Der is an OX-module (indeed, by the above it is isomorphic to (Ω 1 X/S) ∨), Conn(E) is just a sheaf of sets. Observe that given ∇ ∈ Conn(E) (U) and θ ∈ Der(U), we obtain a map ∇θ: E |U → EU defined by ∇θ = (ˆ θ ⊗ 1) ◦ ∇. Example 1. 5. Again in the case E = OX, with X = P 1 S, let t be a coordinate for the line, and take θ = d. A differential form ω may be written as g(t) dt, dt so a connection ∇ is of the form ∇(f(t)) = df(t) + f(t) g(t) dt. Then ∇θ(f(t)) = + f(t) g(t); i. e., it is a 1 st-order linear differential operator. df(t) d...|$|E
