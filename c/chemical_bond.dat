5|$|The {{familiar}} Pauling electronegativity scale relies upon <b>chemical</b> <b>bond</b> energies, {{but such}} values have obviously not been measured for inert helium and neon. The Allen electronegativity scale, which relies only upon (measurable) atomic energies, identifies neon {{as the most}} electronegative element, closely followed by fluorine and helium.|$|E
5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually {{described in terms}} of an atomic radius. This {{is a measure of the}} distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a <b>chemical</b> <b>bond.</b> The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of <b>chemical</b> <b>bond,</b> the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E
5|$|The carbonâ€“fluorine bond, a {{component}} of all organofluorine compounds, is the strongest <b>chemical</b> <b>bond</b> in organic chemistry. Furthermore, this bond becomes shorter and stronger as more fluorine atoms {{are added to the}} same carbon on a given molecule. Because of this, fluoroalkanes {{are some of the most}} chemically stable organic compounds.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} to automatically validate the <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding</b> between the atoms during the structure construction {{on a computer}} screen using a chemical structure editor is developed. The technique involves the capturing of semantics of the electronLinks between the atoms involved in <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding.</b> An artificial intelligence component is developed to support the system to bring the decisions of valid <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding</b> based on the semantics of the electronLinks involved in bonding...|$|R
5|$|Metallic bonding can be {{classified}} {{as a type of}} covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a <b>chemical</b> <b>bond.</b> Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons are free to move as well as the ions. For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.|$|E
5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or <b>chemical</b> <b>bond</b> which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E
5|$|Four {{people have}} {{received}} two Nobel Prizes. Marie Curie received the Physics Prize in 1903 {{for her work}} on radioactivity and the Chemistry Prize in 1911 for the isolation of pure radium, making her {{the only person to}} be awarded a Nobel Prize in two different sciences. Linus Pauling was awarded the 1954 Chemistry Prize for his research into the <b>chemical</b> <b>bond</b> and its application to the structure of complex substances. Pauling was also awarded the Peace Prize in 1962 for his activism against nuclear weapons, making him the only laureate of two unshared prizes. John Bardeen received the Physics Prize twice: in 1956 for the invention of the transistor and in 1972 for the theory of superconductivity. Frederick Sanger received the prize twice in Chemistry: in 1958 for determining the structure of the insulin molecule and in 1980 for inventing a method of determining base sequences in DNA.|$|E

40|$|Models of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding</b> are {{essential}} for contemporary chemistry. Even the explosive development of the computational resources including, both hardware and software, cannot eliminate necessity of compact, intuitive, and efficient methods of representing chemically relevant information. The Lewis model of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding,</b> which was proposed eleven years before the formulation of quantum theory and preserves its pivotal role in chemical education and research for more than ninety years, is a vivid {{example of such a}} tool. As chemistry shifts to the nanoscale, it is becoming obvious that a certain shift of the paradigms of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding</b> is inescapable. For example, none of the currently available models of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding</b> can correctly predict structures and properties of sub-nano and nanoclusters. Clusters of main-group elements and transition metals are of major interest for nanotechnology with potential applications including catalysis, hydrogen storage, molecular conductors, drug development, nanodevices, etc. Thus, the goals of this dissertation were three-fold. Firstly, the dissertation introduces a novel approach to the description of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding</b> and the algorithm of the software performing analysis of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding,</b> which is called Adaptive Natural Density Partitioning. Secondly, the dissertation presents a series of studies of main-group element and transition-metal clusters in molecular beams, including obtaining their photoelectron spectra, establishing their structures, analyzing <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding,</b> and developing generalized model of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding.</b> Thirdly, the dissertation clarifies and develops certain methodological aspects of the quantum chemical computations dealing with clusters. This includes appraisal of the performance of several computational methods based on the Density Functional Theory and the development of global optimization software based on the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm...|$|R
50|$|Electromerism {{is a type}} of {{isomerism}} {{between a}} pair of molecules (electromers, electro-isomers) differing in the way electrons are distributed among the atoms and the connecting <b>chemical</b> <b>bonds.</b> In some literature electromerism is equated to valence tautomerism, a term usually reserved for tautomerism involving reconnecting <b>chemical</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>chemical</b> <b>bond</b> between atoms {{occurs as}} a result of {{electromagnetic}} interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean <b>chemical</b> <b>bond</b> lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E

50|$|In general, strong <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding</b> is {{associated}} with the sharing or transfer of electrons between the participating atoms.

40|$|AbstractThis {{article is}} a part of {{research}} for a doctoral thesis about improving teaching, enhancing representations and conceptual change of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding</b> for grade 10 students (15 - 16 year-old) in Thailand. The aim of this research is to explore studentsâ€™ understanding of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding</b> concepts. The sample consisted of 102 grade 10 students from three secondary schools in Chaiyaphum province in the northeast of Thailand. After studying this topic, the students responded to a 9 -item two-tier multiple- choice test bonding (Tan & Treagust, 1999), translated into the Thai language which covered the content of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding.</b> For the data analysis, we report the percentage of students who choose both parts of the two-tier items. The research findings show how many students have difficulty in understanding the concepts of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding,</b> and there is more potential for the formation of alternative conceptions. The problems identified with students understanding of the abstract concept of <b>chemical</b> <b>bonding</b> are useful for the design and development pedagogical content knowledge of chemistry teachers in secondary school...|$|R

25|$|While {{the idea}} of shared {{electron}} pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, quantum mechanics is needed {{to understand the nature}} of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. Walter Heitler and Fritz London are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a <b>chemical</b> <b>bond</b> (molecular hydrogen) in 1927.
