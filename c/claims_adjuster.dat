25|$|The insured {{receives}} a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and {{circumstances under which}} the insured will be financially compensated. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the insured for the coverage {{set forth in the}} insurance policy is called the premium.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the impact of a general {{practitioner}} management plan (GPMP) on health outcomes of patients with diabetes. Aim: To examine the impact of a GPMP on risk of hospitalisation for diabetes. Methods: A retrospective study using administrative data from the Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs was conducted (1 st July 2006 to 30 th June 2014) of diabetes patients either exposed or unexposed to a GPMP. Primary endpoint was risk of first hospitalisation for a diabetes-related complication and was assessed with Cox proportional hazard regression models with death as a competing risk. Secondary endpoints included rates of receiving guideline care for diabetes with differences assessed using Poisson regression analyses. Results: A total of 16, 214 patients with diabetes were included; 8091 had a GPMP and 8123 did not. After one year, 545 (6. 7 %) patients with a GPMP and 634 (7. 8 %) of patients without a GPMP were hospitalised for a diabetes complication. There was a 22 % reduction in the risk being hospitalised for a diabetes complication (adjusted HR 0. 78, 95 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 87, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) for those who received a GPMP by comparison to those who did not. Increased rates of diabetes guideline-care, HbA 1 c <b>claims</b> (<b>adjusted</b> HR 1. 29, 95 % CI 1. 25 - 1. 33) and microalbuminura <b>claims</b> (<b>adjusted</b> HR 1. 65, 95 % CI 1. 58 - 1. 72) were observed after a GPMP. Conclusions: Provision of a GPMP in older patients with diabetes resulted in improved health outcomes, delaying risk of hospitalisation at 12 months for diabetes-complications. GPMPs should be included as part of routine primary care for older patients with diabetes. G. E. Caughey, A. I. Vitry, E. N. Ramsay, A. L. Gilbert, S. Shakib, P. Ryan, A. Esterman, R. A.

5000|$|A public {{adjuster}} is {{a professional}} claims handler <b>claims</b> <b>adjuster</b> who advocates for the policyholder in appraising and negotiating a claimant's insurance claim. [...] Aside from attorneys and the broker of record, public adjusters licensed by state departments of insurance are the only type of <b>claims</b> <b>adjuster</b> that can legally represent the rights of an insured during an insurance claim process. A public adjuster will be most beneficial when {{it is clear that}} the insurer will pay the claim and the only issue is the proper identification and valuation of the loss.

50|$|Many {{insurance}} companies prefer their claims adjusters {{to have a}} 4-year college degree preferably in business related fields. In the past, high school graduates have become claims adjusters by promotion from within the claims department. Since there are no college majors for claims adjusters, many states require a state certification in order to practice as an adjuster. States also require that {{a certain number of}} continuing education credits for claims adjusters are earned each year in order to maintain their license. This continuing education is achieved by attending seminars and online training from different <b>claim</b> <b>adjuster</b> educational resources. There are also professional designations that have become prevalent among claims adjusters; for example, The American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters awards the Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriter (CPCU) designation to experienced underwriters.|$|R
40|$|A {{firm that}} {{accounts}} for consumer behavior sets the selling price of a product considering the reference price of consumers. In the literature, a reference price is usually modeled as depending on past selling prices. That is, past selling prices implicitly constrain the current selling price of a product. In this article, the author explicitly measures this constraint with an optimal control framework. He works on the structural properties of a general demand function, which depends on both selling and reference prices. Analytical results prove the following <b>claims.</b> <b>Adjusting</b> reference prices effects increase the price elasticity of demand, the demand function becoming flatter. Thus, the reference price effect weakens the market power of the firm. Also, the reference price effect constitutes a main driver {{of the dynamics of}} the selling price. But contrary to intuition, selling price dynamics does not systematically imitate reference price dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Banks play a {{critical}} role in facilitating international trade by guaranteeing international payments and thereby reducing the risk of trade transactions. This paper uses banking data from the United States to document new empirical patterns regarding the use of letters of credit and similar bank guarantees. The analysis shows that the volume of banks' trade finance claims differs substantially across destination countries. Controlling for exports, claims are hump-shaped in country credit risk and increase with the time to import of a destination market. They also vary systematically with global conditions, expanding when aggregate risk is higher and funding is cheaper. The response to changes in these macro factors is not uniform. Trade finance <b>claims</b> <b>adjust</b> the least in countries with intermediate levels of risk, which rely the most on letters of credit to settle payments. We show that a modification of the standard model of payment contract choice in international trade is needed to rationalize these empirical findings...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} widely {{recognized}} design philosophies in advanced race design: hyper-growth (HG), hyper-production (HP), and tri-immune-HE. HG emphasises empire size, with high population growth rate and {{high rates of}} planet habitability. The <b>Claim</b> <b>Adjuster,</b> Hyper Expansion, and War Monger Primary Racial Traits tend toward HG, although other PRTs may also go the HG route. HP focuses on maximum potential per planet, with very good factory settings, usually sacrificing population-produced resources and small amounts of population growth rate and habitability (relative to HG). The Super Stealth PRT has the strongest tendency toward HP, although other PRTs may go the HP route. The Hyper Expansion PRT with immunity to all three environmental factors and very low population growth rate is the original heavy-hitter of advanced play, earning a perpetual mention in race design discussions. However, modern HG and HP races have surpassed it in performance, and triple immunity is no longer considered the best approach.|$|R
