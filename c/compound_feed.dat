40|$|<b>Compounded</b> <b>feeds</b> {{have been}} one of the {{essential}} requisites in the development of aquaculture. Rearing of larvae in the hatchery, postal larval rearing in the nursery until they become stockable size and their subsequent culture in grow-out ponds require appropriate and nutritionally balanced <b>compounded</b> <b>feeds.</b> <b>Compounded</b> <b>feeds</b> have many advantages. By understanding the nutritional requirements of the candidate species of culture, nutritionally well balanced feeds could be formulated using low-cost feedstuffs available in the concerned region. These feeds could be prepared in large quantities with good shelf life and can be used off the shelf wherever and whenever required. Preparation of <b>compounded</b> <b>feed</b> does not require extensive area and highly skilled man power.

Diets and cows were arranged in a 4 × 4 Latin Square design having experimental periods of 21 days. In each period, starting from the afternoon meal of day 11, the <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> was gradually substituted in three 1 kg increments with the same <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> supplemented with anionic salts. Interactions between type of forage and concentrate were significant for urinary pH values. Urine pH decreased at an increasing rate after anionic feed supplementation at different rates for the different of basal forage diets, with the lowest value for R and the highest for A diet. The 1 and 2 kg levels of substitutions elevated urinary C 1 and urea concentrations, but not Na and K concentrations or urine volume: thus the osmolality increased from 266 to 334 mOsm/kg. The highest level of anionic feed supplementation (3 kg) sharply changed urine output patterns with increased urine volumes from 3. 14 to 4. 63 1 / 6 h and lowered urinary Cl and urea concentrations resulting in reduced urine osmolality from 334 to 277 mOsm/kg. The anionic <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> caused a marked increase of the Ca concentration in urine, from 0. 96 to 4. 30 mmol/l, while P levels were not affected.
