50|$|The 1826 date, however, has a fine {{touch of}} drama about it. Late in 1826 the {{decision}} was made to build the Rideau Canal through lot C. As the village of Bytown (Ottawa) sprang up around the canal terminus, Sparks became landlord for a whole community. Those months also saw Sparks cement the other foundation of his fortune. On 2 Nov. 1826 a marriage license was issued to Sparks and Sally Olmstead, widow of Philemon Wright Jr. The marriage solidified Sparks’ link with the leadership of the Ottawa timber trade.:It was in land that Sparks reaped the greatest dividends. He began to sell portions of lot C as early as 18 Dec. 1826 when he sold land west of the <b>canal</b> <b>mouth</b> for £200 an acre, the same land he had bought for 9s. 6d. an acre. Land sales and leases quickly made Sparks wealthy. As one of the few people with ready cash he also became Bytown’s leading moneylender and often enough was able to regain land he had sold. For example, in January 1832 he accepted a lot in payment of a debt of £75. In May 1832 Sparks sold an adjacent lot for £600. The nicest irony in all of Sparks’ complex dealings came in July 1844 when he leased part of a town lot, 66 ft by 99 ft, for £200 to John Burrows.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{a greater}} {{depth of water}} at the {{entrance}} to the canal than {{at the entrance to}} Maryport harbour, but the problems of navigation in the upper Solway meant that sailing ships were more dependent on favourable winds to reach Port Carlisle. The annual shareholders' meeting in 1826 was told that [...] "it often happened that the navigation was stopped for six, seven, or nine weeks together by the prevalence of adverse winds"; this problem had held back the use of the canal for valuable goods (where the cost of adequate buffer stocks would be prohibitive) but was now obviated by a weekly steam packet service to and from Liverpool. This was not a complete solution: the canal had not been designed to take steamships, there was not enough depth of water at low tide at the harbour mouth to keep large steamships afloat, and the heavy machinery in steamships made them much less tolerant of grounding when the tide went out. The company therefore sought an Act of Parliament authorising the construction of a 'floating dock' (i.e. not a dock that floated, but a wet dock with lock gates to retain sufficient depth of water that ships in the dock remained afloat) at the <b>canal</b> <b>mouth.</b> The prospect of this (and the fact that some Canal Company directors were also directors of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway [...] ) helped the N&CR to decide against active involvement in the promotion of a railway from Carlisle to Maryport. [...] Although the Act was obtained (Royal Assent 7 June 1836) the 'floating dock' at Port Carlisle was never built.|$|E
40|$|Coastal plains {{represent}} the most populated {{areas of the}} world because they allow an industrial, urban and agricultural development. Groundwater is the main resource in coastal plains and it can satisfy the water demand for these activities. Coastal aquifers {{represent the}} place where continental freshwater and seawater meet. Freshwater tends to overly seawater because of its lower density, creating a fragile balance. Nevertheless some processes, both natural and anthropic, can perturb this balance determining groundwater salinization. The main human induced salinization process is the upconing. Natural processes can be the lateral intrusion, evaporite dissolution, fossil water contamination, sea spray aerosol deposition and salt-wedge intrusion in river mouths. Last two processes were deepened in the present study because they are usually not so diffused in regional researches. The aim of this thesis was the study of groundwater salinization induced by rivers or anthropic canals, determined by the wind action or the variation of fluvial discharge rate in time, in areas where protected and anthropic areas coexist: the Tiber Delta and the Pontina Plain. The areas were chosen because they exhibit analogies: both are composed by multi-layered sedimentary aquifers and coastal morphology is strongly affected by reclamation works of the past centuries. The major difference is represented by the presence of different hydrological bodies: in the Tiber Delta area a great river is present and it influences salinization mechanisms in the hydrogeological system, whereas in the Pontina Plain lakes and reclamation canals determine the distribution and movement of seawater. This study was developed with several methods, such as hydrological and hydrogeological surveys, multitemporal chemo-physical surveys of groundwater, hydrochemical surveys, remote sensing techniques, statistical analyses about meteorological data {{and the use of the}} most innovative techniques of numerical modeling. In the Tiber Delta area the importance of the westerly winds for the salinization processes was investigated. In fact the winds determine both a salt-wedge emplacement in the Tiber mouth during the falls, and a groundwater salinization in the Litorale Romano Natural Reserve pine forest because of sea spray aerosols deposition. The salt-wedge presence in the Tiber River, noticed up to 8. 8 km from the Tiber mouth, is supposed to be the more likely reason of the seawater intrusion processes identified in the alluvial area of Ostia Antica. Furthermore regional hydrochemical analyses permitted to identify freshening processes ascribable to ionexchange, related to the presence of historical solar salt works in the Ostia Antica area. In the Pontina Plain, along the coastal area which hosts the Circeo National Park, salinization resulted linked to the presence of seawater in reclamation canals and lakes. As suggested by the dissertation title, the final aim of the work was the implementation of a numerical model, to detect salinization processes. The use of numerical modeling is a further investigation tool to analyze and quantify what happens in a complex hydrogeological system. The implementation of numerical modeling was performed using the software FEFLOW 6. 0, to understand the relationships between groundwater and a reclamation canal salinization. The 2 D model, implemented in a transient flow-mass transport state, was located at the Moscarello <b>Canal</b> <b>mouth</b> (Pontina Plain), where a salt-wedge intrusion was noticed. The canal resulted to be subject to a strong discharge modification, which is able to determine a hydraulic gradient and a consequent mass transport in the adjacent aquifer. This transport through the canal bottom resulted able to induce the movement of a saline plume present in the aquifer, determining hence an enhancement of salinity values collected in a piezometer...|$|E
