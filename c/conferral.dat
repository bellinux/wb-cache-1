5|$|Spanish, Dutch, and English traders brought {{guinea pigs}} to Europe, where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among {{the upper classes}} and royalty, {{including}} Queen Elizabeth I. The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in {{a description of the}} animal from Santo Domingo; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola, the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers. However, based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands, the animal must have been introduced by ceramic-making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC, and it was present in the Ostionoid period, for example, on Puerto Rico, long before the advent of the Spaniards. The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner. Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777; it is an amalgam of Pallas' generic designation (1766) and Linnaeus' specific <b>conferral</b> (1758). The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting (artist unknown) {{in the collection of the}} National Portrait Gallery in London, dated to 1580, which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise-shell guinea pig in her hands; she is flanked by her two brothers, one of whom holds a pet bird. The picture dates from the same period as the oldest recorded guinea pig remains in England, which are a partial cavy skeleton found at Hill Hall, an Elizabethan manor house in Essex, and dated to around 1575.|$|E

Specifically, they were more likely than low self-monitors to be sought out for help and to refrain from asking others for help. This behavior provides one explanation for why high self-monitors acquire elevated status among their peers—they are more attuned to status dynamics in exchange relations and adapt their behavior in ways that elicit status...|$|R

As it relates to apostolic succession, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery said that the apostles Peter, James, and John appeared to them in 1829 and conferred upon them the Melchizedek Priesthood and with it [...] "the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fullness of times".|$|R

Results show that multiple informal sociometric status hierarchies develop early in the organization’s life and remain remarkably stable. Control attempts are driven by these status hierarchies: Lower competence status individuals and those who attract negative status degradations are targeted for control by more people early in the group’s life, those relatively free of negative status degradations attempt to control greater numbers of others throughout the group’s existence, while higher positive status is generally unrelated to control attempts. However, control attempts do not lead to higher future sociometric status, suggesting they are not status signals. Findings also show that individuals targeted for control by many others leave the organization entirely...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{establish}} whether nurse-led care (NLC) was clinically {{effective in}} managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods This was a multicentre RCT with a non-inferiority design. The hypothesis {{was that the}} outcomes from NLC would not be inferior to those obtained from the rheumatologist-led care (RLC). Patients with RA were recruited from 10 rheumatology centres across the UK and were allocated randomly to either NLC or RLC. The primary outcome (disease activity - measured by DAS 28) and secondary outcomes (ESR, CRP, pain, fatigue, stiffness, quality of life, self-efficacy, disability, psychological well-being and satisfaction) were compared {{between the two groups}} at each follow-up time point and using data pooled over time (52 weeks). The primary analysis followed a "per-protocol" approach and one-sided 95 %CI was used to test the null hypothesis using a priori-defined threshold of 0. 6 DAS 28 score change. Results Patients under NLC (n= 91) were comparable to those under RLC (n= 90) in their demographic and baseline characteristics. NLC made fewer medication changes, ordered fewer X-Rays but made more <b>conferrals,</b> gave more patient education and psychosocial support than RLC. DAS 28 change scores demonstrated that NLC was not inferior to RLC at any follow-up time point. The pooled average difference in DAS 28 score was 0. 17 (95 %CI = - 0. 12, 0. 46); therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected. NLC did not have higher risk than RLC for failing to achieve a low disease activity state or for having non-responders. The intention-to-treat analysis provided similar results. At week 26, patients under NLC had more general satisfaction than those under RLC. There {{were no significant differences in}} any other secondary outcomes during the follow-up period (weeks 26 to week 52). Conclusions The main results demonstrated that NLC is not inferior to RLC in managing RA. This will contribute to the evidence for NLC in rheumatology and may influence future policy. Further research is needed to determine the pathway that leads to NLC impact. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|People {{from all}} over the world must live and work {{together}} in today’s society. Such integration is not always a smooth process, and interactions with people from other cultures may lead to misunderstandings or even outright conflicts. In the last few years, researchers and practitioners have been working on creating digital tools that can be used to mediate these misunderstandings and conflicts. These tools typically involve interactions with so-called intelligent agents, i. e. virtual characters that are able to take decisions autonomously, that behave as if they are from another culture. The aim of these interactions is to make potential trainees experience how misunderstandings can shape interactions with and perceptions of people from other cultures. In this work, we take the first steps in the design of a digital culture-general training tool to help young adults deal with misunderstandings or conflicts due to differences in culture, through interactions with intelligent agents. We have posed the following design research questions and found the following answers: Which concepts are required to describe the design of a digital culture-general training tool involving agents that show culturally varying behaviour? The answer to this question can be found in the glossary, which presents the key concepts that have been used in this work to create agents that show culturally varying behaviour and to create scenarios that incorporate these agents to increase the intercultural competence of trainees. Can we use theories of culture to create scripted scenarios in which virtual characters behave appropriately for a given culture? To answer this question we designed scripted scenarios in which virtual characters show culturally varying behaviour based on a theory of culture. To ensure that the behaviours of these virtual characters were representative of real-life cultural differences, we conducted an evaluation with people from a wide range of cultures. The results show that the dimensions of culture can be used to generate culturally varying behaviour in agents, but that extensive (pre) testing is required to ensure that the underlying intention of the characters’ behaviour aligns with the users’ interpretation of that behaviour. Can we identify requirements for sociocultural agents that can help them to make sense of their social world? To answer this question we focused on describing important concepts of social interactions based on theories from sociology and psychology. These concepts are incorporated into a conceptual model for socio-cultural agents that can be used to describe their social world. The model differentiates between three levels of analysis: the interaction, the group, and the society. These levels range from being more specific, and thus more visible, to more abstract, and thus less visible, and help us to understand how each level affects interpretation and behaviour. Can we create intelligent agents that can vary their behaviour depending on the culture to be simulated? To answer this question we described the creation of intelligent agents that show culturally varying behaviour. We use an existing model to create believable social interactions, in which agents attribute, claim, and confer social importance in their interactions with other agents and users. Social importance is a way to measure the importance of a certain individual in the eyes of others. The strength of attribution, claims, and <b>conferrals</b> was varied using cultural modifiers. The generated behaviour of the agents was then evaluated to ensure that the intelligent agents showed behaviour representative of a given culture. The results suggest that it is possible to create intelligent agents that can act out appropriate culturally varying behaviour for a given culture. Can we create critical incidents, involving intelligent agents that show appropriate behaviour for given cultures, through which potential trainees become more sensitive to and knowledgeable about differences across cultures? To answer this question we focused on applying different methods of intercultural training in the design of a digital culture-general training tool. These methods were incorporated into critical incidents, in which users can interact with intelligent agents. To ensure that the critical incidents led to an attribution of perceived differences in behaviour to specific differences in culture and to (potential) trainees becoming less judgemental of inappropriate behaviours by people from different cultures, the tool was evaluated by two groups of students. The results suggest that it is possible to create agent-based critical incidents to make potential trainees more knowledgeable about differences across cultures. Contributions The findings to our design research questions represent a set of important contributions to the field. First, we have identified and structured important concepts to better understand the design and implementation of socio-cultural agents and the design of critical incidents that involve these agents for intercultural training. Second, we have described and used models that help to define the simulated world of the agents and help them to navigate through that world. Third, we have attempted to systematize the process of creating scenarios involving agents that show culturally varying behaviour through a set of guidelines that need to be met to ensure that the behaviour of socio-cultural characters is properly evaluated. Fourth, besides conceptual elements, we have also created practical implementations that can freely be used and modified by others. In our work, we have only taken the first steps in designing a digital culture-general training tool. Additional work on the generalization and validation of the critical incidents and the behaviours of the agents is still required; however, we believe that our results show our approach to be viable. We believe that future work will have to focus on three fields: understanding how trainees can be emotionally engaged in the scenarios, systematizing the process of using model-driven approaches to generate socio-cultural behaviour, and using the design outputs in different contexts and with different people from different cultures...|$|R
