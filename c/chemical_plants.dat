5|$|In Taiwan, {{the threat}} of Fanapi forced the closure of rail lines and {{cancellation}} of flights from Kaohsiung International Airport, and at least 156flights were canceled. The storm caused the Kaohsiung seaport in southern Taiwan to close, thus delaying shipments from nearby <b>chemical</b> <b>plants.</b> Many boats rode out the storm at port. Portions of the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit system suspended their service, and the Maokong Gondola was shut down during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Like the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Guangzhou also {{attempted}} {{to raise the}} air quality of the city. The authority had pledged ￥600 million to fight the problem, and had ordered around 32 <b>chemical</b> <b>plants</b> to stop production {{by the end of}} 2009. A report shown on July 13, 2010 indicates that the air quality was rated at 95.07% in 2009, an increase of 12.01% since 2004; this improvement eventually cost authorities ￥24 billion. Later action from organisers to curb the pollution included decreasing the movement of vehicles up to 40 percent and banning barbecue stalls in 11 cities.|$|E

5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in <b>chemical</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
5|$|Various other German {{industrial}} enterprises, such as Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert, built factories {{with their}} own subcamps. There were 45 such satellite camps, 28 of which served corporations involved in the armaments industry. Prisoner populations ranged from several dozen to several thousand. Subcamps were built at Blechhammer, Jawiszowice, Jaworzno, Lagisze, Mysłowice, Trzebinia, and other centers as far afield as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Satellite camps were designated as Aussenlager (external camp), Nebenlager (extension or subcamp), or Arbeitslager (labor camp). Industries with satellite camps included coal mines, foundries and other metal works, <b>chemical</b> <b>plants,</b> and other industries. Prisoners were also made to work in forestry and farming.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, a {{state-owned}} fertiliser factory, Nitrogen Éireann Teoranta, later Irish Fertiliser Industries, {{was established}} {{on the outskirts}} of the town.

50|$|Uranium {{processing}} operations ceased in 1966, and on December 31, 1967, the AEC returned the facility to the Army {{for use as}} a defoliant production plant. The defoliant project was canceled before any process equipment was installed, and the Army transferred 50.65 acre of land encompassing the raffinate pits back to the AEC while retaining the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Plant.</b> The AEC, and subsequently the United States Department of Energy (DOE), managed the site, including the Army-owned <b>Chemical</b> <b>Plant,</b> under caretaker status from 1968 through 1985. In 1984, the Army repaired several of the buildings at the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Plant,</b> decontaminated some of the floors, walls, and ceilings, and isolated some equipment. In 1985, the Army transferred full custody of the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Plant</b> to the United States Department of Energy (DOE), at which time the DOE designated control and decontamination of the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Plant,</b> raffinate pits, and Quarry as a major project.
