40|$|The present work proposes an {{analytical}} method {{able to detect}} in an adulterated olive oil sample {{the addition of the}} <b>copper</b> <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>chlorophylls</b> (E 141 i). The method consists of a pigment extraction in liquid phase and subsequent analysis by HPLC-DAD. The profile of chlorophyll pigments of an olive oil is determined essentially by its content in pheophytins (a and b), but in no case any copper derivative. Different samples of colorant E 141 i have been analyzed, the natural coloring additives used to adulterate vegetable oils. The 99. 59 ± 0. 52 % of the chlorophyll pigments present in the different samples of E 141 i colorant are not those of an olive oil (more than 75 % are cuproderivatives). Thus, the simple detection of one of the compounds in an olive oil indicates adulteration. The major chlorophyll derivative in all the E 141 i colorants samples is Cu-pyropheophytin a and its limit of detection (LOD) defined at a signal-to-noise ratio of about 3 was 6. 58 ng/g. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

40|$|Chlorophylls (a, b) are the {{porphyrin}} {{compounds and}} most common chemical in the plant’s world. In fact, these compounds are an obligatory intermediate product both in energy metabolism and in plant catabolism. At the same time, currently {{there are few}} pharmaceutical preparations on the pharmaceutical market based on chlorophylls. Dyes based on hydrolyzed chlorophyll are successfully used in the food industry. Commercial chlorophylline is a <b>copper</b> <b>complex</b> <b>of</b> hydrolyzed <b>chlorophylls.</b> As shown earlier in TLC, the chlorophyllin mixture contains {{a large number of}} different compounds. It is like water-soluble saponified derivatives in the form <b>of</b> sodium-magnesium <b>complexes,</b> and similar structures in the form <b>of</b> a <b>complex</b> with <b>copper.</b> The latter are more brightly colored, soluble in water and widely used as coloring agents in cooking. In this case, if the initial chlorophyll was not found to have a pronounced biological activity, the substituted derivatives in the form <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> <b>complexes</b> possessed a number of new unique biological properties. Non-hydrolyzed hydrophobic cuprophylline obtained from eucalyptus leaves possessed high antimicrobial activity to most strains of staphylococci, inclusion resistant to antimicrobials and multiresistant strains. This drug is called Chlorophyllipt, it is allowed {{to be used as a}} medicinal product and is one of the oldest antibacterial drugs from plants on the market. It is marketed as ethanoic and oily solutions for topical use, and as an alcohol solution for intravenous injections. Its main purpose is the fight against staphylococcal infections. Recently, found that the oral administration of chlorophyllipt activates cellular immunity and indirectly exhibits antiviral activity. Another compound of cuprophyllin is water-soluble chlorophyllin.

Although superoxide dismutase mimetics (SODm) have provided protection against organ injury involving generation of superoxide anions, they often suffer problems, e. g., regarding their bioavailability or potential pro-oxidant activity.
