50|$|Kyanite is a {{typically}} blue silicate mineral, {{commonly found in}} aluminium-rich metamorphic pegmatites and/or sedimentary rock. Kyanite in metamorphic rocks generally indicates pressures higher than four kilobars. Although potentially stable at lower pressure and low temperature, the activity of water is usually high enough under such conditions that it is replaced by hydrous aluminosilicates such as muscovite, pyrophyllite, or kaolinite. Kyanite {{is also known as}} disthene, rhaeticite and <b>cyanite.</b>|$|E

Some very rare minerals do exist as well, like anglesite, autunite, beryl, cerussite, covellite, crocoite, greenockite, nontronite, pyromorphite, scheelite, native silver, stibnite and wulfenite, and also extremely rare minerals like chalcolite, dundasite, embreyite, hisingerite, leadhillite, mimetite, ozokerite (pseudo-mineral) and vauquelinite.|$|E

Its occurrence in nature is very rare; it is therefore synthesized from various natural, primary raw minerals (sillimanite, andaluzite, <b>cyanite,</b> etc.), but the main source is kaolinite. The process of mullite formation is connected with the transformation of alumina minerals into 3 Al 2 O 3 SiO 2. The effectiveness of transformation of aluminum compounds into mullite is not adequate to the theoretical content of Al 2 O 3 in the material. The transformation process depends on the presence of mineralizers, temperature, time of firing, etc. The aim of this work was the assessment of potential uses of energetic waste including such components as Si and Al. To correct the material composition, an Al additive in the form of gibbsite was used. This study also investigated the influence of different mixture ratios of fly ash and gibbsite, and the influence of trans­formation temperature on the phase composition of the prepared mullite type composite.

40|$|The soils of the Yıldız Mountain, namely Entisols, Mollisols, Inceptisols, Ultisols, and Spodosols, from Poyralı, Yeniceköy, Demirköy and {{northwest}} of Igneada that were developed on calcareous sandy sediments, chlorite schists, Pliocene sediments and alluvial materials were studied in this paper. Moreover, the Entisols and the Mollisols {{located at the}} Kırklareli, Koruköy, Dereköy and the land up to the Bulgarian border developed on metagranites, quartz-quartzitic sediments, chlorite schists, talc schists, dolomites, <b>cyanites,</b> have been studied as the soils in between the forest areas for their agricultural potentials. The clay mineral assemblages of the soils located at {{the west of the}} Yıldız Mountains revealed the presence of illite, vermiculite, smectite, chlorite and kaolinite that have indicated their influence on the fertility of these soils. Thus, the soils of the area are in need of appropriate management plans. The typical properties of the soils studied are: the absence of salinity and carbonate contents, the low amounts of organic matter, the deficiency in P and K which most probably is due to the leaching under acid conditions, the dominantly loamy textures and the pH varying from weakly to strong acid. The priority in the management of these soils should therefore be the application of an appropriate fertilization programme along with soil liming. In addition, some soils may need deep ripping and tillage...|$|R
