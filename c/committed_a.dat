5|$|From that point, Pegues {{rushed for}} 13 {{yards on the}} first play of the drive, giving the Hokies a first down at their 24-yard line. Two more rushes by Pegues gained seven yards, then North Carolina <b>committed</b> <b>a</b> five-yard offsides penalty, giving the Hokies a first down at the 36-yard line. Clark threw an {{incomplete}} pass, Pegues was tackled for no gain on a running play, then Tech <b>committed</b> <b>a</b> five-yard delay of game penalty. On third down, Clark was sacked for a loss, and Tech punted. The kick was partially blocked, allowing North Carolina to return {{the ball to the}} 45-yard line of Virginia Tech. The Tar Heels thus began a drive inside Virginia Tech territory with 3:33 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} play after the turnover, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 16-yard pass to Cornelius White, who picked up a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. Texas then <b>committed</b> <b>a</b> five-yard offsides penalty before Oxendine ran forward for four yards. On the next play, Oxendine fumbled the ball after {{being hit by a}} Texas defender. The loose ball was picked up by a Texas defender, who returned it to the 50-yard line. Brown threw two incomplete passes, then Tech <b>committed</b> <b>a</b> five-yard penalty. On third down, Brown completed a 21-yard pass to Davis, who gained a first down at the Tech 24-yard line. After the long gain, Brown threw two more incomplete passes. On third down, Brown threw another interception to Gray, who returned the ball to the Tech 31-yard line and allowed the Hokies' offense to return to the field with 7:33 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|Because Clemson {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Kendrick received the kickoff at the Tech goal line and returned it to the 20-yard line, where the Hokies started the first possession of the second half. On the first play, Virginia Tech <b>committed</b> <b>a</b> 10-yard holding penalty. Suggs gained five yards with a run up the middle, then Vick completed a pass to tight end Browning Wynn at the 28-yard line. On third down, the Hokies were stopped short of the first down marker and punted {{for only the second}} time in the game. During the kick, Clemson <b>committed</b> <b>a</b> 15-yard roughing the kicker penalty. The penalty allowed the Hokies to retain the football and gave them a first down at their 44-yard line. On the first play after the penalty, Vick completed a 55-yard pass to Davis at the Clemson one-yard line. After the pass, Suggs ran straight ahead for his second touchdown of the game. The extra point was missed by Warley, but Tech still extended its lead to 2710 with 12:19 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Clemson {{received}} Georgia Tech's kickoff with 1:20 {{remaining in}} the game. On the Tigers' first play, they <b>committed</b> <b>a</b> 10-yard penalty. Two incomplete passes followed from Parker, who then completed an 18-yard throw to Xavier Dye. This set up a fourth-and-two for the Tigers, who needed to gain a first down to keep their potential game-winning drive going. Instead, Parker was stymied {{in his attempt to}} run for the needed yards, and Clemson turned the ball over on downs. Georgia Tech's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and ensured their 39–34 victory.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi {{was ready}} now for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Abéché, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only <b>committed</b> <b>a</b> few thousand regular troops to the offensive, {{and most of these}} were artillery and logistic units. This may have been due to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair.|$|E

40|$|Although people {{typically}} avoid {{engaging in}} antisocial or taboo behaviors, such as cheating and stealing, they may succumb {{in order to}} maximize their personal benefit. Moreover, they may be frustrated when the chance to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> taboo behavior is withdrawn. The present study tested whether the desire to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> taboo behavior, and the frustration from being denied such an opportunity, increases attraction to violent video games. Playing violent games allegedly offers an outlet for aggression prompted by frustration. In two experiments, some participants had no chance to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> taboo behavior (cheating in Experiment 1, stealing in Experiment 2), others had <b>a</b> chance to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> taboo behavior, and others had a withdrawn chance to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> taboo behavior. Those in the latter group were most attracted to violent video games. Withdrawing the chance for participants to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> taboo behavior increased their frustration, which in turn increased their attraction to violent video games. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} half, Tech's fortune turned. Late {{in the third}} quarter, the Virginia Tech defense stopped Miami's offense again, but instead of {{receiving}} the punt cleanly, the Hokies <b>committed</b> <b>a</b> roughing the kicker penalty that allowed Miami to retain possession of the ball with a first down. A few plays later, Miami scored its first touchdown of the game. In the fourth quarter Miami finally took the lead on a 10-play, 70-yard drive. The Hokies were unable to answer the Hurricanes' score, and Miami won the 1966 Liberty Bowl, 147.|$|E
5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades <b>committed</b> <b>a</b> serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E

On the first play after the completion, Druckenmiller was sacked for a one-yard loss. A second-down pass was dropped, a third-down pass was incomplete, and the Hokies punted again.|$|E
