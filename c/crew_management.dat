2500|$|The initial {{investigation}} into the crash stated that the primary cause was due to [...] "procedural navigation errors by the crew". The Commonwealth of Independent States' Interstate Aviation Committee report concluded that the main causes of the crash were poor <b>crew</b> <b>management,</b> failing to apply approach procedures, and incorrect use of the aircraft's GPS satellite navigation system, in breach of its operational requirements and their rating for its use on approach; failure to use information from other installed navigation equipment; failure to seek an alternative approach when they realised the GPS could not be giving a realistic distance measuring equipment readout.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 March 2008 a Mi-8 with {{registration}} RA-06152 crashed at {{the airport}} whilst attempting to land. There had been recent heavy snowfalls {{at the airport}} and as the helicopter came into land, its rotor wash disturbed the loose snow, causing the pilots to lose their visual references in what was effectively a highly localised blizzard. The helicopter's course deviated [...] beyond the runway, at an angle of 50 degrees, and crashed into the smaller hangar. Three of the nine passengers were killed in the impact, and three more were seriously injured. The investigation concluded that the airport needed to improve its procedures for landing in snow, and that the airline needed to improve its <b>crew</b> <b>management</b> and ensure seat belts are worn.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become {{a prime example of}} successful <b>crew</b> resource <b>management.</b> For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began to change in the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. <b>Crew</b> Resource <b>Management,</b> while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to speak up when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to their concerns. United Airlines instituted a <b>Crew</b> Resource <b>Management</b> class in the early 1980s.

40|$|Background Being able {{to learn}} from {{mistakes}} is a vital aspect of nurse’s professionalism and increasing patient safety. With <b>Crew</b> Resource <b>Management</b> methodologies, aviation and other High Risk Organisations have succeeded in enabling learning cultures that should be applicable also to healthcare. Purpose The purpose was to describe how <b>Crew</b> Resource <b>Management</b> and the inherent learning culture could improve nurse’s professionalism and patient safety within the healthcare system.   Method A literature overview based on database searches in CINAHL, PubMed and a manual search, resulting in 25 scientific articles analysed using an integrated analysis method and quality review.   Results <b>Crew</b> Resource <b>Management</b> implementations {{have a positive effect}} on the nurse’s professional role and patient safety but have still not reached the full potential. Incident reporting is a key factor in providing feedback but still encounters barriers as a basis for pre-emptive learning. Identified barriers are not using <b>Crew</b> Resource <b>Management</b> components as a whole, a lack of feedback and an insufficient learning culture. Feedback is connected to nurse’s perception and situational awareness strengthening morale and professionalism. Conclusion Nurses professionalism and patient safety is dependent on being {{able to learn}} from mistakes which is a key aspect of <b>Crew</b> Resource <b>Management.</b> Learning is enabled by the reporting of mistakes in incident reporting systems without the fear of being punished. Improvements to both systems and the reporting culture are seen as needed, as-well as changes to the education system promoting reporting as part of an overall safety and learning culture...|$|R
