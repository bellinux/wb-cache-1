The encapsulation of a model protein within CaCO 3 particles has been successfully investigated by Boury and coworkers but the release profiles {{still need to be}} improved. In this project, we would like to slow down the kinetics of protein release. One strategy consists in loading the CaCO 3 particles with degradable micelles containing the protein/drug in their core. In this perspective, we have developed a novel class of degradable polyphosphoesters (PPE) (co) polymers able to self-assemble into micelles. Note that the degradation products of PPEs, like phosphates, associated with calcium from the inorganic carrier could favor some reconstruction processes like bone regeneration. Pendant <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>functions</b> were introduced along the backbone of the copolymers in order to increase their affinity for calcium and facilitate their incorporation in the CaCO 3 particles.
