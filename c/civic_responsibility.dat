5|$|According to our {{surviving}} narratives, {{the three}} kings of Rome during the Etruscan occupation were Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus. During this period the army underwent a reformation into a centurial army based on socio-economic class. This reformation is traditionally attributed to Servius Tullius, {{the second of}} the Etruscan kings. Tullius had earlier carried out the first Roman census of all citizens. Livy tells us that Tullius reformed the army by transplanting onto it the structure derived originally for civil life {{as a result of this}} census. At all levels, military service was, at this time, considered to be a <b>civic</b> <b>responsibility</b> and a way of advancing one's status within society.|$|E

25|$|Although {{government}} officials held meetings on storm preparation, Radio France Internationale reported that Haiti {{did not have}} the logistical capability to handle a large-scale disaster. Only 576shelters, with a collective capacity of 90,000people, were listed for all of southern Haiti. Despite pleas from officials, many residents refused to leave their homes. A total of 1,300shelters were readied with a total capacity of 390,000people, insufficient for the population threatened in the storm path. Citing this problem and <b>civic</b> <b>responsibility,</b> officials asked residents in secure homes to welcome vulnerable neighbors. The Haitian government sent funds to 145municipalities, after mayors complained that they had insufficient supplies. Government offices remained open during the storm, while schools were closed from October3–10 to serve as shelters, causing the school calendar to be adjusted. By the day before the storm made landfall, 340,000people had evacuated to these shelters. At least 500people evacuated from Jérémie, and patients at the Les Cayes hospital were evacuated. In Ouest, which contains the capital Port-au-Prince, about 55,000people evacuated ahead of the storm. Although civil protection officials took to the streets to warn people, many residents were unaware that Matthew was even approaching the country a day before its expected landfall. Evacuations continued through the hurricane's landfall with the total number of people in shelters reaching 9,280 by 2:00a.m. local time on October4. Hundreds of prisoners were also evacuated to safer areas during the storm passage.|$|E
25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and <b>civic</b> <b>responsibility,</b> active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E

500|$|Early in November 1940, Army Minister Percy Spender {{solicited}} {{ideas from}} Australia's universities {{for an adult}} education program for the Army and suggestions on who should lead the program. In response, the University of Sydney submitted and recommended the plan prepared by Madgwick and his colleagues. The Army accepted the plan and on 1 March 1941 the Army Education Service (AES) was established. Madgwick was selected as its commander, titled [...] "Assistant Adjutant General (Education)", and commissioned with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. The plan was given final approval by the Australian War Cabinet in May 1941. As implemented, the program covered the 250,000 Army troops stationed in Australia and Australian territories or protectorates in the East Asia/South Pacific area. The goals of the program included improving morale, fostering <b>civic</b> <b>responsibility,</b> providing diversion from the tedium of military life, and preparing servicemen and women to enter the workforce after demobilisation. At least initially, the program consisted of extension lectures, tutorial classes, and discussion groups.|$|E

500|$|A {{result of}} the enshrinement debate was that the Ministry of the Interior {{concentrated}} on distinctions of [...] "religion" [...] and [...] "doctrine", stating that [...] "Shinto rituals (shinsai) are performed by the state whereas religious doctrines (kyōhō) are {{to be followed by}} individuals and families." [...] Through this logic, Shinto rituals were a <b>civic</b> <b>responsibility</b> which all Japanese subjects were expected to participate in, whereas [...] "religious" [...] Shinto was a matter of personal faith and subject to freedom of religion. This debate marked an early failure in crafting of a unified national Shinto practice, and led to a sharp decline in both state grants to Shinto shrines and to the appointment of Shinto priests to government positions. The Ministry of Home Affairs took responsibility for shrines in 1877, and began to separate Shinto religious practices from indoctrination. In 1887, the Ministry stopped financial support for most shrines, aside from select Imperial shrines tied to state functions.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the mid-19th}} century a private company, the Spring Valley Water Company (SVWC), owned much of the Alameda Creek Watershed and had held a {{monopoly}} on water service to San Francisco. In 1906, William Bowers Bourn II, a major stockholder in the SVWC, {{and owner of the}} giant Empire gold mine, hired Willis Polk to design a [...] "water temple" [...] atop the spot where three subterranean water sources converge (a pipe from the Arroyo de la Laguna, Alameda Creek, through the Sunol infiltration galleries, and a 30-inch pipeline from the artesian well field of Pleasanton) [...] Some sources claim Bourn wanted to sell the water company to the City of San Francisco and saw the temple as a way to appeal to San Francisco voters, who would have to approve the purchase (municipal efforts to buy out the SVWC had been a source of constant controversy from as early as 1873, when the first attempt to purchase it was turned down by the voters because the price was too high). Other sources claim that as one born into wealth and classically educated, Bourn was partially motivated by a sense of <b>civic</b> <b>responsibility.</b>|$|E
500|$|... 1882 saw {{the first}} signs of insubordination among the army corps when a group of {{officers}} assassinated a journalist in broad daylight. He had published an article which they considered an offence to their honor. However, the participants were not subjected to punishment for this act. Records from 1884 show that, out of a peacetime army of 13,500 men, more than 7,526 had been jailed for insubordination. The military were badly paid, inadequately equipped, ill-instructed, and thinly spread across the vast empire, often in small [...] "garrisons of 20, 10, 5 and even 2 men." [...] Most of the non-officer corps consisted of men recruited from the poor sertão (hinterland) in the northeast, and later from former slaves. These were volunteers seeking some means of subsistence, as there was no conscription. They were completely unprepared for the military life, had little education or concept of <b>civic</b> <b>responsibility</b> and government. A poor Brazilian from the northeast viewed his military commanders in the same light as he viewed the henchmen of the political bosses at home. An ex-slave would see his harsh superior officer as differing little from his former owner and taskmasters. They had no means of understanding that they were being used to effect a coup, that their orders put them in rebellion against the emperor, or that their actions would lead to a dictatorship. The average recruit blindly followed orders and hoped to avoid punishment by his superiors for any mistake.|$|E
