2500|$|The exact phylogenetic {{position}} of the clade containing mosasaurids and their closest relatives (aigialosaurids and dolichosaurs) within Squamata remains uncertain. Some cladistic analyses recovered them as the closest relatives of snakes, taking into account similarities in jaw and skull anatomies; however, this has been disputed and the morphological analysis conducted by Conrad (2008) recovered them as varanoids closely related to terrestrial monitor lizards instead. Subsequent analysis of anguimorph relationships conducted by Conrad et al. (2011) based on morphology alone recovered mosasaurids, aigialosaurids and dolichosaurs as anguimorphs lying outside the least inclusive clade containing monitor lizards and helodermatids; the analysis based on combined datasets of morphological and molecular data, on the other hand, found them {{more closely related to}} monitor lizards and the earless monitor lizard than to helodermatids and the <b>Chinese</b> <b>crocodile</b> <b>lizard.</b> The large morphological analysis conducted by Gauthier et al. (2012) recovered mosasaurids, aigialosaurids and dolichosaurids in an unexpected position as basal members of the clade Scincogekkonomorpha (containing all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with Gekko gecko and Scincus scincus than with Iguana iguana) that didn't belong to the clade Scleroglossa. The phylogenetic {{position of}} these taxa turned out to be highly dependent on which taxa were included in or excluded from the analysis. When mosasaurids were excluded from the analysis, dolichosaurs and aigialosaurids were recovered within Scleroglossa, forming a sister group to the clade containing snakes, amphisbaenians, dibamids and the American legless lizard. When mosasaurids were included in the analysis, and various taxa with reduced or absent limbs other than snakes (such as dibamids or amphisbaenians) were excluded, mosasaurids, aigialosaurids and dolichosaurs were recovered inside Scleroglossa forming the sister group to snakes. Longrich, Bhullar and Gauthier (2012) conducted a morphological analysis of squamate relationships using {{a modified version of the}} matrix from the analysis of Gauthier et al. (2012); they found the phylogenetic {{position of the}} clade containing mosasaurs and their closest relatives within Squamata to be highly unstable, with the clade [...] "variously being recovered outside Scleroglossa (as in Gauthier et al., 2012) or alongside the limbless forms".|$|E

40|$|The <b>crocodile</b> <b>lizard</b> is a {{critically}} endangered reptile, and serious diseases {{have been found}} in this species in recent years, especially in captive lizards. Whether these diseases are caused by changes in the gut microbiota and the effect of captivity on disease remains to be determined. Here, we examined the relationship between the gut microbiota and diet and disease by comparing the fecal microbiota of wild lizards with those of sick and healthy lizards in captivity. The gut microbiota in wild <b>crocodile</b> <b>lizards</b> was consistently dominated by Proteobacteria (∼ 56. 4 %) and Bacteroidetes (∼ 19. 1 %). However, the abundance of Firmicutes (∼ 2. 6 %) in the intestine of the wild <b>crocodile</b> <b>lizards</b> was distinctly lower than that in other vertebrates. In addition, the wild samples from Guangdong Luokeng Shinisaurus crocodilurus National Nature Reserve also had a high abundance of Deinococcus–Thermus while the wild samples from Guangxi Daguishan <b>Crocodile</b> <b>Lizard</b> National Nature Reserve had a high abundance of Tenericutes. The gut microbial community in loach-fed <b>crocodile</b> <b>lizards</b> was significantly different from the gut microbial community in the earthworm-fed and wild lizards. In addition, significant differences in specific bacteria were detected among groups. Notably, in the gut microbiota, the captive lizards fed earthworms resulted in enrichment of Fusobacterium, and the captive lizards fed loaches had higher abundances of Elizabethkingia, Halomonas, Morganella, and Salmonella, all of which are pathogens or opportunistic pathogens in human or other animals. However, there is no sufficient evidence that the gut microbiota contributes to either disease A or disease B. These results provide a reference for the conservation of endangered <b>crocodile</b> <b>lizards</b> and the first insight into the relationship between disease and the gut microbiota in lizards...|$|R

40|$|The <b>crocodile</b> <b>lizard</b> Shinisaurus crocodilurus Ahl, 1930 - a true living fossil - is {{the only}} known living {{representative}} of the family Shinisauridae. Its current distribution range is restricted to small and isolated relict populations in South China and Northeast Vietnam. The species is strongly associated to freshwater streams within remote and intact evergreen broadleaf forests and exhibits rare reproduction strategies (e. g., ovoviviparity, multipaternity). Its unique biology and outstanding appearance makes S. crocodilurus an increasingly desired target species in the international pet trade, which - in concert with multiple further anthropogenic pressures - brought the species at the brink of extinction. While detrimental population declines of S. crocodilurus have been recorded in China, respective information on its population status, threats and ecology remained poorly known in Vietnam. The present thesis provides a combination of several ecological, systematic, molecular and forensic methods {{in order to identify}} the autecology and conservation status of S. crocodilurus in Vietnam and to test the utility of different methods as potential novel tools for conservation implications. Based on annual population monitoring of S. crocodilurus we found, that wild populations are dramatically small, in continuous decline and we even observed several local extirpations in Vietnam within recent years. Poaching as well as ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation were identified as major causes. We further provided new and essential basic knowledge on the ecological adaptation of Vietnamese S. crocodilurus, emphasizing its strong ecological specialization. In order to predict the overall distribution of suitable habitats and potential further occurrences of S. crocodilurus, we applied species distribution models (SDMs). Following the resulting predictions, we discovered a new S. crocodilurus population, affirming the practical utility of such theoretical models. In this context, we also predicted an almost entire loss of suitable habitats by 2080 as consequence of global climate change. To substantiate these prognoses with actual data on temperature selection, we developed a backpack system with thermo data loggers for S. crocodilurus, which - being {{the first of its kind}} in lizards - proved to be applicable in the field. First data indicated the species small realized thermal niche and selection of cool temperatures, suggesting its vulnerability to climate change. Since we identified illegal trade as critical and acute threat to S. crocodilurus - and mechanisms to detect the potential illegal source of traded specimens are generally lacking - we tested the applicability of isotopic markers to distinguish captive bred from wild caught specimens. This approach was herein trialed for the first time in lizards and revealed promising results, namely a clear separation of the investigated groups. Thus, this novel method might develop as a future tool in wildlife forensics. A herein applied integrative approach revealed distinct differences in ecological adaptation, morphology and genetics between <b>Chinese</b> and Vietnamese <b>crocodile</b> <b>lizard</b> populations, resulting in the taxonomic separation into at least two subspecies, concordant with the split into two conservation units. This taxonomic split emphasized the immediate need of enforced in situ and ex situ conservation measures and the establishment of separated conservation breeding programs to retain the genetic integrity of each taxon. Such a conservation breeding program was initiated in the Me Linh Station for Biodiversity, Vinh Phuc, Vietnam - based on the herein conducted ecological and microhabitat analyses - in order to establish a stable reserve population with the goal of a future restocking program. In this context, we identified priority areas for conservation and provided recommendations for the establishment of new reserves and the maintenance of forest corridors, connecting existing reserves with S. crocodilurus populations, in order to inform authorities and policy makers. In summary, this thesis clearly demonstrated the suitability of a various spectrum of novel forensic and ecologic tools and highlights the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary strategy in species conservation, exemplary on the <b>crocodile</b> <b>lizard.</b> Furthermore, it also emphasizes the necessity of ground research, population monitoring and assessment of habitat requirements to provide a solid base for advanced techniques, to amend legislations, to protect habitats and - together with the expertise from zoological gardens - to develop and manage ex situ conservation programs. ...|$|R

Although previous work showed the existence of duplicate control regions in mitochondrial DNAs of several snakes, the blind snake did not have this characteristic. Phylogenetic analyses based on different tree-building methods consistently supported that the blind snake and a colubrid snake (akamata) make a sister clade relative to all the lizard taxa from six different families. An alternative hypothesis that snakes evolved from a lineage of varanoids was not favored and nearly statistically rejected by the Kishino-Hasegawa test. It is therefore likely that the apparent similarity of the tongue structure between snakes and varanoids independently evolved and that the duplication of the control region occurred on a snake lineage after divergence of the blind snake.
