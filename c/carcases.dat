5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA.

Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants play an {{important}} role in both the environment and for humans. A single nest is capable of dispersing over 300,000 plant seeds; moreover, meat ants have formed symbiotic relationships with many insects. This ant may be used as a form of pest control to kill the cane toad, an invasive species. They can also help farmers to remove animal <b>carcases</b> by consuming and reducing them to bones in a matter of weeks. Despite this, meat ants are sometimes pests around urban areas and eradicating them is difficult.|$|E

5|$|As the Market {{was being}} built, a {{cut and cover}} railway tunnel was {{constructed}} underground City street level to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal <b>carcases</b> to its Cold Store, and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s, and are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road.|$|E
5|$|Polled Dorsets are an all-white, {{medium-sized}} sheep, prolific {{and able}} to breed out of season. The <b>carcases</b> are muscular with good conformation and the adults produce a thick fleece, which is free from dark fibers. Since its development, the number of Polled Dorsets registered in the United States has grown to exceed the number of Horned Dorsets. Without horns the sheep are easier to handle and there is much less risk of the rams hurting themselves or others by butting. The Polled Dorset is sometimes confused with the Australian Poll Dorset, but that breed did not start as a genetic mutation but resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset breeding program.|$|E
5|$|A Limousin/Jersey {{backcross}} {{study conducted}} in Australia and New Zealand {{to investigate the}} effects of the F94L myostatin variant concluded that the mutation had no significant effect on birth-weight and growth traits. Averaged over all backcross calves in the trial (total of 766), animals homozygous for the mutation had approximately 6% heavier <b>carcases</b> than animals without the mutation, 15% larger eye muscle (also known as rib eye) area, 13% heavier silverside weight, and 13% heavier total meat weight. Increased meat weight and size was accompanied by a 15% reduction in intra-muscular fat and 25% reduction in total fat weight. No other significant effects were observed. A second backcross study conducted in Japan of Limousin and Japanese Black breeds identified similar changes to meat and fat quantities in cattle homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|E
40|$|In vivo {{measures}} of <b>carcase</b> quality can aid selection. Muscle density, (measured by computer tomography) has strong negative genetic and phenotypic correlations with intramuscular fat. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate growth and <b>carcase</b> parameters of lambs, sired by five high and low muscle density Terminal sire rams, using three different covariates. Progeny (n= 394) were recorded for live weight at: birth; 8 weeks, 16 weeks and immediately pre-slaughter. Ultrasonic measurements were made at the third lumbar vertebrae, pre-slaughter. <b>Carcase</b> records include <b>carcase</b> weights, EUROP classification scores for fatness and conformation. Data were analysed using GENSTAT 15, using a sire nested within muscle density ANOVA design model, fitting sex; dam age (slaughter batch for <b>carcase</b> traits); birth/rear type and MyoMaxTM carrier status. The model was adjusted for the covariates, age at measurement (age) : live weight at slaughter (Slwt); or slaughter fat grade (fat). Low muscle density sired lambs were heavier at 8 weeks (age P= 0. 022; Slwt P= 0. 043 : fat P= 0. 04) and 16 weeks (age 0. 014; Slwt P= 0. 05; fat P= 0. 036). However high muscle density sired lambs had increased ultrasonic muscle depth (age 0. 0 19 : Slwt P= 0. 017; and fat P= 0. 017), heavier hot <b>carcase</b> weight (age P= 0. 004; Slwt P< 0. 001; fat P= 0. 004), 48 h cold <b>carcase</b> weight (age P= 0. 027; Slwt P< 0. 001 : fat P= 0. 013), higher killing out percentages (age, Slwt and fat P< 0. 001), and improved <b>carcase</b> conformation (age, Slwt and fat P< 0. 001). It is proposed that when compared at the same end point, high muscle density sired lambs have increased lean tissue which is expressed as higher <b>carcase</b> weight rather than live weight.

40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} is to review the recent {{development}} of economic selection indices for beef cattle in Ireland, consisting of a beef production sub index (BPSI), beef and dairy calving sub indices (BPSI, DCSI), a maternal sub index (MSI), a weaned calf sub index (WCSI) and consequential total beef merit indices. The sub indices are designed to increase the profitability of different specific components of the beef industry. Secondly some initial results of a project that has begun, aiming to further optimize these developments, are presented. This project will focus on several issues including trait definition, modeling of breed effects in Irish data sets and determining appropriate fixed and random effects in a multibreed scenario. Initial heritabilities for <b>carcase</b> weight, <b>carcase</b> fat and <b>carcase</b> conformation as a function of age, using data gathered routinely in abattoirs, are presented. The data set was multibreed in nature. Fixed regressions on breed fractions were used to model breed effects. <b>Carcase</b> conformation for younger animals tended to have moderate to high heritabilities (0. 32 - 0. 50), while <b>carcase</b> fatness and <b>carcase</b> weight heritabilities for the same age range were slightly lower (0. 23 - 0. 39) ...|$|R

The best bulls identified in progeny testing are formally given the award Young Beef Cattle (in French Viande Jeunes Bovins, abbreviated to JB). Female progeny go to a test station in Moussour in Corrèze, where they are inseminated with the same bulls and calve at two years in confinement before being put out to pasture with their calves. The test station evaluates weight, growth, morphology, fertility, calving ability and milking ability in order to assess their maternal qualities. The best bulls following the tests on their daughters are identified as Maternal Qualities (in French Qualités Maternelles, abbreviated to QM).|$|E
5|$|Whitby grew in {{size and}} wealth, {{extending}} its activities to include shipbuilding using local oak timber. In 1790–91 Whitby built 11,754tons of shipping, making it the third largest shipbuilder in England, after London and Newcastle. Taxes on imports entering the port raised money to improve and extend the town's twin piers, improving the harbour and permitting further increases in trade. In 1753 the first whaling ship set sail to Greenland and by 1795 Whitby had become a major whaling port. The most successful year was 1814 when eight ships caught 172 whales, and the whaler, the Resolutions catch produced 230tons of oil. The <b>carcases</b> yielded 42tons of whale bone used for 'stays' which {{were used in the}} corsetry trade until changes in fashion made them redundant. Blubber was boiled to produce oil for use in lamps in four oil houses on the harbourside. Oil was used for street lighting until the spread of gas lighting reduced demand and the Whitby Whale Oil and Gas Company changed into the Whitby Coal and Gas Company. As the market for whale products fell, catches became too small to be economic and by 1831 only one whaling ship, the Phoenix, remained.|$|E
