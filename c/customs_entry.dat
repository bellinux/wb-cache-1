Back then the office's main purpose was to produce electronic financial reports and trade statistics for the government. The source of the data were from paper copies of financial forms, and <b>customs</b> <b>entry</b> transactions that were already processed. These copies would then be sent to BCC for data entry. To enable the office to effectively perform its work, an IBM System/34 mini computer was installed; this computer allowed the data to be entered and verified, and final reports to be produced, which would then be utilized by the various governmental ministries.|$|E
50|$|Following {{separation}} from New South Wales in December 1859, the Queensland Government maintained Lytton's {{role as the}} <b>customs</b> <b>entry</b> to the Port of Moreton Bay. In 1860-61 an electric telegraph line was constructed from Brisbane to the Lytton Customs Station - the first telegraph line in Queensland built specifically for internal administrative use, to communicate shipping intelligence and meteorological observations from Moreton Bay. The Lytton Telegraph Office opened on 1 June 1861, the third to open in Queensland after Brisbane and Ipswich on the inter-colonial line, which had commenced operation in April 1861. In 1864 the electric telegraph was extended from Lytton via Cleveland and undersea cable to Dunwich on Stradbroke Island and north to Cape Moreton on Moreton Island.|$|E

50|$|In 1966 {{he set up}} one of the world's first air courier companies. He {{was also}} {{instrumental}} in founding the Association of International Courier and Express Services (AICES) and later the Association of European Express Carriers. Through this and his membership of the International Express Carriers Conference (IECC) https://web.archive.org/web/20080718174808/http://www.jcampbell.com/articles/CP_shape_pub_pol.pdf he worked steadfastly to dispel the 'cowboy' image of the courier industry and promote it as a respected worldwide enterprise on which the business community could depend. He was a recognised expert on the complexities of international customs procedures for express shipments and worked tirelessly to achieve parity of treatment with postal administrations. He contributed valuable input to the European Commission in formulating its Paper on Community Postal Policy, ensuring that it was aware of the courier industry's interests. This helpfully reinforced the line which the Department of Trade and Industry took with the Commission. Having left school in 1941 Bertie Coxall joined the RAF and was commissioned as a navigator, serving in Canada and the Middle East. On demobilisation in 1947 he joined LEP as a <b>Customs</b> <b>Entry</b> Clerk and remained there for 20 years, through LEP's takeover first by American Airlines and then by Pan American Airways (Pan Am), rising to managerial level. In 1966 finding he could not progress in Pan Am without emigrating to the United States, he resigned to form his own company, Airport Courier Services Ltd (ACSL), providing document transmission by motorcycle within the Heathrow area between freight agents and airlines. In 1969, he expanded operations by sending an employee daily to Paris and back. This innovative air courier service was gradually extended to other destinations across the world.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} the Lytton {{district}} is closely aligned to the establishment during the 1840s and 1850s of the Port of Moreton Bay at Brisbane Town, on the Brisbane River, rather than at Cleveland on the Bay. Moreton Bay was proclaimed a Port of Entry, with the facilities to collect customs, in June 1846. Brisbane was declared a warehousing port in 1849 and a Customs House was erected there in 1850. In 1857 the New South Wales colonial government began to investigate the suitability of establishing a customs station at the south head of the Brisbane River (present-day Lytton). In August 1857, surveyor James Warner completed a preliminary survey of a site for a village, which was approved in November 1858, and in December 1858 tenders were called {{for the construction of}} a Customs Station nearby on the river. In February 1859 Warner officially surveyed sections 1 to 13 of the village of Lytton, as well as sites for a customs landing place and a signal station. From 1 July 1859 a Tide Surveyor was stationed at Lytton. His job was to meet and board all ships entering the harbour, to prevent the evasion of customs duties. He was assisted by a coxswain and four boatmen, also stationed at the Lytton customs reserve. Following separation from New South Wales in December 1859, the Queensland government maintained Lytton's role as the <b>customs</b> <b>entry</b> to the Port of Moreton Bay. From [...] Water Police-cum-Customs Officers were stationed on the gaol hulk Proserpine at the mouth of the Brisbane River. The Sub-inspector of the Water Police, based at the Lytton Customs Reserve, was also appointed as a health officer, and inspected all vessels entering the port.|$|E

40|$|ShTh is a {{customisable}} graphical {{user interface}} to a tool that helps people {{in the process of}} building and reverse engineering software. ShTh's main goal is to provide an easy way of filtering the (potentially) huge amount of information contained in a thesaurus. ShTh provides menudriven facilities that help naive users to query a thesaurus and visualise the results of query application. It also provides facilities to store and retrieve queries and thesauri, import and export thesauri and a custom menu where users can "plug-in" <b>custom</b> <b>entries</b> with associated actions. This interface was entirely built using a persistent programming language and using libraries of procedures also written in the same language. Interface components are stored in a persistent object store so they can be reused in later sessions. Customisation is achieved by using linguistic reflection: a call is made from the implementation language to its compiler during ShTh execution. Contents 1 Introduction 3 2 Thesa [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Toronto Aerodrome, {{also known}} as Canadian Air Express Airport was an aerodrome located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. One of the {{historical}} airfields of Canada, operated from 1928 to 1939, it was situated at the current Downsview subway station on Dufferin Street and Sheppard Avenue West. Toronto Aerodrome {{was one of the}} several small airfields, which were established in the Toronto area during the 1920s and 1930s. This aerodrome served as the principal <b>custom</b> <b>entry</b> point for aircraft coming to Toronto until 1939, when Malton airfield, now Toronto Pearson International Airport, became operational. The aerodrome shared the site with the Toronto Flying Club (located at Dufferin Street and Wilson Avenue). The Toronto Flying Club's site is now the south end of Downsview Airport, TTC Wilson Complex. Following the end of World War II into the 1960s, parts of former airfield and surrounding farmland were developed into the residential neighbourhood of Wilson Heights and mixed commercial-industrial area of Downsview.|$|R

40|$|The LHCb readout unit (RU) is a <b>custom</b> <b>entry</b> {{stage to}} the readout network of a data-acquisition or trigger system. It {{performs}} subevent building from multiple link inputs toward a readout network via a PCI network interface or alternatively toward a high-speed link, via an S-link interface. Incoming event fragments are derandomized, buffered and assembled into single subevents. This process {{is based on}} a low- overhead framing convention and matching of equal event numbers. Programmable logic is used both in the input and output stages of the RU module, which may be configured either as a data-link multiplexer or as entry stage to a readout or trigger network. All FPGAs are interconnected via the PCI bus, which is hosted by a networked microprocessor card. Its main tasks are remote FPGA configuration and initialization of the PCI cards. The RU hardware architecture has been optimized for a throughput of up to 200 MB/s at a 1 MHz trigger rate, as required by the most demanding application, the LHCb level- 1 trigger network. A custom traffic-scheduling link is available for applications like pipelined destination address allocation. (12 refs) ...|$|R
