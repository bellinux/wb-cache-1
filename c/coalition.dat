5|$|He and Sharif met in Lahore in June 2008 {{to discuss}} Musharraf's removal and the {{constitutional}} amendments, which the PML-N viewed as not going {{far enough to}} fulfill the Murree declaration. He opposed impeachment calls because he claimed the <b>coalition</b> {{did not have the}} two-thirds majority in both legislative bodies—National Assembly and Senate. He was unwilling to restore the judiciary as divisions in the <b>coalition</b> grew and popular sentiment shifted towards Sharif. The <b>coalition</b> criticised the government for barring Sharif from competing in the June by-elections. Because of the impasses over Musharraf and the judiciary, the <b>coalition</b> could not address rising food shortages and spiraling inflation, which was the highest in 30 years.|$|E

He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and the <b>coalition</b> selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

The <b>coalitions</b> took an average of 12 months to form and completed 98 % of formation tasks. Funding, technical support, and networking among grantees promoted formation. Although cultures, geographies, lead agencies, and years of experience differed, <b>coalitions</b> developed similar structures and processes.

40|$|In {{this article}} we explore how the {{management}} of governing <b>coalitions</b> and attributes {{of the dynamics of}} the conflict between and within governing and opposition <b>coalitions</b> affect obstructionist movements in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies from 1991 to 2010. Obstructionist movements are operationalized by the percentage of monthly roll call votes related to procedural requirements that delay decisions on legislative proposals. We find that the proportionality in the distribution of ministerial posts reduces obstruction in minority <b>coalitions.</b> In larger <b>coalitions,</b> this type of incentive has little effect in reducing obstructionist moves. Smaller, more cohesive, and better managed governing <b>coalitions</b> are more capable than oversized <b>coalitions</b> of diminishing problems for decision making in the Chamber of Deputies.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the known}} {{efficient}} algorithms designed to compute the nucleolus for special classes of balanced games are based on two facts: (i) in any balanced game, the <b>coalitions</b> which actually determine the nucleolus are essential; and (ii) all essential <b>coalitions</b> {{in any of the}} games in the class belong to a prespeci ed collection of size polynomial in the number of players. We consider a subclass of essential <b>coalitions,</b> called strongly essential <b>coalitions,</b> and show that in any game, the collection of strongly essential <b>coalitions</b> contains all the <b>coalitions</b> which actually determine the core, and in case the core is not empty, the nucleolus and the kernelcore. As an application, we consider peer group games, and show that they admit at most 2 n - 1 strongly essential <b>coalitions,</b> whereas the number of essential <b>coalitions</b> could be as much as 2 n- 1. We propose an algorithm that computes the nucleolus of an n-player peer group game in O(n 2) time directly from the data of the underlying peer group situation. ...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Labor-community <b>coalitions</b> {{are not a}} new concept.

This broad-based approach requires the development of <b>coalitions</b> for the longer run, not just for temporary expediency.

40|$|Background: Arguably {{the most}} {{influential}} force in human history is the formation of social <b>coalitions</b> and alliances (i. e., long-lasting <b>coalitions)</b> {{and their impact on}} individual power. Understanding the dynamics of alliance formation and its consequences for biological, social, and cultural evolution is a formidable theoretical challenge. In most great ape species, <b>coalitions</b> occur at individual and group levels and among both kin and non-kin. Nonetheless, ape societies remain essentially hierarchical, and <b>coalitions</b> rarely weaken social inequality. In contrast, human hunter-gatherers show a remarkable tendency to egalitarianism, and human <b>coalitions</b> and alliances occur not only among individuals and groups, but also among groups of groups. These observations suggest that the evolutionary dynamics of human <b>coalitions</b> can only be understood in the context of social networks and cognitive evolution. status: publishe...|$|R
