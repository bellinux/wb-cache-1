50|$|In 1934, the German Army {{introduced}} the MG 34, {{considered to be}} the first modern general-purpose machine gun. Equipped with a quick-change barrel and fed either with belts, or from 50-round or 75-round spring-loaded saddle-drum Patronentrommel 34 magazines (with a simple <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> cover), the MG 34 could sustain fire for much longer periods of time than other portable squad-level weapons such as the American B.A.R. and the British Bren Gun, both of which were fed by box magazines, while also being much lighter and more portable than crew-served weapons like the Browning M1919 or Vickers machine guns (which also lacked quick-change barrels). The MG 34 was also quite versatile; not only was it able to be fed from belted ammunition or a saddle drum magazine, it could also be fired from a bipod, heavy tripods or various pintle mounts for armored vehicles. Switching between a bipod and a tripod required no special tools, as the mounting latch was spring-loaded. Later in the war, the MG 34 was used {{as the basis for the}} Luftwaffe's MG 81 flexible defensive gun, and as the MG 34 Panzerlauf, it was used throughout the war as secondary armament on panzers and other vehicles. However, it did have its drawbacks, such as sensitivity to dirt and comparatively expensive production. One attempt at improvement was the MG 34S, an incremental improvement on the basic 34 design.|$|E

Experimental results indicated that the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> sulfur content produced insignificant effect on sulfur enrichment factor for every sulfur species, while the partial fluxes of sulfur species were proportional to feed sulfur content. With the feed temperature increase, total flux increased for every binary mixture. Sulfur enrichment factor decreased in the following order at the same temperature: thiophene > 2 -methylthiopbene > 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene > n-butyl mercaptan > n-butyl sulfide. Correspondingly activation energy of permeation was also obtained. In order to simulate the desulfurization process of real gasoline, effect of more sulfur species coupling exist on separation efficiency was also investigated. With the increase of sulfur species number according to the decrease order of sulfur enrichment factor, total sulfur enrichment factor decreased while total flux was almost invariable.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the coupling of the biological system of infant sleep and the social system of mother-infant synchrony. Before birth and shortly after birth the systems appear to be connected, but it is unclear whether this remains the case over time. This study therefore examined whether infant sleep measured at 6 weeks and 5 months could predict mother-infant gaze synchrony after a social challenge at 5 months (N = 84). Infant sleep was measured in terms of sleep bout duration, which normally increases during this period. Gaze was defined in terms of looking at each other's head simultaneously, known as gaze synchrony, or looking elsewhere. Results showed that infant sleep could predict the temporal dynamics of the mother-infant interaction in terms of flexibility of gaze pattern shifts. The larger the increase in sleep bout duration over age, the more flex, ible the interaction appeared to be. Maternal Age, type <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> and <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> appeared to function as confounding variables in this relation.

In this work, a mechanistic cutting force model for turning processes is developed. In order to accurately predict cutting forces, the cutting tool edge is discretized and an approach for calculating the chip load corresponding to each discretized edge segment is developed. Approach for calculating effective tool angles is also developed considering effects of the tool corner radius and the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> direction. By using the yield shear stress of the work material, the friction angle between work and tool material, the chip load and the effective tool angles for each tool edge segment, the distributions of the turning forces and force intensity along the tool edge can be predicted. Turning cases of straight turning, contour turning, taper turning and facing are tested and the model outputs include the distributions of the instantaneous effective tool angles, chip load, cutting force coefficients and force intensity. Test results for straight turning and contour turning operations are analyzed to demonstrate the model capability. The distributions of force and force intensity on tool edge provide useful information for prediction of turning forces/power and potential further prediction of tool wear/life...|$|E

40|$|During {{developing}} {{programs for}} {{programmable logic controllers}} (PLCs) the concept of model-oriented design is increasingly used. In particular, usage of Simulink PLC Coder is giving {{the opportunity to get}} SCL program code from Simulink model which contains certain dynamic elements. Then, for example, this SCL code can be transformed to functional blocks of the Simatic S 7 - 300 (VIPA 300) PLC. This significantly reduces the time required to develop code in the language of SCL and reduces requirements for specialists’ qualification when developing control systems. In this article we provide an example of PLC programming automation when implementing algorithms of guaranteeing control (AGC). For certain types of technological processes it is typical to contain monotonically increasing function of the effectiveness with fixed one-way restriction in regulations. For example, in the grinders, presses, extruders the load current of the drive is stabilized using the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed.</b>  Energy efficiency of these plants will increase with increasing of the set point (SP) to the controller of the drive load current stabilization loop. However, an increase in SP increases the probability of triggering appropriate protection, for example, as a result of random changes in the properties of raw materials. Therefore, to avoid this accident, the power of driving motors is often unreasonably overrated. And in this case they are used with currents equal to the half of rated. Systems of guaranteeing control (SGC) are used to solve the contradiction between the need to improve the efficiency and increasing probability of an accident. </p...|$|E
40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Equine grass {{sickness}} {{is a high}} mortality disease which, {{despite many}} years of investigation, is of unknown aetiology. Recent findings indicating that the disease is associated with Clostridium botulinum require support from an epidemiological study that recognises and controls for potential confounders, e. g. age, time of year and premises. HYPOTHESIS: EGS is associated with low antibody levels to C. botulinum antigens. METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted. Data were collected from 66 histologically confirmed cases of EGS and 132 premises-matched control horses. The probability of EGS in horses was modelled using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: EGS was significantly associated (age-adjusted P < 0. 005) with low antibody levels to each of 3 clostridial antigens; C. botulinum type C and C. novyi type A surface antigens and a C. botulinum type C toxin complex toxoid. These serological risk factors for EGS remained highly significant when entered into multivariable models.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of machinability during laser-assisted milling of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy was investigated. The effects of laser processing and milling parameters on cutting forces and tool wear have been examined. It is found that local heating and softening of the workpiece by the laser beam {{in front of}} the cutting tool significantly reduced the cutting forces, especially the force in the feed direction during up-cut milling. Laser power, tool-beam distance, depth of cut and cutting speed are the parameters influencing the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> force during laser-assisted milling. Analysis of the workpiece temperature rise due to laser beam heating shows that the feed force is strongly dependent on the workpiece temperature {{in front of the}} cutting zone; significant reduction of feed force occurred when the temperature in front of the cutting zone was in the range 200 - 450 &# 0176;C. Edge chipping is found to be the tool failure mode for both conventional milling and laser-assisted milling. A significant improvement in tool life during laser-assisted milling was obtained when the workpiece temperature in front of the cutting zone was at an optimum value. Compressed air was used to remove the chip from the cutting tool, which made the milling process more effective. The optimum workpiece temperature in front of the cutting zone with compressed air delivered through the spindle is about 350 &# 0176;C, higher than that with compressed air delivered through a stationary nozzle (about 230 &# 0176;C).

Cutting tests have testified that if PVD technology applied on cutting, the cutting force of hard alloy cutter will alter with the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds</b> (f), depth <b>of</b> cutting (ap) and cutting velocity (v).

The main {{reason for this is that}} the difference of frictional factor of the three kinds of cutter material and the workpiece material...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{identification}} of optimal model parameters related to Abrasive Waterjet Milling (AWJM) process. The evenly movement as well as variations <b>of</b> the jet <b>feed</b> speed was taken into account and studied in terms of 3 D time dependent AWJM model. This gives {{us the opportunity to}} predict the shape of the milled trench surfaces. The required trench profile could be obtained with high precision in lack of knowledge about the model parameters and based only on the experimental measurements. We use the adjoint approach to identify the AWJM model parameters. The complexity of inverse problem paired with significant amount of unknowns makes it reasonable to use automatic differentiation software to obtain the adjoint statement. The interest in investigating this problem is caused by needs of industrial milling applications to predict the behavior of the process. This study proposes the possibility of identifying the AWJM model parameters with sufficiently high accuracy and predicting the shapes formation relying on self-generated data or on experimental measurements for both evenly jets movement and arbitrary <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> speed. We provide the results acceptable in the production and estimate the suitable parameters taking into account different types of model and measurement errors...|$|R
40|$|The new, {{original}} {{control method}} of the vibratory conveyor {{operating on the}} Frahm's dynamic eliminator basis, {{is presented in the}} paper. The proposed method is based on the application of the control of the feed-forward controler, together with the events detection based on the generalised likelihood ratio (GLR) algorithm. Such approach leads to the controller intervention only when it is justified by the current process situation, (e. g. in case <b>of</b> an essential <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the <b>feed</b> mass) to enable the stable machine operations and to limit transient states. The results are presented in a form of numerical simulations...|$|R
