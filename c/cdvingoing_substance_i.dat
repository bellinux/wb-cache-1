40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{acrylic resin}} is a {{polymeric}} material with several applications in different {{scientific and technological}} fields, especially in medicine and biotechnology. Its physical characteristics or their possible modifications can imply new ways of utilization and applicability. OBJECTIVE: To study {{the effect of a}} magnetic field on the surface physico-chemical properties usually implied in bacterial adhesion, especially surface hydrophobicity. METHODS: the hydrophobicity of the resin surface was determined by sessile drop contact angle measurements, using van Oss (1994) methodology. Accordingly, a <b>substance</b> (<b>i)</b> is considered hydrophobic when the variation of the free energy of interaction between two entities of <b>substance</b> (<b>i)</b> immersed in water is negative (DGiwi 0, <b>substance</b> (<b>i)</b> is hydrophilic. Two types of resin samples were used: hydrated and non-hydrated ones. The hydrated samples were obtained by autoclaving at 121 ºC. Before contact angle measurements, the samples submitted to the magnetic field were exposed during 24 hours to a field of 500 gauss generated between to parallel magnetite plates. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The principal results are summarized in Table 1. As could be expected the hydrated resin is hydrophilic, while the dehydrated is hydrophobic. However, when the hydrated resin is submitted to the magnetic field it becomes even more hydrophobic than when dehydrated. This {{can be explained by the}} effect of the magnetic field on the orientation of the water molecules of hydration. Consequently, there is an evident alteration of surface properties promoted by the magnetic field...|$|R
