50|$|On {{the subject}} of Indian calligraphy, writes:Aśoka's edicts (c. 265-238 BC) were {{committed}} to stone. These inscriptions are stiff and angular in form. Following the Aśoka style of Indic writing, two new <b>calligraphic</b> <b>types</b> appear: Kharoṣṭī and Brāhmī. Kharoṣṭī {{was used in the}} northwestern regions of India from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century of the Christian Era, and it was used in Central Asia until the 8th century.In many parts of ancient India, the inscriptions were carried out in smoke-treated palm leaves. This tradition dates back to over two thousand years. Even after the Indian languages were put on paper in the 13th century, palm leaves where considered a preferred medium of writing owing to its longevity (nearly 400 years) compared to paper. Both sides of the leaves were used for writing. Long rectangular strips were gathered on top of one another, holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string. Books of this manufacture were common to Southeast Asia. The palm leaf was an excellent surface for penwriting, making possible the delicate lettering used in many of the scripts of southern Asia.Burnt clay and copper were a favoured material for Indic inscriptions. In the north of India, birch bark was used as a writing surface as early as the 2nd century AD.|$|R

50|$|Beginning in {{the second}} season and onward, the theme song was now {{instrumental}} during the title sequence, featuring an acoustic guitar and piano prominence on a synth base, and a higher pitch. The visuals were redesigned to feature still photos of Lewis and Curtis {{in a series of}} different poses, separately and together, with professional photo backgrounds behind them. These photos appeared in moving strips that traveled in all sorts of directions along a greenish-blue, textured wall. The title and credits were encased in metallic, multicolored boxes that traveled across the screen along with the photos; the font was a <b>Calligraphic</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{designer}} {{was invited}} to exhibit several pieces of calligraphy and type design in this international exhibition. The exhibition {{was intended to be}} a celebration of the work of Hermann Zapf and Gudrun Zapf von Hesse, a husband & wife partnership exemplifying the disciplines of calligraphy, book design, typography, bookbinding and type design. Designers all over the world have been influenced by the Zapf's design practice and therefore, several designers were also invited to show work that was felt to demonstrate the influence of their work on a younger generation of designers but also display the pioneering spirit evident in the work of certain designers who work extensively with the calligraphic line. The designer has a continuing research focus on the investigation of the calligraphic line, particularly, in this case, in the practice of modern type design. The practice of type design, although often isolated and singular, can have far-reaching and international impact if the worldwide community of graphic designers begins to use the typefaces in design work. As a result of the broad international dissemination of his work in the field and the appropriate aesthetic qualities {{as a result of the}} research focus, the designer {{was invited to}} exhibit. The exhibition and catalogue show selections of the Humana type family, designed in the mid nineteen nineties for North American type foundry ITC, as well as a specially commissioned painting: Karma Police and digital artwork: Bloodbrotherhood. The catalogue, a well-respected design object in itself (design: Jack Werner Stauffacher) contains a chapter showcasing his work with a commentary and biography. <b>Calligraphic</b> <b>Type</b> Design in the Digital Age John Prestianni/Various Contributors Publisher: Gingko Press ISBN: 978 - 1584230960 200...|$|E
