5|$|In {{most major}} categories, Phoenix {{had a lower}} {{incidence}} of death {{than the rest of}} the nation. Only deaths due to Alzheimer's (29.7 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000) and pre-natal conditions (5.3 to 3.8 deaths per 100,000) were slightly above the national average. Deaths due to HIV and liver disease were exactly at the national average of 2.5 and 10.8 respectively. However, in several major categories, Phoenix had significantly lower indices of death: deaths by cancer stood at only 57% (106) of the national average of 184.6 deaths per 100,000; deaths due to heart disease, 56.1% of the national rate of 249.8 per 100,000. <b>Cancer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> were the two top causes of death in the country.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of <b>cancer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E

Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals, because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} The {{number of patients}} with both lung <b>cancer</b> <b>and</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> has increased {{for the last ten}} years. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the outcome of the combined treatment of radical surgery and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) for patients with both lung <b>cancer</b> <b>and</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Methods The clinical data of 18 patients (16 males and 2 females, mean age of 66. 11 years) with both lung <b>cancer</b> <b>and</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> who went through combined surgical interventions between 2003 and 2012 were summarized and analyzed. The lung cancer in these patients was predominantly at stages I and II (TNM). All patients’ cardio-pulmonary function was favorable. Results All the patients survived the operation, without any recorded death and new myocardial infarction occurrence during the perioperative period. Squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma were found in 10 and 8 patients, respectively. Pathological lung cancer stage was Ia in 2 cases, Ib in 8 cases, IIa in 3 cases, II b in 3 cases, and IIIa in 2 cases. The most frequently observed complications were cardiac arrhythmias, atelectasis, and pulmonary infections. The mean values of operating room time, postoperative drainage, drainage tube time, and blood transfusion were significantly different between video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) groups and thoractomy groups. No significant differences in survival rate were found (P= 0. 187). Conclusion The combined method of OPCABG and pulmonary resection is a safe and effective treatment for patients with both lung <b>cancer</b> <b>and</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> VATS lobectomy is beneficial for lung cancer patients because it reduces lesions...|$|R
