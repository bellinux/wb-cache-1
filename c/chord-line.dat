Its south-west corner is traversed for 29 miles by the main line of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, and also by 25 miles of the new <b>chord-line</b> from Hajipur to Bachwara, which runs parallel to the Ganges embankment from east to west. From Samastipur a line runs to Darbhanga town and there branches off in two directions, the first north-west to Sitamarhi through Kamtaul and Jogiara, and the other due east to Khanwa Ghat on the Kosi (Old streem) near Pratapganj The total length of the line within the District is 146 miles.Most of the earthwork for a line from Sakri to Jaynagar on the Nepal frontier was completed as a relief work during the famine of 1897 and the line, which has now been opened, should tap a large grain supply from Nepal".|$|E

40|$|Previous {{estimates}} of the efficiency of rowing have assumed (in {{the absence of any}} better data) that the water reaction force on the rowing blade, the `blade force 2 Ì† 7, acts in a direction normal to the blade <b>chord-line</b> (oar shaft direction). In 1967 Wellicome suggested {{that there may be a}} component of the blade force parallel to the <b>chord-line,</b> pointing outwards, which would make the oar more efficient in the early part of the stroke [Rowing: A Scientific Approach, A Symposium, (Williams, Scott, eds.), Kaye and Ward Ltd, London, 1967]. The recent steady-flow 1 / 4 -scale model tests of Caplan and Gardner [J. Sports Sciences, v 25 : 643 - 650, 2007] detected a small such parallel force on the asymmetrical Macon and Big Blade shapes. It is possible that this component of force is actually zero within the experimental error, but if the direction of the blade force is tilted away from normal by the amount shown in the model tests, the efficiency of rowing propulsion may be one or two percent greater than previously estimated. However, those previous {{estimates of}} efficiency ignored the effect of oar bending which could reduce the efficiency of rowing by as much as 5...|$|E
6000|$|There is no {{such thing}} as getting a full view of the whole place. A short walk over a grassy down gives on to an outcrop of very dirty sandstone, which in the {{excessive}} innocence of his heart the visitor naturally takes to be the coal lying neatly on the surface. Up to this sandstone the path seems to be made of crushed sugar, so white and shiny is the quartz. Over the brow of the down comes in sight the old familiar pit-head wheel, spinning for the dear life, and the eye loses itself in a maze of pumping sheds, red-tiled, mud-walled miners' huts, dotted all over the landscape, and railway lines that run on every kind of gradient. There are lines that dip into valleys and disappear round the shoulders of slopes, and lines that career on the tops of rises and disappear over the brow of the slopes. Along these lines whistle and pant metre-gauge engines, some with trucks at their tail, and others rattling back to the pit-bank with the absurd air of a boy late for school that an unemployed engine always assumes. There are six engines in all, and as it is easiest to walk along the lines one sees a good deal of them. They bear not altogether unfamiliar names. Here, for instance, passes the [...] "Cockburn" [...] whistling down a grade with thirty tons of coal at her heels; while the [...] "Whitly" [...] and the [...] "Olpherts" [...] are waiting for their complement of trucks. Now a Mr. T. F. Cockburn was superintendent of these mines nearly thirty years ago, in the days before the <b>chord-lines</b> from Kanu to Luckeeserai were built, and all the coal was carted to the latter place; and surely Mr. Olpherts was an engineer who helped to think out a new sleeper. What may these things mean? ...|$|R
