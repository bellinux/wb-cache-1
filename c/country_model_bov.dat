Vector {{quantization}} (VQ) using exhaustive {{nearest neighbor}} (NN) search is the speed bottleneck in classic bag of visual words (<b>BOV)</b> <b>models.</b> Approximate NN (ANN) search methods still cost great time in VQ, since they check multiple {{regions in the}} search space to reduce VQ errors. In this paper, we propose ExVQ, an exclusive NN search method to speed up <b>BOV</b> <b>models.</b> Given a visual descriptor, a portion of search regions is excluded from the whole search space by a linear projection. We ensure that minimal VQ errors are introduced in the exclusion by learning an accurate classifier. Multiple exclusions are organized in a tree structure in ExVQ, whose VQ speed and VQ error rate can be reliably estimated. We show that ExVQ is much faster than state-of-the-art ANN methods in <b>BOV</b> <b>models</b> while maintaining almost the same classification accuracy. In addition, we empirically show that even with the VQ error rate as high as 30 %, the classification accuracy of some ANN methods, including ExVQ, {{is similar to that}} of exhaustive search (which has zero VQ error). In some cases, ExVQ has even higher classification accuracy than the exhaustive search. ...|$|R

The study focuses on a particular CSR practice (i. e. corporate code of conducts) of seven MNCs from Europe (4) and the USA (3) operating in {{the oil and gas}} sector of the Nigerian economy. The study concludes that the corporate codes of conduct of these MNCs operating in Nigeria, to a large extent, reflect the characteristics of their home <b>countries</b> <b>model</b> of capitalism, respectively. The home <b>countries</b> <b>model</b> of capitalism is also found to have implications for the degree of adaptability of these MNCs CSR practices to the Nigerian institutional context.

The seminal work of Laursen and Metzler (1950) suggests that the employment-isolation effect under the flexible exchange rate system is imperfect even if international capital mobility is completely prohibited. Assuming a small <b>country</b> <b>model</b> instead of the two <b>country</b> <b>model</b> by Laursen and Metzler (1950), we obtain the following results: (i) The business fluctuation of the world economy diffuses to the small country through a change in the inflation rate resulting from the change in the real exchange rate. In this sense, the employment isolation is imperfect. (ii) Domestic monetary expansion does not necessarily improve the employment level. This is because the depreciation of the real exchange rate (worsened terms of trade) should always be compensated by the lowered inflation rate and thus reduces the consumption demand...|$|R

However, {{it is also important to}} note that the vertical specialization dependence on 9 Asian countries and Hong Kong is relatively high as compared to non-regional countries.
