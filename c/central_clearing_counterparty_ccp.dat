40|$|R&R at the Journal of Financial EconomicsWe provide {{evidence}} {{of the effects of}} introducing a <b>central</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>counterparty</b> (<b>CCP)</b> on price stability by adopting as an experimental construct the 2009 clearing reform in three Nordic equity markets. We find that the daily price volatility of the affected equities experience an economically significant decline of 8. 8 % relative to pre-reform levels. The decrease in volatility is more pronounced for stocks with a higher margin cost impact, consistent with the predictions of dynamic asset pricing models. We also find that the reform induces a sharp decline of 9. 8 % in trade volume but no deterioration in market quality as captured by trading costs and information measures. Overall, our results suggest that the adoption of central clearing enhances price stability. Our results also suggest an important coordination role for policy in implementing clearing reforms, since investors failed to voluntarily clear trades in the CCP when given the option...|$|E

The empirical results support the use of GIS instead of more conventional measures. We also find that eliminating transitory price components increases the information share of the CDS market in the earlier period of the sample. The economic condition and funding cost turn out to affect the information share of the CDS market negatively. Another interesting finding is that the CDS of investment grade firms possess higher information shares compared to speculative grade firms.

40|$|This note {{discusses}} the basic economics of <b>central</b> <b>clearing</b> for derivatives {{and the need}} for a proper regulation, supervision and resolution of <b>central</b> <b>counterparty</b> <b>clearing</b> houses (<b>CCPs).</b> New regulation in the U. S. and in Europe renders the involvement of a central counterparty mandatory for standardized OTC derivatives' trading and sets higher capital and collateral requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. From a macrofinance perspective, CCPs provide a trade-off between reduced contagion risk in the financial industry {{and the creation of a}} significant systemic risk. However, so far, regulation and supervision of CCPs is very fragmented, limited and ignores two important aspects: the risk of consolidation of CCPs on the one side and the competition among CCPs on the other side. i) As the economies of scale of CCP operations in risk and cost reduction can be large, they provide an argument in favor of consolidation, leading at the extreme to a monopoly CCP that poses the ultimate default risk - a systemic risk for the entire financial sector. As a systemic risk event requires a government bailout, there is a public policy issue here. ii) As long as no monopoly CCP exists, there is competition for market share among existing CCPs. Such competition may undermine the stability of the entire financial system because it induces "predatory margining": a reduction of margin requirements to increase market share. The policy lesson from our consideration emphasizes the importance of a single authority supervising all competing CCPs as well as of a specific regulation and resolution framework for CCPs. Our general recommendations can be applied to the current situation in Europe, and the proposed merger between Deutsche B 6 rse and London Stock Exchange...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Central</b> <b>counterparty</b> <b>clearing,</b> also {{referred}} to as central <b>counterparty</b> (<b>CCP),</b> is a financial institution that provides clearing and settlement services for trades in foreign exchange, securities, options and derivative contracts. A clearing house stands between two clearing firms (also known as member firms or participants). Its purpose is to reduce the risk a member firm failing to honor its trade settlement obligations. A CCP reduces the settlement risks by netting offsetting transactions between multiple counterparties, by requiring collateral deposits (also called [...] "margin deposits"), by providing independent valuation of trades and collateral, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the member firms, and in many cases, by providing a guarantee fund {{that can be used to}} cover losses that exceed a defaulting member's collateral on deposit. The advantages of a <b>central</b> <b>counterparty</b> <b>clearing</b> arrangement are greater transparency of the risks, reduced processing costs, and greater certainty in cases of default by a member.Once a trade has been executed by two counterparties, it is submitted to a clearing house, which then steps between the two original traders' clearing firms and assumes the legal counterparty risk for the trade. For example, a trade between member firm A and firm B becomes two trades: A-CCP and CCP-B. This process is called novation.|$|R

The nature of counterparty exposures in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets is widely considered to have exacerbated the recent financial crisis. Trading in this market is decentralised, and exposures were often inadequately collateralised. Their bilateral character both led to the possibility of default cascades and made it difficult to assess the overall risks taken on by market participants. 2 Clearing trades centrally can mitigate these structural weaknesses.

40|$|We {{study the}} role of a central <b>counterparty</b> (<b>CCP)</b> in {{controlling}} <b>counterparty</b> risk. When trading is organized via a centralized exchange with fungible contracts [...] as in a futures market [...] we show that it is optimal to clear trades via a CCP that uses (i) novation to pool the risk of default and (ii) mutualization of losses to insure against the aggregate cost of default in the form of price risk. We then analyze the design of CCP clearing for over-the-counter (OTC) trades where contracts are customized and, hence, not fungible. A CCP can still offer gains from novation by pooling default risk across all customized contracts. Bargaining in OTC trades leads to an inefficient allocation of default risk across trades. A transfer scheme can alleviate this inefficiency, but necessitates novation being offered by a CCP. Hence, the benefit from CCP clearing for OTC markets goes beyond simple netting as it is a prerequisite for an efficient allocation of default risk in such markets. <b>Central</b> <b>Counterparty,</b> <b>Clearing,</b> Over-the-counter Markets, Novation and Mutualization, Default Ris...|$|R
