The Society was formally established in Brecon on 13 September 1992 as a 'friends of[...] [...]' society for the Brecon Beacons National Park, South Wales - which at the time was the sole remaining park of the original ten British National Parks not to have such a society associated with it. The Society maintains a website and organises a year-round programme of walks and talks on subjects relevant to the area or of interest to its membership. It was responsible for the establishment in 2005 of the Beacons Way - a 100-mile recreational route for walkers which runs the length of the National Park.|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the negotiations for a new agricultural policy of the EU the multifunctionality of agricultural production has come into new prominence in the public. The philosophy that subsidies for the agricultural sector should be calculated not only by agricultural market production but also according to agricultural noncommodity production like e. g. the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside,</b> makes it necessary to assess the social value of this part of agricultural production. In this paper we scrutinize the welfare theoretical background of the economic valuation of non-market production as well as the existing practical valuation techniques. Further, the applicability of these techniques to the valuation of agricultural noncommodity production is considered. valuation of non-market goods, cost-benefit analysis, contingent valuation, multifunctionality of agriculture, Environmental Economics and Policy, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, local {{participation}} {{has come}} increasingly to <b>the</b> forefront <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strategics, language, and practices adopted by conservation organisations in the United Kingdom. In this paper I explore what impact <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> participation h having in reshaping conceptions <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> and <b>the</b> <b>countryside.</b> Based on empirical research in Southeast England, I argue that participation may reveal a new, but contradictory, arena <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> concern centred on <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> place. In laying claim {{to its own}} knowledge, language, and values, this concern for place provides a legi-timate authority for local people to challenge outside representations of their space. As a result, I suggest that <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> participation may be bringing about a retreat from <b>the</b> national vision <b>of</b> traditional <b>conservation</b> and a fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> ideas...|$|R

While there, he {{compiled}} {{a number of}} controversial but influential works, including Agriculture and Urban Growth (1959), which advocated for non-farming uses of land. In 1969, he took up the Ernest Cook Professorship of Countryside Planning, which was jointly based at University College, London, and Wye College. He left that post in 1982, the same year Bradford University conferred upon him an honorary Doctor of Science degree, before he was appointed a Fellow of Wye College three years later. In the mean time, Wibberley had been President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Agricultural Economics Society (1975-76) and a Member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nature Conservancy Council (1973-80), amongst other directorships.

40|$|The {{compact city}} {{has become a}} leading concept in the {{planning}} of peri-urban areas. The compact city concept is often advocated as “sustainable” because of claims that include lower emissions and <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside.</b> The literature shows, however, {{that there are certain}} trade-offs in striving for compaction, especially between environmental and social aspects of sustainability. In this article, we describe expressions of the compact city concept in the planning practice of several European urban sample regions, as well as policies and developments that contradict the compact city. We look at examples of positive and negative impacts of the compact city that were observed in the sample regions. Further, we discuss attempts by planners to deal with sustainability trade-offs. Being aware that developments in the peri-urban areas are closely connected to those in the inner city, we compare the sample regions in order to learn how the compact city concept has been used in planning peri-urban areas across different contexts in Europe: in Western, Central and Mediterranean Europe, and with growing, stable or declining populations. We conclude with recommendations with respect to balance in applying the compact city concep...|$|E
40|$|The new Flora of Bedfordshire has {{now been}} published, {{following}} years of recording {{by members of the}} Society. Grass-of-Parnassus painted by Caroline Gaye in 1844 County Floras have been and still are an important feature of Britain’s botanical scene. The Flora of Bedfordshire will provide an up-to-date account of the status and distribution of the flowering plants and mosses of the county, and place their occurrence in the context of over 400 years of study of the local flora. For Bedfordshire it follows {{in a long line of}} such works, from Charles Abbot’s Flora Bedfordiensis in 1798, to James Saunders’ Field Flowers of Bedfordshire of 1911 and, more recently John Dony’s masterly Flora of Bedfordshire of 1953 and Bedfordshire Plant Atlas of 1976. The authors, Chris Boon for the flowering plants, and Alan Outen for the mosses, have each spent many years studying their fields of natural history, and are not only recorders for the county, but are also involved with their respective national societies. The flora is the culmination of more than 20 years of a comprehensive programme of recording in the county by the BNHS. There are introductory chapters on many aspects pertaining to the flora of the county including geology, soils, <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> and changes in the flora over the last 50 years. Also given are accounts of the history of botany in Bedfordshire, and an overview of the botanical hotspots. Significant records are listed, and the distribution maps for each of the 2, 250 species that have ever been recorded in the county show their presence in areas of 2 x 2 km. A unique feature is the indication on the maps of the distribution data from an earlier survey in the 1970 s by John Dony, the distinguished former county botanist, showing clearly the changes that have taken place...|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Countryside</b> and Rights <b>of</b> Way Act 2000 and the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 {{have both}} opened {{sections}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> for recreational access, but {{have also been}} used as vehicles for <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> new environmental law. In drafting the Acts, legislators have included provisions which maintain a balance between private property rights, open access, <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> agriculture and <b>the</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment. This paper contends that this attempt {{to strike a balance}} between access and the environment has created a new species of environmental regulation, one which balances rights with responsibilities and recognises <b>the</b> additional benefit <b>of</b> access to <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> as an educator on the environment and rural affairs.
