30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6 b, H_ 0 (s), the {{resulting}} current transfer function at the faulted cable terminal, has the {{characteristic of a}} band-pass filter. Since H_ 0 (s) is defined {{with respect to the}} incident voltage wave, it can be considered as an admittance which describes the relationship between the resulting current at the faulted cable terminal and the incident voltage. This admittance is highly inductive due to the presence of the series inductor and the <b>converter</b> <b>arm</b> inductors. Consequently, high-frequency components of the incident voltage are largely attenuated. In the low frequency region, this admittance is highly capacitive, mainly due to the equivalent converter capacitor. As a result, low-frequency components of the incident voltage are also largely attenuated. The bandwidth and gain of the frequency response of H_ 0 (s) increase as the series inductors decrease.|$|E

40|$|Two-way {{power flow}} {{is nothing new}} {{and has been in}} {{practical}} use using line commutated converters for at least 50 years. With these types of converters, reversal of power flow can be achieved by increasing the firing angle of the devices beyond 90 degrees thus producing a negative DC voltage. Line commutated converters have several known disadvantages including: the direct current cannot be reversed, the power factor decreases when the firing angle increases and the harmonics are high on the line current. To tackle the above problems a forced commutated converter can be used. The power factor can be unity and the harmonics can be reduced. Many researchers have used PWM with different control techniques to serve the above purposes. In each <b>converter</b> <b>arm,</b> they used a forced commutated device with an antiparallel diode. Under the rectification mode of operation the current path is preponderantly through the diodes and under the inverter operation the current flows preponderantly through the forced commutated devices. Although their results were encouraging and gave a unity power factor with nearly sinusoidal current, the main disadvantage was that there were difficulties in controlling the power factor when the system is needed to operate at lagging or leading power factor. In this work, a new idea was introduced by connecting two GTOs antiparallel instead of a diode and a GTO. A single phase system using two GTO converters which are connected in series was built. One converter operates as a rectifier and the other converter operates as an inverter. In the case of the inversion mode and in each inverter arm one GTO is operated as a diode simply by switching it always on and the other antiparallel GTO is operated as a normal device to carry the inverter current. In case of the rectification mode, in each arm one GTO is always off and the other GTP is operated as a controlled device. The main advantage is that the system can be operated at lagging or leading power factor...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to bring}} clarity to the {{dimensioning}} aspects and limiting factors of the modular multilevel converter (MMC). Special consideration {{is given to}} the dc capacitors in the submodules as they are a driving factor for the size and weight of the converter. It is found that if the capacitor voltages are allowed to increase by 10 % the stored energy must be 21 kJ/MW in order to compensate the capacitor voltage ripple. The maximum possible output power can, however, be increased by injecting a second-order harmonic in the circulating current. A great advantage of cascaded converters is the possibility to achieve excellent harmonic performance at low switching frequencies. Therefore, this thesis also considers the relation between switching harmonics, capacitor voltage ripple, and arm quantities. It is shown that despite subharmonics in the capacitor voltages, it is still possible to achieve periodic arm quantities. The balancing of the capacitor voltages is also considered in further detail. It is found {{that it is possible to}} balance the capacitor voltages even at fundamental switching frequency although this will lead to a comparably large capacitor voltage ripple. Therefore, in order to limit the peak-to-peak voltage ripple, it is shown that a predictive algorithm can be used in which the resulting switching frequency is approximately 2 – 3 times the fundamental frequency. This thesis also presents two new submodule concepts. The first submodule simply improves the trade-off between the switching frequency and capacitor voltage balancing. The second submodule includes the possibility to insert negative voltages which allows higher modulation indices compared to half-bridge submodules. A brief comparison of cascaded converters for ac-ac applications is also presented. It is concluded that the MMC appears to be well suited for ac-ac applications where input and output frequencies are close or equal, such as in interconnection of ac grids. In low-frequency applications such as low-speed drives, however, the difficulties with handling the energy variations in the <b>converter</b> <b>arms</b> are much more severe in the MMC compared to the other considered topologies.

30|$|There {{has been}} a rather long history of {{research}} on the control and protection of AC faults in electric power transmission systems [1, 2]. Regarding the high-voltage direct current (HVDC) including multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) technologies, research effort has been made on the protection against DC faults [3, 4, 5, 6]. As for AC faults, control strategies of voltage source converter (VSC) for improving the AC fault ride-through capability of VSC-HVDC systems were proposed in [7, 8]. An approach of limiting the AC unbalanced fault on the VSC MTDC grids was proposed in [9]. Control and protection strategies were investigated in [10] for a hybrid MTDC system against AC faults. In most situations, AC faults can be isolated by AC circuit breakers. However, when an AC fault occurs at the nearby AC side of the converter, which is beyond the protection area of the nearby AC circuit breakers, the fault isolation is achieved by both blocking of the converter to prevent current flowing from the DC side and tripping the AC side circuit breakers. In the above situation, previous work has assumed that the blocking of the converter is successful. However, this assumption is not necessarily valid in terms of practical operation of converters, especially in the more advanced modular multilevel converter (MMC) [11, 12] in the current system. The MMC at the fault side has different conditions of blocking failure: ① for the communication outage of control signals where the whole converter can be out of control and cannot be blocked, although the occurrence of such a condition is considered to be rare; ② a more common condition {{is that one of the}} six converter arms is failed to be blocked; ③ the most common condition is that one sub-module (SM)/several SMs on one <b>converter</b> <b>arm</b> is/are failed to be blocked; ④ other conditions. Hence, it is worth identifying the potential risk to the MTDC system, analyzing the dynamic performance to reveal the fact that special control and protection is necessary to be conducted when the MTDC system is significantly affected under emergency conditions, while under other non-emergency conditions, the special control and protection may not be essential.|$|E
