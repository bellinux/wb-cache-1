This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants <b>could</b> <b>receive</b> a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem.

Children in homes with an income under $41,000 <b>could</b> <b>receive</b> vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school.

The wireless service was integral in sending large GIS files to the scene for rescuers to use in locating survivors. It was also utilized by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, the American Red Cross, and media outlets, both local and national. Retroactively, various Minneapolis officials deemed the presence of the network essential to the success of the response to the collapse.|$|E
5|$|Triton had {{a number}} of {{attributes}} that made her a potential NECPA platform. Her size allowed ample room for additional shipboard systems and personnel accommodations. Her designed speed provided the capability for rapid transit, and her nuclear power plant offered virtually unlimited endurance and range. The Combat Information Center (CIC) provided substantial command and control capabilities as did the communication buoy system that <b>could</b> <b>receive</b> and send radio transmissions while submerged. As she was a submarine, Triton offered superior protection against nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) contaminants over surface ships or an airborne command centre. However, the record remains unclear if such an explicit NECPA conversion was ever undertaken for Triton.|$|E
5|$|B'nai Israel hired Peres in December 1858 as cantor and teacher, in English and German, at {{an annual}} salary of $600 (today $) with {{perquisites}} of $400.

For example, at a congregational meeting in , they gathered money from the members present and B'nai Israel's treasury to assist suffering Moroccan Jews, and created a committee to raise funds throughout Memphis on their behalf.
