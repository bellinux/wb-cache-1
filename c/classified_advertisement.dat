5|$|In 2004, the Livestock Conservancy {{entered a}} {{partnership}} with Slow Food USA, Chefs Collaborative, and four other organizations to found the Renewing America's Food Traditions collaboration. The effort resulted in a book, Renewing America's Food Traditions, describing more than 1000varieties and species of food that are disappearing from the United States. The organization has written or published over a dozen books on heritage livestock breeds, including several on heritage poultry and waterfowl and more on general livestock conservation. Its conservation criteria and literature on livestock biodiversity are also widely used in independent publications on breeds. The Conservancy organizes an annual conference {{that focuses on the}} preservation and promotion of rare livestock breeds. For this conference, it partners with other organizations to teach members and other attendees about various aspects of rare breed livestock. For instance, in 2005, the organization partnered with the NAGP and the American Grassfed Association for a discussion on the cryogenic preservation of rare breed genetic material, which included a tour of the USDA Livestock and Poultry Gene Bank. In 2009, the Conservancy set up an online <b>classified</b> <b>advertisement</b> system to help users find and purchase rare breeds.|$|E

25|$|While writing Busted's second album, A Present for Everyone, Fletcher {{was asked}} by the record label if he was {{available}} to film auditions for a new band, V. It was at this time that Danny Jones and Fletcher met for the first time; Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be an instrumental band rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing boyband, for which they were intended. Fletcher was impressed with Jones' unique style and so approached and invited him to write with himself and Bourne. When writing projects for Busted had come to an end, the two began collaborating for their own (yet unnamed) band and, eventually, moved into the InterContinental Hotel in London for two months, (while still receiving help from Bourne) to concentrate on writing together. Bassist Dougie Poynter and drummer Harry Judd were subsequently recruited via a <b>classified</b> <b>advertisement</b> in the NME magazine. The pair, both Essex lads, coincidentally turned up at the same audition and got to talking over their shared appreciation of the band The Starting Line, after Poynter noticed their name and logo was printed on Judd's T-shirt.|$|E
500|$|In February 1832 Balzac {{received}} an intriguing letter from Odessa—with no return address and signed simply [...] "L'Étrangère" [...] ("The Foreigner")—expressing sadness at the cynicism and atheism in La Peau de Chagrin and its negative portrayal of women.

500|$|The episode {{continually}} {{switches to}} flashbacks which {{show that the}} circumstances leading to Victor's death stemmed from a simple misunderstanding. A group of pilgrims descend upon the Meldrews' home after misunderstanding Margaret's <b>classified</b> <b>advertisement</b> in her local newspaper of {{a picture of the}} Virgin Mary with [...] "two small tears under her eyes". [...] Readers apparently took it to mean 'tears' (as in crying) rather than 'tears' (as in rips). As a result of their exposure in the local paper, Victor is contacted by an old acquaintance and invited to a works reunion. Victor, who is persuaded to go by Margaret, is informed by the barman (Paul Merton) [...] that {{all but one of the}} other guests have cancelled for various reasons. Sitting alone while waiting for Limpy, the one remaining potential attendee, Victor is entertained by two cabaret performers (Ed Welch— who wrote the incidental music for all series —and Jean Challis). Victor eventually leaves the pub, with Limpy arriving seconds after he leaves. At the railway station Victor telephones Margaret for a lift. As he stands at the side of the road waiting for his wife, a car appears and mounts the kerb; Victor is knocked down and killed.|$|E

2500|$|The group {{considers}} {{itself to}} have officially formed in January 2006, when its first lineup came together. Vocalist Ann Yu and drummer/keyboardist David Farrell, {{who had previously}} played together in several bands, were preparing to relocate to Los Angeles, California because, according to Yu, [...] "it's {{a lot easier to}} find other musicians that are serious about making a career out of [...] " [...] there. The move was abruptly canceled as the band began to form. Bassist and friend Jesse Hayes became available when his punk rock band Time in Malta split up; then, in January, Yu and Farrell met guitarist Ted Parker through a Craigslist <b>classified</b> <b>advertisement.</b> A few weeks later, the band played its first gig in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company was}} still seeking a {{salesman}} in April 1922, but stopped posting dedicated sales openings until January 1923, this time noting several thousand Hush-A-Phones had already sold in New York. The company's first <b>classified</b> <b>advertisement</b> {{for the product}} appeared June 7, 1922, pricing the product at $10 and offering a free 5-day trial offer.

40|$|<b>Classified</b> <b>advertisements</b> in {{newspapers}} and magazines represent a uniquely democratic access to the media for the individual. Without having to pay the {{thousands of dollars for}} full-page advertisements, buyers and sellers can purchase space for their offers for only a few dollars, yet have them seen by city-wide or nation-wide audiences. Democracy, though, breeds its own excesses, and the legal question is always how to control that excess without harming the freedom. As befits a medium open to all, <b>classified</b> <b>advertisements</b> run the gamut of human activity, from the sale of a used automobile to employment to lonely singles looking for an 2 ̆ 2 attractive. nonsmoking, athletic 2 ̆ 2 mate.

2500|$|On May 25, 1928, Fish saw a <b>classified</b> <b>advertisement</b> in the Sunday {{edition of}} the New York World that read, [...] "Young man, 18, wishes {{position}} in country. Edward Budd, 406 West 15th Street." [...] On May 28, 1928, Fish, then 58years old, visited the Budd family in Manhattan under the pretense of hiring Edward; he later confessed {{that he planned to}} tie Edward up, mutilate him, and leave him to bleed to death. He introduced himself as Frank Howard, a farmer from Farmingdale, New York. Fish promised to hire Budd and his friend Willie, and said he would send for them in a few days. He failed to show up, but he sent a telegraph to the Budd family apologizing and set a later date. When Fish returned, he met Grace Budd. He apparently changed his intended victim from Edward Budd to Grace Budd and quickly made up a story about having to attend his niece's birthday party. He convinced the parents, Delia Flanagan and Albert Budd I, to let Grace accompany him to the party that evening. The elder Albert Budd was a porter for the United States Equitable Life Assurance Society. Grace had a younger sister, Beatrice, two older brothers, Edward and George Budd, and a younger brother, Albert Budd II. Grace left with Fish that day but never returned.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880 his old restlessness returned, and {{he headed}} north for the twofold object of {{publishing}} his poems and lecturing. He spent December in Baltimore, Maryland, where his Poems: Patriotic, Religious, and Miscellaneous were republished. He also delivered his first lecture on [...] "Some Aspects of Modern Civilization". During this visit {{he made his}} home at Loyola College. In return for the Jesuit fathers' hospitality, he gave a public poetry reading and devoted the $300 proceeds to establish a poetry medal at the college. His Baltimore lectures drew such intense public interest that {{he was invited to}} sit for a set of photographic portraits at the studio of the eminent Baltimore photographer David Bachrach. The image of Ryan {{at the top of this}} article is believed to be one of the Bachrach portraits, as well as is the portrait on the cover of the 2008 biography of Ryan, Poet of the Lost Cause, from the University of Tennessee Press. These became so popular that Bachrach ran a <b>classified</b> <b>advertisement</b> in the Baltimore Sun recommending photographs of Fr. Ryan as Christmas gifts. In November 1882, Ryan returned to the north for an extended lecture tour that included appearances in Boston, New York, Montreal, Kingston, and Providence, Rhode Island. Contrary to an earlier biographical article which termed this tour unsuccessful, recent research into period newspapers shows that Fr. Ryan's lecture tours of 1882-83 were phenomenally popular, with newspapers in every city Ryan visited describing packed houses and thunderous ovations. In June 1883, he accepted an invitation to recite his poem [...] "The Sword of Robert Lee" [...] at a ceremony marking the unveiling of Lee's statue on the campus of Washington and Lee University, and the same month, delivered the commencement address at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.|$|E
