2500|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>{{mutation}}</b> is a mutation {{that has}} wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under certain [...] "permissive" [...] environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under certain [...] "restrictive" [...] conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences {{at a lower}} temperature (permissive condition). These mutations are non-autonomous, as their manifestation depends upon presence of certain conditions, as opposed to other mutations which appear autonomously. The permissive conditions may be temperature, certain chemicals, light or mutations {{in other parts of}} the genome. In vivo mechanisms like transcriptional switches can create conditional mutations. For instance, association of Steroid Binding Domain can create a transcriptional switch that can change the expression of a gene based on the presence of a steroid ligand. Conditional mutations have applications in research as they allow control over gene expression. This is especially useful studying diseases in adults by allowing expression after a certain period of growth, thus eliminating the deleterious effect of gene expression seen during stages of development in model organisms. DNA Recombinase systems like Cre-Lox Recombination used in association with promoters that are activated under certain conditions can generate conditional mutations. Dual Recombinase technology can be used to induce multiple conditional mutations to study the diseases which manifest as a result of simultaneous mutations in multiple genes. Certain inteins have been identified which splice only at certain permissive temperatures, leading to improper protein synthesis and thus, loss of function mutations at other temperatures. Conditional mutations may also be used in genetic studies associated with ageing, as the expression can be changed after a certain time period in the organism's lifespan.|$|E
40|$|Assessing testing {{strategies}} and test sets {{is a crucial}} part of software testing. Mutation analysis is, among other ap-proaches, a suitable technique for this purpose. However, compared with other methods it is rather time-consuming and applying mutation analysis to large software systems is still problematic. This paper presents a versatile approach, called <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation,</b> which increases the efficiency of mutation analysis. This new method significantly reduces the time overhead for generating and executing the mutants. Results are reported for eight investigated programs up to 373, 000 lines of code and 406, 000 generated mutants. Fur-thermore, <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> has been integrated into the Java 6 Standard Edition compiler. Thus, it is widely applica-ble and not limited to a certain testing tool or framework...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear import {{system is}} highly conserved among eukaryotes. Here we report {{the effects of}} a <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> in SRP 1, which encodes a Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of the {{vertebrate}} nuclear import receptor importin. Importin was isolated as a factor required for the initial targeting step of a nuclear import substrate to the nuclear envelope in a mammalian in vitro assay. We show that yeast Srp 1 is similarly required for protein import. In addition, Srp 1 is also required for the execution of mitosis: we demonstrate that cells containing a <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> of SRP 1 arrest with a G 2 /M phenotype in a manner analogous to classic cdc mutants. This defect {{may be due to the}} failure of the mutant to degrade the mitotic cyclin Clb 2 and other proteins required for mitosis. The requirement of a nuclear import receptor for cell cycle-regulated proteolysis implies that import of cell cycle regulators into the nucleus is critical for cell cycle progression...|$|E
40|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA {{polymerase}} II large subunit, RPB 1, {{were obtained}} by introducing a mutagenized RPB 1 plasmid into yeast cells, selecting for loss of the wild-type RPB 1 gene, and screening the cells for heat or cold sensitivity. Sequence analysis of 10 <b>conditional</b> RPB 1 <b>mutations</b> and 10 <b>conditional</b> RPB 2 <b>mutations</b> revealed that the amino acid residues altered by these distinct mutations are nearly always invariant among eucaryotic RPB 1 and RPB 2 homologs. These results suggest that RNA polymerase mutants might be obtained in other eucaryotic organisms by alteration of these invariant residues...|$|R
40|$|A type of {{retroviral}} {{gene trap}} vectors {{has been developed}} that can induce <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> in most genes expressed in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The vectors rely on directional site-specific recombination systems that can repair and reinduce gene trap mutations when activated in succession. After the gene traps are inserted into the mouse genome, genetic mutations can be produced {{at a particular time}} and place in somatic cells. In addition to their conditional features, the vectors create multipurpose alleles amenable {{to a wide range of}} postinsertional modifications. Here we have used these directional recombination vectors to assemble the largest library of ES cell lines with <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> in single genes yet assembled, presently totaling 1, 000 unique genes. The trapped ES cell lines, which can be ordered from the German Gene Trap Consortium, are freely available to the scientific community...|$|R

In this review, we will discuss the insights into BRCA 1 functions that we obtained from mouse models with conventional and <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> in Brca 1. The most advanced models closely resemble human BRCA 1 -related breast cancer and may therefore be useful for addressing clinically relevant questions...|$|R
40|$|Several desmin {{mutations}} {{have been}} described in patients with cardiomyopathies and distal myopathies. Among them, A 213 V substitution {{has been associated with}} three completely different clinical phenotypes: restrictive cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and isolated distal myopathy. However, the identification of this substitution also in control subjects has highlighted the question if the A 213 V shift represents a <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation,</b> giving rise to cardiomyopathy only in the presence of other predisposing factors. The aim of the present work was to study the potential role of this substitution in predisposing to heart dilation...|$|E
40|$|RSC is an {{essential}} chromatin remodeling complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that performs central roles in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression. Here we identify Htl 1 as a novel factor that associates with the RSC complex both physically and functionally. We isolated HTL 1 through a genetic screen for mutants that displayed additive growth defects with a <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> in the protein kinase C gene (PKC 1), which has been suggested through genetic connections to interact functionally with RSC. Several lines of evidence connect HTL 1 to RSC function. First, an htl 1 Δ mutant displayed temperature-sensitive growth and a G 2 /M cell cycle arrest at restrictive temperatures, a phenotype {{similar to that of}} strains with conditional mutations in essential RSC components. Second, we isolated RSC 3, which encodes a component of the RSC complex, as a dosage suppressor of the htl 1 Δ growth arrest. Third, an htl 1 Δ mutant displayed additive growth defects with conditional rsc 3 alleles. Fourth, overexpression of HTL 1 suppressed the growth defect of a strain with a <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> in another RSC component, RSC 8. Finally, we demonstrate that Htl 1 is a nuclear protein that can associate in vivo with a fraction of the RSC complex. We propose that an RSC-Htl 1 complex acts coordinately with protein kinase C to regulate the G 2 /M transition...|$|E
40|$|The {{replication}} in Bacillus subtilis of the staphylococcal R plasmids pE 194, pBD 15, pUB 110, pSA 0501, and pSA 2100 {{has been}} studied {{in the presence of}} hydroxyurea. In all cases, an enrichment for covalently closed circular DNA compared with chromosomal DNA was observed. In this respect, hydroxyurea mimics the effect previously observed with pUB 110, using strains carrying the <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> dnaA 13. This mutation has been reported to affect ribonucleotide reductase (G. W. Bazill and D. Karamata, Mol. Gen. Genet. 117 : 19 - 29, 1972). An explanation for these effects is offered, together with some supporting evidence...|$|E
40|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>{{mutations}}</b> such as temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations {{are important}} {{for the analysis of}} protein function but are often difficult, or impossible, to obtain. Here we present a simple method for generating <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> based on the use of a protein-destabilizing genetic element in combination with systems allowing the induction and repression of gene expression. This genetic cassette can be fused to other protein-coding sequences, and once transcription is turned off and synthesis of the gene product ceases, the preexisting protein is rapidly degraded. We have applied this method to the analysis of the yeast ARD 1 gene product, a subunit of an N-terminal acetyltransferase, and show that a complete loss of ARD 1 product can be achieved in less than one generation. Despite the rapid loss of ARD 1 protein, there is a prolonged delay in the expression of the ard 1 mutant phenotype, suggesting that the acetylated substrates of ARD 1 are metabolically stable and/or exert a long-lasting effect on processes such as the repression of the silent mating type cassettes...|$|R
50|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> can be {{produced}} in mice which affect only specific cells or tissues at specific times, so that the mouse can develop to adulthood and the adult phenotype can be studied. In one case, MED1 was found to participate in controling the timing of events of meiosis in male mice. Conditional mutants in keratinocytes show differences in skin wound healing. A conditional mutant in mice was found to change dental epithelium into epidermal epithelium, which caused hair to grow associated with the incisors.|$|R
40|$|To study {{essential}} maternal gene {{requirements in}} the early C. elegans embryo, we have screened for temperature-sensitive, embryonic lethal mutations {{in an effort to}} bypass essential zygotic requirements for such genes during larval and adult germline development. With conditional alleles, multiple essential requirements can be examined by shifting at different times from the permissive temperature of 15 °C to the restrictive temperature of 26 °C. Here we describe 24 <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> that affect 13 different loci and report the identity of the gene mutations responsible for the conditional lethality in 22 of the mutants. All but four are mis-sense mutations, with two mutations affecting splice sites, another creating an in-frame deletion, and one creating a premature stop codon. Almost all of the mis-sense mutations affect residues conserved in orthologs, and thus may be useful for engineering <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> in other organisms. We find that 62 % of the mutants display additional phenotypes when shifted to the restrictive temperature as L 1 larvae, in addition to causing embryonic lethality after L 4 upshifts. Remarkably, we also found that 13 out of the 24 mutations appear to be fast-acting, making them particularly useful for careful dissection of multiple essential requirements. Our findings highlight the value of C. elegans for identifying useful temperature-sensitive mutations in essential genes, and provide new insights into the requirements for some of the affected loci...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the genetic interactions between mutations affecting chromosome structure and partitioning in Bacillus subtilis. Loss-of-function mutations in spoIIIE (encoding a putative DNA translocase) and smc (involved in chromosome structure and partitioning) caused a synthetic lethal phenotype. We constructed a <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> in smc {{and found that}} many of the spoIIIE smc double-mutant cells had a chromosome bisected by a division septum. The growth defect of the double mutant was exacerbated by a null mutation in the chromosome partitioning gene spo 0 J. These results suggest that mutants defective in nucleoid structure are unable to move chromosomes {{out of the way of}} the invaginating septum and that SpoIIIE is involved in repositioning these bisected chromosomes during vegetative growth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGermline {{inactivation}} of c-myc in mice causes embryonic lethality. Therefore, {{we developed}} a LoxP/Cre-based <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> approach to test the role of c-myc in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and mature B lymphocytes. Cre expression resulted in reduced proliferation of wild-type MEFs, but c-Myc-deficient MEFs showed a further reduction. In contrast to fibroblasts, Cre expression had no apparent affect on wild-type B cell proliferation. Deletion of both c-Myc genes in B cells led to severely impaired proliferation in response to anti-CD 40 plus IL- 4. However, treated cells did upregulate several early activation markers but not CD 95 or CD 95 ligand. We discuss these findings with respect to potential c-Myc functions in proliferation and apoptosis and also discuss potential limitations in the Cre-mediated gene inactivation approach...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mutations in the dynamin-related GTPase, Mgm 1 p, {{have been}} shown to cause {{mitochondrial}} aggregation and mitochondrial DNA loss in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, but Mgm 1 p’s exact role in mitochondrial maintenance is unclear. To study the primary function of MGM 1, we characterized new temperature sensitive MGM 1 alleles. Examination of mitochondrial morphology in mgm 1 cells indicates that fragmentation of mitochondrial reticuli is the primary phenotype associated with loss of MGM 1 function, with secondary aggregation of mitochondrial fragments. This mgm 1 phenotype is identical to that observed in cells with a <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> in FZO 1, which encodes a transmembrane GTPase required for mitochondrial fusion, raising the possibility that Mgm 1 p is also required fo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe complex {{series of}} {{movements}} that mediates chromosome segregation during mitosis {{is dependent on}} the attachment of microtubules to kinetochores, DNA-protein complexes that assemble on centromeric DNA. We describe the use of live-cell imaging and chromatin immunoprecipitation in S. cerevisiae to identify ten kinetochore subunits, among which are yeast homologs of microtubule binding proteins in animal cells. By analyzing <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> in several of these proteins, we show that they are required for the imposition of tension on paired sister kinetochores and for correct chromosome movement. The proteins include both molecular motors and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), implying that motors and MAPs function together in binding chromosomes to spindle microtubules...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the application of}} the two-hybrid system to the identification of protein-protein interaction temperature-sensitive mutants. We applied this strategy to the interaction between the human CDK 2 cell cycle regulator and the p 21 Cip 1 regulatory subunit. A library of randomly generated CDK 2 mutant proteins was screened for interaction with p 21 Cip 1 at different temperatures. This approach resulted in the isolation of single point mutations in CDK 2 causing temperature-sensitive interaction with p 21 Cip 1. Our results demonstrate that the two-temperature two-hybrid screen is an efficient approach for the rational design and screening of protein-protein interaction <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations...</b>|$|R

A powerful development is the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic approach, combining advantages of both conventional transgenic and knock-in gene-targeting strategies. In immunology the potential of BAC transgenic technology has yet to be fully harvested and, combined with a variety of elegant genetic tools, it will allow the analysis of complex immunological processes in vivo. In this short review, we discuss the applications of BACs in immunology, such as identification of regulatory regions, expression and cell-fate mapping, cell ablation, <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> and the generation of humanized mice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Myo 2 p is an {{unconventional}} myosin required for polarized growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Four lines of evidence suggest that (a) Myo 2 p is {{a target of}} calmodulin at sites of cell growth, and (b) the interaction between Myo 2 p and calmodulin is Ca ~+ independent. First, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence, the distributions of Myo 2 p and calmodulin are nearly indistinguishable throughout the cell cycle. Second, a genetic analysis indicates that mutations in CMD 1 show allele-specific synthetic lethality with the myo 2 - 66 <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation.</b> Mutations that inactivate the Ca 2 +-binding sites of calmodulin {{have little or no}} effect on strains carry-ing myo 2 - 66, whereas an allele with a mutation outside the Ca~+-binding sites dramatically increases th...|$|E
40|$|Abstractβ-Catenin is an {{essential}} molecule in Wnt/wingless signaling, which controls decisive steps in embryogenesis. To study the role of β-catenin in skin development, we introduced a <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> of the gene in the epidermis and hair follicles using Cre/loxP technology. When β-catenin is mutated during embryogenesis, formation of placodes that generate hair follicles is blocked. We show that β-catenin is required genetically downstream of tabby/downless and upstream of bmp and shh in placode formation. If β-catenin is deleted after hair follicles have formed, hair is completely lost after the first hair cycle. Further analysis demonstrates that β-catenin is essential for fate decisions of skin stem cells: {{in the absence of}} β-catenin, stem cells fail to differentiate into follicular keratinocytes, but instead adopt an epidermal fate...|$|E
40|$|Disruption of {{the yeast}} {{tropomyosin}} gene TPM 1 {{results in the}} apparent loss of actin cables from the cytoskeleton (Liu, H., and A. Bretscher. 1989. Cell. 57 : 233 - 242). Here we show that TPM 1 disrupted cells grow slowly, show heterogeneity in cell size, have delocalized deposition of chitin, and mate poorly because of defects in both shmooing and cell fusion. The transit time of alpha-factor induced a-agglutinin secretion to the cell surface is longer than in isogenic wild-type strains, {{and some of the}} protein is mislocalized. Many of the TPM 1 -deleted cells contain abundant vesicles, similar in morphology to late secretory vesicles, but without an abnormal accumulation of intermediates in the delivery of either carboxypeptidase Y to the vacuole or invertase to the cell surface. Combinations of the TPM 1 disruption with sec 13 or sec 18 mutations, which affect early steps in the secretory pathway, block vesicle accumulation, while combinations with sec 1, sec 4 or sec 6 mutations, which affect a late step in the secretory pathway, have no effect on the vesicle accumulation. The phenotype of the TPM 1 disrupted cells is very similar to that of a <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> in the MYO 2 gene, which encodes a myosin-like protein (Johnston, G. C., J. A. Prendergast, and R. A. Singer. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 113 : 539 - 551). The myo 2 - 66 <b>conditional</b> <b>mutation</b> shows synthetic lethality with the TPM 1 disruption, indicating that the MYO 2 and TPM 1 gene products may be involved in the same, or parallel function. We conclude that tropomyosin, and by inference actin cables, may facilitate directed vesicular transport of components to the correct location on the cell surface...|$|E
40|$|The Bacillus subtilis {{nitrogen}} transcriptional factor TnrA is inactive {{in cells}} grown with excess nitrogen, e. g., glutamine or glutamate plus ammonium, because feedback-inhibited glutamine synthetase (product of glnA) binds to TnrA and blocks its DNA-binding activity. Two <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> that allow TnrA-dependent gene expression in cells grown with glutamate plus ammonium, {{but not in}} glutamine-grown cells, were characterized. One mutant contained a mutation in the glnA ribosome binding site, while the other mutant synthesized a truncated GlnR protein that constitutively repressed glnRA expression. The levels of glutamine synthetase were reduced in both mutants. As a result, when these mutants are grown with excess nitrogen {{in the absence of}} glutamine, there is insufficient production of the feedback inhibitors necessary to convert glutamine synthetase into its feedback-inhibited form and TnrA-activated genes are expressed at high levels...|$|R

40|$|A {{conditional}} centromere {{was constructed}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by placing the centromere of chromosome III immediately downstream from the inducible GAL 1 promoter from S. cerevisiae. By utilizing growth conditions that favor either transcriptional induction (galactose-carbon source) or repression (glucose-carbon source) from the GAL 1 promoter, centromere function can be switched off or on, respectively. With the conditional centromere {{we were able to}} radically alter the mitotic transmission pattern of both monocentric and dicentric plasmids. Moreover, it was possible to selectively induce the loss of a single chromosome from a mitotically dividing population of cells. We observed that the induction of chromosome III aneuploidy resulted in a dramatic change in cell morphology.

After release of the temperature-sensitive nimT 23 block, p 34 ~ 2 undergoes tyrosine dephosphorylation and we showed that as cells entered mitosis, a rapid increase in calmodulin was observed. The increase in calmodulin and progression into mitosis were prevented by reducing extracellular Ca 2 ÷ levels to 2 nM.

Point mutations, deletions and the autonomy of intracistronic second-site mutations were characterized by this method. Further analysis has shown that each possible pair from three ti mutants gave nonconditional clear recombinants.

This study distinguishes a subset of Neurospora morphological mutants for their morphological response to altered growth rate. Growth rates are altered using two different methods: reduced temperature and nutrient-deficient media. This should assure that the observed effect is not due to simple <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> in the mutant strains examined.

In cultured Shp 2 mutant Schwann cells, Nrg 1 -evoked cellular responses like proliferation and migration were virtually abolished, and Nrg 1 -dependent intracellular signaling was altered. Pharmacological inhibition of Src family kinases mimicked all cellular and biochemical effects of the Shp 2 mutation, implicating Src as a primary Shp 2 target during Nrg 1 signaling.

40|$|Mammalian signal {{recognition}} particle (SRP), {{a complex of}} six polypeptides and one 7 SL RNA molecule, is required for targeting nascent presecretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Earlier work identified a Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog of human SRP RNA and showed {{that it is a}} component of a particle similar in size and biochemical properties to mammalian SRP. The recent cloning of the gene encoding a fission yeast protein homologous to Srp 54 p has made possible further characterization of the subunit structure, subcellular distribution, and assembly of fission yeast SRP. S. pombe SRP RNA and Srp 54 p co-sediment on a sucrose velocity gradient and coimmunoprecipitate, indicating that they reside in the same complex. In vitro assays demonstrate that fission yeast Srp 54 p binds under stringent conditions to E. coli SRP RNA, which consists essentially of domain IV, but not to the full-length cognate RNA nor to an RNA in which domain III has been deleted in an effort to mirror the structure of bacterial homologs. Moreover, the association of S. pombe Srp 54 p with SRP RNA in vivo is disrupted by <b>conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> not only in domain IV, which contains its binding site, but in domains I and III, suggesting that the particle may assemble cooperatively. The growth defects conferred by mutations throughout SRP RNA can be suppressed by overexpression of Srp 54 p, {{and the degree to which}} growth is restored correlates inversely with the severity of the reduction in protein binding. <b>Conditional</b> <b>mutations</b> in SRP RNA also reduce its sedimentation with the ribosome/membrane pellet during cell fractionation. Finally, immunoprecipitation under native conditions of an SRP-enriched fraction from [35 S]-labeled fission yeast cells suggests that five additional polypeptides are complexed with Srp 54 p; each of these proteins is similar in size to a constituent of mammalian SRP, implying that the subunit structure of this ribonucleoprotein is conserved over vast evolutionary distances...|$|R
