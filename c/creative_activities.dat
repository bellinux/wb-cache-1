By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from their musical world and ideals. In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of fortification. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's <b>creative</b> <b>activities</b> increasingly took {{a back seat to}} his official duties as a professor of chemistry.|$|E

Number of pages: 36 The purpose {{with our study}} is to examine what preschool teachers, working in preschools and in kindergartens, think about <b>creative</b> <b>activity.</b> To answer this we have chosen a qualitative method and have done interviews with twelve preschool teachers, six in preschool and six in kindergarten. We base our study on the following question: How do preschool teachers in preschool and kindergarten describe their work with children’s <b>creative</b> <b>activity?</b> The result of the study didn’t show any difference between kindergarten and preschool. They both consider that <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> is important for children’s learning and development.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a study of}} how educationalists, from one preschool group, approach to and respond to children ́s <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> in preschool. To answer the survey ́s purpose I used four research questions, which is the following: -What function do the educationalists give the <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> in the working? -How do they see the importance of thecreative activity for thechild and its development? -How doeducationalists considerthat theyrespond to the child's <b>creative</b> <b>activity?</b> -Is thereany norms surrounding <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> in preschool? The theoretical base {{of the study is}} rooted in the sociocultural perspective, where <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> and visual arts can be seen as mediating cultural tools. The method is a qualitative interview of five preschooleducationalists. The conclusion is that these educationalists works with <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> in aconsciousway, as they for instance seize the communicative function which takes place in the <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> and visual arts. They use this function to create conditions for children ́s development and learning. They also see the function of processing expressions, and the link to play and imagination. In their work with <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> they seem to have an agreement about the process as a central part, while it in contrast to this seems like the children is mostly focusing at the motive. The <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> also seemsto be tightly linked to culture, in several ways, both societal and local. And the experience from home seems to be important. The conclusion also shows that the <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> in preschool really is surrounded by norms. Which shows up to depend on, for instance, children ́s gender. But the norms also showto differ between adults and children, where they lean in different directions regarding to intentions and taste...|$|R

In some people, temporary or prolonged loneliness can lead to notable artistic and creative expression, for example, as was the case with poet Emily Dickinson, and numerous musicians. This is not to imply that loneliness itself ensures this creativity, rather, it may have an influence on the subject matter of the artist and more likely be present in individuals engaged in <b>creative</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E

Synesthesia may also give a memory advantage. In one study conducted by Julia Simner of the University of Edinburgh it was found that spatial sequence synesthetes have a built-in and automatic mnemonic reference. So the nonsynesthete will need to create a mnemonic device to remember a sequence (like dates in a diary), but the synesthete can simply reference their spatial visualizations.|$|E

25|$|The Bengal {{renaissance of}} the 19th century was a {{remarkable}} period of societal transformation in which {{a whole range of}} <b>creative</b> <b>activities</b> – literary, cultural, social and economic – flourished. The Bengal Renaissance was the culmination of the process of emergence of the cultural characteristics of the Bengali people that had started in the age of Hussein Shah (1493–1519). This spread over, covering around three centuries, and had a tremendous impact on Bengali society. Incidentally that coincided with the rise of the Tagore family. The Tagore family attained prominence during this period through its unusual social positioning between Indian and European influences.|$|E
25|$|Most Waldorf-inspired {{schools in}} the United States are {{elementary}} schools established as either magnet or charter schools. The first Waldorf-inspired high school was launched in 2008 with assistance from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. While these schools follow a similar developmental approach as the independent schools, Waldorf-inspired schools must demonstrate achievement on standardized tests {{in order to continue}} receiving public funding. Studies of standardized test scores suggest that students at Waldorf-inspired schools tend to score below their peers in the earliest grades and catch up or surpass their peers by middle school. One study found that students at Waldorf-inspired schools watch less television and spend more time engaging in <b>creative</b> <b>activities</b> or spending time with friends. Public Waldorf schools' need to demonstrate achievement through standardized test scores has encouraged increased use of textbooks and expanded instructional time for academic subjects.|$|E
25|$|Bennett Brook is {{significant}} to Aboriginal people, {{as it is}} believed that it was formed by the <b>creative</b> <b>activities</b> of the Waugal. It is said that the Waugal's resting place is a cave in the deep, still water. Python Bridge crosses Bennett Brook approximately 200meters from its confluence with the Swan River and it {{is believed to be the}} home of an evil and dangerous spirit. Some Aboriginal families have said that camping areas existed from the Southern boundaries of this site to Bennett Swamp in pre-contact times. There is a tradition of digging wells for freshwater supplies in the western bank of Bennett Brook and a traditional fish trap supplied food for these camps. Benara Road is the southern boundary to this Aboriginal site. From the 1930s to 1960s, Aboriginal camps spread across Lord Street into the area that is now a housing estate. It is reported that burials have taken place between Benara Road and Widgee Road, however their exact location is not known.|$|E

The institute was first established in Berkeley, California and later moved to ASU in 1997. As one of the leading research organization in the United States devoted to the science of human origins, IHO pursues a transdisciplinary strategy for field and analytical paleoanthropological research. The Herberger Institute Research Center supports the scholarly inquiry, applied research and creative activity of more than 400 faculty and nearly 5,000 students. The renowned ASU Art Museum, Herberger Institute Community Programs, urban design, and other outreach and initiatives in the arts community round out the research and <b>creative</b> <b>activities</b> of the Herberger Institute. Among well known professors within the Herberger Institute is Johnny Saldaña of the School of Theatre and Film. Saldaña received the 1996 Distinguished Book Award and the prestigious Judith Kase Cooper Honorary Research Award, both from the American Alliance for Theatre Education (AATE).

Mahler was by nature moody and authoritarian—Natalie Bauer-Lechner, his earlier partner, said that living with him was [...] "like being on a boat that is ceaselessly rocked to and fro by the waves." [...] Alma soon became resentful because of Mahler's insistence that there could only be one composer {{in the family and}} that she had given up her music studies to accommodate him. She wrote in her diary: [...] "How hard it is to be so mercilessly deprived of... things closest to one's heart." [...] Mahler's requirement that their married life be organized around his <b>creative</b> <b>activities</b> imposed strains, and precipitated rebellion on Alma's part; the marriage was nevertheless marked at times by expressions of considerable passion, particularly from Mahler.|$|E

2500|$|The study {{offers a}} {{conceptual}} framework (Loo, 2017, p. 49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005), [...] and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work. [...] These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets {{in the areas of}} science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these <b>creative</b> <b>activities.</b> Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.|$|E

60|$|It is {{impossible}} for art, {{or any of the}} higher <b>creative</b> <b>activities,</b> to flourish under any system which requires that the artist shall prove his competence to some body of authorities before he is allowed to follow his impulse. Any really great artist is almost sure to be thought incompetent by those among his seniors who would be generally regarded as best qualified to form an opinion. And the mere fact of having to produce work which will please older men is hostile to a free spirit and to bold innovation. Apart from this difficulty, selection by older men would lead to jealousy and intrigue and back-biting, producing a poisonous atmosphere of underground competition. The only effect of such a plan would be to eliminate the few who now slip through owing to some fortunate accident. It is not by any system, but by freedom alone, that art can flourish.|$|E
