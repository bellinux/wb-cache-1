5000|$|Control console, {{attached}} to the IOM, was a printer-keyboard that operated at 15 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>cps).</b>|$|E
50|$|IBM 5219 - A {{daisywheel}} {{impact printer}} not {{far removed from}} the IBM typewriters. It was good for about 40 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>CPS).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Paper-tape {{capability}} {{was offered}} with 5, 6, 7, or 8 channel tape punches and readers. The punched tape reader operated at 200 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and the tape punch ran at 100 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of speech rate and tune on intelligibility of fire information words and sentences under the conditions with different levels of noise. The result showed that the types of signals and noise levels affect the intelligibility significantly. The appropriate tune for fire information display interface is mezzo-soprano. The appropriate voice rate is 5 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for words display, 7 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for usual sentences display and 6 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for the sentences with numbers display...|$|R
50|$|A paper-tape {{punch of}} 300 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> was available.|$|R
5000|$|Paper {{tape input}} at 200 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>cps),</b> paper tape output at about 50 cps or {{teleprinter}} output at 10 cps. Four magnetic tape units added in 1958 ...|$|E
50|$|One IBM 2152 printer/keyboard {{could be}} {{attached}} to an adapter in the Terminal Control Unit. This device had a selectric print mechanism and resembled the 1052 printer/keyboard used as a console on many System/360 computers. It operated at 15.5 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>CPS).</b>|$|E
50|$|The 7701 communicated {{using the}} Synchronous transmit-receive (STR) {{communications}} protocol over either private or switched (message service) telephone lines. It operated at speeds of either 75 or 150 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>cps).</b> The 7702 operated at speeds of either 150, 250, or 300 characters per second.|$|E
50|$|The SI unit of {{frequency}} is the hertz (Hz), {{named after the}} German physicist Heinrich Hertz; one hertz means that an event repeats once <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> A previous name for this unit was cycles <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>cps).</b> The SI unit for period is the second.|$|R
50|$|The DX {{paper tape}} readers operate at any speed up to 360 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> via {{external}} timing, except EIA. EIA tape readers operate at 120 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> if internal timing is used, {{and up to}} 314 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> if external timing is used. All of the DX paper tape readers are adjustable-level, reading 5, 6, 7 or 8-level fully punched or chadless paper tape. The DX series of paper tape readers were available in table-top and rack mount models, with an optional verifier data output for use by an external verifier logic to guarantee the accuracy of each character read.|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} measure of speed is cards per minute, abbreviated CPM: The number of cards {{which can be}} read or punched in one minute. Card reader models vary from 300 to around 2000 CPM. If all columns of an 80 column card encode information this translates to approximately 2500 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>CPS).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The IBM 1009 Data Transmission Unit was an IBM {{communications}} controller introduced in 1960. [...] The 1009 used the Synchronous transmit-receive (STR) protocol to transfer data at 150 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>cps)</b> over a single point-to-point dial or leased telephone line. The system was advertised as {{being able to}} [...] "link the magnetic core memories of IBM 1401 computers over telephone lines." ...|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic {{tape was}} {{available}} {{in a variety of}} models, all using open-reel Â½ inch magnetic tape. Various models could read and write seven-track or nine-track tape with densities from 200 bits per inch (bpi) to 1600 bpi at rates of 37.5 inches per second (ips) to 150 ips. The maximum transfer rate was 266 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>cps).</b> All models connected to the system through the IOM.|$|E
5000|$|The {{measurement}} of ionizing radiation is sometimes expressed {{as being a}} rate of counts per unit time as registered by a radiation monitoring instrument, for which counts per minute (cpm) and counts <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>cps)</b> are commonly used quantities.|$|R
5000|$|A model 28 Teleprinter, 10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> {{was also}} {{available}} for output.|$|R
50|$|More {{expensive}} Teletype systems used photo {{readers that}} used light sensors {{to detect the}} presence or absence of punched holes in the tape. These could work at much higher speeds (hundreds of <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second).</b> More sophisticated punches were also available that could run at somewhat higher speeds; Teletype's DRPE punch could operate at speeds up to 240 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} support higher {{throughput}} at their own service bureau, RC developed several high-speed input/output devices. One of their most popular was the RC 2000 paper tape reader, introduced in 1963. Feeding the tape at 5 meters per second, the 2000 could read 2,000 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>CPS),</b> storing the results in a buffer while the computer periodically read the data back out instead of stopping the tape {{to wait for the}} computer to get ready. The machine was later upgraded as the RC 2500, increasing speed to almost 7 meters a second, improving read speed to 2500 CPS. The RC 2000/2500 became a major product for RC during the 1960s, selling 1,500 examples around the world. Several related devices were added to the line, including a high-speed punch and a dedicated data conversion machine that would [...] "massage" [...] data between formats to ease the burden on the host computer.|$|E
5000|$|Computations were output on a Teletype printer at {{the rate}} of 10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of the G-15's primary {{output devices}} is the {{typewriter}} with an output speed of about 10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for numbers (and lower-case hexadecimal characters u-z) and about three <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for alphabetical <b>characters.</b> The machine's limited storage precludes much output of anything but numbers; occasionally, paper forms with pre-printed fields or labels were {{inserted into the}} typewriter. A faster typewriter unit was also available.|$|R
50|$|ALF's first {{products}} were adaptations of the punched tape reader in the Model 33ASR Teletype which {{allowed it to}} operate at higher speeds. Display-based terminals were becoming popular for use on time-shared systems, and they could operate at higher speeds than the Teletype. ALF created an interface card which allowed the Teletype's reader, which normally reads 10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> to read at 30 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> when used with a display-based terminal. It was sold only to schools in the local district; no attempt was made for larger marketing. Another version allowed the reader to operate at 55 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> but modems that could operate at such speeds were not widely used at that time.|$|R
50|$|One or two paper-tape readers {{could be}} connected, {{each with a}} speed of 1,000 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{effective}} {{transmission rate}} is usually {{expressed as a}} number of units of data per unit time, such as bits <b>per</b> <b>second</b> or <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{solid state}} digital computer, the M. 3, has been designed, {{constructed}} and partially tested. The computer logic {{is based on the}} M. 2 computer constructed by A. D. Booth in 1956, but with fundamental changes to the logic associated with the store and the arithmetic section. The M. 3 is a serial, fixed point computer which uses 32 bit words and two address instructions. The 150 Kc/s clock frequency permits addition or subtraction in 250 microseconds. Division requires 8000 microseconds and multiplication requires 250 to 8000 microseconds. A drum store provides 8192 word storage with an average random access time of 8500 microseconds. Peripheral equipment consists of an 80 <b>character</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> tape reader and a 60 <b>character</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> tape punch or a 10 <b>character</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> typewriter...|$|R

5000|$|As 1200-baud dialup {{communication}} {{became more}} common among Time-sharing providers, the Silent 700 faced the problem that its printhead technology simply couldn't [...] "heat up all the little dots" [...] at 120 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> TI solved this in their 780-series terminals by creating a two-character-wide thermal head, which printed 60 pairs of <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> This allowed the product line to survive {{a few more years}} in the new high-speed interactive computing environment of the mid-1980s.|$|R
50|$|Card punches {{necessarily}} {{run more}} slowly {{to allow for}} the mechanical action of punching, up to around 300 CPM or 400 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R

50|$|The DEUCE {{could be}} fitted with paper tape equipment; the reader speed was 850 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> while the paper tape output speed was 25 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> (The DEUCE at the University of New South Wales {UTECOM} had a Siemens {{teleprinter}} attached in 1964, giving 10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> input-output). Decca magnetic tape units {{could also be}} attached. The automatic multiplier and divider operated asynchronously (that is, other instructions could be executed while the multiplier / divider unit was in operation). Two arithmetic units were provided for integer operations: one of 32 bits and another capable of performing 32-bit operations and 64-bit operations. Auto-increment and auto-decrement was provided on 8 registers from about 1957. Array arithmetic and array data transfers were permitted. Compared with contemporaries such as the Manchester Mark 1, DEUCE was about ten times faster.|$|R
