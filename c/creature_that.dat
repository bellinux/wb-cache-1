50|$|Dragons are legendary <b>creatures</b> <b>that</b> {{appear in}} the myths of many cultures. In the West, European dragons are {{depicted}} as reptilian or serpent-like <b>creatures</b> <b>that</b> breathe fire. The Chinese dragon is completely different.

5|$|The episode {{begins in}} the guise of a comic book; FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{receives}} a letter from Shaineh Berkowitz (Pattie Tierce), a single mother who claims to have been mysteriously impregnated, while unconscious, by an unknown presence 18years ago, resulting in the birth of her son, Izzy (Stewart Gale). Now, following a similarly unexplained attack, she is pregnant again. She has heard about Mulder's expertise in the paranormal from The Jerry Springer Show and wants him to investigate. Mulder and his partner, special agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), travel to rural Albion, Indiana. They meet Shaineh and her son Izzy and learn that the description of the <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> attacked her, with a lumpy head and two mouths, is very similar to a comic book character invented by Izzy. His monstrous creation, called The Great Mutato, is inspired by a mysterious <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> has been seen by many of the locals. Izzy and his friends take the agents to a wooded area where they see Mutato (Chris Owens) from a distance.|$|E
5|$|When Driscoll {{is searching}} {{for a place to}} sleep in the animal storage hold, a box behind him reads Sumatran Rat Monkey — Beware the bite! This is a {{reference}} to the <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> causes mayhem in Jackson's 1992 film Braindead. In that film, the rat monkey is described as being found only on Skull Island.|$|E

2500|$|This example {{involves}} two sets, A and B, represented here as coloured circles. The orange circle, set A, represents {{all living}} <b>creatures</b> <b>that</b> are two-legged. The blue circle, set B, represents the living <b>creatures</b> <b>that</b> can fly. Each separate type of creature can be imagined {{as a point}} somewhere in the diagram. [...] Living <b>creatures</b> <b>that</b> both can fly and have two legs—for example, parrots—are then in both sets, so they correspond to points in the region where the blue and orange circles overlap. That region contains all such and only such living creatures.|$|R

5|$|At Sony's 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference, the North American {{release date}} was {{confirmed}} as March 12, 2013. A single-player demo was shown, revealing new gameplay mechanics and combat systems. An {{encounter with the}} sea monster Charybdis {{was included in the}} demo, but this sequence was cut from the final game. Charybdis was recast as the <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> Alecto transforms into during the final fight of the game. The same day, Papy confirmed on PlayStation.Blog that a collector's edition of the game would be released. He said Ascension was being developed to feature stereoscopic 3D, but it was ultimately cut. At gamescom 2012, new multiplayer footage was shown, followed by the announcement of a multiplayer beta.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} Matt Smith—and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) are summoned by River Song, a mysterious {{woman from the}} Doctor's future. She takes them to the planet Alfava Metraxis, where the spaceship Byzantium has crashed. Hidden inside is a Weeping Angel, a <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> can only move when unobserved by others. With the help of Father Octavian (Iain Glen) and his militarised clerics, the Doctor, Amy and River Song travel through a stone labyrinth to reach the ship. On the way, they discover that all the statues in the maze are Angels, which are slowly restoring and planning to trap them in the labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee is {{a mythical}} sea <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> {{appears as a}} horse-like demon when it ventures onto land. Writer and folklorist Ernest Marwick {{considered}} it {{very similar to the}} Norwegian nøkk, the nuggle of the Shetlands and the kelpie. A unique and solitary creature possessing extensive evil powers, its malevolent behaviour can influence events throughout the islands. Islanders were terrified of the creature and would not speak its name without immediately saying a prayer. It was often found in the vicinity of a beach, but would never come ashore if it was raining.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Snow White, {{which was}} a short story that the writers could expand and {{experiment}} with, Pinocchio {{was based on a}} novel with a very fixed story. Therefore, the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation. In the original novel, Pinocchio is a cold, rude, ungrateful, inhuman <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons by means of brutal torture. The writers decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen's dummy Charlie McCarthy, but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book. The story was still being developed {{in the early stages of}} animation.|$|E
5|$|A {{glassblower}} is {{attacked and}} hospitalized. Nemhauser (Greg Thirloway), another agent on the case, tells Scully that Patterson {{was responsible for}} getting Mulder assigned to the case and may admire him after all. Patterson finds Mulder in the library studying gargoyles; he tells Mulder that he's wasting his time and is a disappointment to him. Scully goes to Mulder's apartment and finds it covered with gargoyle drawings. Mulder, having sculpted a gargoyle himself in Mostow's studio before falling asleep, awakens to find a figure with a gargoyle-like face standing over him; he gives chase but is attacked, his face slashed with a utility knife. Mulder refuses to explain to Scully why he was in Mostow's studio. Scully confronts Patterson, who tells her not to try and stop Mulder from doing what he's doing, because she won't be able to. Mulder goes to see Mostow again, but Mostow will not tell him {{how to find the}} <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> attacked him.|$|E
5|$|Alice in Wonderland is a 2010 American fantasy {{adventure}} film {{directed by}} Tim Burton from a screenplay written by Linda Woolverton. The film stars Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas, and Mia Wasikowska and features {{the voices of}} Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, and Timothy Spall. Based on Lewis Carroll's fantasy novels, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. This film {{tells the story of}} a nineteen-year-old Alice Kingsleigh (stated in the film to be a daughter of Charles Kingsley), who is told that she can restore the White Queen to her throne, with the help of the Mad Hatter. She is the only one who can slay the Jabberwock, a dragon-like <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> is controlled by the Red Queen and terrorizes Underland's inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|Along the way, Samus defeats {{four of the}} Space Pirate bosses, {{including}} Kraid and Ridley, and {{arrives in}} Tourian—the heart of the Space Pirate base. There, she encounters the Metroid larva, which has now grown to an enormous size. It attacks Samus and nearly drains all of her energy before it realizes who she is, and then departs. Samus recharges her energy and confronts Mother Brain, the biomechanical <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> controls the base's systems and all the enemy forces on Zebes. Mother Brain nearly kills Samus, but is then attacked by the Metroid larva, which drains it of its energy and transfers it back to Samus. Mother Brain recovers and destroys the Metroid in retaliation, but is in turn defeated by Samus with the Hyper Beam—an extremely powerful weapon created from the energy given to her by the Metroid. Afterward, a planetary self-destruct sequence begins, which Samus narrowly escapes. If the player rescues the Dachora and the Etecoons—the creatures Samus encountered earlier in the game—during the escape, they are shown leaving the planet in the distance.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E
5|$|Angband (1990) was {{developed}} by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played UMoria, they wanted to expand the game even further. Working from UMorias code, they {{increased the number of}} levels and monsters, flavored the game based on Angband, the massive fortress controlled by Morgoth from Tolkien's fiction, and incorporated more of the deadlier creatures described within the Middle Earth mythology. They kept the Balrog as a difficult <b>creature</b> <b>that</b> must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following Cutler and Astrand's graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game through to a public release outside of the university, adding in elements such as giving the player a sense of the rewards and dangers of a level when they entered it the first time.|$|E
