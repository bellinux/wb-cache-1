50|$|Fellfields are {{typically}} populated by cushion plants: perennials that grow {{close to the}} ground. <b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> are well-adapted to the dryness and short growing season of a fellfield. <b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> often have hairy foliage and long taproots, to gather and retain moisture. Examples of <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> include the lupines and buckwheats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> {{have been}} {{described}} as ecosystem engineers because of their ability to locally maintain increased moisture and soil temperatures below the cushion ±15 °C (±27 °F) relative to adjacent soil temperatures. Some, specifically Mulinum leptacanthum and Oreopolus glacialis, have been positively identified as species that alter the macronutrient concentrations in the soil. These attributes allow other species to more easily colonize the harsh environments that <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> inhabit.

40|$|Nurse plant {{facilitation}} is {{a commonly}} reported plant–plant interaction {{and is an}} important factor influencing community structure in stressful environments. <b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> are an example of alpine nurse plants that modify microclimatic conditions within their canopies to create favourable environments for other plants. In this meta-analysis, the facilitative effects of <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> was expanded from previous syntheses of the topic and the relative strength of facilitation for other plants and for arthropods were compared globally. The abundance, diversity, and species presence/absence effect size estimates were tested as plant responses to nurse plants and a composite measure was tested for arthropods. The strength of facilitation was on average three times greater for arthropods relative to all <b>plant</b> responses to <b>cushions.</b> <b>Plant</b> species presence, i. e., frequency of occurrence, was not enhanced by nurse-plants. <b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> nonetheless acted as nurse plants for both plants and arthropods in most alpine contexts globally, and although responses by other plant species currently dominate the facilitation literature, preliminary synthesis of the evidence suggests that the potential impacts of nurses may be even greater for other trophic levels...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> {{have been}} shown to be a {{keystone}} species in the ecosystem in which they occur. For example, Azorella macquariensis is the only cushion-forming plant that occurs on Macquarie Island and it plays a vital role in the ecosystem as it makes up the major structural component of feldmark vegetation on the island (Threatened Species Section, 2012). <b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> are also often considered [...] "nurse species", as their presence is necessary in order for many other alpine species to become established. <b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> have been found to enhance species richness in areas with inherent impoverished local diversity (Cavieres et al. 2014). This effect is due to their low and compact growth form that alleviates severe alpine conditions (Cavieres et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|Foundation {{species can}} change plant {{community}} structure by modulating important ecological {{processes such as}} community assembly, yet this topic is poorly understood. In alpine systems, <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> commonly act as foundation species by ameliorating local conditions. Here, we analyze diversity patterns of species' assembly within cushions and in adjacent surrounding open substrates (83 sites across five continents) calculating floristic dissimilarity between replicate plots, and using linear models to analyze relationships between microhabitats and species diversity. Floristic dissimilarity did not change across biogeographic regions, but was consistently lower in the cushions than in the open microhabitat. <b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> appear to enable recruitment of many relatively stress-intolerant species that otherwise would not establish in these communities, yet the niche space constructed by <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> supports a more homogeneous composition of species than the niche space beyond the cushion's influence. As a result, <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> support higher alpha-diversity and a larger species pool, but harbor assemblies with lower beta-diversity than open microhabitats. We conclude that habitats with and without dominant foundation species can strongly differ in the processes that drive species recruitment, and thus the relationship between local and regional species diversity...|$|R

50|$|The <b>cushion</b> <b>plant</b> form is not {{endemic to}} any single area or plant family. About 338 species {{worldwide}} in 78 genera in areas ranging from Tasmania, New Zealand, and Tierra del Fuego {{to the arctic}} tundra of Svalbard have convergently evolved the same plant form in response to similar environmental conditions. Thirty four diverse plant families such as Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Donatiaceae, and the Stylidiaceae include <b>cushion</b> <b>plant</b> species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> {{commonly}} grow {{in rapidly}} draining rocky or sandy soils in exposed and arid subalpine, alpine, arctic, subarctic or subantarctic feldmark habitats. In certain habitats, such as peaty fens or bogs, <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> {{can also be}} a keystone species in a climax community. As such, the plants are often colonizers of bare habitat with little or no soil. Due to their role as initiators of primary succession in alpine habitats, the plants have specific adaptations to the desiccation and mechanically harsh environment of windy alpine slopes.|$|R

30|$|The {{fact that}} there have been few {{experimental}} studies (to our knowledge only Stenström et al. 1997; Alatalo and Totland 1997; Robinson et al. 1998; Le Roux et al. 2005; Day et al. 2009) of the impact of global change on <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> themselves represents a significant gap in knowledge, considering their important function as facilitator and nurse plants in alpine, polar and other harsh environments. The rarity of experimental studies on climate change is evidenced by the fact that a recent review of the ecological literature on <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> (Reid et al. 2010) did not acknowledge the existing experimental studies. Instead, information has been gleaned primarily from observational studies, which suggest that the longevity of plants may buffer them against changing climate variability (Morris et al. 2008) and that these long-lived <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> may be less sensitive to increased climate variability than short-lived plants. Furthermore, none of the existing studies that we are aware of address global change variables other than temperature.|$|R

40|$|High {{mountain}} environments {{are highly}} stressful for insect survival. It {{has been suggested}} that small microtopographic variations generating less stressful microclimatic conditions than the surrounding environment would provide more suitable sites for insect development. <b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> represent one of the life forms best adapted to the extreme alpine habitats. <b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> can modify microclimatic conditions within and under their canopy, generating less severe microsites than the surrounding environment. In this study, we characterized the microclimatic modifications made by the <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> Azorella monantha and Laretia acaulis and examine their role as microcliniatic shelters for two species of high Andean coleopterans (Coccinelidae) : Eriopis connexa and Hippodamia variegata at 3200 in a. s. l. in the Andes of central Chile. Results showed that the cushion species create microhabitats with higher availability of water and less oscillating temperatures. However, the intensity of modifications was higher in A. monantha compared to L. acaulis. The abundance of the two ladybird beetle species was higher within cushions than outside, although E. connexa showed higher abundances compared to H. variegata. However, a habitat selection experiment in a greenhouse showed that under milder temperature conditions ladybird beetles species do not prefer cushions. This suggests that in the harsh alpine climate, <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> may act as microclimatic shelters since they reduce stressful environmental conditions, allowing greater abundances of coleopterans than in the surrounding environment...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cushion</b> <b>plants</b> form large, {{low-growing mats}} that can {{grow up to}} 3 m in diameter. The typical form is a compact mass of closely spaced stems with minimal apical {{dominance}} that terminate in individual rosettes. Each stem grows at a consistent rate {{so that no one}} rosette is more exposed {{than the rest of the}} cushion. Observations on senescence have concluded that <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> typically die en masse rather than individual rosettes dying at separate times. Underneath the living rosettes, the plants typically produce nonphotosynthetic material or allow previous leaves to die, creating an insulating effect.|$|R

50|$|The {{varying levels}} of impact {{activities}} such as skiing, walking and camping are not adequately assessed.

50|$|Plants {{growing in}} the alpine or subalpine regions face the {{challenge}} of obtaining and retaining water. One solution for obtaining water is the growth of an extensive root system. A small alpine forget-me-not may stand only inches above the ground, but its taproot can extend for a couple of feet below the soil surface. The long taproot is necessary because of both the limited precipitation in many alpine and arctic environments, mostly as snowfall, and because of the rapid drainage of a newly formed and shallow soil. Besides obtaining water, the plant must also retain moisture to survive in a dry and desiccating environment. The compact growth form of <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> reduces air flow over the surface of the epidermis, reducing the rate of water loss. Additionally, many <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> have small and fleshy leaves which reduce the surface area of the plant, which reduces transpiration and conserves water. In alpine environments well above the tree line, cold is a limiting factor for growth, by having tightly packed stems and foliage, <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> are able to convert and trap heat from sunlight, causing them to warm several degrees above the ambient air temperature. Many alpine <b>cushion</b> <b>plants</b> also have thick matted hairs that warm up and heat the air trapped in between the hairs when the sun shines. These hairs also act as a greenhouse by preventing the warmer air from rising away from the plant, and they also act as wind breaks, preventing the wind from blowing away the trapped heat.|$|R
