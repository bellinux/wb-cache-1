40|$|In {{accordance}} with waste strategy for Turkey, {{the study was}} carried out to analyses waste engine <b>crankcase</b> <b>oils</b> and waste gearbox oils generated from vehicle maintenance services {{in order to determine}} their suitability for recycling, recovery or final disposal based on regulation published by Turkish Ministry of Environment and Forestry on 21 January 2004. The regulation requires all waste oil neither abandoned nor released into the environment and all batches must be analyzed for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, chlorine, total halogens, polychlorinated biphenyls, and flash points. The content analysis showed that the heavy metal concentrations in waste engine <b>crankcase</b> <b>oils</b> were varied considerably, between the metals analyzed, lead the highest is followed by chromium, arsenic and cadmium. In addition, higher amount of chlorine and total halogens, were detected in some samples, while polychlorinated biphenyls concentrations remained below regulatory limits for all samples. The analyses revealed that waste engine <b>crankcase</b> <b>oils</b> from fifteen to thirty five years old vehicles contained chromium, lead, chlorine and total halogens levels above legal limits set by Ministry of Environment and Forestry for recycling. Conversely, in comparison to the findings from the analyzed series of old vehicles, the waste engine <b>crankcase</b> <b>oils</b> samples from new vehicles and all waste gearbox oils are eligible for recycling...|$|R

50|$|Diels-Alder {{reaction}} of maleic anhydride and butadiene and isoprene gives the respective tetrahydrophthalic anhydrides {{which can be}} hydrogenated to the corresponding hexahydrophthalic anhydrides. These species are used a curing agents in epoxy resins. Another market for maleic anhydride is lubricating oil additives, which are used in gasoline and diesel engine <b>crankcase</b> <b>oils</b> as dispersants and corrosion inhibitors. Changes in lubricant specifications and more efficient engines have had {{a negative effect on}} the demand for lubricating oil additives, giving flat growth prospects for maleic anhydride in this application. A number of smaller applications for maleic anhydride. The food industry uses maleic anhydride in artificial sweeteners and flavour enhancements. Personal care products consuming maleic anhydride include hair sprays, adhesives and floor polishes. Maleic anhydride is also a precursor to compounds used for water treatment detergents, insecticides and fungicides, pharmaceuticals, and other copolymers.|$|R
40|$|Global {{demand for}} inexpensive, {{reliable}} power is increasing every year. In Asia, generators powered by stationary gas engines {{are becoming increasingly}} popular in areas where methane gas is available. Engine populations are expected to grow as gas distribution infrastructure is built. Although gas engines may resemble other engine types in their appearance and lubricant specifications, they generally benefit {{from the use of}} lubricants developed specifically for them. This is because gas engines stress <b>crankcase</b> <b>oils</b> in areas that may not be adequately addressed by oils developed for other applications. For instance, gas engines can expose the oil to severe nitration and oxidation conditions, and can be very sensitive to ash content and composition. Oils not designed properly for this application can shorten head rebuild cycles, accelerate sludge build-up, and shorten oil and filter life. In this paper, we provide background on gas engine types and their applications, discuss the formulation requirements for gas engine oils (GEOs), and provide examples of their performance...|$|R
50|$|An early {{development}} was the semi-tunnel crankshaft. This used large ball or roller bearings {{of the tunnel}} style for their centre bearings, but the end bearings (carrying the load of pistons on only a single side) remained with a small diameter bearing of conventional style. This reduced the bearing cost, and also reduced the linear speed of these smaller bearings. This was important as it also reduced {{the speed of the}} <b>crankcase</b> <b>oil</b> seals alongside them.|$|E
5000|$|This design uses oil seals {{to prevent}} the {{pollution}} from the combustion chamber (created by piston ring blow-by in four-strokes and just combustion in two-strokes) from polluting the <b>crankcase</b> <b>oil,</b> extending {{the life of the}} oil as it is used slowly for keeping the rings full of oil to hold and use to lubricate.

50|$|Waste oil is {{used oil}} {{containing}} not only breakdown products but also impurities from use. Some examples of waste oil are used oils such as hydraulic oil, transmission oil, brake fluids, motor oil, <b>crankcase</b> <b>oil,</b> gear box oil and synthetic oil. Many {{of the same}} problems associated with natural petroleum exist with waste oil. When waste oil from vehicles drips out engines over streets and roads, the oil travels into the water table bringing with it such toxins as benzene. This poisons both soil and drinking water. Runoff from storms carries waste oil into rivers and oceans, poisoning them as well.|$|E
5000|$|Diesel fuel {{has better}} {{lubrication}} properties than petrol as well. Indeed, in unit injectors, the fuel is employed for three distinct purposes: injector lubrication, injector cooling and injection for combustion. Although spark-ignition engines and their fuel systems {{do not require}} as much lubricity, the higher lubricity of diesel fuel aids in providing lubrication {{to the top of}} the cylinders and piston rings where it is most needed to resist the high heat, loads and friction resulting from compression and combustion. Because diesel fuels are actually very light oils, excess fuel in the cylinders and contaminating the <b>crankcase</b> <b>oil</b> is more easily tolerated by diesel engines.|$|E

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of used lubricants by FTIR spectroscopy is reviewed {{and placed in}} context of the recently approved ASTM Practice E 2412 - 04 developed by the Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) as a standardized means of trending oil/lubricant condition. A new spectral reconstitution procedure is presented and evaluated as an alternative means of executing this ASTM Practice, its objective being to minimize sample handling issues associated with the high viscosity of most in-service <b>oils.</b> Used diesel <b>crankcase</b> <b>oils</b> were analyzed in both their neat and diluted forms in 100 and 200 m KCl cells, respectively, and the coefficient of variation (CV) for accuracy of the spectral reconstitution procedure was < 5 % for all the parameters evaluated. Spectral reconstitution simplifies and facilitates sample handling, avoiding the need for peristaltic or syringe pumps, allowing up to 120 samples/h to be analyzed. The need for a solvent rinse between samples is avoided with cell clogging and tubing wear effectively eliminated. The spectral reconstitution technique also makes the ASTM Practice compatible with newer FTIR systems which are capable of quantitative determination of AN, BN and moisture...|$|R
50|$|A runaway {{condition}} {{can also}} result from oil supplied by {{failure of the}} oil seals in a turbocharged diesel engine, from overfilling the <b>crankcase</b> with <b>oil,</b> or certain other mechanical problems such as a broken internal fuel pipe or a worn or incorrectly assembled throttle linkage. In vehicles or installations that use both diesel engines and bottled gas (e.g. propane, natural gas, acetylene) or operate {{in an area where}} vapors may accumulate, a gas leak drawn back into the engine air intake can supply unintended fuel.|$|R
