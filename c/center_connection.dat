We solve a strong integer linear programming formulation based on so-called jump inequalities by a Branch&Cut algorithm. As the separation subproblem of identifying currently violated jump inequalities is difficult, we approach it heuristically by two alternative construction heuristics, local search, and optionally tabu search. We also introduce {{a new type of}} cuts, the <b>center</b> <b>connection</b> cuts, to strengthen the formulation in the more difficult to solve odd diameter case. In addition, primal heuristics are used to compute initial solutions and to locally improve incumbent solutions identified during Branch&Cut.

Starting with a problem of fragmentation of Central European book histories, the essay argues how this could be turned into an opportunity to apply comprehensive and comparative approaches, using cultural area and comparing isomorphism of documentary practices rather than following the commonly used linguistic criteria (the national vernacular). European identity has been central to the Croatian construction of identity, and this can provide a broader framework for resolving {{the problem of how to}} construct a national history that acknowledges its status as boundary culture. If the European periphery is to claim its own cultural discourse, this will have to be through the controversial, ideological, and difficult task of cultural revision in which it will have to ex-territorialize itself and abandon a dream in which the national vernacular assumes a major function in language and society. This will not be possible without understanding the borderlands and an acceptance of its unique role in which dualities need to be accepted as an epistemology for boundary histories to assume significance within the dominant discourses of culture. In the dualities and multiplicities of the borderlands there arise counter-hegemonic interpretations, and the periphery can be validated by revealing the patterns of the <b>center,</b> <b>connection</b> to other traditions, and its own uniqueness at the same time.

40|$|Fiber-based {{coalescers}} {{are widely}} used to accumulate droplets from aerosols and emulsions, where the accumulated droplets are typically removed by gravity or shear. This thesis investigate self-propelled removal of droplets from a hydrophobic fiber, where the surface energy released upon drop coalescence overcomes the drop-fiber adhesion toward the spontaneous departure. The self-propelled removal occurs above a threshold drop-to-fiber radius ratio, disrupting the power-law accumulation on a fibrous coalescer. The departure velocity approaches the capillary-inertial one at large radius ratios. In experiments, the condensation process including self-propelled removal phenomenon was captured on Teflon-coated fibers with radius of 13 ~$mu$m and 40 ~$mu$m. The power law of condensation is obtained by plotting time and averaged radius of droplets condensed on fibers in 2 -dimensional (2 D) image at that time. Then, {{to better understand the}} mechanism resulting such self-propelled removal, droplet-pairs with equal size were manipulated on different radius of fibers (on cones with slowly varied radius). To simplify analysis, two droplets were aligned so that their <b>center</b> <b>connection</b> line was perpendicular to the axis of fiber. By using two high-speed cameras, two views of this removal process were captured simultaneously. Based on information obtained in those video-pairs, the velocity immediate after removal and drop-to-fiber radius ratio were extracted for every case. In plotting those velocity against the radius ratio, data-sets of different size of fibers were collapsed on a single curved, implying critical radius-ratio (at which the removal starts) and asymptotic removal velocity (when radius ratio is very large). In understanding the fluid field in this dynamic process, a 2 D phase-field simulation were qualitatively compared with experimental observation, which help to explain why such self-propelled removal can happen on highly curved hydrophobic surface (micro-fiber), but not on flat hydrophobic surface. Understanding to this phenomenon can be useful in chemical industry, ventilation system, and oil separation, in all of which fibrous beds are used to separate aerosol from immiscible flow.
