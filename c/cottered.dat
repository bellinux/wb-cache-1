2500|$|In 1938 some {{restoration}} {{was undertaken}} by volunteer labour, organised by Captain Berry. In the 1960s, {{a small group}} of mill enthusiasts raised enough money to enable the mill to be made structurally safe. The mill was given to the Hertfordshire Building Preservation Trust in 1967 by the owner George Turner of <b>Cottered.</b> Building work carried out J. A. Elliott Ltd of Bishops Stortford included replacing some beams, and reboarding the mill and roundhouse roof. New stocks and sails, and a new set of rear steps were made by E. Hole and Sons, the Burgess Hill millwrights. The restoration took place between 1967 and 1969. Further structural repairs were carried out in 1979, including work to prevent infestation by Death Watch beetles. By 1988, the mill was again in need of attention. There was an unrealised proposal to use a helicopter to move the mill to a new site near Letchworth. In 1990, further restoration work carried out by Dorothea Restorations Ltd of Bristol included a new weather beam, rebuilding the brake wheel and repairing and refitting the sails. Further work funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage enabled the mill to be returned to working order in 1998. The mill was officially reopened on 21 June 1998 by Richard Whitmore ...|$|E
60|$|Dropping {{into the}} {{darkness}} of the locker beneath the forecastle, he was more fortunate than he could reasonably have expected to be, for as he crawled over the rusty links he felt a shackle. It appeared to be of the usual harp-pattern with a <b>cottered</b> pin, and he called out sharply to the Siwash, who presently flung him an iron bar and a big spike. He struck one of the two or three sulphur matches he had carefully treasured, and when the sputtering blue flame went out set to work to back the pin out in the dark. He smashed his knuckles and badly bruised his hands, but he succeeded, and knew that he had shortened the chain by two-thirds now.|$|E
