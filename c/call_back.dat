5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to <b>call</b> <b>back</b> to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a <b>call</b> <b>back,</b> and returned to audition once more.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{her talent}} {{exhibited}} on radio, Kuehl's agent convinced {{her parents to}} bring her to auditions for a television role. Kuehl later recalled [...] "The same 200 kids I think were there for the interview had been for the radio audition and I was <b>called</b> <b>back</b> and <b>called</b> <b>back</b> and <b>called</b> <b>back</b> and eventually I got that part. And beginning in 1950, I did that series for six years." [...] Kuehl was signed to play Jackie, Stuart Erwin's tomboy daughter, in the television series The Stu Erwin Show (also known as Trouble with Father) from 1950 to 1955.|$|R

25|$|The paguli was {{a ritual}} {{performed}} when all efforts {{to heal the}} moribund had failed, {{in an effort to}} <b>call</b> <b>back</b> the departed soul (1). A coconut shell of water was set upon the dying person’s stomach and was rotated to the chant: “Come back, soul, come back” as noted by Alcina in 1668. In the case of a datu, some slaves could be sacrificed to appease ancestor spirits.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{receipt of}} the report, Turnage decided to {{establish}} a platoon-sized outpost on the hill and the following morning a force from the 3rd Battalion, 21st Marines, which included heavy weapons support and an artillery forward observer, was sent out to occupy it. The Japanese, however, had returned during the night following the battle and had retaken the position and established themselves firmly. Heavy fire prevented the Marines from advancing and forced them to <b>call</b> <b>back</b> to regimental headquarters for reinforcements.|$|E

25|$|The timing flaw {{consisted}} of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, {{and making a}} second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer, entered safe mode, and sent a distress <b>call</b> <b>back</b> to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4, which alerted engineers {{that they needed to}} contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned {{for the remainder of the}} encounter.|$|E
25|$|The reorganizing {{also made}} a drastic change to the {{corporate}} culture. While ND previously had allowed {{a high degree of}} autonomy for its employees and divisions, issues became increasingly top-managed. Motivation and sales dropped, and the company lost much of its ability to get employees to work free overtime. In early 1991 a new round of layoffs was carried through, followed by a new reorganization. New control mechanisms were introduced to ensure that all employees understood the new model. Few employees would admit to not understanding it, but in reality most did not, enhancing the problem. New rounds of lay-offs took place in June and September, the latter consisting of 500 people. ND lost all its large customers and signed no large contracts in 1990 and 1991. One of the main reasons was that sales personnel were forced to <b>call</b> <b>back</b> to the office to confirm every step in negotiations.|$|E
25|$|The {{second meeting}} in New York was {{attended}} by Levine, Bellanca, and Chamberlin. With check in hand, Levine added a stipulation that Columbia Aircraft would select the crew on the flight, which Lindbergh objected to. Reminding Lindbergh that the WB-2 was the only plane that could make the flight at the time, they made him leave and <b>call</b> <b>back</b> {{the next day to}} reconsider. The terms did not change, and Lindbergh returned to St. Louis without an airplane. Lindbergh then approached Travel Air Manufacturing Company, asking for a Travel Air 5000 modified with a Wright Whirlwind motor and was declined. Lindbergh also inquired what it would cost to buy a Fokker for the attempt; he was given a quote of $100,000 for a custom trimotor, and was told that Fokker would not build a single-engine craft for a transatlantic flight. Lindbergh instead purchased a single-place aircraft from Ryan aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, for $6000.|$|E

25|$|At 6:00 PM on July 23, Forbes and Beach {{drove to}} the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore at 11105 Superior Avenue to see Evans. Not finding him there, they {{drove to the}} Evans' {{apartment}} at 12312 Auburndale Avenue and were {{surprised to discover that}} the Cleveland Police had, in fact, established a stationary surveillance around Evans' home. One unmarked car with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale, and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street. At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home. They talked with him for 15 minutes, during which time Evans expressed his anxiety about the police and his concern {{that he was going to}} be harassed again. Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director, James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by another call and asked Forbes to <b>call</b> <b>back</b> in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes drove to the home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics were}} {{extremely}} {{pleased with the}} <b>call</b> <b>back</b> to the teapot and Jim's note from [...] "Christmas Party". Adams felt that the scene, before the reveal of the note, was properly executed, and that the note made it even better. Sepinwall called it [...] "a fabulous payoff for longtime fans". Cornet called the sequence [...] "effective". Rick Porter of Zap2it wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "nice move" [...] {{on the part of the}} writers for [...] "not letting us know what Jim wrote on the card from 'Christmas Party' [...] it has to be pretty epic." ...|$|E
500|$|On [...] "Blame Game", West {{attempts}} {{to call his}} past lover, but he receives a <b>call</b> <b>back</b> instead and he hears a conversation between her and Chris Rock, who begins an extended monologue approximately five minutes into the song. [...] Chris Rock performs a vulgar, profanity-ridden sketch in which he compliments his lover's dress sense and sexual technique, and asks her who taught her these skills. Each time he asks, the answer is the same: [...] "Yeezy taught me.". Andy Gill of The Independent commented that a similar [...] "alliance of aristocratic piano and cello with less rarefied elements underpins 'Blame Game', a brutal rumination on West's sexual appetite".|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode {{three and a}} half stars out of five and called it [...] "another decent episode". Furthermore, he wrote that Pam and Nellie's bonding was the subplot that [...] "worked best". Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that [...] "the writers [...] trying to shove Andy Bernard in a Michael Scott-shaped hole." [...] Furthermore, he called Nellie [...] "the {{greatest}} square peg of them all." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger of the California Literary Review, despite enjoying the tension between Pam and Jim, felt that the main story never went anywhere. He called the main action of the episode [...] "lifeless", but wrote that the entry as a whole [...] "set up the conclusion of the series". Davinger also applauded Darryl's sound byte <b>call</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
500|$|Captain Cooper of Anderson {{first called}} the USCG in Sault Ste. Marie at 7:39p.m. on channel16, the radio {{distress}} frequency. The USCG responders instructed him to <b>call</b> <b>back</b> on channel12 {{because they wanted}} to keep their emergency channel open and they were having difficulty with their communication systems, including antennas blown down by the storm. Cooper then contacted the upbound saltwater vessel Nanfri and was told that she could not pick up Fitzgerald on her radar. Despite repeated attempts to raise the USCG, Cooper was not successful until 7:54p.m. when the officer on duty asked him to keep watch for a [...] boat lost in the area. At about 8:25p.m., Cooper again called the USCG to express his concern about Fitzgerald and at 9:03p.m. reported her missing. Petty Officer Philip Branch later testified, [...] "I considered it serious, but {{at the time it was}} not urgent." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} room, Greenfield and fellow speechwriter Adam Walinsky {{worked on a}} formal {{response}} to the King assassination with assistance over the phone from Ted Sorenson in New York City. (The original address prepared for the Cleveland City Club, a campaign piece on the economy meant to win the support of local business owners and Democratic Party officials, was dispensed with.) Sorenson's memory differed in that he recalled receiving a call from Kennedy {{at his home in}} Washington D.C, rather than New York, on the night of April 4. Kennedy asked for Sorenson's thoughts on a speech being prepared for his appearance in Cleveland and said he would <b>call</b> <b>back</b> within the hour. Sorenson, mindful of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, quickly began writing notes on scrap pieces of paper. When Kennedy called back, Sorenson dictated what he had produced and the senator transcribed it. Mankiewicz later recalled being [...] "occasionally" [...] involved in the drafting process.|$|E
