50|$|In 1900 Ernst Körting filed patents for a novel {{design of}} gas engine. This engine {{had a single}} water <b>cooled</b> <b>piston</b> that was double acting, i.e. the {{cylinder}} had combustion chambers at either end. As the engine was a 2-stroke this gave it continuous power strokes, much as a double acting steam engine. The lack of continuous power strokes in internal combustion engines was perceived by those used to steam as having the potential for mechanical problems due to the intermittent power strokes. The Körting design was quite successful {{in a range of}} applications particularly large installations powered by blast furnace gas.|$|E
50|$|Most {{aviation}} {{piston engines}} are air-cooled. Air cooled engines are lighter than their major alternative - water cooled engines, because the lower weight of air cooled engines in aircraft design being {{a more important}} factor than the lower drag of water cooled engines. While water cooled engines were widely used {{from the early days}} of flight, air cooled engines were the dominant choice in aircraft. Following the Second World War, turbojets and jet turbine powered aircraft have come to dominate flight regimes where water <b>cooled</b> <b>piston</b> engines offered a drag advantage. Thus today, piston engines are mostly used in slower general aviation aircraft where low weight is an advantage. Therefore, most aero engines produced today are of the air cooled variety. Today, most of the engines currently (2005) manufactured by Lycoming and Continental and used by major manufacturers of light aircraft Cirrus, Cessna and so on.|$|E

40|$|Recently, with {{development}} in the output power and material cost efficiency, the value of thermal and mechanical stress on many engine parts such as piston is increased. On the other hands, the strength of aluminum alloys used for piston manufacturing decreases with temperature. So, for lightweight pistons, the strength reduction should be minimized to maintain the mechanical integrity of the part. This drives piston designers to use strong and lightweight materials that can sustain a harsh thermal environment through improved oil cooling. In addition to modify the power output, <b>piston</b> <b>cooling</b> reduces the carbonization and pre-ignition caused by hot spots on sharp edges of the piston crown. In this study, in order to evaluate the <b>piston</b> <b>cooling</b> functionality and validate the numerical simulation, a test rig is designed and manufactured and it is equipped with glassy piston and cylinder to show the oil contact surface. Using this test rig, flow rate is measured in different oil pressures and temperatures. In addition, heat transfer coefficient for various engine speeds is determined. Also a numerical model has been developed using CFD approach for analysis of <b>piston</b> <b>cooling</b> oil jet and validated with existing experimental results at axisymmetric condition.

5000|$|As {{turbocharged}} or supercharged engines {{produce more}} power {{for a given}} engine size as compared to naturally aspirated engines, attention must {{be paid to the}} mechanical design of components, lubrication, and cooling to handle the power. <b>Pistons</b> are usually <b>cooled</b> with lubrication oil sprayed {{on the bottom of the}} piston.

50|$|The most obvious, and common, {{solution}} to this problem was to run the entire cooling system under pressure.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} piston-head temperature on knock-limited power. Tests were made in a supercharged CFR engine over a range of fuel-air ratios from 0. 055 to 0. 120, using S- 3 reference fuel, AN-F- 28, Amendment- 2, aviation gasoline, and AN-F- 28 plus 2 percent xylidines by weight. Tests were run at a compression ratio of 7. 0 with inlet-air temperatures of 150 F and 250 F and at a compression ratio of 8. 0 with an inlet-air temperature of 250 F. All other engine conditions were held constant. The piston-head temperature was varied by circulation of oil through passages in the crown of a liquid-cooled piston. This method of <b>piston</b> <b>cooling</b> decreased the piston-head temperature about 80 F.

50|$|In {{operational}} service, the NBL locomotives {{were less}} reliable than their Swindon-built cousins. Mild steel {{was used for}} the exhaust manifolds and these components were prone to fracture. Not only did this result in a loss of exhaust pressure to drive the turbochargers but also the driving cabs rapidly filled with exhaust fumes. The MAN-built engines used in the German DB class V 200 design had nickel-resist steel manifolds and were far less troublesome. The engine design also suffered from being quite highly rated for a design with no active <b>piston</b> <b>cooling</b> and <b>piston</b> ring life expectancy was decreased as a result. One MAN L12V18/21B was sent to the British Internal Combustion Engine Research Association for various tests and potential modifications to improve the deficiencies but nothing ever came of this. Further problems arose because of the conversion from metric to imperial feet and inches when the MAN drawings were received by NBL. It is almost certain that rounding errors in these conversions resulted in poor tolerances and lowered reliability in practice. Despite all this, figures for 1965 show the North British Warships covered a far greater annual mileage than contemporary Type 4's such as the Westerns, Peaks and Brush Type 4.|$|R

50|$|The Mazda FE-DOHC was the DOHC {{variant of}} the FE. The {{official}} Mazda engine codes are FE-DE and FE-ZE, depending on output level. It is still commonly called the FE3 because of its head castings. The FE-DOHC shares the same dimensions as the original FE-SOHC, including the square 86 mm bore × stroke and it has an ideal 1.74 rod/stroke ratio. The FE-DOHC is usually identified by a gold-coloured cam cover, however not always. There were at least five different FE-DOHC engines available with various compression ratio, camshaft and ECU tuning combinations, however none were fitted with a turbocharger from the factory. Despite this, the FE-DOHC is already built for turbo with large forged connecting rods, large journal dimensions, oil <b>cooler,</b> <b>piston</b> oilers, web-stiffened block with main girdles (and braceplate where equipped). This robust engine design is a favourite of tuners who are aware of its capability because it already has a high-power capacity perfect for custom turbo jobs. As much as 600 whp has been seen on a stock engine. The common FE-DOHC crankshaft is cast while the forged crankshaft is fitted to the aluminum sump engines with both the main bearing braces and the main bearing girdle plate. In European 10.0:1 compression, non-catalytic trim, the FE-DOHC produces 148 ps (108 kW) at 6000 rpm and 133 lb/ft (182 Nm) at 4000 rpm. The 9.2:1 compression, catalytic converter version produces 140 ps. The Japanese domestic market variants produce anywhere between 145 ps and 165 ps. The only vehicle with 165ps was the 96-97 Capellas Wagons, FX (MT or AT) or FX Cruising (Only exists in AT). They had different tail lights to the earlier wagons.|$|R
