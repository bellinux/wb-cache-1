25|$|The 160 and 165 are the <b>current</b> <b>entry</b> level {{offering}} from Caterham; the 160 {{is for the}} United Kingdom {{while the}} 165 is intended {{for sale in the}} European Union. It is only available with the S3 chassis, doors and windscreen as standard. There is a list of optional extras such as carpets, spare wheel, weather package and heater. It is powered by a turbocharged Suzuki 660cc kei car K6A engine producing 80 horsepower. Price starts at £14,999 in semi-kit form. This model, with its skinnier tyres and Suzuki driveshafts, is actually compact enough to be classified as a kei car in Japan, except for its power which is above the 64PS limit enforced for the class. The car's gearbox and live rear axle is also supplied by Suzuki; this is the first Caterham with a live rear axle since the supply of Morris Marina rears dried up after the Seven Beaulieu ended production in 2003. The car received a large amount of publicity for a low-powered entry-level model, with Suzuki even displaying it at the 2014 Frankfurt Motor Show. Production had to be adjusted upwards by 50%, with a third of the first year's production of 150 cars shipped to Japan.|$|E

Notice that although the data was inserted on the 4th, the database states that the information is valid since the 3rd. The official does not yet know if or when John will ever move to a better place so in the database the Valid-To is filled with infinity (∞).

50|$|The castle {{was built}} in granite {{in the first half}} of the 15th century for Jean and Yves de Kérouzéré, seneschal of Morlaix, and {{followers}} of the dukes of Brittany. Visible from the sea, Kérouzéré was dangerously exposed and was particularly vulnerable to English attacks. As such the duke permitted him to erect a single tower of more than twenty-four feet in width with crenellations and ditches. This construction caused a major controversy with the neighboring seigneur of Kermorvan. As a result, from 1466 the building was still unfinished and, in 1468, François II had to grant a second authorization for its completion. The original tower is the part of the manor-house located to the west of the <b>current</b> <b>entry</b> (the window of the chapel sits above it).|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Enigma consisted of a keyboard connected to a battery and a <b>current</b> <b>entry</b> plate or wheel (German: Eintrittswalze), at the right hand end of the scrambler (usually via a plugboard in the military versions). This contained a set of 26 contacts that made electrical connection with the set of 26 spring-loaded pins on the right hand rotor. The internal wiring of the core of each rotor provided an electrical pathway from the pins on one side to different connection points on the other. The left hand side of each rotor made electrical connection with the rotor to its left. The leftmost rotor then made contact with the reflector (German: Umkehrwalze). The reflector provided a set of thirteen paired connections to return the current back through the scrambler rotors, and eventually to the lampboard where a lamp under a letter was illuminated.|$|E

50|$|The four-story, {{limestone}} Classical Revival {{federal building}} {{sits on a}} granite base. The primary (south) elevation has the concentrated enrichment. This elevation consists of a horizontal balustrade with simple Tuscan capitals and an unenriched entablature, flanked by two monumental pavilions. The pavilions terminate {{the composition of the}} south elevation and consist of two 4' diameter, two-story high fluted Tuscan columns in limestone. The columns rests upon the first floor limestone base, and support an entablature. The dual fluted columns support an enriched entablature consisting of triglyphs interrupted by two stone rosettes, one above each column. This detailing is duplicated at each of the two pavilions. The fourth floor is concealed behind the entablature and cornice. The rear (north) elevation is secondary to the front and side elevations. The plan is typical of many post offices and courthouses of the time. The first floor covers the entire footprint and the upper floors are raised above the first floor in a B plan, where the primary elevation is the front of the B. The three wings which bridge from the front to the back are the east wing; the main ceremonial courtroom, Courtroom A, in the center; and the west wing. This plan results in two interior light courts which serve the interior offices and Courtroom A. The north elevation is the location of the loading dock and, at the northeast corner, the <b>current</b> <b>entry</b> door for the public to the postal sales area of the first floor.|$|E

The analysis was performed for 1 st degree (bachelor's degree and engineering) and 2 nd degree (master's degree) studies offered by various higher education institutions in Poland, and specifically, universities which form the Union of Universities in Support for Developing Spatial Management Studies. All the academic institutions covered by the research included studies in entrepreneurship or related topics in their curricula. The authors observed that their educational offer in the analysed domain was dependent on the level and type of studies and was the broadest in case of bachelor and master's degree studies but not so broad in case of engineering studies. Furthermore, a relationship between the scope of such offer and the profile of the university offering the spatial management studies was established...|$|R

Focusing on {{a subset of the}} Spanish-UNL dictionary, namely on the substantives it contains, the work has consisted in automatically enrich the universal word associated with each substantive with the semantic information required to link the universal word to the Universal Word System. For this process, WordNet has been employed as an external source of semantic information and used in addition to semantic features already present in the dictionary. The results achieved are not final and further work is required for a fully automatic, high quality semantic enrichment of the <b>current</b> <b>entries.</b> However, the work done shows the fruitfulness of the approach and its outcome has contributed {{to the creation of a}} master entries dictionary. ...|$|R

50|$|Elements of {{the former}} house garden, and estate {{landscaping}} remain today. These include {{the outline of the}} formal carriage loop north of the house, isolated elements such as mature trees and an avenue of rainforest tree species and palms going north from the house towards the river. More detailed elements such as a pedestal and urn, east of the house on the edge {{of the former}} carriage loop also remain. Tree plantings lining the former carriage loop north of the house include Canary Island date palms (Phoenix canariensis), southern nettle trees (Celtis australis) and cotton palms (Washingtonia robusta) with their tall, clean trunks to 20m high. An avenue of trees towards the river comprises Bunya Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla), Canary Island date palms and swamp mahoganies (Eucalyptus robusta). The latter of these may be later plantings. Walkway planting dates to the 1860s-1900, the main period of popularisation and fashionability of these species, and their promotion by such public figures as then Directors of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Charles Moore and Joseph Maiden. These men provided such species to many public institutions such as hospitals. Cotton and Canary Island date palms were also commonly promoted species in this period. Close to Holker Street and the main entry are large specimens of Hill's fig (Ficus hillii) and Moreton Bay figs, transplanted from estate remnants to the east of the <b>current</b> <b>entry</b> driveway as part of a redevelopment of the main entry. These trees are at least of 1880s vintage but possibly older. Significance trees throughout the site include the extremely rare Schotia afra (Kaffir bean, Boer bean) and the surviving turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera) which are likely to be indigenous to the site.|$|E
5000|$|CRNAs in the United States receive Master's or Doctoral {{degrees in}} nurse anesthesia. The Council on Accreditation {{develops}} requirements for degree programs. In 1981, the Council on Accreditation developed guidelines for master's degrees. In 1982, {{it was the}} official position of the AANA board of directors that registered nurses applying for a school of anesthesia shall be, at minimum, baccalaureate prepared and then complete a master's level anesthesia program. At that time, many programs started phasing in advanced degree requirements. As early as 1978, the Kaiser Permanente California State University program had evolved to a master's level program. All programs were required to transition to a master's degree beginning in 1990 and complete the process by 1998. Currently, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing has endorsed a position statement that will move the <b>current</b> <b>entry</b> level of training and education of nurse anesthetists in the United States to the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) or Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice (DNAP). This move will affect all advance practice nurses, with a mandatory implementation by the year 2015. In August 2007, the AANA announced its support of this advanced clinical degree as an entry level for practice of all nurse anesthetists with a target compliance date of 2025. In accordance with traditional grandfathering rules, all those in current practice will not be affected. Several nurse anesthesia programs have already transitioned to the DNP or DNAP entry level format. Because all programs will be converting to a doctorate level education, {{the length of the}} programs will continue to expand. [...] Nurse anesthetists have always embraced the responsibility of helping meet America’s growing healthcare needs. As healthcare technologies continue to advance and the knowledge base of the human body continues to expand, the 2025 requirement of a doctoral level education for entry into nurse anesthesia practice will ensure that patients have continued access to the highest quality anesthesia care that is possible.|$|E

30|$|In hierarchies, {{the task}} {{structure}} {{is defined by}} managerial decision and exposed selectively to organizational members as management sees fit. In markets, the scope of a transacted good is typically defined by the buyer, while the division of tasks involved in providing the good is decided by the supplier. In the ideal-type community, the task structure is designed and elaborated by community members in a distributed, self-organized fashion and transparently exposed, such as with Wikipedia where anyone can identify {{the need for a}} new encyclopedic entry as well as additions or corrections to <b>current</b> <b>entries</b> (Aaltonen and Lanzara 2015). While it is not uncommon in communities that basic task division is performed by actors in organizer roles such as project leaders and architects in OSS communities (Lee and Cole 2003), this could be viewed as a limited infusion of a hierarchical mechanism rather than a property of the community ideal form. One can observe both approaches to task division in OSDD where some challenges are defined by principal investigators, while other are identified by ordinary members as there are no restrictions on who can identify new tasks or problems for themselves or others to solve.|$|R
