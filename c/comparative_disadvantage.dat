60|$|Defeated as {{a general}} theory, the Protectionist {{doctrine}} finds support in some particular cases from considerations which, when really in point, involve greater interests than mere saving of labor—the interests of national subsistence and of national defense.(359) The discussions on the Corn Laws have familiarized everybody with the plea {{that we ought to}} be independent of foreigners for the food of the people; and the Navigation Laws were grounded, in theory and profession, on the necessity of keeping up a “nursery of seamen” for the navy. On this last subject I at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice; and that a country exposed to invasion by sea, if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet, is quite right in obtaining those means, even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport. When the English navigation laws were enacted, the Dutch, from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home, were able to carry for other nations, England included, at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves: which placed all other countries at a great <b>comparative</b> <b>disadvantage</b> in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war. The navigation laws, by which this deficiency was remedied, and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which England was then frequently engaged in hostilities, were probably, though economically disadvantageous, politically expedient. But English ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country, maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade. The ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer, and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade.|$|E

We observe geographical patterns: African and Carribean (and to a lesser extent Asian) countries have a ‘typical’ pattern of specialisation. Highly populated as well as richer countries diversify more.

The dispersion of resources in a multinational corporation drives intra-firm competition, which will typically lead to the removal of a subsidiary's charter if the subsidiary lacks specialized resources - typically an outcome of host country <b>comparative</b> <b>disadvantages</b> - and simultaneously holds {{a position on the}} periphery of the organizational network.

50|$|An {{attacker}} {{can successfully}} defeat in detail by exploiting either the absolute weaknesses or <b>comparative</b> <b>disadvantages</b> in the deployment or structure of defending troops, or advantages, such as maneuvering speed, that the defender cannot match.

For example, during World War I, when horse cavalry were still in use to some extent, aircraft could support cavalry, but cavalry had little or no ability to support aircraft. Thus, if a unit is equally suited for use against cavalry and against aircraft, using it to eliminate enemy aircraft would have benefits lasting well into future engagements against enemy cavalry units weaker for their lack of support, but using it against enemy cavalry—and thereby leaving the enemy aircraft intact for subsequent engagements—would bring benefits during that engagement alone.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to provide insight into the export competitiveness of meat products of the European Union (EU- 27) member states on global markets. The revealed comparative advantage index is used to analyze the levels, compositions, and evolutions in patterns of development in the export competitiveness of meat products and their levels of stability at the product level. Except for some niche meat products, a larger number of the EU- 27 member states have experienced <b>comparative</b> <b>disadvantages</b> on global markets over the analysed years of 2000 to 2011. The revealed comparative advantages on the global markets are the most robust for Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Denmark, Poland, Cyprus and Hungary.

The heterogeneity in export competitiveness of the EU- 27 member states suggests the importance of the differentiation of meat products in competitive export specialization on global markets...|$|R

50|$|The aim of a {{free-trade area}} {{is to reduce}} {{barriers}} to exchange so that trade can grow {{as a result of}} specialisation, division of labour, and most importantly via comparative advantage. The theory of comparative advantage argues that in an unrestricted marketplace (in equilibrium) each source of production will tend to specialize in that activity where it has comparative (rather than absolute) advantage. The theory argues that the net result will be an increase in income and ultimately wealth and well-being for everyone in the free-trade area. The theory refers only to aggregate wealth and says nothing about the distribution of wealth; in fact there may be significant losers, in particular among the recently protected industries with a <b>comparative</b> <b>disadvantage.</b> The overall gains from trade can be used to compensate for the effects of reduced trade barriers by appropriate inter-party transfers.|$|E

The explanatory variables (proxies for human capital, physical capital, market size and market integration) affect the dependent variable (unit-value differences) with relevant and significant coefficients. The negative sign for the variable human capital, interacted with the dummy for CEECs, suggests the existence of <b>comparative</b> <b>disadvantages</b> in the high-skill sectors for these countries. Moreover, the lower market size of CEECs could strengthen their disadvantage in high quality segments of production. However, the geographic proximity to the core of Europe and the integration process, which are strongly correlated with high quality trade, could make faster the process of catching up...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{international}} service {{trade has}} maintained a high speed of development. Global economic integration and industry structural adjustment of the world further promote the world economic center shifting from manufacturing to services. Since China joined WTO, the level of opening up gradually improves and service trade has achieved rapid growth.

Sometimes in elementary schools teachers force the students to sit boy, girl, boy girl. Sex segregation in educational settings can also lead to negative outcomes for boys such as boys in coeducational classrooms having academic scores higher than boys in single-sex classrooms. On the contrary, girls in single-sex classrooms have academic scores higher than girls in co-educational classrooms. Boys academically benefit from a coeducational environment while girls do from a single-sex environment, so critics and proponents of both types of education argue that either single-sex or coeducational classrooms create a <b>comparative</b> <b>disadvantage</b> for either sex. Athletic participation and physical education are examples where appeals to differences in biological sex may encourage segregation within education systems. These differences can impact access to competition, gender identity construction, and external as well as internalized perceptions of capabilities, especially among young girls. Segregation of public toilets by sex is promoted by human rights groups as being critical {{to ensure the safety of}} schoolgirls from male abuse.
