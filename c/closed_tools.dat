50|$|DCPD resins are {{transformed}} using high pressure RIM equipment {{as used in}} the polyurethane industry, with some small changes to be considered. As a reference, a widely used machine to inject DCPD resins is the Cannon A-100 fitted with a DCPD kit. The most important change is that the resin can never be in contact with air or moisture, which required a nitrogen blanket in the tanks. The tools or moulds are <b>closed</b> <b>tools</b> and are being clamped using a hydraulic press. Because the resins shrink about 6% in volume during reaction, these presses (also called clamping units) don't have to handle high pressures such as for Sheet Moulding Compound (SMC) or expanding polyurethane.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{contains}} {{a review of}} methods using elastomer tool, including the distribution of tools and suitability to the operations. Forming using elastomers is among the unconventional forming methods using flexible tool which is especially suitable for sheet metal forming. The material is used rubber and polyurethane. There are described properties, forming forces and other attractions of elastomers. The principle consists in replacing the fixed part of the tool flexible medium. Forming methods are divided to open <b>tool</b> forming and <b>close</b> <b>tool</b> forming, according {{to the construction of}} forming tool. Open tool forming includes bending and roll bending. Among the <b>close</b> <b>tool</b> forming methods is Guerin, Marform, Maslenikov, radial expanding and extrusion. The following are examples of tools and differences compared to conventional methods and liquids. The advantage of elastomeric tool is a low cost, simplicity and frugality to surface modified products. The disadvantage is a low life, low productivity and the use of large forming forces. Forming using elastomers has application in the prototypes and small series production...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{characteristic}} of the heat transfer coefficient of the boron steel for hot stamping process was studied in this paper. For obtaining the 1400 MPa high strength product by the hot stamping process, the microstructure of blank has to be transformed from austenite to fully martensite by the quenching process in <b>closed</b> <b>tools.</b> The heat transfer coefficient between the blank and tools then becomes an important role which may affect the cooling rate and the final microstructure distribution of the blank. In this study, the experimental platform was built, and the inverse calculating method was used for obtaining the heat transfer coefficient. The influence of the contact pressure on the heat transfer coefficient was also investigated, and it reveals that the contact pressure affect the interface heat transfer most. From the FEM simulations, it also shows that the temperature histories of the blank and tools are good agreement to the experiment results, which imply the feasibility of the experiment platform and the method for obtaining the heat transfer coefficient...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{metal forming}} {{technologies}} enable the mass-production of smallest parts for micro-technical applications. The future trend is to manufacture more complex parts {{at a high}} level of economic efficiency and precision. A common method to enhance the geometrical complexity of micro parts is the preheating of the workpiece. Conventional preheating processes are time cosuming, decrease the productivity and heat the complete workpiece, which can be disadvantageous in processes like deep-drawing. By a direct heating with laser radiation the temperature of local regions of the work piece can be increased quickly and the achievable process limits can be extended. Transparent tool parts made of sapphire permit the guidance of the laser radiation directly onto the workpiece within the <b>closed</b> <b>tool</b> during the process. This means no further preheating step and the avoidance of an extended total process time. In this paper applications of this technology in deep-drawing and can-extrusion processes as well as possibilities for theoretical predictions of dominating phenomena are discussed...|$|R

However, Design/CPN has to be considered as a <b>closed</b> <b>tool.</b> To enlarge its funcitonality the desire is to open the tool for its environment.

40|$|Tools for {{numerical}} analysis {{is a prerequisite}} in product development. Variations of the finite element method is widely used for simulation of metal manufacturing processes, for example sheet metal forming and hot stamping. However accurate the models are, {{there is still the}} issue of parameter estimation for the constitutive models used in the simulations. The increased use of high-strength steel in metal manufacturing processes necessitates forming at elevated temperatures. Formblowing and hardening (FH), where an austenitized profile blank is formed in a <b>closed</b> <b>tool</b> by injection of pressurised gas followed by rapid water cooling, is a recent development. The objectives are to increase knowledge regarding: characterisation methods for parameter estimation in constitutive models; numerical simulations of metal forming processes at elevated temperatures. Experimental material characterisation tests have been performed for deformation levels beyond plastic instability in standard tests. Methods for field measurements of deformation have been applied. Measurements were combined with inverse modelling for parameter estimation. Thermomechanical simulation models of the FH process have been developed. Complete process simulations were performed and compared with experiments. A pre-bursting failure criteria were implemented and compared with experimental burst tests.
