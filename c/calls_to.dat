In March 2016, the adult social work Principal Social Worker Network ran the first <b>Call</b> <b>to</b> Action {{in support of the}} Ministry of Justice Mental Capacity Action Day.

The approach made use of the open social media platform, twitter. Thematic analysis was undertaken of the content generated during the <b>Call</b> <b>to</b> Action. Secondary social network analysis was undertaken to map the relationships and exchanges which took place during the MCA <b>Call</b> <b>to</b> Action. The findings were that 269 unique users participated in the MCA <b>Call</b> <b>to</b> Action, two thirds of which self-identified as being social workers during the MCA <b>Call</b> <b>to</b> action. There were 244 media tweets posted during the <b>Call</b> <b>to</b> Action showing an image of an unwise decision, 80 % of these were posted by social workers.
