5|$|A {{subtropical}} <b>cyclone</b> is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical <b>cyclone</b> and some characteristics of an extratropical <b>cyclone.</b> They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel. As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the <b>cyclone</b> hybrids. By 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this <b>cyclone</b> category. Subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical <b>cyclone</b> list in the Atlantic Basin in 2002. They have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|A {{subtropical}} <b>cyclone</b> is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical <b>cyclone</b> and some characteristics of an extratropical <b>cyclone.</b> They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical <b>cyclone</b> is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. China {{is one of}} the {{countries}} which suffer the damage from Tropical <b>cyclones</b> most severely. Tropical <b>cyclones</b> catastrophe causes tremendous loss of life and great majority of damage to China every year. Because of the economic influence of Tropical <b>cyclones</b> catastrophe, the defense of Tropical <b>cyclones</b> becomes an important issue. This paper first analyzed the Tropical <b>cyclones</b> characteristic in China, then we discussed relationship between economic losses and Tropical <b>cyclones,</b> and finally we tried to present some feasible suggestions {{for the construction of a}} recovery system for Tropical <b>cyclones</b> from the three phases, including disaster defense and reduction system, disaster crisis management, and disaster loss evaluation and compensation system...|$|R
50|$|Otkin and Martin {{identified}} {{three types of}} kona storms: cold-frontal cyclogenesis <b>cyclones</b> (CFCs), trade wind easterlies, and cold-frontal cyclogenesis/trade wind easterlies <b>cyclones.</b> Of the three, CFC <b>cyclones</b> are the most common.|$|R
5|$|At 1200UTC on 1 April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{issued its}} first {{advisory}} on the system, classifying it as Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> 26S. At 0000UTC on 2 April, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) warning centre in Perth classified the low as Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> Inigo. The storm quickly intensified as it tracked southwestward, aided by low wind shear and strong divergence. An eye featured gradually organised, and early on 3 April the BOM classified Inigo as a severe tropical <b>cyclone</b> with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Later that day, the <b>cyclone</b> underwent rapid intensification {{as the eye}} became increasingly better defined. On 4 April, Inigo attained Category5 status on the Australian <b>cyclone</b> scale, and at 0600UTC it reached peak winds of 240km/h (150mph) and an estimated minimum pressure of 900hPa (mbar) while located about 950km (590mi) north of Onslow, Western Australia. Around the same time, the JTWC assessed Inigo as a powerful <b>cyclone</b> with 1-min winds of 260km/h (160mph). With a minimum pressure of 900hPa, Inigo tied <b>Cyclone</b> Gwenda of the 1998–99 season as the most intense tropical <b>cyclone</b> on record in the Australian <b>cyclone</b> region.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{tropical}} storms and hurricanes this season, {{there were four}} additional tropical depressions that {{did not make a}} landfall anywhere. Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> Four formed on July2 and dissipated the next day. It was {{the tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> to come closest to crossing 140°W and entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility this year. Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> Thirteen formed on September12 and lasted four days. Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> Seventeen formed October16 and dissipated a day later. Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> Nineteen, the penultimate system of the season, formed on November 1 and dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cyclone</b> Annette {{developed}} {{simultaneously with}} <b>Cyclone</b> Willy in the Australian basin and <b>Cyclone</b> Haja in the south-west Indian. On February3, a tropical low formed {{northeast of the}} Cocos Islands. Steered by a ridge to the south, it moved generally southwestward and intensified into Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> Annette, named by the Bureau of Meteorology. After executing a loop, Annette crossed 80E into the south-west Indian Ocean on February16. Upon crossing into the basin, the storm was renamed Jaminy by the Mauritius Meteorological Service. Around that time, the <b>cyclone</b> attained peak winds of 170km/h (105mph). Jaminy moved generally southwestward and weakened below <b>cyclone</b> status on February20. The next day, it turned to the southeast, later dissipating on February24.|$|E

5000|$|The Northern Iowa Panthers {{marked the}} fourth {{game on the}} <b>Cyclones</b> schedule. The <b>Cyclones</b> started slow, having a three {{and out to the}} Panther defense. Well the Panthers took over and moved the ball down field, a {{turnover}} would give the ball back to the <b>Cyclones.</b> The <b>Cyclones</b> in turn would take it down into Panther territory before settling for a field goal. But the <b>Cyclones</b> never looked back. The <b>Cyclones</b> took a 13-0 lead into the half and two [...] "pick 6's" [...] in the third quarter would put the game out of reach for they Panthers. While the Panthers moved the ball quite well, the <b>Cyclone's</b> defense stiffened when it needed to, forcing five Panther turnovers. The <b>Cyclones</b> shut out the Panthers 27-0, marking the first shutout victory since a 23-0 victory over the same UNI Panthers in 2004.|$|R
50|$|WKRB (90.3 FM) is the {{official}} radio station of the <b>Cyclones.</b> It served as radio home for every <b>Cyclones</b> season except 2012. WSOU was named {{the official}} radio station of the <b>Cyclones</b> on June 15, 2012 for the 2012 season, {{following the death of}} Warner Fusselle. <b>Cyclones</b> games will air occasionally on BCAT & SNY.|$|R
5|$|<b>Cyclone</b> Arthur (RSMC Nadi designation: 08F, JTWC designation: 09P) was {{the eighth}} {{tropical}} depression and fourth tropical <b>cyclone</b> of the 2006–07 South Pacific <b>cyclone</b> season. Forming as tropical depression on January25, Arthur rapidly intensified into a strong Category 2 <b>cyclone</b> on the Australian intensity scale {{according to the}} Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Nadi, Fiji. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the storm to have peaked as a minimal Category 1 <b>cyclone.</b> Shortly after peaking in intensity, the <b>cyclone</b> began to deteriorate due to unfavorable conditions. Quickly moving towards the east-southeast, the Arthur began to undergo an extratropical transition. After turning towards the southeast, the center of circulation was almost fully exposed due to strong wind shear. However, Arthur briefly re-strengthened late on January26 before becoming extratropical the next day. Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> Arthur affected several small islands during its existence. French Polynesia observed the most noteworthy effects from the storm, where several landslides damaged a few homes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cyclone</b> Fanele was {{the first}} <b>cyclone</b> of {{tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> status to strike western Madagascar since <b>Cyclone</b> Fame one year prior. It formed on January18, 2009 in the Mozambique Channel, and rapidly organized as it remained nearly stationary. Fanele ultimately turned toward the southwest Madagascar coastline, reaching peak winds of 185km/h (115mph), according to the Réunion Météo-France office (MFR). It weakened before moving ashore in Menabe Region southwest of Morondava, and rapidly weakened over land. Fanele briefly re-intensified after reaching open waters, only to become an extratropical <b>cyclone</b> by January23.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the frequency and duration of thunderstorms, lightning and southern <b>cyclones</b> over Estonia are presented for the period 1950 – 2010. A total of 545 southern <b>cyclones</b> and 2106 thunderstorm days were detected, whereas 11. 3 % of the observed thunder days were associated with southern <b>cyclones.</b> At the same time, 29. 2 % of all southern <b>cyclones</b> were accompanied by thunderstorms. In the thunder season, however, this percentage was much higher, reaching up to 80 % in summer months. The number of thunder days was largest when the centres of southern <b>cyclones</b> passed a measuring station at a distance less than 500  km. The number of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes related to southern <b>cyclones</b> was larger than {{that of any other}} thunder events. The results of our study demonstrate that the intensity of thunderstorms related to southern <b>cyclones</b> is higher than that of other thunderstorms. Correlation analysis revealed statistically significant {{relationships between}} the frequency of thunder days related to southern <b>cyclones</b> and the frequency of southern <b>cyclones,</b> also between the frequency of thunder days related to southern <b>cyclones</b> and days of other thunder events...|$|R
5|$|The South Pacific Ocean basin runs between 160°E and 120°W, with {{tropical}} <b>cyclones</b> {{developing in}} it officially {{monitored by the}} Fiji Meteorological Service and New Zealand's MetService. Tropical <b>Cyclones</b> that develop within this basin generally affect countries {{to the west of}} the dateline, though during El Niños <b>cyclones</b> have been known to develop to the east of the dateline near French Polynesia. On average the basin sees nine tropical <b>cyclones</b> annually with about half of them becoming severe tropical <b>cyclones.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Cyclone</b> Gonu set several {{intensity}} records. When {{it became}} a very severe cyclonic storm on June 3, Gonu became the strongest tropical <b>cyclone</b> on record in the Arabian Sea. Later, it became the only super cyclonic storm, which is a tropical <b>cyclone</b> with 3-minute sustained winds of at least 220km/h (140mph), in the region. The JTWC estimated peak winds of 270km/h (165mph). Based on their estimate, Gonu was tied with the 1991 Bangladesh <b>cyclone</b> for the strongest tropical <b>cyclone</b> in the entire northern Indian Ocean, and had the highest windspeed of any <b>cyclone</b> in this basin. On June 6, Gonu made landfall in extreme eastern Oman with winds of 150km/h (90mph), making it the strongest tropical <b>cyclone</b> on record to strike the Arabian Peninsula. With a damage total of $4.2billion (2007USD) and 50deaths, Gonu became the worst natural disaster on record in Oman. Additionally, the storm was only the second cyclonic storm on record to strike Iran, the other doing so on June 4, 1898.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cyclone</b> Hudah was a {{powerful}} and destructive tropical <b>cyclone</b> that affected Southeast Africa in April2000. It was the last {{in a series of}} three cyclones that impacted Madagascar during the year. Hudah first developed as a disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough on March22, within the Australian region <b>cyclone</b> basin. Moving westward {{as the result of a}} strong subtropical ridge to its south, the storm quickly intensified, and reached Category2 <b>cyclone</b> intensity on March25 before entering the Southwest Indian <b>cyclone</b> basin. For various reasons that remain unknown, the <b>cyclone</b> was only designated a name by the time it had crossed into the area of responsibility of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Réunion. Nonetheless, Météo-France (MFR) assigned the name Hudah to the <b>cyclone.</b> An eye formed, and the storm intensified into a tropical <b>cyclone</b> on March27 well to the southeast of Diego Garcia. On April1, the MFR upgraded it to a very intense tropical <b>cyclone,</b> estimating peak 10minute winds of 225km/h (140mph). By contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated 1minute winds of 235km/h (145mph). <b>Cyclone</b> Hudah maintained peak winds until making landfall just southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar on April2. It weakened greatly over land, but re-attained tropical <b>cyclone</b> status on April5 after moving over the Mozambique Channel. Hudah reached 10minute winds of 160km/h (100mph) by the time it made landfall on Mozambique near Pebane, Mozambique, on April8, and dissipated by the next day.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cyclone</b> Inigo {{was tied}} with <b>Cyclone</b> Gwenda for being the most intense {{recorded}} <b>cyclone</b> in the Australian region in terms of pressure. It developed from a tropical low that crossed eastern Indonesia in late March 2003. Becoming a named tropical <b>cyclone</b> on 1 April, Inigo rapidly intensified as it tracked southwestward, reaching a minimum central pressure of 900hPa on 4 April. An approaching trough weakened the <b>cyclone</b> and turned it to the southeast, and on 8 April Inigo dissipated after making landfall on Western Australia as a minimal tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cyclone</b> Jokwe of March 2008 was {{the first}} {{tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> to make landfall in Mozambique since <b>Cyclone</b> Favio struck in the previous year, and was the most recent <b>cyclone</b> to make landfall on Mazambique until <b>Cyclone</b> Dineo in 2017. The tenth named storm of the 2007–08 South-West Indian Ocean <b>cyclone</b> season, Jokwe was first classified as a tropical depression on March 2 over the open Southwest Indian Ocean. It tracked west-southwest, crossing northern Madagascar as a tropical storm on March 5 before intensifying into a tropical <b>cyclone</b> on March 6. Jokwe rapidly intensified to reach peak winds of 195km/h (120mph), before weakening slightly and striking Nampula Province in northeastern Mozambique. It quickly weakened while paralleling the coastline, though the storm restrengthened as it turned southward in the Mozambique Channel. Late in its duration, it remained nearly stationary for several days, and steadily weakened due to wind shear before dissipating on March 16.|$|E
