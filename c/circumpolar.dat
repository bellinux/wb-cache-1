5|$|The astronomical {{ceiling of}} the tomb of Senenmut (BC) {{contains}} the Celestial Diagram depicting <b>circumpolar</b> constellations {{in the form of}} discs. Each disc is divided into 24 sections suggesting a 24-hour time period. Constellations are portrayed as sacred deities of Egypt. The observation of lunar cycles is also evident.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} the Patagonian region is {{influenced}} both by the close distance to Antarctica and by the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies. Polar cold air outbreaks, cool ocean upwelling, orographic precipitation and the Antarctic <b>Circumpolar</b> Current further affect the regional climate.|$|E
5|$|A zigzag {{with seven}} stars is {{sometimes}} displayed, representing the Big Dipper (or the Bushel, the Chinese equivalent). In the Shang Dynasty of the 2nd millennium BCE, Chinese thought regarded the Big Dipper as a deity, while during the Han Dynasty, {{it was considered}} a qi path of the <b>circumpolar</b> god, Taiyi.|$|E
5|$|Around 23 Ma, the Drake Passage opened between Antarctica and South America, {{resulting}} in the Antarctic <b>Circumpolar</b> Current that completely isolated the continent. Models of the changes suggest that declining CO2 levels became more important.|journal=Nature|volume=421|pages=245–9|date=16 January 2003|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6920/abs/nature01290.html|doi=10.1038/nature01290|accessdate=19 October 2009|issue=6920|pmid=12529638 |bibcode = 2003Natur.421..245D }} The ice began to spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent.|$|E
5|$|The Arctic tern has a {{continuous}} worldwide <b>circumpolar</b> breeding distribution; {{there are no}} recognized subspecies. It {{can be found in}} coastal regions in cooler temperate parts of North America and Eurasia during the northern summer. During the southern summer, it can be found at sea, reaching the northern edge of the Antarctic ice.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has frequently been {{confused with the}} other <b>circumpolar</b> long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. This confusion was fueled by the resurfacing of an older name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded as being too ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens were also a mix of the two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998. The proposal was accepted and the taxon listed as rejected in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Bohemian waxwing has a <b>circumpolar</b> distribution, {{breeding}} {{in northern}} regions of Eurasia and North America. In Eurasia, its northern nesting limit is {{just short of}} the treeline, roughly at the 10°C July isotherm, and it breeds south locally to about 51°N. Most birds breed between 60–67°N, reaching 70°N in Scandinavia. The North American subspecies breeds in the northwestern and north central areas of the continent, its range extending southwards beyond the US border in the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Dalla Lana School of Public Health is a Faculty of the University of Toronto {{that began}} {{as one of}} the Schools of Hygiene begun by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1927. The School went through a {{dramatic}} renaissance after the 2003 SARS crisis, and it is now Canada's largest public health school, with more than 750 faculty, 800 students, and research and training partnerships with institutions throughout Toronto and the world. With more than $39 million in research funding per year, the School supports discovery in global health, tobacco impacts on health, occupational disease and disability, air pollution, inner city, <b>circumpolar</b> health, and many other pressing issues in population health.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of observing cosmological factors is also {{seen on the}} other side of the world. The Forbidden City in Beijing is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions. The Chinese system was composed of five directions: North, South, East, West and Centre. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing. One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing him in front of the <b>circumpolar</b> stars. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as feng shui.|$|E
5|$|Vega {{can often}} be seen near the zenith in the mid-{{northern}} latitudes during the evening in the Northern Hemisphere summer. From mid-southern latitudes, {{it can be seen}} low above the northern horizon during the Southern Hemisphere winter. With a declination of +38.78°, Vega can only be viewed at latitudes north of 51°S. Therefore, it does not rise at all anywhere in Antarctica or in the southernmost part of South America, including Punta Arenas, Chile (53°S). At latitudes to the north of +51°N, Vega remains continually above the horizon as a <b>circumpolar</b> star. Around July 1, Vega reaches midnight culmination when it crosses the meridian at that time.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a <b>circumpolar</b> star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be <b>circumpolar</b> throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest of the cluster can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before dawn. To see it after sunset, one will need to wait until December. By mid-February, the star is visible to {{virtually}} every inhabited region of the globe, with only those south of 66° unable to see it. Even in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, at the tip of the African continent, the star rises almost 32° above the horizon. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is <b>circumpolar</b> in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{is closer}} to the north {{celestial}} pole than any other first magnitude star. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is <b>circumpolar</b> north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are {{on opposite sides of the}} pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the winter sky in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales can {{be found}} in oceans nearly worldwide, but data about current {{population}} sizes is deficient. The long-finned pilot whale prefers slightly cooler waters than the short-finned, and is divided into two populations. The smaller group is found in a <b>circumpolar</b> band in the Southern Ocean from about 20 to 65°S. It may be sighted off the coasts of Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. An estimated more than 200,000 individuals were in this population in 2006. The second, much larger, population inhabits the North Atlantic Ocean, in a band from South Carolina in the United States across to the Azores and Morocco at its southern edge and from Newfoundland to Greenland, Iceland, and northern Norway at its northern limit. This population was estimated at 778,000 individuals in 1989. It is also present in the western half of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{lineages}} of rorquals {{and right}} whales split almost 20mya. It is unknown where this occurred, {{but it is}} generally believed that they, like their descendants, followed plankton migrations. These primitive mysticetes had lost their heterodont dentition in favor of baleen, and {{are believed to have}} lived on a specialized benthic, plankton, or copepod diet like modern mysticetes. Mysticetes experienced their first radiation in the mid-Miocene. Balaenopterids grew bigger during this time, with species like Balaenoptera sibbaldina rivaling the blue whale in terms of size. It is thought this radiation was caused by global climate change and major tectonic activity when Antarctica and Australia separated from each other, creating the Antarctic <b>Circumpolar</b> Current.|$|E
5|$|Distance {{from the}} sea is another {{important}} geographic factor. Owing {{to the shape of}} the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents that impact the climate of Argentina are the Brazil Current from the north and the Malvinas Current from the south (a branch of the Antarctic <b>Circumpolar</b> Current). The Brazil Current transports warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas Current transports cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas Current. As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego colder than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it is influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{the only}} planet in the Solar System on which deserts have been identified. Despite its low surface {{atmospheric}} pressure (only 1/100 of that of the Earth), the patterns of atmospheric circulation on Mars have formed a sea of <b>circumpolar</b> sand more than 5 million km² (1.9million sq mi) in area, much larger than deserts on Earth. The Martian deserts principally consist of dunes {{in the form of}} half-moons in flat areas near the permanent polar ice caps in the north of the planet. The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the Martian polar regions. Examination of the surface of rocks by laser beamed from the Mars Exploration Rover have shown a surface film that resembles the desert varnish found on Earth although it might just be surface dust. The surface of Titan, a moon of Saturn, also has a desert-like surface with dune seas.|$|E
25|$|Whether a star is <b>circumpolar</b> {{depends upon}} the observer's latitude. Since the {{altitude}} of the north or south celestial pole (whichever is visible) equals the absolute value of the observer's latitude, any star whose angular distance from the visible celestial pole {{is less than the}} absolute latitude will be <b>circumpolar.</b> For example, if the observer's latitude is 50° N, any star will be <b>circumpolar</b> if it is less than 50° from the north celestial pole. If the observer's latitude is 35° S, then all stars within 35° of the south celestial pole are <b>circumpolar.</b> Stars on the celestial equator are not <b>circumpolar</b> when observed from any latitude in either hemisphere of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Stars (and constellations) {{that are}} <b>circumpolar</b> in one {{hemisphere}} are always {{invisible in the}} high latitudes of the opposite hemisphere, and these never rise above the horizon. For example, the southern <b>circumpolar</b> star Acrux is invisible {{from most of the}} Contiguous United States, likewise, the seven stars of the northern <b>circumpolar</b> Big Dipper asterism are invisible from most of the Patagonia region of South America.|$|E
25|$|Whether a given star is <b>circumpolar</b> at the observer's {{latitude}} (θ) may {{be calculated}} {{in terms of}} the star's declination (δ). The star is <b>circumpolar</b> if θ + δ is greater than +90° (observer in Northern Hemisphere), or θ + δ is less than −90° (observer in Southern Hemisphere).|$|E
25|$|As one travels {{south of}} the Equator, the {{opposite}} happens. The south celestial pole appears increasingly high in the sky, and all the stars lying within an increasingly large circle centered on that pole become <b>circumpolar</b> about it. This continues until one reaches the Earth's South Pole where, once again, all visible stars are <b>circumpolar.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Antarctic <b>Circumpolar</b> Current encircles that continent, {{influencing}} the area's climate and connecting currents in several oceans.|$|E
25|$|A <b>circumpolar</b> star is a star, as {{viewed from}} a given {{latitude}} on Earth, that never sets {{below the horizon}} due to its apparent proximity {{to one of the}} celestial poles. <b>Circumpolar</b> stars are therefore visible from said location toward the nearest pole for the entire night on every night of the year (and would be continuously visible throughout the day too, were they not overwhelmed by the Sun's glare).|$|E
25|$|Xanthoria elegans has an {{extremely}} broad <b>circumpolar</b> and alpine distribution, and is found on all continents except Australia. It is widespread in Antarctic regions.|$|E
25|$|In Chinese astronomy, {{the stars}} of Camelopardalis are located within a group of <b>circumpolar</b> stars called the Purple Forbidden Enclosure (紫微垣 Zǐ Wēi Yuán).|$|E
25|$|The {{stars of}} Ursa Major were all <b>circumpolar</b> in Athens of 400 BCE, {{and all but}} {{the stars in the}} Great Bear's left foot were <b>circumpolar</b> in Ovid's Rome, in the first century CE. Now, however, due to the {{precession}} of the equinoxes, the feet of the Great Bear constellation do sink below the horizon from Rome and especially from Athens; however, Ursa Minor (Arcas) does remain completely above the horizon, even from latitudes as far south as Honolulu and Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>circumpolar</b> {{constellation}} is {{used for}} any constellation that, from a particular latitude on Earth, never sets below the horizon. From the North Pole or South Pole, all constellations south or north of the celestial equator are <b>circumpolar</b> constellations. Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations may include those that lie entirely between declinations 45° north and 45° south, or those that pass through the declination range of the ecliptic or zodiac ranging between 23½° north, the celestial equator, and 23½° south.|$|E
25|$|Some stars {{within the}} far {{southern}} constellations (such as Crux, Musca, and Hydrus) roughly {{south of the}} Tropic of Capricorn (-23½°) will also be <b>circumpolar</b> stars.|$|E
25|$|The University of Alberta {{is home to}} the Canadian <b>Circumpolar</b> Institute, which {{supports}} research into social and environmental issues including climate change, cultural identity and natural resource development.|$|E
25|$|Yellowknife {{hosted the}} inaugural Arctic Winter Games in 1970, {{and has since}} hosted athletes and artists from <b>circumpolar</b> regions at the {{biennial}} multi-sport and multi-cultural event in 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2008.|$|E
25|$|By {{the third}} century BC the Greeks had begun to use the Little Bear, Ursa Minor, to navigate. In the mid-1st century AD Lucan writes of Pompey who {{questions}} a sailor {{about the use of}} stars in navigation. The sailor replies with his description of the use of <b>circumpolar</b> stars to navigate by. To navigate along a degree of latitude a sailor would have needed to find a <b>circumpolar</b> star above that degree in the sky. For example, Apollonius would have used β Draconis to navigate as he traveled west {{from the mouth of the}} Alpheus River to Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|Some stars {{within the}} far {{northern}} constellation (such as Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Ursa Major, and Ursa Minor) roughly {{north of the}} Tropic of Cancer (+23½°) will be <b>circumpolar</b> stars, which never rise or set.|$|E
25|$|Ursa Major {{is visible}} {{throughout}} the year {{from most of the}} northern hemisphere, and appears <b>circumpolar</b> above the mid-northern latitudes. From southern temperate latitudes, the main asterism is invisible, but the northern parts of the constellation can still be viewed.|$|E
25|$|The Southern Ocean, geologically the {{youngest}} of the oceans, was formed when Antarctica and South America moved apart, opening the Drake Passage, roughly 30 million years ago. The separation of the continents allowed the formation of the Antarctic <b>Circumpolar</b> Current.|$|E
25|$|The Ross Gyre and Weddell Gyre are two gyres {{that exist}} within the Southern Ocean. The gyres {{are located in}} the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea respectively, and both rotate clockwise. The gyres are formed by {{interactions}} between the Antarctic <b>Circumpolar</b> Current and the Antarctic Continental Shelf.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012, Inuit <b>Circumpolar</b> Conference Chair Jimmy Stotts was {{reported}} as {{saying there is}} concern that increased shipping could adversely affect indigenous hunting of marine mammals. Also concerning {{is the lack of}} infrastructure on the Western Alaska coast to deal with a spill or a wrecked vessel.|$|E
