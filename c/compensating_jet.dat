40|$|We analyze an {{evolution}} of a localized flow in a half-plane bounded by a rigid wall when the total mass is not conserved within the equivalent-barotropic quasigeostrophic (QG) approximation. A simple formula expressing the total geostrophic mass {{in terms of the}} QG potential vorticity is derived and used to estimate the range of the geostrophic mass variability. Behaviour of the total mass is analysed for the system of two point vortices interacting with the wall. Distributed localized perturbations are examined by means of numerical experiments using the QG model. Two types of time variability of the total geostrophic mass are revealed: oscillating (the mass oscillates near some mean value) and limiting one (the mass tends to some constant value with increasing times). In the framework of a rotating shallow water model, the QG model is known to describe the slow evolution of the geostrophic vorticity assuming the Rossby number to be small. Consideration of the next-order dynamics shows that conservation of the total mass and circulation is provided by a <b>compensating</b> <b>jet</b> taking away the surplus, or shortage of mass from the localized geostrophic disturbance.

The role of Kelvin waves in establishing the usual Phillips condition for conservation of circulation of the along-wall QG velocity is discussed.
