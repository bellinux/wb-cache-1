I monitored movements of 17 radiocollared desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus crooki) to determine if deer were using the corridor for access across the aqueduct and the 26 km wide valley. I also examined deer use of vegetation associations and proximity to landscape features. Four deer crossed the canal but stayed within 500 m of the crossing site. One deer traversed the valley via the corridor. Overall, 22. 4 % of deer locations were in the corridor land system. Female mule deer generally used the mesquite (Prosopis velutina) -burroweed (Isocoma tenuisecta) vegetation association more than it was available and the palo verde (Cercidium spp.) -mixed cacti association less than it was available. Female deer were generally closer to the <b>CAP,</b> <b>housing</b> developments, roads, and permanent water than random points...|$|E

40|$|Global climate change, {{especially}} the phenomena of global warming, {{is expected to}} increase the intensity of land-falling hurricanes. Societal adaptation is needed to reduce vulnerability from increasingly intense hurricanes. This study quantifies the adaptation effects of potentially policy driven <b>caps</b> on <b>housing</b> densities and agricultural cover in coastal (and adjacent inland) areas vulnerable to hurricane damages in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal regions of the U. S. Time series regressions, especially Prais-Winston and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, are estimated to forecast the economic impacts of hurricanes of varying intensity, given that various patterns of land use emerge in the Atlantic and Gulf coastal states of the U. S. The Prais-Winston and ARMA models use observed time series data from 1900 to 2005 for inflation adjusted hurricane damages and socio-economic and land-use data in the coastal or inland regions where hurricanes caused those damages. The results from this study provide evidence that increases in housing density and agricultural cover cause significant rise in the de-trended inflation-adjusted damages. Further, higher intensity and frequency of land-falling hurricanes also significantly increase the economic damages. The evidence from this study implies that a medium to long term land use adaptation in the form of <b>capping</b> <b>housing</b> density and agricultural cover in the coastal (and adjacent inland) states can significantly reduce economic damages from intense hurricanes. Future studies must compare the benefits of such land use adaptation policies against the costs of development controls implied in <b>housing</b> density <b>caps</b> and agricultural land cover reductions...|$|R

50|$|The {{entrance}} tower hints {{back to a}} 14th century keep {{with its}} plain rendered walls, battlement and <b>cap</b> <b>house.</b> There's even a high-level door half hidden by the ornate portico. The addition of windows in the SW face of this tower in the 1930s somewhat detracted from the intended effect. Another tower consists of twin drum towers corbelled to the square and back again to round turrets and these twin towers are linked with an arch - the whole is similar in effect to the Seaton Tower at Fyvie Castle from 1599. While the building has five circular turrets it also has one square turret very similar in style to those at Crathes Castle (late 16th Century). Much of {{the remainder of the}} building reflects fairly standard Scottish Baronial architecture from 17th and 18th centuries. The rear elevation of the building is the plainest and more akin to the work of Charles Rennie Macintosh though the architects retained crow-stepped gables and as a result the property doesn't leak as disastrously as Macintosh's Hill House. It is a category B listed building. The house was built on the site of, and incorporating part of, an earlier building called Kincardine Lodge, dating from around 1780.|$|R
