5|$|The Bob Stump Memorial Parkway is a {{relatively}} new freeway in the far northwestern area of the Valley, serving cities such as Surprise, Peoria, Glendale, and northern Phoenix.

5|$|The bobcat {{has long}} been valued both for fur and sport; it has been hunted and trapped by humans, but has {{maintained}} a high population, even in the southern United States, where it is extensively hunted. In the 1970s and 1980s, an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting, but by the early 1990s, prices had dropped significantly. Regulated hunting still <b>continues,</b> <b>with</b> half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause. As a result, the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter, when hunting season is generally open.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} Charles was crowned as Charles XI {{does not mean}} that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This {{descendant}} was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still <b>continues,</b> <b>with</b> the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.|$|E

5|$|When helium is {{exhausted}} at {{the core}} of a massive star, the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon (see Carbon-burning process). This process <b>continues,</b> <b>with</b> the successive stages being fueled by neon (see neon-burning process), oxygen (see oxygen-burning process), and silicon (see silicon-burning process). Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{sideline}} 4...g5, {{the main line}} <b>continues</b> <b>with</b> both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns {{in return for a}} material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire the bishop pair. After 6.Nbd2Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may end up with the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all. The maverick gambit 6...f6 also exists.|$|E
