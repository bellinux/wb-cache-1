40|$|We {{conducted}} a 5 -month survey on primates; with {{special attention to}} Goeldi’s monkey (<b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii),</b> {{in the rain forest}} of northwestern Bolivia. Goeldi’s monkey is one of the least documented of all South American primates, and very little is known about its distribution. We report observations on distribution, abundance, and habitat of <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii</b> and other primates, incidental sightings of other mammals, and preliminary behavioral observations on Callimico and two associated callitrichid monkey species: Saguinus fuscicollis and S. labiatus. We found a locality that appears to be particularly suitable for detailed field observations on Callimico on the north bank of the lower Río Tahuamanu.

5000|$|The Goeldi's {{marmoset}} or Goeldi's monkey (<b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii)</b> is a small, South American New World monkey {{that lives}} in the upper Amazon basin region of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.

40|$|Compared {{to other}} species of {{tamarins}} and marmosets, <b>callimicos</b> (<b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii)</b> are characterized by hindlimb and hindfoot elongation, and a pattern of locomotion dominated by leaping to and from vertical supports in the forest understory. We present field data on trunk-to-trunk leaping in a habituated group of callimicos in northern Bolivia. We measured the DBH of the takeoff and landing platform, and the distance traveled during 110 trunk-to-trunk leaps. Our results indicate that mean distance leapt by callimicos was 1. 8 m (range 0. 2 – 4. 3 m). There {{were no significant differences}} in the size of takeoff (mean = 10. 3 cm) and landing platforms (mean = 9. 9 cm). In addition, longer leaps did not occur on larger diameter supports than did shorter leaps. Although tree trunks and saplings were the most commonly used takeoff and landing platforms, 31. 8 % of the time callimicos jumped to and from bamboo culms. These data highlight the facts that trunk-to-trunk leaping represents a highly specialized pattern of locomotion in callimicos, and that these primates travel through mixed forests that include stands of bamboo and canopy trees. Conservation efforts to sustain viable populations of <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii</b> must focus on protecting and preserving habitats that contain large tracts of mixed bamboo and secondary forest.

40|$|Abstract Background The taxonomic and phylogenetic {{relationships}} of New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) {{are difficult to}} distinguish {{on the basis of}} morphology and because diagnostic fossils are rare. Recently, molecular data have led to a radical revision of the traditional taxonomy and phylogeny of these primates. Here we examine new hypotheses of platyrrhine evolutionary relationships by reciprocal chromosome painting after chromosome flow sorting of species belonging to four genera of platyrrhines included in the Cebidae family: Callithrix argentata (silvered-marmoset), Cebuella pygmaea (pygmy marmoset), <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii</b> (Goeldi's marmoset) and Saimiri sciureus (squirrel monkey). This is the first report of reciprocal painting in marmosets. Results The paints made from chromosome flow sorting of the four platyrrhine monkeys provided from 42 to 45 hybridization signals on human metaphases. The reciprocal painting of monkey probes on human chromosomes revealed that 21 breakpoints are common to all four studied species. There are only three additional breakpoints. A breakpoint on human chromosome 13 was found in Callithrix argentata, Cebuella pygmaea and <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii,</b> but not in Saimiri sciureus. There are two additional breakpoints on human chromosome 5 : one is specific to squirrel monkeys, and the other to Goeldi's marmoset. Conclusion The reciprocal painting results support the molecular genomic assemblage of Cebidae. We demonstrated that the five chromosome associations previously hypothesized to phylogenetically link tamarins and marmosets are homologous and represent derived chromosome rearrangements. Four of these derived homologous associations tightly nest <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii</b> with marmosets. One derived association 2 / 15 may place squirrel monkeys within the Cebidae assemblage. An apparently common breakpoint on chromosome 5 q 33 found in both Saimiri and Aotus nancymae could be evidence of a phylogenetic link between these species. Comparison with previous reports shows that many syntenic associations found in platyrrhines have the same breakpoints and are homologous, derived rearrangements showing that the New World monkeys are a closely related group of species. Our data support the hypothesis that the ancestral karyotype of the Platyrrhini has a diploid number of 2 n = 54 and is almost identical to that found today in capuchin monkeys; congruent with a basal position of the Cebidae among platyrrhine families. </p...|$|R
50|$|Fauna {{are typical}} of the Amazon region. Many of the species are at the furthest west of their range.181 species of mammals have been {{recorded}} including equatorial saki (Pithecia aequatorialis), golden-mantled tamarin (Saguinus tripartitus), Goeldi's marmoset (<b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii),</b> jaguar (Panthera onca), margay (Leopardus wiedii), Sechuran fox (Lycalopex sechurae), southern little yellow-eared bat (Vampyressa pusilla), Schmidts's big-eared bat (Micronycteris schmidtorum), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), long-nosed armadillo (Dasypus), gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira), red brocket (Mazama americana) and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).Endangered mammals include white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).|$|R
25|$|Pygmy {{marmosets}} (Cebuella pygmaea), Goeldi marmosets (<b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii),</b> pacaranas (Dinomys branickii), {{and eastern}} lowland olingos (Bassaricyon alleni) are found here, {{but not in}} regions to the east. Other primates present include tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis and Saguinus imperator), brown pale-fronted capuchins (Cebus albifrons), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), white-faced sakis (Pithecia irrorata), and black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus). The rare red uakari monkeys (Cacajao calvus) {{are found in the}} north in swamp forests. Nocturnal two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni) are well distributed throughout this region along with the widespread three-toes sloths (Bradypus variegatus). The Amazon River is a barrier to a number of animals such as the tamarins Saguinus nigricollis, which occur on the north side, and Saguinus mystax, which occurs on the southwest side of the Amazon-Ucayali system.|$|R
40|$|Large and {{medium-sized}} mammals {{are essential to}} forest ecosystems as {{they are responsible for}} prey population control, seed dispersal and predation. A mammal survey was conducted in the Humaitá Forest Reserve (HFR), a 20 km² forest fragment located in the southeastern part of the state. The survey was carried out using census transects, camera traps, and occasional records such as bones and footprints. In all, 27 species of large to medium-sized mammals were recorded for the RFH, representing 48 % of those expected for the region. Dasyprocta fuliginosa, Pecari tajacu and Didelphis marsupialis were the species with the highest number of records with camera traps. The occurrence of two species of cats (Leopardus pardalis and Puma concolor) and three endangered species (<b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii,</b> Myrmecophaga tridactyla and Priodontes maximus) are important records for the RFH. The results may aid future research on the ecology, biogeography and conservation of mammals in the region...|$|R
40|$|We {{carried out}} a 4 -month census of {{primates}} in the Pando Department of northern Bolivia with special emphasis on Saguinus species. Contrary to a previous report by Izawa and Bejarano (1981), {{there was no evidence}} for the presence of the two populations of Saguinus mystax that they reported, or that Lagothrix occurs in the Pando. In addition, we found the distribution of Saguinus imperator to be more restricted than they suggested. We confirm the presence of Cebuella south of the Rıo Tahuamanu (cf. Brown and Rumiz, 1986) and report two new locations for <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii.</b> We present data on group sizes, habitat utilization, and locomotor behavior of the primates and compare them with previous studies in the Pando. Differences in body size, diet, foraging techniques, and vertical use of the forest appear to be key factors in both sympatry and in the formation of polyspecific associations...|$|R
5000|$|The Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve is a {{protected}} area with soaring rates of biodiversity. The reserve is located 20 km from Iquitos, being reached by Route LO-103. The ecosystem {{is part of}} the Nanay River basin, specifically in an area called [...] "Ecoregion Napo", which contains a unique Amazonian biodiversity, including its distinctive white sand forests. The Napo Ecoregion contains 112 species of amphibians, 17 species of primates, 1900 plant species and over 600 birds species. Some ecologically important animals care for their rarity in the reserve are the supay pichico (<b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii)</b> black stump (Callicebus torquatus), equatorial saki (Pithecia aequatorialis) ancient antwren (Herpsilochmus gentryi), Mishana tyrannulet (Zimmerius villarejoi), Allpahuayo antbird (Percnostola arenarum), chestnut-tailed ant (Myrmeciza centuculorum castanea), the pompadour cotinga (Xipholena punicea), saffron-crested tyrant-manakin (Neopelma chrysocephalum), among others.

40|$|This paper reports four fatal {{cases of}} metastrongylid {{nematode}} Angiostrongylus dujardini infection {{observed in a}} Saguinus oedipus and a <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii</b> monkey and in two suricates (Suricata suricatta). All animals were kept in captivity in a zoo of central Italy. The two monkeys died with no premonitory signs, while the two-month-old suricates showed malaise, anorexia and tachypnea {{for a few days}} prior to death. Cardiomegaly and/or granulomatous pneumonia were the major anatomo-pathological findings. Inflammatory lesions were observed in the liver, heart and kidney of the suricates at histology. A. dujardini diagnosis was confirmed through both morphological identification of adult worms recovered at necropsy and molecular characterization of larvae in tissue samples. Callitrichidae and suricates are active predators and maintain their hunting behaviour in captivity and it is then likely that they were exposed to infection by preying on parasitized gastropods, intermediate hosts of A. dujardini, entering zoo enclosures from the surrounding environment. This is the first report of A. dujardini in Italy and in S. suricatta...|$|R
40|$|The phylogenetic affinities of the neotropical Goeldi's monkey (<b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii)</b> {{have long}} {{been a matter of}} debate. Whereas most {{morphological}} evidence appears to place Callimico in a sister group position relative to the Callitrichidae, genetic studies place C. goeldii within the Callitrichidae and suggest that it is more closely related to marmosets than to tamarins. The present study presents the first radiographic analysis comparing the secondary limb bone ossification of newborn C. goeldii with representatives of the marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and tamarins (Saguinus oedipus). The state of secondary ossification of the epiphysis and short bones is classified into three different ontogenetic stages. Our results reveal that {{in terms of the number}} of ossification centers, C. goeldii is significantly closer to C. jacchus than to S. oedipus. This is the first morphological study to support the findings of molecular studies, and the results suggest that C. goeldii is more closely related to marmosets than to tamarins...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCallitrichid {{hepatitis}} (CH) is {{a highly}} fatal, rodent-borne zoonosis of New World primates (family Callitrichidae) caused by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). It is unclear whether virulence in Callitrichidae is associated with specific genetic or phylogenetic markers of the virus as only a partial S RNA sequence of a single CH-associated isolate is known. In a period of 10 months, three pygmy marmosets (Cebuella pygmaea) and one Goeldi's monkey (<b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii)</b> died from CH in a German zoo. LCMV was most likely transmitted by wild mice. Infection was associated with characteristic histopathological lesions in liver, brain, and lymphoid tissue. Virus sequences from all callitrichids and a captured mouse were ≥ 99. 2 % identical. LCMV strains from a pygmy marmoset and the Goeldi's monkey were isolated in cell culture and the 3. 4 -kb S RNA was completely sequenced. Both strains differed considerably in their genetic and phylogenetic characteristics from known LCMV strains, including the previously described CH-associated strain. These data show that CH is widespread and {{can be caused by}} distantly related LCMV strains...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{explored}} whether prolactin {{is associated}} with paternal care in 3 monkey species: titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus), common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), and Goeldi’s monkey (<b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii).</b> They compared prolactin levels in fathers before and after infant birth {{as well as between}} fathers and nonfathers. C. cupreus fathers carry infants almost exclusively, have higher prolactin levels than nonfathers, but show no prolactin increase after infant birth. C. goeldii fathers carry infants only after 3 weeks, show an increase in prolactin levels during the precarrying period, but do not have higher levels than nonfathers. C. jacchus fathers are the primary carriers, have higher prolactin levels than nonfathers, and show a trend for a prolactin increase after the birth of infants. In conclusion, species differences in the patterns of prolactin secretion were evident and reflect the different paternal roles. Direct paternal care in which fathers actively engage in behav-iors such as infant carrying and feeding is relatively uncommon yet {{can be found in a}} variety of animal taxa (Beck, 1998; Gross &...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the intra- and {{interspecific}} variability of the 14 / 15 association in Platyrrhini, we analyzed 15 species from 13 genera, including species {{that had not been}} described yet. The DNA libraries of human chromosomes 14 and 15 were hybridized to metaphases of Alouatta guariba clamitans, A. caraya, A. sara, Ateles paniscus chamek, Lagothrix lagothricha, Brachyteles arachnoides, Saguinus midas midas, Leontopithecus chrysomelas, <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii,</b> Callithrix sp., Cebus apella, Aotus nigriceps, Cacajao melanocephalus, Chiropotes satanas and Callicebus caligatus. The 14 / 15 hybridization pattern was present in 13 species, but not in Alouatta sara that showed a 14 / 15 / 14 pattern and Aotus nigriceps that showed a 15 / 14 / 15 / 14 pattern. In the majority of the species, the HSA 14 homologue retained synteny for the entire chromosome, whereas the HSA 15 homologue displayed fragmented segments. Within primates, the New World monkeys represent the taxon with the highest variability in chromosome number (2 n = 16 to 62). The presence of the HSA 14 / 15 association in all species and subspecies studied herein confirms that this association is the ancestral condition for platyrrhines and that this association has been retained in most platyrrhines, despite the occurrence of extensive inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements in this infraorder of Primates...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [81]- 94) A comparison among {{species was}} performed on twelve pairs of New World primates to determine if pair bonding behaviors were influenced by chronic progestin contraception {{in the form of}} subcutaneous melengestrol acetate (MGA) implants. In six of the pairs, the females were implanted with the MGA implant, while the other six were reproductive pairs. The species studied were <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii,</b> Leontopithecus rosalia, and Leontopithecus chrysomelas, with monogamous pairs being housed at the Brookfield Zoo, Brookfield, IL. The animals are all part of ongoing captive breeding programs in which genetic manipulation is necessary to sustain healthy gene pools. With the rising importance of captive breeding programs to save endangered animals, and their increasing successes, safe and reversible forms of contraception are needed to control for inbreeding and surplus animals. After recording 74 hours of behavioral data on 25 variables for 12 pairs, no significant effects of contraception could be shown for the behavior of males or females toward their respective mate. Treatment with MGA can be recommended for all three species studied based on its ability to provide contraception without causing profound social disruption. However, further research is needed on other species before this form of contraception should be widely advocated. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the third molars of <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii</b> represent a reversal in evolutionary tooth loss within the Callitrichinae. Loss of third molars is part of a suite of unusual characters that has been used to unite marmosets and tamarins in a clade to the exclusion of Callimico. However, molecular phylogenetic studies provide consistent support for {{the hypothesis that}} marmosets are more closely related to Callimico than to tamarins, raising the possibility that {{some or all of the}} features shared by marmosets and tamarins are homoplastic. Here, I use the binary-state speciation and extinction (BiSSE) model and a sample of 249 extant primate species to demonstrate that, given the shape of the primate phylogenetic tree and the distribution of character states in extant taxa, models in which M 3 loss is constrained to be irreversible are much less likely than models in which reversals are allowed to occur. This result provides support for the idea that the last common ancestor of Callimico and marmosets was characterized by the two-molared phenotype. The M 3 s of Callimico therefore appear to be secondarily derived rather than plesiomorphic. This conclusion may also apply to the other apparently plesiomorphic traits found in Callimico. Hypotheses regarding the re-evolution of M 3 in the callitrichine clade and the origin and maintenance of the two-molared phenotype are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to characterize the richness (number of species) of large and medium-sized mammals, and the antropic threats in the Parque Nacional da Serra do Divisor (PNSD). In 31 days data were collected through direct observations or evidences (bones, hairs, vocalizations and tracks) along pre-existing trails distributed in different types of vegetation. Wild mammals captured by local people were also considered. They were found 44 species of terrestrial mammals (with the exception of small mammals and bats) and two species of cetaceans, representing 73 % of the total predicted, according to the literature and information of local dwellers were registered in PNSD. They exist in the area two species classified by IUCN (1996) as "Endangered" [Cacajao calvus rubicundus (I. Geoffroy, 1806) and Priodontes maximus (Kerr, 1792) ] and five as "Vulnerable" [Ateles chamek (Humboldt, 1812), <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii</b> (Thomas, 1904), Lagothrix lagotricha poeppigii (Humboldt, 1812), Myrmecophaga tridactyla Linnaeus, 1758 and Inia geoffrensis (Blainville, 1817) ]. Given that subsistence and commercial hunting are common in the PNSD, mammals more affected by hunting [Ateles chamek (Humboldt, 1812), Lagothrix lagotricha (Humboldt, 1812), Tayassu pecari (Link, 1795) ] were observed only in the more remote areas such as Serra do Divisor, Rio Moa.

40|$|Studies of wild callitrichids reveal limited {{data about}} their complex diets. As insectivorous {{primates}} {{it is likely}} that they can digest chitin. Using the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, as a model, this study assessed chitin digestibility and whether or not a variety of zoo-housed callitrichid species display a preference for particular insect types. The presence of chitinolytic microorganisms in the faeces of Goeldi's monkey, <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii,</b> was investigated using both culture-based and molecular techniques and a preliminary evaluation of the faecal bacterial population was made. The measurement of faecal acid detergent fibre in C. jacchus showed that they did digest insect chitin and furthermore Goeldi's monkeys; cotton-topped tamarins, Saguinus oedipus, Geoffroy's marmosets, Callithrix geoffroyi and pygmy marmosets, Cebuella pygmaea, showed significant preferences for particular insect types. The presence of chitinolytic microorganisms in the faeces of C. goeldii, was confirmed with Cellulosimicrobium spp being among a number of chitinolytic microorganisms isolated. Using a range of agar media targeted to specific bacterial genera, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and coliforms were found in the faecal samples and numbers present estimated. As expected the highest count was for total anaerobes, with Bacteroides and Clostridium species present in high numbers. Molecular analysis resulted in the isolation of 113 16 S rDNA sequences which matched existing entries in the GenBank database. Eighty five % of the isolates were matched to clones of unassigned phylotype but clones from the genera Howardella, Escherichia, Shigella, Prevotella, Megasphaera and Bifidobacterium were identified. The evidence resulting from this investigation will inform diet development and aid in the future health management of callitrichids in captivity. Additionally, the isolation of novel chitinolytic microorganisms could have potential industrial applications where the degradation of chitin is of interest.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the susceptibility of peritoneal macrophage (PM) from the Neotropical primates: Callithrix jacchus, Callithrix penicillata, Saimiri sciureus, Aotus azarae infulatus and <b>Callimico</b> <b>goeldii</b> to ex vivo Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi-infection, the etiological agent of American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL), as a screening assay for evaluating the potential of these non-human primates as experimental models for studying AVL. The PM-susceptibility to infection was accessed by the PM-infection index (PMI) at 24, 72 h and by the mean of these rates (FPMI), {{as well as by}} the TNF-&# 945;, IL- 12 (Capture ELISA) and Nitric oxide (NO) responses (Griess method). At 24 h, the PMI of A. azarae infulatus (128) was higher than those of C. penicillata (83), C. goeldii (78), S. sciureus (77) and C. jacchus (55). At 72 h, there was a significant PMI decrease in four monkeys: A. azarae infulatus (128 / 37), C. penicillata (83 / 38), S. sciureus (77 / 38) and C. jacchus (55 / 12), with exception of C. goeldii (78 / 54). The FPMI of A. azarae infulatus (82. 5) and C. goeldii (66) were higher than C. jacchus (33. 5), but not higher than those of C. penicillata (60. 5) and S. sciureus (57. 5). The TNF-a response was more regular in those four primates which decreased their PMI at 24 / 72 h: C. jacchus (145 / 122 pg/mL), C. penicillata (154 / 130 pg/mL), S. sciureus (164 / 104 pg/mL) and A. azarae infulatus (154 / 104 pg/mL), with exception of C. goeldii (38 / 83 pg/mL). The IL- 12 response was mainly prominent in A. infulatus and C. goeldii which presented the highest FPMI and, the NO response was higher in C. goeldii, mainly at 72 h. These findings strongly suggest that these New World primates have developed a resistant innate immune response mechanism capable of controlling the macrophage intracellular growth of L.

40|$|International audienceThe ponerine ant Pachycondyla goeldii is a monogynous (i. e. one queen per colony) {{arboreal}} {{species that}} colonizes pioneer areas. Founding queens and first generation workers initiate their own ant garden {{by building a}} cardboard-like structure into which epiphyte seeds are integrated. Following {{the growth of the}} epiphyte, the colony establishes its nest within the root system. This particular nest-building behavior is crucial in an environment where suitable nest sites are rare. Nevertheless, the slow growing process of ant gardens does not allow this species to readily evacuate and find another refuge in the advent of an attack by a predator or worsening climatic conditions. Previous field studies of P. goeldii were performed after forest destruction and subsequent colonization by P. goeldii. As a result, the colonies studied where relatively young and monodomous (i. e. one nest per colony). Our study of nest composition, worker exchanges between ant gardens in the field, and dyadic encounters shows that mature colonies of P. <b>goeldii</b> are polydomous (<b>i.</b> e. multiple nests per colony). In ants, the association of polydomy with monogyny has infrequently been reported. To our knowledge, P. goeldii represents the first record of a Ponerinae exhibiting both these particular characteristics. Our field and laboratory experiments suggest that polydomy is adaptively advantageous in coping with the microclimatic instability of pioneer areas by providing colonies with easily accessible nests...|$|R
