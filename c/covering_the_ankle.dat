The hair[,] parted in the centre, is plaited into about twenty little twists called Jadilah.[FN#28] Of ornaments, as usual among Orientals, they have a vast variety, ranging from brass and spangles to gold and precious stones; and they delight in strong perfumes, musk, civet, ambergris, attar of rose, oil of jasmine, aloe-wood, and extract of cinnamon. Both sexes wear Constantinople slippers. The women draw on Khuff, inner slippers, of bright yellow leather, serving for socks, and <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankle,</b> with Papush of the same material, sometimes lined with velvet and embroidered with a gold sprig under the hollow of the foot. In mourning the men show no difference of dress, like good Moslems, to whom such display of grief is forbidden. But the women, who cannot dissociate {{the heart and the}} toilette, evince their sorrow by wearing white clothes and by doffing their ornaments. This is a modern custom: the accurate Burckhardt informs us that in his day the women of Al-Madinah did not wear mourning.|$|E

50|$|Dress {{boots are}} short leather boots worn by men.

The boot {{is lower than the}} hockey version, often not <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankles.</b> All bandy skates are designed such that they will not cause injury to an opponent. The blade is generally an inch longer than the hockey skates, allowing for higher speeds at the large bandy rink. The Russian bandy skates have an even longer blade and a very low cut shoe.|$|R
25|$|Some {{designs of}} dress shoes {{can be worn}} by either gender. The {{majority}} of dress shoes have an upper covering, commonly made of leather, enclosing most of the lower foot, but not <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankles.</b> This {{upper part of the}} shoe is often made without apertures or openings, but may also be made with openings or even itself consist of a series of straps, e.g. an open toe featured in women's shoes. Shoes with uppers made high to cover <b>the</b> <b>ankles</b> are also available; a shoe with the upper rising above <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> is usually considered a boot but certain styles may be referred to as high-topped shoes or high-tops. Usually, a high-topped shoe is secured by laces or zippers, although some styles have elastic inserts to ease slipping the shoe on.|$|R

The shell of the costume is constructed out of papier-mâché molded to resemble a horse supported by a bamboo frame. It is then covered with bright colored fabric elaborately designed with mirror-work embroidery known as Shisha. The dummy horse does not have legs. Instead, fabric is draped around <b>the</b> dancer's waist <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> entire length of his legs.

50|$|Sagittal plane {{motions of}} <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> occur at <b>the</b> talocrural joint. As the heel {{contacts}} <b>the</b> ground <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> joint is near neutral in either slight plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. Immediately following heel strike <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> plantar flexes until the foot is positioned {{flat on the}} ground. This plantar flexion movement is controlled eccentrically by <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> dorsiflexors. As <b>the</b> body glides over the fixed foot, a maximum of about 10 degrees of ankle dorsiflexion is reached. <b>The</b> <b>ankle</b> dorsiflexion {{is a result of}} the tibia moving forward over the foot and is facilitated by eccentric control provided by the soleus. Concurrently, the knee reaches full extension and as the heel rises off <b>the</b> ground <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> begins to plantar flex. <b>The</b> <b>ankle</b> reaches a maximum of 15-20 degrees of plantar flexion right before push-off which is accomplished concentrically by the plantar flexor muscles. Right after toe off <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> is dorsiflexed to neutral position for toe clearance during swing phase.|$|R

In like manner, the inversion muscles are stretched when <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> joint becomes elevated. Throughout this seated stretch, <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> joint is to remain supported while depressed and elevated with the ipsilateral (same side) hand in order to sustain the stretch for 10–15 seconds.
