30|$|Both {{gravimetric}} and instantaneous samplers {{were used}} for testing the CAC for respirable dust control. Each gravimetric sampler consisted of an Escort ELF® pump, a 10 -mm Dorr-Oliver cyclone, and a 37 -mm, 5 -µm PVC filter. The Escort ELF pumps were calibrated to maintain 2.0  L/min airflow. The Thermo Scientific pDR- 1000 ®was used as the instantaneous sampler. The typical sampling package was comprised of two gravimetric samplers and one instantaneous sampler. One sampling package was placed approximately 0.91  m (3 ft.) upstream of the shuttle <b>car</b> <b>cab</b> and another was placed 0.91  m (3 ft.) downstream of the shuttle <b>car</b> <b>cab.</b> These sampling packages monitored the respirable upstream and downstream dust concentrations to ensure consistent dust concentrations throughout the test.|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{experiment was}} conducted {{to determine the effect}} of reduced visibility on driver lateral (steering) control. The simulator included a real <b>car</b> <b>cab</b> and a single lane road image projected on a screen six feet in front of the driver. Simulated equations of motion controlled apparent car lane position in response to driver steering actions, wind gusts, and road curvature. Six drivers experienced a range of visibility conditions at various speeds with assorted roadmaking configurations (mark and gap lengths). Driver describing functions were measured and detailed parametric model fits were determined. A pursuit model employing a road curvature feedforward was very effective in explaining driver behavior in following randomly curving roads. Sampled-data concepts were also effective in explaining the combined effects of reduced visibility and intermittent road markings on the driver's dynamic time delay. The results indicate the relative importance of various perceptual variables as the visual input to the driver's steering control process is changed...|$|E
40|$|Non-fatal tibia {{and ankle}} {{injuries}} without proper {{protection from the}} restraint system has gotten wide attention from researchers. This study aimed to investigate occupant tibia and ankle injuries under realistic frontal impact environment that is rarely considered in previous experimental and simulant studies. An integrated occupant-vehicle model was established by coupling an isolated <b>car</b> <b>cab</b> model and a hybrid occupant model with a biofidelic pelvis-lower limb model, while its loading conditions were extracted from the realistic full-frontal impact test. A parametric study was implemented concerning instrument panel (IP) design and pedal intrusion/rotation parameters. The significant influences of the IP angle, pedal intrusion and pedal rotation on tibia axial force, tibia bending moment and ankle dorsiflexion angle are noted. By coupling their effects, a new evaluation index named CAIEI (Combined Ankle Injury Evaluation Index) is established to evaluate ankle injury (including tibia fractures in ankle region) risk and severity in robustness. Overall results and analysis indicate that ankle dorsiflexion angle should be considered when judging the injury in lower limb under frontal impact. Meanwhile, the current index with coupling effects of tibia axial force, bending moment and ankle dorsiflexion angle is in a good correlation with the simulation injury outcomes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhen people gaze at real scenes, their visual {{attention}} is driven both {{by a set}} of bottom-up processes coming from the signal properties of the scene and also from top-down effects such as the task, the affective state, prior knowledge, or the semantic context. The context of this study is an assessment of manufactured objects (here <b>car</b> <b>cab</b> interior). From this dedicated context, this work describes a set of methods to analyze the eye-movements during the visual scene evaluation. But these methods can be adapted to more general contexts. We define a statistical model to explain the eye fixations measured experimentally by eye-tracking even when the ratio signal/noise is bad or lacking of raw data. One of the novelties of the approach is to use complementary experimental data obtained with the "Bubbles" paradigm. The proposed model is an additive mixture of several a priori spatial density distributions of factors guiding visual attention. The "Bubbles" paradigm is adapted here to reveal the semantic density distribution which represents here the cumulative effects of the top-down factors. Then, the contribution of each factor is compared depending on the product and on the task, in order to highlight the properties of the visual attention and the cognitive activity in each situatio...|$|E
50|$|One major variant is the <b>cab</b> <b>car.</b> The <b>cab</b> <b>car</b> {{is placed}} {{at the end of}} the train and {{features}} a full cab built into the end of the coach, from which the train's locomotive can be remotely controlled. This allows for push-pull operation with a faster turnaround time for trains, by avoiding having to physically turn around the train or locomotive. Unlike the similar Driving Van Trailer used by Britain's InterCity 225, the <b>cab</b> <b>cars</b> are otherwise identical to the regular coaches rather than imitating the design of the locomotive, leading to the appearance that the train is travelling 'backwards'. In 2014 Metrolinx (the provincial agency operating GO Transit) and Bombardier announced a new design for the <b>cab</b> <b>car,</b> which included a larger cab end and crash-energy management crumple zones.|$|R

40|$|Full-scale {{experiments}} {{using two}} 4 -door sedan passenger cars, placed {{side by side}} in the reverse direction, were carried out to establish the burning behavior and describe the spread of fire to adjacent car. The temperature was measured by thermocouples. Radiant heat flux was measured with heat flux gauge placed at a distance of 5  m, at the right side of the car. Four cameras were placed inside the car and in the fire test room recording burning behavior during the test. Engine compartment was ignited by a sponge dipped with little gasoline. During the experiment, the ignition was initiated in the engine compartment of car I and approximately 20  min were enough time for fire to spread into the second car. Fully-developed burning of two cars occurred at 29  min. It was observed that the flame spread through car roof faster than through the bottom of car compartment. The fire followed a slow rate spread from engine compartment to <b>car</b> <b>cab.</b> The temperature inside the car peaked at the point of 900  °C. The peak smoke temperatures at every location were measured at the range of 89 – 285  °C.

30|$|To improve dust {{reductions}} {{from the}} CAC, {{modifications to the}} canopy locations were tested. Installing a spoiler and moving the CAC 22.86  cm (9  in.) forward from the operator location seem {{to provide the best}} improvement in the performance of the CAC. Dust reductions of 70 % at 0.61  m/s (120 fpm), 66 % at 2.0  m/s (400 fpm), and 51 % at 4.2  m/s (850 fpm) ventilation airflows were achieved. Although the 60 % dust reduction threshold was not met at 4.2  m/s (850 fpm), a 51 % reduction is close and is sufficient to proceed with field testing. In addition, the 4.2  m/s (850 fpm) air ventilation quantity threshold was originally based upon a mine ventilation velocity measured in an intake entry and the maximum shuttle car speed of 9.6  km/hr (6 mph) (Joy Global 2016). Recent studies completed by NIOSH show that the maximum air ventilation quantity threshold may not be equal to mine intake air plus the maximum shuttle car speed (Shahan and Reed 2018), and relative velocity may be significantly lower than 850 fpm in mines. In addition, the higher airflow a shuttle car encounters is generally associated with lower dust concentrations. In fact, the shuttle car operators’ highest respirable dust exposure occurred when being loaded by the continuous miner in blowing face ventilation. Therefore, the modification of moving the CAC 22.9  cm (9 in.) forward and flush mounted onto the shuttle <b>car</b> <b>cab</b> roof should be sufficient to achieve the targeted 60 % reduction.|$|E
40|$|Parking Lot Park is a live public {{event that}} maps the various geographies - geologic, political, social, and sexual- which {{intersect}} {{within the first}} Open Space Park of San Diego, California: San Clemente Canyon. Currently known as Marian Bear Park, the land has undergone many transformations: formerly a harvest spot for the Kumeyaay and later grazing territory for Mission era cattle ranchers, the presently U. S. -owned canyon was protected from highway expansions in the 1970 s by it's namesake, Marian Bear. Parking Lot Park unfolded November 8 th, and 9 th 2014 as a sound promenade and drive-in theater within the canyon itself. Staged for audiences of 50, participants traversed the canyon with flashlights to discover 6 sound installations.
