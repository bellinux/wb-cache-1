The greatest significance attributed to the student <b>practical</b> <b>training,</b> arises from the established perception among the professional and scientific community, that a quality <b>practical</b> <b>training</b> and an internship availability for students, is the most convenient form of professional development. Guided by this factual situation, at the same time bearing in mind the actual European and global trends, we analyzed the concept of implementation <b>of</b> student <b>practical</b> <b>training,</b> the scope {{and the quality of the}} internships, the reflections in the varied and numerous areas of activity, and the influence on the socio-economic development in a broader context.
