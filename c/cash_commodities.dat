40|$|We {{investigate}} the long-term (30 -year) efficient frontier weights in five common asset class indexes by adding classes one-by-one to the stock-bond frontier. Our {{results show that}} bonds are the most effective diversifier for stocks, real estate is helpful only at higher risk levels, and international stocks and commodities add little diversification benefits over the longer time horizon. Overall, our results highlight the difficulties using modern portfolio theory to quantify asset class allocations. The efficient frontier (the highest expected return for a given standard deviation), holds a sacred place in academic finance and has driven much of the world’s movement towards increased diversification. Further, diversification across broad asset classes (stocks, bonds, <b>cash,</b> <b>commodities</b> and real estate for example) is commonly believed {{to account for the}} vast majority of long-term portfolio returns and picking the right assets within asset classes for only a smaller proportion. Given the means, standard deviation and covariance’s of the asset classes, mathematical programming can solve for the weights in the asset classes for different levels of risk tolerance (portfolio standard deviation) so the portfolio is “optimized ” (has the highest return/risk profile). A central issue for this research is that asset class weights calculated using the efficient frontier do not significantly differ depending on the combination of asset classes chosen to estimate the inputs (asse...|$|E

40|$|Value-at-Risk, {{known as}} VaR, gives a {{prediction}} of potential portfolio losses, {{with a certain}} level of confidence, that may be encountered over a specified time period due to adverse price movements in the portfolio???s assets. For example, a VaR of 1 million dollars at the 95 % level of confidence implies that overall portfolio losses should not exceed 1 million dollars more than 5 % of the time over a given holding period. This research examines the effectiveness of VaR measures, developed using alternative estimation techniques, in predicting large losses in the cattle feeding margin. Results show that several estimation techniques, both parametric and nonparametric, provide well-calibrated estimates of VaR such that violations (losses exceeding the VaR estimate) are commensurate with the desired level of confidence. In particular, estimates developed using JP Morgan???s Risk Metrics methodology appear robust for instruments that have linear payoff structures such as <b>cash</b> <b>commodity</b> prices. published or submitted for publicationnot peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{portfolio}} {{approach to}} hedging {{assumes that the}} p ¡ motivation for hedging is risk reduction. The paper eexamines the portfolio approach to hedging and respecifies the model {{in such a way}} that hedge ratios are estimated using returns rather than price levels. Using the same data set, hedge ratios estimated using price levels differ from one while hedge ratios using returns are found to be insignificantly different from one. The results do not support he portfolio approach to hedging. Therefore, one must look elsewhere for empirical support for the risk-reduction theory of hedging. Key words: hedging, portfo l io model, risk reduct ion. Johnson and Stein (JS hereafter) in the early 1960 s attempted to use the portfolio theory developed by Markowitz for securities to ra-tionalize the observation that participants in futures markets are often ot fully hedged. JS argued that a combination of spot and futures positions may be analyzed asa two-security portfolio and that it may be rational under some circumstances to be less than fully hedged. The JS approach tended to support the traditional theory of hedging which held that the primary motivation for hedging was risk reduction. The traditional theory was figorously challenged by Working (1953 a,b, 1962), who argued that the major motivation for hedging was not o reduce risk but rather to profit from favorable changes in basis and/or to use futures markets as an aid in pricing <b>cash</b> <b>commodities.</b> 1 ~~he JS theoretical results have been rein-forced by empirical tests of the portfolio model in which it is found that hedge ratios estimated using simple regression techniques are often less than one. For instance, Ederington is able to make the statement: "Contrary to the traditional hedging theory 9 [...] our empirical results indicate that eve...|$|E

40|$|Hay is {{expensive}} to produce given {{the cost of}} labor, machinery, fuel, and fertilizer prices. However, {{it is an important}} crop providing feed for cattle, horses, and sheep when pasture is not available. Hay and haylage provide a means of preserving forage for use during drought and winter and for sale off the farm as a <b>cash</b> <b>commodity.</b> The value of hay is based on its nutritional quality. To make producing hay profitable the hay’s nutritional quality needs to be greater than its cost of production. The nutritional requirements of the animals hay is fed to determine the quality of hay required or the need for additional supplemental feeds. The animal’s nutritional requirements are determined by its species, age, size, and production level. Young animals need nutrients for growth. Lactating animals need nutrients for milk production. After water, digestible energy is the nutrient needed in the greatest abundance and its availability is dependent on the forage’s digestibility. The animal’s need for protein is related to the animal’s energy intake and its type and level of production. For high producing animals fed cool season forages, energy will usually limit production. When feeding energy supplements with hay, if the supplements are fed in excess to the availability of crude protein (CP) in the forage, protein supplements will also b...|$|R
