40|$|A {{positive}} relationship {{between the number of}} siblings and a child's chance of being stunted has been seen in several studies. It is possible that individual stunting risks are also raised by high fertility in the community, partly because of the impact of aggregate fertility on the local economy, but this issue has not been addressed in earlier investigations. In this study we estimate the independent effect of the <b>child</b> <b>dependency</b> ratio in the province (or governorate, region, or larger geopolitical zone within a country), using DHS data on up to 145, 000 children in 152 provinces in 23 countries with at least two such surveys. The data design allows inclusion of lagged province variables and province fixed effects (to control for constant unobserved province characteristics). Three types of regression models for a child's chance of being stunted are estimated. Some estimates suggest an adverse effect of the current <b>child</b> <b>dependency</b> ratio, net of the child's number of siblings, while others do not point in this direction. When the <b>child</b> <b>dependency</b> ratio measured in an earlier survey is included instead, no significant effects appear. Thus, we conclude that there is only weak support for the idea that a child's stunting risk may be raised by high fertility in the community...|$|R

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{have proposed that}} parent-child attachment security should favor child sleep. Research has yet, however, to provide convincing support for this hypothesis. The current study used objective measures of sleep and attachment to assess the longitudinal links between mother-child attachment security and subsequent sleep, controlling for <b>child</b> <b>dependency.</b> Sixty-two middle-class families (30 girls) were met twice, when children were 15 months (Wave 1; W 1) and 2 years of age (Wave 2; W 2). At W 1, mother-child attachment was assessed with the observer version of the Attachment Q-Sort. At W 2, children wore an actigraph monitor for 72 hours. Results indicated that children more securely attached to their mothers subsequently slept more at night and had higher sleep efficiency, and these predictions were not confounded by <b>child</b> <b>dependency.</b> These findings suggest a unique role for secure attachment relationships {{in the development of}} young children’s sleep regulation, while addressing methodological issues that have long precluded consensus in this literature...|$|R

2500|$|The {{decline in}} death rate and birth rate that occurs during the {{demographic}} transition may transform the age structure. When {{the death rate}} declines during {{the second stage of}} the transition, the result is primarily an increase in the child population. The reason being that when the death rate is high (stage one), the infant mortality rate is very high, often above 200 deaths per 1000 children born. When the death rate falls or improves, this may include lower infant mortality rate and increased child survival. Over time, as individuals with increased survival rates age, there may also be {{an increase in the number}} of older children, teenagers, and young adults. This implies that there is an increase in the fertile population proportion which, with constant fertility rates, may lead to an increase in the number of children born. This will further increase the growth of the child population. The second stage of the demographic transition, therefore, implies a rise in <b>child</b> <b>dependency</b> and creates a youth bulge in the population structure. As a population continues to move through the demographic transition into the third stage, fertility declines and the youth bulge prior to the decline ages out of <b>child</b> <b>dependency</b> into the working ages. This stage of the transition is often referred to as the golden age, and is typically when populations see the greatest advancements in living standards and economic development. However, further declines in both mortality and fertility will eventually result in an aging population, and a rise in the aged <b>dependency</b> ratio. An <b>increase</b> of the aged dependency ratio often indicates that a population has reached below replacement levels of fertility, and as result does not have enough people in the working ages to support the economy, and the growing dependent population.|$|R

40|$|Differences in infant outcome, {{predictor}} variables, {{and their}} relationships were explored {{as a function}} of maternal employment. Thirty 18 -month-olds and their mothers were studied. Child intelligence, attachment security, and dependency were measured, as well as frequency of stressful events in the mother's life, quality of the parents' marital relationship, frequency of the mother's social contacts, and extent of the mother's emotional and parenting supports. Also included were the mother's ability to cope; satisfaction with emotional, parenting, and child care supports; and role satisfaction. For children of employed mothers, attachment and dependency were negatively correlated; securely attached <b>children</b> showed less <b>dependency</b> behavior. For employed mothers, satisfaction with child care and frequent social contacts predicted secure child attachment. Satisfaction with child care, role satisfaction, and ability to cope were strongly interrelated. For nonemployed mothers, maternal coping predicted attachment security, while frequent social contacts predicted greater <b>child</b> <b>dependency.</b> Predictors of <b>child</b> outcome were highly interrelated for nonemployed mothers, with satisfaction with emotional supports playing a pivotal role. These differences suggest that different models to predict infant outcome in employed and nonemployed mother families may be appropriate...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} design theorems or {{principles}} {{are used for}} the development of normalized systems, i.e. systems that are stable with respect to a defined set of anticipated changes, circumventing most combinatorial effects. Combinatorial effects are (hidden) coupling or <b>dependencies,</b> <b>increasing</b> with the size of the system.

Since current software constructs allow combinatorial effects any developer is able to violate any principle at any time.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{explores the}} {{influence}} of the 1994 tax reform on intrapro-vincial inequality in financing basic education. The empirical analysis finds that the reform has decreased inequality in general, suggesting that the center may attain its policy goal through centralizing its relative fiscal capability and increasing the intergovernmental transfers. The data defy that there is a leaner relationship between the fiscal dependency of the province on the center and educational inequality, even though the reform has changed the fiscal dependency of each province significantly. But the study strongly sup-ports that there is a U-shaped relationship between fiscal dependency and inequality. This indicates that when fiscal <b>dependency</b> <b>increases,</b> education in a richer province will be more equal, whereas that in a poorer province will be more unequal...|$|R
