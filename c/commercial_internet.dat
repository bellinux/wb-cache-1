Through her leadership and collaboration with PSINet and UUnet, Estrada helped form the interconnection enabling the first <b>commercial</b> <b>Internet</b> traffic via the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Internet</b> Exchange. She wrote Connecting to the Internet in 1993 and she was inducted to the Internet Hall of Fame in 2014. She is on the Board of Trustees of the Internet Society.|$|E

25|$|Before <b>commercial</b> <b>Internet</b> access became common, these {{networks}} of BBSes provided {{regional and international}} e-mail and message bases. Some even provided gateways, such as UFGATE, by which members could send/receive e-mail to/from the Internet via UUCP, and many FidoNet discussion groups were shared via gateway to Usenet. Elaborate schemes allowed users to download binary files, search gopherspace, and interact with distant programs, all using plain text e-mail.|$|E

25|$|On 10 June 2009 the {{two major}} ISPs in Iceland, Vodafone Iceland and Iceland Telecom {{at the behest of}} SAFT (Save the Children Iceland) and other {{interest}} groups instated a null route on the website ringulreid.org, making it inaccessible to most <b>commercial</b> <b>Internet</b> users in Iceland. Other members of the Reykjavik Internet Exchange didn't institute the null route, but both Vodafone and Síminn blocked it at their Icelandic routers.|$|E
25|$|Public {{commercial}} {{use of the}} Internet began in mid-1989 with the connection of MCI Mail and Compuserve's email capabilities to the 500,000 users of the Internet. Just months later on 1 January 1990, PSInet launched an alternate Internet backbone for {{commercial use}}; one of the networks that would grow into the <b>commercial</b> <b>Internet</b> we know today. In March 1990, the first high-speed T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was installed between Cornell University and CERN, allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites. Six months later Tim Berners-Lee would begin writing WorldWideWeb, the first web browser {{after two years of}} lobbying CERN management. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 0.9, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the first Web browser (which was also a HTML editor and could access Usenet newsgroups and FTP files), the first HTTP server software (later known as CERN httpd), the first web server, and the first Web pages that described the project itself. In 1991 the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Internet</b> eXchange was founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with the other commercial networks CERFnet and Alternet. Since 1995 the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including the rise of near instant communication by email, instant messaging, telephony (Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP), two-way interactive video calls, and the World Wide Web with its discussion forums, blogs, social networking, and online shopping sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more.|$|E

25|$|Count 4: Replacement of ThaiCom 4 with iPSTAR. A {{previous}} {{government had}} originally contracted with ShinSat to launch and operate ThaiCom 4 {{as a backup}} satellite for ThaiCom 3. Instead, ShinSat negotiated with the Thaksin government to launch iPSTAR, {{at the time the}} largest commercial satellite in history, which it claimed could offer <b>commercial</b> <b>internet</b> services while also providing backup for ThaiCom 3. However, the claim is not technically possible since iPSTAR does not have C-band transponders as ThaiCom 3. Shin Corp's ownership in ShinSat was subsequently reduced from 51% to 40%. The judges found that the changes in ownership and satellite specification change reduced Thailand's communications security by not having the backup satellite for ThaiCom 3 on the one-to-one basis. It also noted that the negotiations allowed ShinSat to launch a satellite with much greater commercial potential than ThaiCom 4 without having to bid for a separate concession agreement.|$|E

2500|$|TCP/IP {{network access}} {{expanded}} again in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet) provided access to supercomputer {{sites in the}} United States for researchers, first at speeds of 56 kbit/s and later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 45 Mbit/s. <b>Commercial</b> <b>Internet</b> service providers (ISPs) emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990. By 1995, the Internet was fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic. The Internet rapidly expanded in Europe and Australia {{in the mid to}} late 1980s and to Asia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The beginning of dedicated [...] communication between the NSFNET and networks in Europe was established with a low-speed satellite relay between Princeton University and Stockholm, Sweden in December 1988. Although other network protocols such as UUCP had global reach well before this time, this {{marked the beginning of the}} Internet as an intercontinental network.|$|E

2500|$|The IWF compiles and {{maintains}} {{a list of}} URLs for individual webpages with child sexual abuse content called the child abuse image content list or CAIC list. A whole website will only be included on the list if that whole domain {{is dedicated to the}} distribution of child sexual abuse images. It says [...] "every URL on the list depicts indecent images of children, advertisements for or links to such content, on a publicly available website. The list typically contains 500 - 800 URLs at any one time and is updated twice a day to ensure all entries are still live". Offending UK URLs are not listed as they are taken down very quickly; URLs elsewhere are listed only until they are removed. The list is applied by the ISPs of 95% of <b>commercial</b> <b>Internet</b> customers in the UK. According to the IWF website, blocking applies only to potentially criminal URLs related to child sexual abuse content on publicly available websites; the distribution of images through other channels such as peer-to-peer is a matter for [...] "our police partners", and IWF has no plans to extend the type of content included on the list.|$|E
