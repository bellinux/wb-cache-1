30|$|The {{process of}} data {{transmission}} to the BS {{can be divided}} into the following two phases: intra-cluster communication and inter-cluster communication. In intra-cluster communication, each cluster member collects data from the sensors embedded in the firefighter’s uniform and forwards them to the CH. Each cluster member is just one hop away from the <b>CH</b> <b>as</b> in LEACH [12]. The CH aggregates the data received from member nodes, into one D a t a−M s g, which is forwarded to the BS. Each CH uses a multi-hop forwarding mechanism, constructing a path that involves other <b>CHs</b> <b>as</b> intermediate nodes to the BS. This multi-hop forwarding mechanism helps to further reduce the energy consumption by reducing transmissions over longer distances.|$|R
