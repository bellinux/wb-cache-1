Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Weaknesses associated with <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> systems suggest a lack of design consideration in the planning stage of a building. The primary question to be addressed in this study is do relationships between design considerations and building performance exist for <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> in multi-story, speculatively built office buildings? The objective {{of this study is to}} explore the qualitative relationships among design emphasis, design priority, and building performance for <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> for multi-story speculatively built office buildings. This study will establish qualitative relationships between owner expectations for <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> and design emphasis. If utilized by the Architect in the planning stage of a building, these relationships can be used to estimate design time, improve the interaction among other cabling professionals, and determine the effort required by the Architect to accomplish the owner's expectations for the performance of the <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> means in his building...|$|R

Firstly, the kinematic models of three types of CDPMs with 7 cables are set up. Then, in order to evaluate workspace quality, two new indices are proposed by using tensions along each cable, which are the All <b>Cable</b> Tension <b>Distribution</b> Index (ACTDI) and Global Tension Distribution Index (GTDI). Next, the three types of CDPMs with 7 cables are analysed with the two indices. At the end, according to different performance requirements, the configurations of <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> are discussed and selected...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Internet Protocol Television (IPTV)   is a service on the Internet where digital TV signal data is delivered to the participants using the Internet Protocol (IP). IPTV promises lower prices for operators,  lower prices for consumers and it is also distributed more efficiently than using the nowadays prevalent coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>distribution.</b> As it is assumed that broadband connection of households will grow at a brisk pace,  IPTV will play more and more important role in the {{incoming}} years in our lives. The number of viewers connected to a single source is nowadays limited by several factors,  and the challenge in the incoming years is to propose an architecture  that will  minimize  the negative effect  of   {{these factors}} to   achieve  the  highest  possible   scalability  with   sufficient  Quality  of Service (QoS)   feedback. ...|$|R
