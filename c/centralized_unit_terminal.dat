Of particular importance are highly expensive drugs used to treat various types of cancers in developing countries like Albania. Hence, pharmacoeconomics may {{play an important role in}} reducing the drug wastage and financial burden placed on patients, family and society in general; of course, without adversely impacting patient’s health outcomes. Our aim was to calculate cost-savings effect of a <b>centralized</b> <b>unit,</b> which allows residual amounts of unused drugs to be reused by patients whose treatments are elaborated in the same working day. We calculated in a comprehensive manner the number of saved vials (flasks) for seven drugs generated from residual amounts of the same working day and, converted them into cost-saving monetary value. We did not take into account prescribed drug dosages that fitted exactly with doses contained in a vial. Over a six month period, there were: a total of 6558 prescriptions for a total of 1180 patients, a total of 1524 saved vials and, a total cost-saving of 134, 348 (•). The saved value represents 6. 2 percent of the cytostatic drugs budget for 2005.

40|$|Abstract [...] In {{the context}} of the ongoing {{deregulation}} of the electricity industry, we revisit the commonly held assumption that, under the condition of perfect information, a decentralized unit commitment would lead to the same power quantities traded and the same optimal social welfare as a <b>centralized</b> <b>unit</b> commitment. Taking operating cost independent of the output quantity into account, we show in the first part that meeting decentralized performance objectives of the individual market participants can lead to a lower efficiency than minimizing total operating cost in a decentralized way. This result concerns short-term optimization, and does not consider long-term investment issues. In the second part, we use an abstract example to show that a generator owner’s optimum bid sequence for a centralized auction market can be above marginal cost even when there is no market power-related strategic bidding. We conclude that marginal production costs cannot be used as baseline for the assessment of market power in electricity markets as generators bid higher than MC because of intertemporal constraints and uncertainties about prices of consecutive hours.

40|$|The smart {{distribution}} system {{is one of}} the most important aspects of the smart grid and will result in systematic update on the distribution side. In smart distribution grid pilot cities of China, much investment on the infrastructure for the smart {{distribution system}} has been done. For example, in Xiamen, the IEC 61968 / 61970 based data base has been established and the smart <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> such as transformer <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> distribution <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> feeder <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> and load control units have been installed. This paper proposes an automatic voltage control (AVC) architecture based on these infrastructures, all of which have been employed in Xiamen. The objective of this architecture is to minimize the distribution losses by coordinating the on load-tap changer (OLTC) and the capacitor banks. In this paper, the data base, the data communication mechanism and the related <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> for this architecture are introduced firstly. Then, an optimal power flow (OPF) model for determining the tap position of the OLTC and switching capacitor banks is also formulated. The proposed architecture is verified in a 33 -buse system. Scenarios are created to verify the impact of DG on the performance of this architecture. The results show that using the proposed architecture, distribution losses can be reduced by selecting reasonable tap position, operated capacitor banks and DG techniques. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Generalized models were developed for the series and parallel units, with coefficients varying by size and manufacturer. Statistical modeling utilized SAS software (2002). Fan power and airflow data were collected at downstream static pressures over a range from 0. 1 to 0. 5 in. w. g. (25 to 125 Pa) for the parallel <b>terminal</b> <b>units.</b> Downstream static pressure was held constant at 0. 25 in. w. g. (62 Pa) for the series units. Upstream static pressures of all variable air volume (VAV) <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 0 in. w. g. (25 to 498 Pa). Data were collected at four different primary air damper positions.
