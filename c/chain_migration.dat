25|$|The Diaspora {{population}} of Ireland {{also got a}} fresh start on the islands of New Zealand during the later half of the 19th century. The ideology of striking it rich in the gold mines caused many Irish people to flock to the docks; risking {{their lives on the}} long voyage to potential freedom and more importantly self-sufficiency. Most famous places including both Gabriel's Gully and Otago are examples of mining sites which, with the funding of large companies, allowed for the creation of wages and the appearance of mining towns. Women found jobs as housemaids cleaning the shacks of the single men at work thereby providing a second income to the Irish family household. The subsequent money accumulated with regards to this would allow for <b>chain</b> <b>migration</b> {{for the rest of the}} family left behind.|$|E
500|$|Within {{a species}} not all populations may be migratory; {{this is known}} as [...] "partial {{migration}}". [...] Partial migration is very common in the southern continents; in Australia, 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerine species are partially migratory. In some species, the population at higher latitudes tends to be migratory and will often winter at lower latitude. [...] The migrating birds bypass the latitudes where other populations may be sedentary, where suitable wintering habitats may already be occupied. This is an example of leap-frog migration. [...] Many fully migratory species show leap-frog migration (birds that nest at higher latitudes spend the winter at lower latitudes), and many show the alternative, <b>chain</b> <b>migration,</b> where populations 'slide' more evenly north and south without reversing order.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} Great Migration of African Americans out of {{the rural}} South to {{industrial}} cities in the early 20th century, the Reverend Louis W. Parson and his wife migrated in 1927 from Mississippi to Albany, where he founded the First Church of God in Christ. In four trips to Mississippi, Parson encouraged friends and family to move to Albany and join the church, which many did during the 1930s and 1940s. The reverend felt that the mores of Albany's South End, where they originally settled, was not conducive to religious life. He started a community in the Pine Bush along Rapp Road, purchasing two [...] undeveloped properties in 1930 and 1933.

2500|$|The area's first European {{settlement}} was {{as an extension}} of the Osborne Park market area. Its initial growth in importance as an agricultural area in the 1920s came from three major factors: retired Chinese miners from the Eastern Goldfields, the post-World War I Soldier Settlement Scheme (many of whom had no experience in intensive farming), and an influx of Italians prior to Mussolini's effective banning of emigration in 1927, who mostly started life in Western Australia as miners and woodcutters. Dino Gava noted: [...] "The process of (Italian) <b>chain</b> <b>migration</b> was strong in Osborne Park and Wanneroo.

40|$|The paper views {{migration}} of skills from a perspective of new industrial policy. It introduces {{two types of}} search networks: open <b>migration</b> <b>chains</b> and diaspora networks. <b>Migration</b> <b>chains</b> are sequences of educational or job opportunities which allows a migrant to move to progressively complex educational and job tasks necessary {{to work in the}} global environment. Diaspora networks are networks of diaspora members to advance their collective goals, often (but not necessarily) for the benefits of home countries. Open <b>migration</b> <b>chains</b> are functional equivalent of value chains: they emphasize upgrading of individual human capital. 2 ̆ 018 Diaspora networks 2 ̆ 019 is about concerted action and clubs.

It is ambitiously optimistic because emerging migration ladders open an opportunity of a win-win situation; an evolving virtuous cycle of co-development of migrant human capital and home country institutions. It is humble, however, in recognizing intricacies of policy solutions to make it happen: creation of robust diaspora networks requires substantial amount of time, patience and institutional capabilities.

40|$|Studies on {{migration}} {{have used}} the notion of social network to describe population flows between countries and the incorporation of immigrants into the new receiving context. In this case, {{the concept of a}} network tries to identify patterns of interaction between displaced individuals in order to determine, among other aspects, their influence on the following: the decision to emigrate, geographical relocation, family regrouping, the formation of communities of compatriots, the acculturation process, psychological adaptation, and social integration. The two issues for which a wider body of literature has been produced regarding social networks among immigrant populations are <b>migration</b> <b>chains</b> and psychological adaptation: 1. <b>Migration</b> <b>chains</b> are displacement and relocation processes of networks that involve relatives, friends, and acquaintances.

50|$|Single, young, male laborers were {{initially}} {{the largest group}} using <b>chain</b> <b>migration</b> to the United States in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries. However, each immigrant group maintained a unique composition due to circumstances in home countries, goals of migration, and American immigration laws. For example, Irish migration after 1880 had a 53.6% female majority, the only migrant group with that distinction. Irish men and women faced economic crisis, overpopulation, and problematic inheritance laws for large families, thereby compelling many of Ireland’s daughters to leave with her sons. Italian <b>chain</b> <b>migration</b> was initially wholly male based on intent to return, but became a source of family reunification when wives eventually immigrated. Chinese <b>chain</b> <b>migration</b> was almost exclusively male until 1946, when the Chinese War Brides Act allowed Chinese wives of American citizens to immigrate without regards to Chinese immigration quotas. Before that time, <b>chain</b> <b>migration</b> was limited to “paper sons” and actual sons from China. The imbalanced sex ratio of Chinese immigrants was due to Chinese exclusion laws and the inability to bring current wives or to marry and return to the United States, inhibiting the corrective measure of <b>chain</b> <b>migration.</b> When immigrant groups react to economic pull factors in the labor markets, <b>chain</b> <b>migration</b> via family has been used informally to balance out the gender ratio in ethnic immigrant communities.|$|E

30|$|The {{porosity}} is {{an important}} feature of hydrogels for biomedical applications and depends on the synthesis conditions. Polymerization in bulk permits to obtain glassy, transparent materials which after swelling in water or other solvents remain soft and flexible. The mass transfer of low molecular weight substances in swollen gels is achieved mainly by diffusion through the spaces between macromolecular <b>chains.</b> <b>Migration</b> of large molecules is possible through reptations [10]. However, {{it is assumed that}} these gels do not have a porous structure and are “homogeneous”. When PHEMA polymerization is carried out {{in the presence of a}} solvent which is taken in the amounts below the critical concentration (up to 45  wt% for water), it results in the gels that keep their optical transparency. Moreover, the swelling propensity as well as the size of the pores will increase [11]. The main feature of the gels synthesized in the presence of the solvent is formation of the cross-links which are separated by large areas of flexible polymer chains. In terms of the soluble substance diffusion through obtained gels [11], they are generally classified as (1) “microporous” with a pore size in the range of 10 – 50  nm and (2) “macroporous”—with pores from 100 to 1000  nm or even bigger. Convection in these materials gradually becomes the dominant mechanism for the transport of substances. If the water content in the initial monomer mixture is higher than 45  wt%, there is a phase separation during polymerization. As a result, transparency is gradually lost with the formation of “white” gels, which are classified as heterogeneous hydrogels or sponges.|$|R

The history of Mexican migrant labor in America and return {{migration to}} Mexico produced a network that allowed for <b>chain</b> <b>migration</b> once more restrictive legislation was passed hardening the border between the two nations. <b>Chain</b> <b>migration</b> based on the knowledge gained from migrant labor experience and relationships with American residents or citizens again provided some ease of immigration. From 1942 to 1964, the American government sanctioned Bracero Program allowed hundred of thousands of Mexican migrant workers to “familiarize themselves with U.S. employment practices, become comfortable with U.S. job routines, master American ways of life, and learn English,” thereby creating social and human capital. After the Hart-Celler Act of 1965 disbanded the Bracero Program, the incentives and effects of <b>chain</b> <b>migration</b> perpetuated undocumented im{{migration to the}} United States.

40|$|Characterization of Epoxy (diglycidyl ether of Bis-phenol A cured with Tri {{ethylene}} Tetra amine) without fillers was done. The Water {{absorption test}} at 95 °C shows that at saturation the epoxy contains a water concentration of 2. 089 %. The diffusion coefficient of absorption is calculated as 0. 021 cm 2 /s. The diffusion coefficient of desorption is calculated as 0. 0987 cm 2 /s. The diffusion is almost 5 {{times faster than}} absorption. Also the material looses weight as the hydrothermal aging progresses. The water in the sample leads to chain scission {{which leads to the}} weight loss. The weight loss is more incase of absorption followed by desorption than only absorption. The chain scission leads to decrease in the mechanical strength by around 45 %. The diffusion of water from the samples doesn t affect the mechanical strength of the materials. The glass transition temperature reduces by 20 °C with water inside the sample. The diffusion of water out of the sample only increases by around 10 °C. The Dielectric response of the material shows that after the water absorption the sample shows high losses at lower frequencies. Also the increase in the real part of the permittivity increases with low frequency. The rapid increase in the real art of the permittivity of the material at lower frequencies can be attributed to a polarization at the electrode due both to accumulation of the charge carriers and to <b>chain</b> <b>migrations.</b> The breakdown test of the samples shows that with water in the sample the breakdown strength of the material decreases by 10 KV, but the material regains its dielectric strength when the water is diffused out.

Consequently, many of the peoples whom this propaganda targeted were already living agricultural lives in Northern and Eastern Europe. Additionally, once the <b>chain</b> of <b>migration</b> had begun from a farm town in Europe, the pamphlets along with letters and remittances sent from America made migration an accessible opportunity for more and more of the people of that community.

Although legal labour migration from China has become more effective, efficient and streamlined, the costs of finding and securing work overseas have been on the rise. In his exploration of the reasons why, Xiang points to intermediaries—commercial labour recruiters— as the key. He argues that intermediaries’ dominant position in cultivating, facilitating and controlling legal migration allow them to charge high fees to potential migrants. This results in the “intermediary trap”, where both the state and the migrants depend on intermediaries to manage and facilitate labour migration overseas.
