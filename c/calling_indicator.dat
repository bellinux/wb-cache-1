50|$|Not all manual {{telephone}} exchanges were non-dialable points. Some were equipped with apparatus which displayed the called number to an operator when an outside call arrived from an automated dial exchange; this panel <b>call</b> <b>indicator</b> or coded-call indicator working {{would have made}} them dialable points from other exchanges, {{despite the absence of}} local dial.|$|R
25|$|Some {{signalling}} communicated dialed digits. An early form <b>called</b> Panel <b>Call</b> <b>Indicator</b> Pulsing used quaternary pulses {{to set up}} calls {{between a}} panel switch and a manual switchboard. Probably {{the most common form}} of communicating dialed digits between electromechanical switches was sending dial pulses, equivalent to a rotary dial's pulsing, but sent over trunk circuits between switches.|$|R

2500|$|Panel was {{installed}} in cities where many stations still used manual (non-dial) service.

50|$|If {{the first}} three letters were {{capitalized}} but not bolded, e.g., HAYes 1295, the caller would dial {{the first three}} letters only, and when connected to Hayes ask the operator for the local number.

When considering zero-day, multi-step or more common attacks, the threats are identified through symptoms, <b>called</b> <b>Indicators</b> of Compromise [17 – 19] (IoC). IoC are ‘artifacts observed on a network or in an operating system that with high confidence indicates a computer intrusion’. They are best identified as anomalies with regard to the normal behaviour of a system.|$|R

Then, MSO (Section 5), quantifying concepts (Section 6) and finally graph-based representations of quality <b>indicators</b> <b>called</b> quality <b>indicator</b> graphs (Section 7) are defined. Quality indicator graphs are combinations of object graphs and quantifying concepts.|$|R

5000|$|If {{a manual}} {{exchange}} {{did not have}} <b>call</b> <b>indicator</b> equipment but did have a published numeric exchange prefix, incoming calls from automatic exchanges would be prompted manually with [...] "Number, please?" [...] {{after the first few}} digits (or, in fixed-length store-and-forward systems like the UK director exchanges, the entire number) had already been dialed. In adjacent communities, a dial subscriber would often need to call the neighboring community. The directory would often instruct him to dial a single digit, such as seven, which would connect to the incoming manual operator for the neighboring community.|$|R

40|$|Using the {{framework}} of random walks in random scenery, Cohen and Samorodnitsky (2006) introduced a family of symmetric α-stable motions called local time fractional stable motions. When α= 2, these processes are precisely fractional Brownian motions with 1 / 2 <H< 1. Motivated by random walks in alternating scenery, we find a "complementary" family of symmetric α-stable motions which we <b>call</b> <b>indicator</b> fractional stable motions. These processes are complementary to local time fractional stable motions in that when α= 2, one gets fractional Brownian motions with 0 <H< 1 / 2.

The flow regime is defined {{by a set of}} parameters, <b>called</b> <b>Indicators</b> of Hydrologic Alteration. These parameters are predicted at the catchment scale by a hydrologic model, called Soil and Water As-sessment Tool. Then the Maximum Entropy Ordered Weighted Averaging method is employed to aggregate non-commensurable biologically relevant flow regimes to develop hydro-ecological-index at the catchment scale. The resulting index reflects the variability of the need of the riverine ecosystem at catchment scale and thus different catchments can be evaluated and compared...|$|R

25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few manual switchboards, Panel <b>Call</b> <b>Indicator</b> (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating manual office. The lamps illuminated digits on a display panel corresponding to the number dialed. The manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next incoming call. In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call Annunciator signaling system was used to avoid installing lamp panels at every operator station. The Call Annunciator used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{is argued}} that the {{analysis}} of the learner’s generated log files during interactions with a learning environment is necessary to produce interpretative views of their activities. The analysis of these log files, or traces, provides "knowledge" about the activity we <b>call</b> <b>indicators.</b> Our work is related to this research field. We are particularly interested in automatically identifying learners’ learning styles from learning indicators. This concept, used in several Educational Hypermedia Systems (EHS) as a criterion for adaptation and tracking, belongs to a set of behaviors and strategies in how to manage and organize information. In this paper, we validate our approach of auto-detection of student's learning styles based on their navigation behavior using machine-learning classifiers...|$|R
