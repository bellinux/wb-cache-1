40|$|The {{centralization}} of purchases has been increasingly a strategic trend, {{particularly in the}} health sector. In Portugal, the SPMS, Serviços Partilhados do Ministério da Saúde, E. P. E., was established in 2010 as a <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>entity</b> for the health sector. Centralized purchasing can bring advantages, such as increasing {{the efficiency of the}} purchasing process, but also disadvantages, such as the possibility of oligopoly by suppliers, generated by imperfect competition, and a diminished response to the most decentralized units. This theme {{was the subject of a}} reflection meeting, which aimed to promote a debate on the national framework aspects of this process, challenges of implementation for hospital medicines and suggestions for improvement of this process. The main ideas generated for a successful centralized purchasing indicate that the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>entity</b> should be dynamic and facilitator, should ensuring equity, safety, accessibility and quality of drugs. There should be better planning and rigorous procurement of drugs, and an integrated information system that allows sharing and networking among the central purchasing and the various health institutions, fostering a proximity policy, should be created. Professionals should be trained in the necessary technical procedures for the completion of the acquisition of drugs, and hospital pharmacists should be included as consultants in the development of specific procedures of centralized procurement, according to the hospital’s needs. Finally, this entire process must be followed by constant monitoring through an annual assessment of the economic and financial feasibility. The benefits of the activity performed annually should adequately quantify the quality and efficiency gains that demonstrate the financial impact achieved in scope of the reduction of expense in the National Health Service...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the suppliers’ view of their relation to Stora Enso. The study focuses on the relation between the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit of Stora Enso and the suppliers but also gives indications of how the overall interface between Stora Enso and the suppliers works. The purpose is explored through a number of research objectives, which are presented below. Areas essential for the functioning of the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit: - The overall organisation of Stora Enso’s purchasing activities, - Stora Enso’s cross-functional purchasing teams, - The internal coordination and communication, - The relational bonds between Stora Enso and the suppliers Important goals and visions for the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit: - Minimising the Total Business Cost, - Being an attractive partner to the suppliers Currently discussed issues within the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> organisation: - The potential for closer cooperation between Stora Enso and the suppliers, - The professionalism of Stora Enso’s purchasers Stora Enso is well organised for purchasing but the centrally coordinated cross-functional teams are not working as well as they could. The internal coordination has improved lately but the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit’s mission to optimise for Stora Enso as a whole often creates tension within the organisation, as a result of the mills being profit centres. The internal communication is not efficient, and the suppliers are strengthening their bonds with the mills by taking over the responsibility for certain information flows. The <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit and the cross-functional teams have the responsibility but not the authority to carry out their task of identifying and reducing the Total Business Cost. Stora Enso is an attractive customer for their suppliers, mainly because of the big volumes they represent. The current negotiation strategies are not advantageous for the introduction of collaborative supplier relations but other factors in the relation between the suppliers and Stora Enso speak strongly in favour for such a strategic change. When it comes to professionalism and business moral the suppliers give the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit a very positive evaluation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the reserve price on participation and the degree of competition in competitive tenderingfor public contracts. Our approach aims at reconciling the most recent developments in auction theory with the more practicalissues arising in centralized public procurement. In lowest price competitive tendering, we argue that, by lowering the reserve price, a (national) <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> body may reduce the purchasing cost at the expense of participation. Instead, if the contract is awarded by means of a scoring auction, the objectives of participation and cost reduction do not necessarily conflict with each other. reserve price; public contracts; <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> body; scoring auctions...|$|R
