50|$|Cable {{television}} {{represented a}} possible alternative to deployment of UHF converters as broadcasts could be frequency-shifted to VHF channels at the <b>cable</b> <b>head-end</b> {{instead of the}} final viewing location. However, most cable systems could not accommodate the full 54-890 MHz VHF/UHF frequency range and the twelve channels of VHF space were quickly exhausted on most systems. Adding any additional channels therefore {{needed to be done}} by inserting the extra signals into cable systems on nonstandard frequencies, typically either below VHF channel 7 (midband) or directly above VHF channel 13 (superband).|$|E
50|$|Downloading and {{streaming}} {{video on demand}} systems provide the user {{with all of the}} features of Portable media players and DVD players. Some VOD systems that store and stream programs from hard disk drives use a memory buffer to allow the user to fast forward and rewind digital videos. It is possible to put video servers on local area networks, in which case they can provide very rapid response to users. Streaming video servers can also serve a wider community via a WAN, in which case the responsiveness may be reduced. Download VOD services are practical to homes equipped with cable modems or DSL connections. Servers for traditional cable and telco VOD services are usually placed at the <b>cable</b> <b>head-end</b> serving a particular market as well as cable hubs in larger markets. In the telco world, they are placed in either the central office, or a newly created location called a Video Head-End Office (VHO).|$|E

These services will be provided initially, primarily over hybrid fiber-cable systems, either by telephone companies or cable companies. The old cable plant is being upgraded and used in totally new ways. The topology and physical characteristics of the upstream channel present new challenges for efficient channel access. We present a media access protocol that efficiently transfers data on this channel. A primary goal in the design was to keep the portion of the protocol resident in the station as simple as possible. Thus we use centralized control located in the <b>cable</b> <b>head-end</b> and minimize intelligence in the station. We refer to this protocol as Centralized Priority Reservation or CPR.

As the plant is upgraded there is an opportunity to use it for the transport of high-speed digital signals.

40|$|An {{important}} {{development in}} the television environment, and one that has strong resonance for iTV applications is the introduction of Personal Video Recorders (PVRs). Many of today’s researchers forecast that {{a significant portion of}} future television viewing will be from PVRs rather than from realtime broadcast sources. Some current PVRs, and most future units, also store iTV elements of a program {{so that they can be}} selectively accessed upon later for playback. While today’s PVRs are standalone devices, those of the future may be part of a PC, a home server, set-top box, or even a remote storage system in which the actual physical storage is on a server at some service provider’s location supporting the required personal access. In this paper, we propose a dynamic channel allocation on a Fiber Cable (FC) network to realize a Remote PVR (RPVR) at the Multiple System Operator (MSO) end. The VCR controls exercised by the user are carried across the cable network to the <b>cable</b> <b>head-end.</b> The request is processed at the head-end and results are communicated back to the user device. Key features of the proposed RPVR approach are allocation of PVR channels for userspecific PVR operations, initiation and closing of PVR sessions, maintaining data related to PVR sessions in user-specific storage at the head-end, and supporting Digital Rights Management (DRM) based VCR functionality. In the proposed system, we use the “assign and reassign ” spectrum of FC architecture, and have proposed a “split and merge ” signal handling mechanisms to support the RPVR application. The proposed approach uses the available spectrum on FC to realize RPVR functionality...|$|E
50|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years, cable and {{satellite}} television have come to provide most homes with dozens or even hundreds of television services. Cable television was originally created to allow residents of weak-signal areas to benefit from a large, well-located common antenna. In the 1970s, Premium Services such as HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel used satellites to deliver movies to <b>cable</b> <b>head-ends,</b> who would re-distribute it to customers for an added charge. During the same period, it has seen the emergence of numerous specialty cable networks, such as CBN (now ABC Family), CNN, ESPN (sports), Lifetime (women's programming), The Learning Channel, MTV, Nickelodeon (children's shows), VH-1, The Weather Channel, and others. The advent of digital compression technology in the 1990s, along with the rapidly growing popularity of direct-to-home satellite television allowed for content providers to pack more channels into a single satellite slot, {{and a number of}} new networks, especially those fulfilling certain niches, aimed at digital cable and satellite systems were established.|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{broadband}} architectures and ISP service profiles to {{show that}} open access is technically feasible and economically viable, even if implementation is not always trivial. The decisive factor is planning. If broadband networks are built with interconnection in mind, {{it will be easier}} to implement open access. Hence, I argue, the FCC should encourage the deployment of open-access-ready networks. Incentives that the FCC can offer at this stage to cable operators to design open access into their networks will have two benefits [...] -they will lower the costs of implementing open access regulations should the FCC decide to act in the future. More significantly, if broadband network operators are encouraged to build open-access-ready networks, they will be better positioned to offer open access on their own, thereby eliminating the need for regulation. Broadband Access Architectures The problem of open access for broadband access networks depends in large part on where a subscriber's traffic first contends with other subscribers' traffic for network resources. There are three locations where contention can first occur: 1. at a carrier aggregation point remote from the subscriber's location (a telephone company central office or a <b>cable</b> company <b>head-end,)</b> 2. on the transmission medium, immediately upon leaving the subscriber's premises, or 3. at some point between the subscriber's location and the carrier's point of presence. The point of first contention is critical to open access because contention means that the network operator must allocate network resources. Which users get what network resources, and when? The open access controversy revolves around this question: whose service provider is making the allocation of resources? Are both users the customers of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{heterogeneous}} parallel computing system that combines a traditional computer cluster with a broadband network of embedded set-top box (STB) devices. As multiple service operators (MSO) manage millions {{of these devices}} across wide geographic areas, the computational power of such a massively-distributed embedded system could be harnessed to realize a centrally-managed, energy-efficient parallel processing platform that supports a variety of application domains which are of interest to MSOs, consumers, and the high-performance computing research community. We investigate the feasibility of this idea by building a prototype system that includes a complete <b>head-end</b> <b>cable</b> system with a DOCSIS- 2. 0 network combined with an interoperable implementation of a subset of Open MPI running on the STB embedded operating system. We evaluate the performance and scalability of our system compared to a traditional cluster by solving approximately various instances of the Multiple Sequence Alignment bioinformatics problem, while the STBs continue simultaneously to operate their primary functions: decode MPEG streams for television display and run an interactive user interface. Based on our experimental results and given the technology trends in embedded computing we argue that our approach to leverage a broadband network of embedded devices in a heterogeneous distributed system offers the benefits of both parallel computing clusters and distributed Internet computing...|$|R
