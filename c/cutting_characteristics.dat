The punch/die clearance was varied to be 2 ∼ 20 % of the worksheet thickness. Also, the feed velocity of the punch was adjusted ranging from 0. 05 ∼ 1. 0 mm·s- 1. From experimental results, a crack initiated {{in the vicinity of}} a cutting tool corner was observed to be largely propagated into the bulk of the worksheet. This deviated propagation seemed to be affected by an in-plane/lateral unbalanced stress state in the worksheet. The variation of the feed velocity had almost no effect on the pattern of crack initiation and its propagation. In addition, the shearing problem was numerically studied by using a two dimensional FEM simulation to discuss about the crack propagation and the dependency of the <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristics</b> on the punch/die clearance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a research {{progress on the}} laser <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites material for the aerospace structure panel. The CFRP is a high performance material and becomes {{one of the most}} important materials in the aerospace industry. The current machining techniques used by the aerospace composites manufacturing for cutting and trimming process have created some quality issues such as fiber pulled out and delamination. The use of laser cutting technology has shows promising advantages. However, the Laser cutting represents the interaction between laser beam and the CFRP composites, that produce heat affected zone (HAZ), kerf width and taper angle. Thermal damage is a direct consequence of the large difference in thermal properties of the carbon fiber and the polymer matrix. Therefore, the effect of laser cutting parameters such as pulse energy, pulse repetition rate, cutting speed and pulse duration need to be taken into consideration. A 300 W Pulsed Nd:YAG laser machine was used in the experiment and successfully cut or trim the 1. 5 mm thickness of the CFRP component. The results also showed that the pulse energy and pulse repetition rate gave the most significant effect on the <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristic</b> in particular of kerf width, HAZ and taper angle...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{effects of}} {{external}} hydrostatic {{pressure on the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristics</b> are investigated. Orthogonal cutting experiments are conducted in a high pressure chamber using four kinds of materials; {{two of them are}} brittle materials and the others are ductile materials. Chip formation processes of soda glass specimen are studied by in-situ observation. It is confirmed that chip formation style changes from the crack type to the segmented chip type, then to the continuous chip type with the increase of hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore, cutting forces under various hydrostatic pressures are measured, and effects of hydrostatic pressure on the cutting forces are studied. It is found that hydrostatic pressure increases the cutting force in the brittle mode cutting of glasses, but does not affect the cutting force in ductile mode cutting. In case of ductile materials, hydrostatic pressure increases the cutting force of polycarbonate too, but does not affect the cutting force of pure aluminum. Based on those experimental results, mechanism of hydrostatic pressure effects on <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristics</b> is discussed...|$|E

For ultra-precision machining of brittle glass materials, critical undeformed chip thickness (CUCT) commonly plays {{a pivotal role in}} determining the transition point from ductile cutting to brittle cutting.

CUCT was determined according to the mentioned <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The results revealed that 320 nm was found as the CUCT in BK 7 cutting and 50 nm was determined as the size effect of undeformed chip thickness. A high-quality machined surface could be obtained with the undeformed chip thickness between 50 and 320 nm at ductile cutting stage. Moreover, no CUCT was identified in fused silica cutting with the current cutting conditions, and brittle-fracture mechanism was confirmed as the predominant chip-separation mode throughout the nanometric cutting operation...|$|E

40|$|Backhousia citriodora is {{a commercially}} {{valuable}} Australian woody species {{that has a}} reputation for being recalcitrant in forming adventitious roots from cuttings. A study was carried out to determine whether maturation and plant genotype influenced rooting. It also tried to establish whether genotypic differences in rooting ability were related to characteristics of the cutting material. The rooting of cuttings in B. citriodora declines after maturation and is strongly influenced by genotype. The <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristics</b> of actively growing axillary buds, wide stems and mature leaves are associated with rooting and survival but not related to genotype. Furthermore, the 8 - 24 weeks required by B. citriodora to form roots from cuttings makes it difficult to distinguish between the characteristics that increase rooting and those characteristics that enhance survival. A subsequent disbudding experiment demonstrated that axillary buds per se have an inhibitory effect on rooting. This suggests that the presence of actively growing axillary buds are an indication of overall growth and condition of the stock plant unrelated to the formation of adventitious rooting. The effects of other <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristics</b> on rooting are also discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In willow cultivation, {{successful}} {{establishment is}} crucial {{for the development of}} a willow crop. The overall objective of this study was to assess the effects of pre-emergence <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristics</b> on the performance of willow during early establishment. In the experiments described in this thesis, cuttings of different size, position on the original rod, quality (i. e. planting damages and storage effects), orientation (i. e. vertical or horizontal planting), and clone were planted in the field or in boxes in an outdoor enclosure. Effects of weed competition and nitrogen fertilization were tested in a bucket experiment, and long-term effects of <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristics</b> on development and growth were evaluated in a field experiment harvested twice between 2008 and 2015. <b>Cutting</b> <b>characteristics</b> had a significant influence on the early establishment of willow. Cutting size had the most apparent influence, with performance generally increasing with increased size. There was a tendency for this effect to level off beyond a certain size. Cuttings sprouted earlier if derived from the apex, and the majority of the shoots on horizontally planted cuttings originated from the apical part. Cutting damage caused by storage or machine planting on compacted soil resulted in decreased performance and increased variation. Cuttings planted on compacted soil had higher probability of being damaged or landing on the soil surface instead of in the soil. Vertically planted cuttings were generally preferable to horizontally planted cuttings, especially when considering the amount of planting material needed. If planted horizontally, the depth should not exceed 5 cm. Weed competition resulted in a considerable decrease in performance if weeds sprouted before the willow had reached sufficient size. Nitrogen fertilization was likely to be of more use to the weeds than to the willow. In the long-term experiment, stool weight increased with cutting weight and early plant size at both harvests, indicating that the initial size hierarchy was maintained during the entire experiment. The performance responses in the experiments varied depending on clone...|$|E

An analytical estimate is given for a certain area below the stability limit where stable stationary cutting and a chaotic attractor coexist.

40|$|Abstract—Drill <b>cuttings</b> {{with various}} <b>characteristics</b> and sizes are {{produced}} in any offshore {{oil and gas}} exploration and production (EP) drilling of the seabed. Drill cuttings may be transported to shore for land disposal or they may be disposed off into the sea after proper treatment on site. Offshore disposal of treated drilling muds and rock cuttings is operationally the simplest option available and economically the least expensive. Appropriate environmental measures, however, must be taken to ensure that the marine environment is not unduly polluted by the discharged drill cuttings. Further, the disposed drill cuttings will ultimately deposit onto the seabed to form piles around the toe of the platform that might hinder optimal pipe laying and maintenance. To enable proper assessment of the impacts of drill cuttings on the seabed and the marine environment, model simulations are performed to analyze the transport, dispersion and deposition of drilling muds and rock cuttings. For this purpose, a simulation model known as TUNA-PT has been developed to model the transport and deposition of drill cuttings subject to various climatic conditions, coastal environments and <b>cuttings</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This paper presents simulation results of cuttings pile formation patterns on the seabed and the distribution of suspended sediments in the top water column for an offshore EP platform in the South China Sea.

40|$|Machinability is an {{important}} characteristic of dental ceramics for restorative dentistry because machining is not only commonly employed in dental CAD/CAM systems but also essential in dental adjustments for occlusal fitting and restorative quality. This paper reports on an in vitro study on machinability of dental ceramics by quantifying <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristics</b> of feldspar and leucite glass ceramics in simulated dental adjusting using a high-speed electric handpiece and diamond burs. Cutting forces, force ratio, energy, surface integrity and bur topography were evaluated as functions of clinically relevant cutting conditions. The results indicate that tangential and normal forces and specific cutting energy for both materials exhibited significant dependences (p p> 0. 01) but no correlations with the cutting conditions applied (p> 0. 05). At the slower feed rates or smaller depths of cut the cutting behaviors for the two materials were very similar in terms of cutting forces and specific cutting energy. At the deeper depths of cut or faster feed rates, normal forces for leucite glass ceramic {{were significantly higher than}} those for feldspar glass ceramic (p< 0. 01). However, leucite glass ceramic produced better cutting surfaces with less fracture areas compared with feldspar ceramic due to its lower index of brittleness and higher force threshold for brittle–ductile transition.

In the course of cutting, continuous signals, which are related to the quality achieved of the laser cut, are measured. After laser <b>cutting</b> <b>characteristic</b> AE bursts in the specimen material, which are results of a thermal influence, can be detected. A relation between the AE bursts and dross formation at the lower edge of the cut is shown. The presence of dross is an important indicator of poor quality of laser cutting. The investigation on laser cutting was conducted on an unalloyed steel DC 04 sheet and on austenitic stainless steel X 5 CrNi 18 - 10 sheet of 1, 5 mm in thickness.
