40|$|Applying a {{recently}} proposed measuring principle [1], {{the behavior of}} the wide-band indoor radio channel at 60 GHz was studied, using a measurement set-up consisting of a <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> signal <b>generator</b> and a spectrum analyzer was used. A new method described in [2], [3] was used {{for the first time to}} extract the rms delay spread from non-coherent wide-band (WB) measurements. Three channel parameters were extracted from the measured power spectrum samples; the path loss exponent, Ricean Kfactor and rms delay spread. Two types of measurements were performed, <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> (CW) and WB. The investigated environments were a common room and a workshop.

An array of calibration devices was deployed, including dihedral and trihedral corner reflectors, polarimetric active radar calibrators, passive receivers, and CW (<b>continuous</b> <b>wave)</b> tone <b>generators.</b> The aim of the campaign was to calibrate both amplitude and phase of the resulting SAR images, over long and short time scales. The results of {{the analysis of the}} calibration data collected in {{the spring of}} 1988 are presented. Trihedral corner reflector signatures and certain image background measures are used to externally calibrate relative amplitude and phase between polarizations at a given frequency, and to calibrate across frequencies.

As the <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> plug rotates, the flex spline teeth which are meshed {{with those of}} the {{circular}} spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with <b>wave</b> <b>generator,</b> so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point {{at the same rate as}} the <b>wave</b> <b>generator's</b> shaft. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the <b>wave</b> <b>generator,</b> the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> is {{a critical}} component of a pulse tube refrigerator. Conventionally either a solenoid operated electromagnetic valve or a rotary valve driven by a hermetically sealed motor is used for this. In this article, we present a novel pressure <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> design based on cam operated valves for use with pulse tube refrigerators. This, when coupled with an inverter drive (variable frequency drive), forms a versatile pressure <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> in the range between 1 and 10 Hz. In a single stage double inlet pulse tube using this type of pressure <b>wave</b> <b>generator,</b> refrigeration power of about 6 W at 77 K and a no load temperature of about 42 K were obtained. The above results are comparable to those obtained with pulse tube systems based on other two types of pressure <b>wave</b> <b>generators.</b> While the rotary valve based pressure <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> is prone to developing leaks at the rotating seal, the solenoid valve based system cannot be operated continuously due to coil failure. The cam operated valve based pressure <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> overcomes the above shortfalls of rotary valve and solenoid valve type pressure generators and is well suited for continuous operation of the refrigerator...|$|R

50|$|The {{strain wave}} gearing theory {{is based on}} elastic {{dynamics}} and utilizes the flexibility of metal. The mechanism has three basic components: a <b>wave</b> <b>generator,</b> a flexspline, and a circular spline. More complex versions have a fourth component normally used to shorten the overall length or to increase the gear reduction within a smaller diameter, but still follow the same basic principles.The <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> {{is made up of}} two separate parts: an elliptical disk called a <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> plug and an outer ball bearing. The gear plug is inserted into the bearing, giving the bearing an elliptical shape as well.The flexspline is like a shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is thick and rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, but in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around the outside of the open end of the flexspline. The flexspline fits tightly over the <b>wave</b> <b>generator,</b> so that when the <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> plug is rotated, the flexspline deforms to the shape of a rotating ellipse but does not rotate with the wave generator.The circular spline is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The flexspline and <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> are placed inside the circular spline, meshing the teeth of the flexspline and the circular spline. Because the flexspline has an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with the teeth of the circular spline in two regions {{on opposite sides of the}} flexspline, along the major axis of the ellipse.Assume that the <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> is the input rotation. As the <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> plug rotates, the flexspline teeth which are meshed with those of the circular spline change. The major axis of the flexspline actually rotates with <b>wave</b> <b>generator,</b> so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point at the same rate as the <b>wave</b> <b>generator.</b> The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (for example two fewer) on the flexspline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the <b>wave</b> <b>generator,</b> the flexspline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth, for example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> results in a much slower rotation of the flexspline in the opposite direction.For a strain wave gearing mechanism, the gearing reduction ratio can be calculated from the number of teeth on each gear: For example, if there are 202 teeth on the circular spline and 200 on the flexspline, the reduction ratio is (200 − 202)/200 = −0.01Thus the flexspline spins at 1/100 the speed of the <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> plug and in the opposite direction. This allows different reduction ratios to be set without changing the mechanism's shape, increasing its weight, or adding stages. The range of possible gear ratios is limited by tooth size limits for a given configuration.|$|R

The <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> of hydraulic swelling type in a model basin is consisted of asubmerged canvas bag and a pump for water supply and drainage.
