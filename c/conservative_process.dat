Due to the conservation of energy, P can never be greater than C, and so the efficiency r is never greater than 100% (and in fact must be even less at finite temperatures).|$|E

40|$|International audienceGlass is {{densified}} under a sharp diamond indenter. The densification is not {{a volume}} <b>conservative</b> <b>process,</b> and does {{not contribute to the}} volume strain around the indentation. This means that densification affects residual stresses around the indentation impression. In order to estimate the densification volume, three-dimensional images of Vickers indentations on soda-lime silicate glasses were obtained before and after annealing. Only the densified volume can be recovered by annealing. After annealing at around glass transition temperature, large volume recovery (55 - 80 %) of Vickers indentation was observed for soda-lime silicate glass. The volume recovery is much larger than the recoveries of indentation diagonal and depth. It is found that the densification of glass under the sharp indenter cannot be ignored for evaluating crack initiation and brittleness of glass. In addition, the residual stresses around the indentation impression were also estimated from the plastically deformed volume and the size of plastic zone around the indentation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNickel-based super alloys such as Inconel 718 {{are widely}} {{employed}} in extremely hostile applications owing to their superior thermo-mechanical properties. On the contrary, these latter lead the industries to adopt <b>conservative</b> <b>process</b> parameters (e. g. low cutting speed) resulting in lower production rates.

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effects of extreme cutting parameters on the surface and subsurface alterations such as grain size and hardness changes by developing a finite element (FE) numerical model. The Zener-Hollomon and Hall-Petch equation were implemented to predict the grain size and micro hardness variations due to the cutting process. In addition, the depth of the affected layer due to machining was predicted using the critical strain equation. The obtained results proved the accuracy and reliability of the proposed FE model showing a good agreement between the simulated and the experimental results...|$|E
