5|$|Although a new {{station at}} 10th Avenue and 41st Street {{was part of}} the {{original}} plan, the intermediate station was eliminated in October 2007 due to cost overruns, leaving the terminal station at Eleventh Avenue and 34th Street as the only new station on the extension. The MTA indicated that the 10th Avenue station could be included in the project if funding were found. The station {{was not included in the}} original (2007) <b>contract</b> <b>award,</b> but was listed as a $450 million option. In late December 2007, reports indicated that the postponed station might be partially built if the City of New York and the MTA agreed on the additional financing for the station shell. In February 2009, the MTA announced that it would build the station if the agency received sufficient funds from the federal economic stimulus package. In June 2010, the city announced it was seeking funding to assess the feasibility of constructing the station at a later date using a two-platform, two-entrance model without an underground connecting passage.|$|E

25|$|On 18 July 2007, {{five days}} after the {{wreckage}} of a Nuri (Sikorsky Sea King S-61A4) helicopter was found near Genting Sempah, Pahang, Defence Minister Najib Razak announced that the Malaysian government will call soon for an international tender for new helicopters to replace the ageing fleet. In September 2008, Malaysia announced the selection of the Eurocopter EC725 for an initial order of 12 helicopters. However, the <b>contract</b> <b>award</b> has been indefinitely delayed due to budgetary constraints. Eurocopter signed a co-operation contract with the Malaysian Ministry of Defence at the 49th Paris air show in June 2011, related to the supply of the 12 EC 725 helicopters to Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) for search and rescue (SAR) operations. These new aircraft will replace the existing fleet of Sikorsky S-61 Sea King rotorcraft. Deliveries will begin in 2012 and are expected to conclude in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The M1070F {{replaced}} the Scammell Commander as the British army tank transporter in 2001. Before {{the development of}} the M1070A1 for the U.S. Army, the more powerful M1070E model was developed as a possible Technology Insertion Programme (TIP) for the M1070A0 fleet. The M1070E1 was offered to meet the British Army's requirement for a tank transporter but was not selected. The vehicle selected by the British Army is the 1070F model, a much-revised M1070E1. The UK fleet, which when delivered was made up of 92 tractor trucks, 89 King GTS 110/7 semi-trailers, and three Tru-Hitch recovery systems, were delivered as part of a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) award to FASTTRAX in 2001 that included staff to operate the vehicles as Sponsored Reserves. The <b>contract</b> <b>award</b> included a 28-system option that was not exercised.

The Army {{received}} its first seven JLTVs for test {{at the end of}} September 2016 according to Colonel Shane Fullmer, JLTV project manager stated at an AUSA 2016 media briefing. He said test vehicles would be sent to Yuma, Arizona, for automotive and mobility testing; to Ft Huachuca, Arizona, for cyber, electronic warfare, and C4 testing; Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, for reliability and automotive testing; and to Alaska for automotive and environmental testing. Some JLTV testing was deferred during the EMD phase, as the government did not want to pay for testing with three suppliers, and it is now set for testing with a fleet of 100 JLTVs. By April 2017 30 JLTVs had been delivered, testing expected to continue through the first quarter of FY19. Also at an AUSA 2016 media briefing, Scott Davis, program executive officer for Combat Support & Combat Service Support, stated that Overall the JLTV programme expects to cut about five years off of the total program and save about US$5.9 billion, as Oshkosh's final competitive bid was low enough so the army decided to 'buy to budget' and get more platforms each year, which shrunk the total length of the contract and increased cost avoidances accrued each year. At AUSA 2016, Oshkosh displayed a JLTV General Purpose variant equipped with an EOS R-400S-MK2 remote weapon system integrated with Orbital ATK's M230 LF 30mm lightweight automatic chain gun.|$|E

[...] Chicago Park District Superintendent Tim Mitchell said the Park District also wanted to renegotiate the contract. In a February 9, 2005 letter to O'Malley and Horan, Georges warned that the concession agreement [...] "does not authorize your occupation of the Park Grill facilities" [...] because the city owns the land, and City Hall should have been party to the original agreement when it was not. On February 11, 2005, Daley asked state lawmakers to impose tougher penalties for defrauding tax payers, and was questioned by reporters about why the Park Grill had not paid any property taxes and gets free gas, water and garbage pick-up. Erma Tranter, president of the Friends of the Parks watchdog group, speaking at a Park District Board of Commissioners meeting, questioned why the Park Grill contract had yet to be renegotiated 11 months after Mayor Daley vowed to do so.
