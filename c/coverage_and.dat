30|$|In {{the public}} {{femtocell}} network, {{due to the}} lack of precise planning, there will be inevitably some <b>coverage</b> holes <b>and</b> multi-femtocell overlap area, resulting in some UEs' low received signal power or heavy interference. We plan to solve this problem through coordinated multipoint transmission technique of multiple femtocells, which in general is to make the high-gain main lobes of the femtocells toward the <b>coverage</b> holes <b>and</b> low-gain side lobes toward the overlap areas. Through collaboration of femtocells the <b>coverage</b> holes <b>and</b> interference between each other can be reduced and thus improving the network performance.|$|R
