5|$|The National Museum of African Art is the Smithsonian Institution's African art museum, {{located on}} the National Mall of the United States capital. Its {{collections}} include 9,000 works of traditional and <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> art from both Sub-Saharan and Arab North Africa, 300,000 photographs, and 50,000 library volumes. It was the first institution dedicated to African art in the United States, and remains the largest collection. The Washington Post called the museum a mainstay in the international art world and the main venue for <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> art in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Jarrell's career {{took him}} to Africa in 1977, where he found {{inspiration}} in the Senufo people of Ivory Coast, Mali and Burkina Faso. Upon return to the United States he moved to Georgia and taught at the University of Georgia. In Georgia, he began to use a bricklayer's trowel on his canvases, creating a textured appearance within his already visually active paintings. The figures often seen in his paintings are abstract and inspired by the masks and sculptures of Nigeria. These Nigerian arts have also inspired Jarrell's totem sculptures. Living and working in Cleveland, Jarrell continues to explore the <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> American experience through his paintings, sculptures, and prints. His work {{is found in the}} collections of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, High Museum of Art, The Studio Museum in Harlem and the University of Delaware.|$|E
5|$|Okay Africa {{wrote that}} by its second year, the fair had become Europe's {{foremost}} <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> art fair, and Naomi Rea of Artnet News {{called it a}} necessary visit during the London Frieze Art Fair. In New York, Ben Davis of Artnet wrote that 1:54 NY was a highlight of the city's art fair week. Critics had typically questioned whether art fairs with narrow geographic scope like 1:54 highlight or ostracize minority artists. A gallery owner from Seattle saw the fair as a route for further integration into larger markets. Artnet Davis expressed distaste at the art fair trend of lumping artists by their geographic region and generalizing trends based on its parts, but nonetheless considered important 1:54's representation of Africa. Critics initially noted the fair's lack of African gallery representation, but cited justification including the African art scene's nascent state and the continent's history of political instability, which affects both overseas trade and gallery security. At the 2015 New York show, reviewers noted elements including the predominantly white gallery exhibition staff and the marquee display of a popular artist at a fair for marginal artists.|$|E

She fostered a new generation of African-American authors, including Toni Cade Bambara, Angela Davis, and Gayl Jones, whose writing Morrison discovered, and she brought out the autobiography of boxer Muhammad Ali, The Greatest. She also published and publicized the work of Henry Dumas, a little-known novelist and poet who was shot to death by a transit officer in the New York City subway in 1968.|$|E

25|$|The term mythology predates {{the word}} myth by centuries. It first {{appeared}} in the fifteenth century, borrowed from the Middle French term mythologie. The word mythology, ("exposition of myths"), comes from Middle French mythologie, from Late Latin mythologia, from Greek μυθολογία mythología ("legendary lore, a telling of mythic legends; a legend, story, tale") from μῦθος mythos ("myth") and -λογία -logia ("study"). Both terms translated the subject of Latin author Fulgentius' fifth-century Mythologiæ, which was concerned with the explication of Greek and Roman stories about their gods, commonly referred to as classical mythology. Although Fulgentius' conflation with the <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> Saint Fulgentius is now questioned, the Mythologiæ explicitly treated its subject matter as allegories requiring interpretation and not as true events.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the last}} couple of years he has been honing his craft as a record producer, putting out a long array of music {{projects}} along the way. His goal has been to spearhead the EDM movement in Africa while at the same time doing his part in spreading the gospel of Afro beats music to the rest of the world. Therefore, his mash-ups and remixes infuse both <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> rhythms and vocals with the piercing synth sounds of electronic dance music giving birth to a completely new refreshing high. His productions however, though geared towards certain genres still remain highly experimental, reminiscent of early Diplo. His mash-up series “Mash-Up Mondays” where he releases a brand new mash-up every Monday is currently hosted on The Beat 99.9 FM radio station during the Morning Rush show.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 {{more than}} 60 arts {{institutions}} {{spread across the}} five boroughs, from smaller community organizations like the Museum of <b>Contemporary</b> <b>African</b> Diasporan Arts in Brooklyn to major institutions like The Morgan Library & Museum, were undergoing or recently completed architectural renovations or new construction. In aggregate the projects represented more than $2.8 billion in investment. The New York City Department of Cultural Affairs budget for building projects was {{the largest in the}} city's history: $865 million from 2006 through 2010, up from a $339.6 million planned budget for the 2001-4 period. The Alliance for the Arts, a nonpartisan, nonprofit arts advocacy and research group, reported in 2003 that the economic impact of cultural construction projects in New York — including factors like jobs created and collateral spending in the city — between 1997 and 2002 was $2.3 billion, with an anticipated impact of $2.7 billion for the period from 2003 through 2006.|$|E

By 2016, the show had become {{three times the size}} of the original exhibition with 130 artists represented. A spin-off, pop-up show, 1:54 NY, has been held annually in New York City during the May Frieze New York since 2015. Critics have described 1:54 as a highlight of the Frieze event, and wrote that the show's publicity for <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> art outweighs the issues of lumping disparate geographic traditions together. The fair's representation from African galleries has improved as the international market for African art expands.|$|E

500|$|... 1:54 is a <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> art fair held {{annually}} in London, beginning in 2013. As of 2015, 1:54 {{is the only}} art fair dedicated to <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> art in the primary art market. Its name refers to the 54 countries that compose the African continent, expressed as a ratio ("one continent: 54 countries"). Moroccan curator Touria El Glaoui, daughter of the artist Hassan El Glaoui, organized the fair to improve the representation of <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> art in worldwide art exhibitions. Representation of non-Western countries in the contemporary art world has lagged behind that of other countries. Representation of African countries, in particular, improved alongside the continent's economic growth. El Glaoui said that the continent {{did not have a}} single art scene, and that there was great diversity between African nations. Accordingly, as in the fair's title, 1:54 tries to preserve rather than homogenize the differences between each country's histories and cultures. In starting the fair, its founder was supported and advised by the British Council, the Francophonie, and partners ArtReview, Beaux Art magazine, and Art.sy. For each edition, the 1:54 organizers ask themselves [...] "what is necessary, what can be achieved, how [...] do something different". The fair's organizers choose exhibitors based on proposal submissions and the firms' reputation and plans. Travel visa issues have also affected whether invitees ultimately attend.|$|E
