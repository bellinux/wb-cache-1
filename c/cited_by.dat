5|$|Hemi {{argued that}} a line of Illinois appellate {{opinions}} demonstrated that Illinois law required more than federal law with regard to satisfying due process standards for personal jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit rejected this argument, finding {{that none of the}} cases <b>cited</b> <b>by</b> Hemi even suggested a meaningful difference between the federal and Illinois due process standards, and {{that at least one of}} the cases <b>cited</b> <b>by</b> Hemi only discussed the distinction in the theoretical context. Though the Seventh Circuit noted that the district court may only exercise jurisdiction only if both federal and state constitutional elements are satisfied, it also stated that it was unaware of cases where personal jurisdiction could be satisfied under the U.S. Constitution, but not under the Illinois Constitution. Hence, the Seventh Circuit limited its analysis as to whether exercising personal jurisdiction over Hemi would comport with the federal guarantee of due process.|$|E
