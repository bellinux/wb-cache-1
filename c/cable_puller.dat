5000|$|Electric park brakes (EPB) {{are used}} on {{passenger}} vehicles {{to hold the}} vehicle stationary on grades and flat roads. This was accomplished traditionally using a manual parking brake. With electric park brakes, the driver activates the holding mechanism with a button and the brake pads are then electrically applied onto the rear brakes. This is accomplished by an electronic control unit (ECU) and an actuator mechanism. There are two mechanisms that are currently in production: 1. <b>Cable</b> <b>puller</b> systems and 2. Caliper integrated systems. [...] EPB systems {{can be considered a}} subset of Brake-by-wire technology.|$|E

40|$|It is very {{important}} for a <b>cable</b> <b>puller</b> to clarify the friction mechanism between a wire rope and steel grippers. In earlier works, some fundamental data such as friction coefficient, deformation and real contact area were obtained. This paper presents main factors affecting the friction based on the experiment varying apparent contact area and lubricants, and also observation of the deformation process. It is shown that the friction of the wire rope is hardly affected by the apparent contact area but significantly affected by the section shape of grippers. It is considered that high compressive load being mainly supported by 6 strands, rather than the rope core of a wire rope structure, is closely related to the friction mechanism...|$|E
40|$|It is very {{important}} for a <b>cable</b> <b>puller</b> to grasp a wire rope tightly without any slippage and with no damage on both of the rope surface and cable gripper. The friction mechanism of a wire rope under a large deformation due to high grasp force, however, has not been sufficiently clarified. The present paper will report some results on friction of the wire rope under high compressive load on some cases such as under lubricated condition and under different contact conditions using three types of wire rope with steel core, fiber core and a galvanized rope with fiber core. As the results, the difference of contact area between the wire rope and gripper greatly affects the friction behavior; that is, the gripper with a curved surface can bring large friction force comparing with the gripper with a flat surface owing to its large real contact area, which is dominated by a restriction of the escape of wire between gripper surfaces and the deformation of a rope and a core...|$|E
5000|$|Cyclocross Cantilever brake bosses {{are more}} often {{equipped}} with traditional center-pull cantilever brakes than the more contemporary and powerful linear-pull brakes ("V-brakes") due to two reasons: native compatibility (insufficient brake <b>cable</b> <b>pull)</b> {{with the majority of}} drop-bar brake levers; and the cantilever brake's greater brake pad-to-rim clearance, which minimizes drag in muddy conditions.

50|$|The {{actuation}} {{ratio is}} the ratio between {{the amount of}} shifter cable length and the amount of transverse derailleur travel that it generates. Shift ratio is the reciprocal of actuation ratio and is more easily expressed for derailleurs than actuation. There are currently several standards in use, and in each the product of the derailleur's actuation ratio and the length of <b>cable</b> <b>pulled</b> must equal the pitch of the rear sprockets. The following standards exist.|$|R

40|$|The {{handling}} of mining machine cables in underground coal mines {{has been identified}} as a particularly stressful task and is a likely contributor to low back pain. In this experiment, seven experienced miners performed a <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> task while ground reaction forces and cable tension were measured. The independent variables were two levels of cable resistance (low and high) and lifting conditions (kneeling under a 1. 2 meter [48 inch] roof, stooping under a 1. 2 meter [48 inch] roof, stooping under a 1. 5 meter [60 inch] roof, and unrestricted standing). The dependent variables were the peak values of the following: actual tension measured in the cable, ground reaction forces in the X (anterior), Y (lateral), and Z (vertical) directions and the magnitude of the resultant force vector. Work posture significantly affected the peak ground reaction forces in the Y-direction. The Y-forces were highest in the kneeling condition, indicating that there is less postural stability when performing <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> tasks in a kneeling posture. Thus, there may be a greater likelihood of injury in this posture. Additionally, biomechanical stresses which contribute to musculoskeletal injury may be greater in the kneeling posture...|$|R
