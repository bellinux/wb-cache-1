40|$|The {{layout of}} the {{production}} line in any <b>clean</b> <b>rooms</b> will change according to the production process and this posed a problem for post <b>clean</b> <b>room</b> maintenance. Air velocity {{is one of the}} many problematic issues commonly found in <b>clean</b> <b>room</b> environment. It is important to address this on-going problem whenever there is an upgrading of the production process in which more advanced equipment were being introduced to the <b>clean</b> <b>room</b> to automate the process. This paper examines the characteristics of airflow distribution within the <b>clean</b> <b>room</b> due to changes in the production process. This study was conducted for a class 100 <b>clean</b> <b>room</b> at a disk-drive manufacturing firm. The airflow distribution in the <b>clean</b> <b>room</b> was simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. This model provides a valuable insight into the processes that are difficult and time-consuming to study experimentally.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine quantitatively and qualitatively the predominant types of microbial contamination occurring in conventional and laminar flow <b>clean</b> <b>rooms.</b> One horizontal laminar flow, three conventional industrial <b>clean</b> <b>rooms,</b> and three open factory areas were selected for microbiological tests. The results showed that as the environment and personnel of a <b>clean</b> <b>room</b> were controlled in a more positive manner with respect to the reduction of particulate contamination, the levels of airborne and surface microbial contaminants were reduced accordingly. The chief sources of microbial contamination were associated with the density and activity of <b>clean</b> <b>room</b> personnel. In addition, the majority of microorganisms isolated from the intramural air by air samplers were those indigenous to humans. Studies on the fallout and accumulation of airborne microorganisms on stainless-steel surfaces showed that, although there were no significant differences in the levels of microbial contamination among the conventional <b>clean</b> <b>rooms,</b> the type of microorganism detected on stainless-steel surfaces was consistently and significantly different. In addition, the “plateau phenomenon” occurred in all environments studied. It was concluded that the stainless-steel strip method for detecting microbial accumulation on surfaces is efficient and sensitive in ultra-clean environments and is the most reliable and practical method for monitoring microbial contamination in future class 100 <b>clean</b> <b>rooms</b> to be used for the assembly of spacecraft which will be sterilized...|$|R
