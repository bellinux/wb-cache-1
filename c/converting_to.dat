5|$|In 1904, {{there was}} a {{religious}} revival (known by some as the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival, or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw {{large numbers of people}} <b>converting</b> <b>to</b> nonconformist and Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether ethnicity impacts graft outcomes in kidney transplant patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> sirolimus (SRL) and maintained on either calcineurin inhibitors (CI) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with steroids. METHODS: This study analyzed kidney transplants <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL and transplanted between July 1991 and April 2007. Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI; group 2 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI; group 3 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF; group 4 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF. RESULTS: A total of 242 patients was included. Demographics, baseline immunosuppression, and reason for SRL conversion were similar among groups. Patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI regimens had significantly higher rates of acute rejection before SRL conversion, but equal rates after conversion. Development of proteinuria was similar across groups. African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF tended to have poorer outcomes compared with African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI. Non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF tended to have better graft outcomes compared with non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI. CONCLUSIONS: African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL may benefit from continued CI, whereas non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL seem to have better outcomes with MMF. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings...|$|R

5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones {{at different stages of}} the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher.

In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E

5|$|According to Turkish {{traveller}} Evliya Çelebi, {{who visited}} the city in 1670, at that time there were 200 houses within the castle, 200 in the Christian eastern neighborhood of Kyçyk Varosh (meaning small neighborhood outside the castle), 150 houses in the Byjyk Varosh (meaning big neighborhood outside the castle), and six additional neighborhoods: Palorto, Vutosh, Dunavat, Manalat, Haxhi Bey, and Memi Bey, extending on eight hills around the castle. According to the traveller, the city had at that time around 2000 houses, eight mosques, three churches, 280 shops, five fountains, and five inns.

5|$|Amanita muscaria {{contains}} several biologically active agents, {{at least}} one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with approximately 10–20% <b>converting</b> <b>to</b> muscimol after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6mg muscimol or 30 to 60mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one cap of Amanita muscaria. The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{unfavourable}} currency {{conditions and}} conflicting {{pressures on the}} military budget, several prospective procurements of modern aircraft such as the SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war; the indigenously developed HAL HF-24 Marut had also not been as successful as hoped, thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets of Hunters and English Electric Canberra bombers. After considering several foreign aircraft to replace the Hunter, including the Dassault Mirage F1, the Saab 37 Viggen, and several Soviet models, the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars, {{a large portion of}} which were to be assembled domestically, in October 1978.

50|$|GAs {{are usually}} {{produced}} from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes {{are used to}} yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: - 1) GGDP is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase - 2) etn-CDP is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase - 3) ent-kaurene is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) - 4) ent-kaurenol is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenal by KO - 5) ent-kaurenal is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenoic acid by KO - 6) ent-kaurenoic acid is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) - 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> GA12-aldehyde by KAO- 8) GA12-aldehyde is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> GA12 by KAO.
