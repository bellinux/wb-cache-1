5000|$|As {{described}} in Swamp Thing #2, the Un-Men are [...] "synthetic men" [...] {{created by the}} evil sorcerer/scientist Anton Arcane in his mountain castle in the Balkans. In that story arc, Arcane dispatches a group of these deformed creatures to Louisiana to capture the Swamp Thing. Obsessed with obtaining immortality, the elderly and ailing Arcane intends to transfer his mind and soul into the Swamp Thing's indestructible plant body. Arcane explains to the <b>captive</b> <b>plant</b> creature that the Un-Men [...] "are the result of my first experimentations [...] - [...] crude, but totally dedicated to me." [...] Unsuitable for Arcane's body-switching schemes, the Un-Men mindlessly serve their [...] "master" [...] as obedient henchmen. At {{the end of the}} story arc, the Swamp Thing chases Arcane to the top of his castle tower, and the old man plunges to his death. His loyal Un-Men jump after him like lemmings, presumably to their deaths as well.|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{deployment}} of the renewable energy system in India is required to achieve a target of 175 GW of green electricity by 2022. Higher educational institutes {{with a lot of}} free areas can {{play a vital role in}} reducing the conventional energy consumption and carbon footprint. The main aim of this paper is to locate and analyze the feasibility of developing 100 % solar PV based academic campus at MANIT – Bhopal, India. Annual electricity consumption of MANIT, Bhopal is analyzed and accordingly 5 MW capacity solar PV based <b>captive</b> <b>plant</b> is proposed. Free open space area of the campus including rooftop area is inspected through geographical coordinates utilizing the NASA surface meteorology data and Google SketchUp. The performance of the proposed solar campus is analyzed using PVSyst and Solar Advisory Model (SAM) software. The proposed plant at MANIT campus can generate around 8000 MWh per annum of electricity to meet the 100 % energy requirements of the campus with the annual reduction of 73 318. 0 tonnes of carbon footprint. Development and promotion of such sustainable green concepts will be a significant step towards transforming the academic campus into an energy efficient and environmentally sustainable community...|$|E
