60|$|Mr. ------ has {{now been}} ten years in Italy, and, after all this time, he is still entirely American in {{everything}} but the most external surface of his manners; scarcely Europeanized, or much modified even in that. He {{is a native of}} ------, but had his early breeding in New York, and might, for any polish or refinement that I can discern in him, still be a country shopkeeper in the interior of New York State or New England. How strange! For one expects to find the polish, the <b>close</b> <b>grain</b> and white purity of marble, in the artist who works in that noble material; but, after all, he handles club, and, judging by the specimens I have seen here, is apt to be clay, not of the finest, himself. Mr. ------ is sensible, shrewd, keen, clever; an ingenious workman, no doubt; with tact enough, and not destitute of taste; very agreeable and lively in his conversation, talking as fast and as naturally as a brook runs, without the slightest affectation. His naturalness is, in fact, a rather striking characteristic, in view of his lack of culture, while yet his life has been concerned with idealities and a beautiful art. What degree of taste he pretends to, he seems really to possess, nor did I hear a single idea from him that struck me as otherwise than sensible.|$|E
5000|$|The wood is {{hard and}} durable, with an attractive, reddish, <b>close</b> <b>grain.</b> It {{has been used}} {{extensively}} for fence posts, for ornamental articles, and for high-load applications such as sheave blocks.

50|$|Its {{flexibility}} and <b>close</b> <b>grain</b> make it {{suitable for a}} number of applications, similar to those for willow. The Greeks and Etruscans made shields of poplar, and Pliny also recommended poplar for this purpose. Poplar continued to be used for shield construction through the Middle Ages and was renowned for a durability similar to that of oak, but at a substantial reduction in weight.|$|E
50|$|Lyptus has {{mechanical}} properties similar to many hardwoods, and {{is most often}} compared to maple. It is a closed-grain wood, and is harder than oak. The high hardness and <b>closed</b> <b>grain</b> structure make it popular for cabinetry, millwork and flooring. The coloration varies from a light salmon to a deeper red. With exposure to UV light, the pigments darken slightly.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to a sourdough starter, salt-rising bread starter {{requires}} a shorter incubation period of 6-16 hours {{and a higher}} incubation temperature, ranging from 38 - 45 C. Salt-rising bread is denser, with a <b>closer</b> <b>grain,</b> than yeast-leavened bread, and has a distinctive taste and odor.

50|$|Deodar is {{in great}} demand as {{building}} material {{because of its}} durability, rot-resistant character and fine, <b>close</b> <b>grain,</b> which is capable of taking a high polish. Its historical use to construct religious temples and in landscaping around temples is well recorded. Its rot-resistant character also makes it an ideal wood for constructing the well-known houseboats of Srinagar, Kashmir. In Pakistan and India, during the British colonial period, deodar wood was used extensively for construction of barracks, public buildings, bridges, canals and railway cars. Despite its durability, {{it is not a}} strong timber, and its brittle nature makes it unsuitable for delicate work where strength is required, such as chair-making.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Box trees growing on the hill is disputed: Several sources from the late 18th century suggest that the first Box Trees on the Hill were planted by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel {{during the reign of}} Charles I. [...] Older medieval {{documents}} however make reference to local individuals with surnames including Atteboxe, de la Boxe and Buxeto, suggesting that Box was already common in the local area by the 13th century, and it has also been observed that Thomas Howard never owned the Box Hill estate. The diarist John Evelyn records a visit to the hill in August 1655 to view [...] "those natural bowers, cabinets and shady walks in the box copses." [...] The <b>close</b> <b>grain</b> of the Box wood made it highly prized for its timber for carving and there are numerous accounts of the sale of trees from the hill throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{distribution}} of plastic strain, both intergranular and intragranular, has been evaluated using digital image correlation on a tensile-deformed Mg- 1 Zn- 0. 5 Nd alloy. The intergranular strain distribution {{is sensitive to}} both {{the orientation of the}} grains and the orientations of neighbouring grains. Large intragranular strain gradients were observed <b>close</b> to some <b>grain</b> boundaries. These high levels of local strain were seen to correlate to the operation of additional slip and/or twin systems <b>close</b> to <b>grain</b> boundaries, deformation kinking and/or grain boundary sliding.

5000|$|The first [...] "King Mortone" [...] {{double bass}} {{appeared}} in 1934, when H. N.

The string bass's fronts were made from the finest straight-grain spruce with very <b>close</b> <b>grain</b> quality, {{while the rest of the}} instrument was made of curly maple. Each bass was equipped with an improved geared key mechanism, ensuring rigidity and sensitive tuning. The H. N. White Company claimed that each [...] "King string bass has a greater volume of tone, and carries the vibrations over a longer period of time, than any other string bass ...". During the Second World War production had stopped, but by this point approximately 1200 basses had been made. In 1946 production resumed and continued steadily until 1965, when the string department of H. N. White was sold to Kay Double Basses. By this point approximately 5000 basses had been made. When Kay had control of King Mortone Basses, they stopped production and used the factories to make Kay Double Basses.|$|E
40|$|We use an {{in situ heating}} holder {{within an}} {{aberration}} corrected transmission electron microscope (AC-TEM) to study the structure and dynamics of large <b>closed</b> <b>grain</b> boundary (GB) loops in graphene at the atomic level. Temperatures up to 800 °C are used to accelerate dynamic evolution of the defect clusters, increasing bond rotation and atomic addition/loss. Our {{results show that the}} large closed GB loops relax under electron beam irradiation into several isolated dislocations far apart from each other. Line defects composed of several adjacent excess-atom clusters can be found during the reconfiguration process. Dislocation ejection from the closed GB loops are seen in real time and are shown to help the reduction in loop size. These results show detailed information about the stability and behavior of large GB loops in 2 D materials that have importance in the high temperature processing of these materials...|$|R
5000|$|... (Original description) The small, solid shell has a {{biconical}} {{shape and}} is angled at the periphery. Its colour is white or buff. It contains 6 whorls, including a small smooth two-whorled protoconch. The sculpture shows {{about a dozen}} undulatory radial ribs, equal in breadth to their rounded interstices. They arise at the suture and are most prominent on the shoulder, and fade on the base. Ascending the spire, these radials gradually diminish. About twelve small spiral threads, which traverse ribs and furrows alike, are evenly distributed between the shoulder and the anterior extremity. Finally, a secondary sculpture of fine <b>close</b> <b>grains,</b> arranged radially and spirally, is spread over the whole surface, giving a *'gritty" [...] aspect to the shell. The aperture is narrow, protected by a strong projecting varix. The outer lip shows two or three ill-defined tubercles within. The siphonal canal is short.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the work performed on a small-scale dryer {{designed to allow}} agricultural product to be dried by farmers via usage of slanted plates for grains transportation. This work involves the prototype design, computational simulation using Comsol Multiphysics and study of the results. The computational simulation results are plotted in temperature contour-plots based on the prototype modelling and boundary conditions. The results illustrate the difference in opening and <b>closing</b> of <b>grains</b> inlet and also effects of the temperature distribution within the dryer. Air-flow relative humidity is also introduced to allow observation of the drying air-flow on the grains. The simulation results are shown and elaborated here. From the results, it is evident the grains can be dried as the injected heated air-flow is projected onto the plates. It can also be concluded here that farmers may need to <b>close</b> the <b>grains</b> inlet of the dryer to prevent heat loss and non-uniform distribution of heat...|$|R

40|$|Interactions between dislocations and Σ = 9 grain {{boundaries}} were studied in slightly deformed silicon bicrystals by several imaging techniques. A very complex dislocation arrangement in the <b>grains</b> <b>close</b> to the <b>grain</b> boundary was revealed by TEM : pile-ups, networks with Lomer-Cottrell barriers, profuse cross-slip, local stress reversals. In situ observations by synchrotron X-ray topography suggest {{the possibility of}} dislocation transmission by Σ = 9 {{grain boundaries}}. Except for dislocations with the a/ 2 [011 Burgers vector, common to both grains, {{the reality of a}} direct transmission mechanism at the atomic scale was not confirmed by HREM investigations which proved that lattice dislocations dissociate in the grain boundary into DSC dislocations. These apparently contradictory results are discussed in terms of deformation conditions and core structures of dislocations...|$|R

However, the dipped in hole on the Ovelgönne bread roll is the earliest prehistoric evidence for this technique in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|A {{great many}} {{things have changed}} {{throughout}} the past century, but some things have come almost full circle. The earliest farmers in the R.M. of the Gap had to haul their grain to Weyburn. Eventually elevators were built in Ceylon and Hardy, but these did not last and now, a full century later, the <b>closest</b> <b>grain</b> gathering point is once again Weyburn. But while the earliest settlers faced a grueling two- or three-day journey with a horse-pulled wagon, farmers now haul their grain in semis. In those first few years, there were few families in the area, and farms were far away from each other. A steady stream of settlers meant that within a decade or so, there were farms everywhere, and {{the isolation of the}} earliest days ended. Over the years, as farming changed and cities became more attractive to young people, the countryside has thinned out again. Small clumps of trees, former access roads that are being reclaimed by the land, and tumbledown shacks are all that remain of these former farms and homes. Reliable roads, vehicles, telephones and the Internet mean that farm families are not exactly isolated, but they certainly have fewer neighbours than they would have in decades past.|$|R
