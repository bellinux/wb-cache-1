40|$|Obsahem bakalářské práce je problematika vzniku nepokojů u obyvatelstvaThis bachelor?s thesis {{deals with}} the issue of the origin of <b>civil</b> <b>unrests</b> and ways of {{possible}} solutions of these situations. The thesis is focused on the description of causes of <b>civil</b> <b>unrests,</b> behaviour of people during mass events and it provides an overview of possible ways of suppressing civil disorders in the Czech Republic. Firstly, the theoretical part describes psychological aspects of people?s behaviour in the crowd and mass events which might be considered risky in terms of the high probability of the outburst of <b>civil</b> <b>unrests.</b> This part also explains terms related to the public order. Secondly, the theoretical part focuses on forces and means that the Police of the Czech Republic uses for maintaining the public order and for suppressing prospective civil disorders.

40|$|Social microblogs such as Twitter and Weibo are {{experiencing}} an explosive growth with billions of global users sharing their daily observations and thoughts. Beyond public interests (e. g., sports, music), microblogs can provide highly detailed information {{for those interested}} in public health, homeland security, and financial analysis. However, the language used in Twitter is heavily informal, ungrammatical, and dynamic. Existing data mining algorithms require extensive manually labeling to build and maintain a supervised system. This paper presents STED, a semi-supervised system that helps users to automatically detect and interactively visualize events of a targeted type from twitter, such as crimes, <b>civil</b> <b>unrests,</b> and disease outbreaks. Our model first applies transfer learning and label propagation to automatically generate labeled data, then learns a customized text classifier based on mini-clustering, and finally applies fast spatial scan statistics to estimate the locations of events. We demonstrate STED’s usage and benefits using twitter data collected from Latin America countries, and show how our system helps to detect and track example events such as <b>civil</b> <b>unrests</b> and crimes. 1...|$|R
