[...] Two days later, Suslov had a coronary, and died on 25 January of arteriosclerosis and diabetes. His death is viewed as starting the battle to succeed Brezhnev, in which Andropov, who assumed Suslov's post as the Party's Second Secretary, sidelined Kirilenko and Chernenko during the last days of Brezhnev's rule. Suslov was buried on 29 January at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Brezhnev expressed great sadness at Suslov's passing.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{historian}} Christopher Andrew, Andropov {{suffered from a}} [...] "Hungarian complex" [...] from his personal experience of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. He had, as the Soviet ambassador to Hungary, [...] "watched in horror from the windows of his embassy as officers of the hated Hungarian security service were strung up from lampposts". Andropov remained haunted {{for the rest of}} his life by the speed with which an apparently all-powerful Communist one-party state had begun to topple. Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov, then <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> the <b>KGB,</b> justified the creation of Operation RYaN because, they claimed, the United States was “actively preparing for nuclear war” against the Soviet Union and its allies. According to a newly released Stasi report, the primary “Chekist work” discussed in the May 1981 meeting was the “demand to allow for ‘no surprise.'" ...|$|R

Even when {{he had been able to}} secure his position, Gorbachev's power within the system was already faltering, although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the Cabinet of Ministers reversed. The power struggle between Gorbachev and Pavlov was not over, with Gorbachev promising Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev that Pavlov, along with Dmitry Yazov, Minister of Defence, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, the <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> the <b>KGB,</b> would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the New Union Treaty.|$|R
