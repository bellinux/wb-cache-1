40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} {{cementitious composites}} are nowadays widely applied in civil engineering. The postcracking performance {{of this material}} depends on the interaction between a steel fiber, which is obliquely across a crack, and its surrounding matrix. While the partly debonded steel fiber is subjected to pulling out from the matrix and simultaneously subjected to transverse force, it may be modelled as a Bernoulli-Euler beam partly supported on an elastic foundation with non-linearly varying modulus. The fiber bridging the crack may be cut into two parts to simplify the problem (Leung and Li 1992). To obtain the transverse displacement at the cut end of the fiber (Fig. 1), it is convenient to directly solve the corresponding differential equation. At the first glance, it is a classical beam on foundation problem. However, the differential equation is not analytically solvable due to the non-linear distribution of the foundation stiffness. Moreover, since the second order deformation effect is included, the boundary conditions become complex and hence conventional numerical tools such as the spline or difference methods may not be sufficient. In this study, moment equilibrium {{is the basis for}} formulation of the fundamental differential equation for the beam (Timoshenko 1956). For the <b>cantilever</b> <b>part</b> of the beam, direct integration is performed, For the non-linearly supported part, a transformation is carried out to reduce the higher order differential equation into one order simultaneous equations, The Runge-Kutta technique is employed for the solution within the boundary domain. Finally, multi-dimensional optimization approaches are carefully tested and applied to find the boundary values that are of interest. The numerical solution procedure is demonstrated to be stable and convergent...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This {{prospective}} mono-center study {{describes a}} clinical technique to provide dental implants with a temporary cross-arch cantilever bridge functionally loaded {{on the day}} of fixture insertion and discusses the 3 -year follow-up of four to six machined surface Branemark implants installed in the interforamina area. Material and methods: Ninety Branemark implants were installed in 18 edentulous mandibles. Five patients were heavy smokers and one had Down syndrome. The day of surgery, a 10 unit provisional glassfiber-reinforced cantilever bridge was installed. The final 12 unit bridge was in place after an average of 144 days (range 10 - 332). Bone-to-implant level was assessed radiologically from the day of surgery up to 3 years. Results: Two out of five fixtures were lost within 3 months in the Down syndrome patient but the provisional bridge continued to function on the three remaining implants until the patient was successfully reoperated. Another implant was lost after 11 months due to a non-detected fracture in the metal framework, resulting in overloading of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>part.</b> As no additional losses occurred during the follow-up time (range 57 - 26 months), the total failure rate is 3 / 91 (3. 3 %). Seventeen of the 18 patients are loading their implants more than 3 years and nine have moved beyond the 4 -year period. Average bone remodelling as measured on the apical radiographs from 12 patients at 0, 12 and 36 months revealed a statistically significant bone loss from the initial 0. 1 mm [standard deviation (SD) 0. 2; range 0 - 0. 7] toward 1. 8 mm (SD 0. 2; range 1. 6 - 2. 2) {{during the first year of}} function. (Wilcoxon's signed rank test; P < 0. 002). After 3 years, no further significant bone loss occurred. Conclusion: This 3 -year study shows that machined surface Branemark implants can be immediately loaded with cross-arch cantilever bridges with an average bone-remodelling pattern indicative of a steady state after 1 year of loading...|$|E
40|$|An {{unpublished}} {{study by}} Prof. A. W. Beeby shows {{the differences in}} strength capacity between a reinforced concrete beam without shear reinforcement and the same beam with a cut-out section at {{the middle of the}} span. The cut-out section exists at the bottom part of the beam while the reinforcement still remains. It remarkably turns out that the strength capacity of the beam with the cut-out section is 1. 6 times larger compared to the reference beam. The reference beam fails by a flexural shear crack which does not arise in the beam with the cut-out section. On the occasion of Beeby’s experiments and the lack of a simple physical model for a flexural shear crack this thesis has the objective to clarify the difference between a beam and a truss mechanism and the failure due to flexural shear cracks. The study is based on a simple supported beam without shear reinforcement subjected to a oncentrated load with a three point bending test with a slendernessratio of 2. 45 and a reinforcement ratio of 0. 89 %. An analytical study describes the difference between the beam and a simplified truss mechanism. Linear analyses show the differences in stress distributions and deflections. The study shows the same difference in strength capacity as the experiments of Beeby. In addition quite a difference is revealed in the displacements of both mechanism. The truss mechanism shows a larger deformation compared to the beam mechanism. Finite element modelling with DIANA has been used to gain better insight in the difference of the strength capacity. The models use a total strain fixed crack model. The Hordijk-curve describes the tensile properties and an ideal relation describes the compressive properties. The decrease of the poisson ratio and the shear resistance around a crack have been taken into account by a damaged based shear retention model and a damaged based crack model. The finite element models show differences of the strength capacity within the same level of Beeby’s experiments. The force mechanism in both systems is different before the flexural shear crack arises in the beam. After a flexural shear crack occurs both mechanism seems to change into a similar truss mechanism, but detailed analyses show important deviations from this expectation. Variation of the cut-out dimensions shows that a too small gap results in a flexural shear crack and a too large gap in the failing of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>part.</b> Gaps between these limits all change into a truss mechanism which reaches the same level of failure load as the basic truss. The decrease of stiffness of the beam results in more compressive stresses in the truss mechanism preventing the occurrence of the shear crack. If the shear crack does not occur in the beam it results in a higher strength capacity. A dedicated shaped beam which has initially exactly the shape of a shear cracked beam without the concrete part below the crack, has a different strength capacity compared to a regular shear cracked beam. The dedicated shaped beam proves that the crack shape itself has no influence on the ability of converting into a truss. It turns out that in the regular beam it is impossible to develop a perfect truss mechanism after a flexural shear crack due to the concrete that is still present beneath the crack. The concrete beneath the crack causes a different stress distribution {{in the top of the}} beam compared to the dedicated shaped beam without this concrete. A hypothesis is given for the failure of the shear crack. The acquired knowledge of the influence of the concrete beneath the crack and the stiffness of the beam allows other design possibilities. It is possible to design a concrete truss, if among other, the yielding of steel, crushing of the concrete and the deformation capacity of the truss are taken into account. Further research is for instance possible for unbonded reinforcement and beams with a descending height.

30|$|Many {{procedures}} {{are used to}} recover denture foundation, but the majority is considered sophisticated techniques [51 – 53]. Observations tried to notify bone modifications with different types of implant-assisted restoration [23, 40, 54]. The clinical and radiographic investigations, detection of the altered mineral levels, or bone density within the bone may give a valuable data for the bony state around loaded implants [55 – 57]. In a prospective study, Adell et al. [19] noticed a reduction of probing depth around implants, resembling approximately that surround natural dentition which indicates active positive bone repair. A further sign of bone preserving is the radiopacity close to the fixture due to increasing in density [58]. Such radiopacity affirmed to increased bone volume and/or increased mineral content. Maxillary implants reflected more bone density rather than mandibular and distal cantilevered implants due to the stresses which may produce more unfavorable bone restoring condition. After 10  years of implant placement, {{a significant increase in}} peri-implant bone density was noted in a clinical study for 18 patients [59].

We go on to model these toppling failures numerically. Specifically, a Mohr-Coulomb model, within the framework of SIGMA/W software (ver. 7. 17), was used to simulate the stress–strain behavior of the experimental banks.

On the earliest model, the Mg 19, the ailerons fill the trailing edge from bend to tip but such a large area produces heavy control loads and on the Mg 19a the ailerons are reduced in length by about a third. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes open above and below the wing just inboard of the bend at 44% chord. In plan the wing has a straight and swept leading edge. The trailing edge is also straight inboard of the ailerons, where the tips become semi-elliptical. A 1° sweep at one quarter chord produces a swept spar to allow the two ends to meet just behind the rear seat.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} in the miniaturization of electronic items introduces manufacturing challenges for achieving both better surface integrity and high throughput. Controlled thermal interaction processes physically vaporize the material for producing the miniature components but the poor surface and sub-surface characteristics introduce a niche for thermo-mechanical processes, particularly microgrinding. Prior microgrinding attempts have focussed on axi-symmetrical components of hard-brittle materials. For non-axi-symmetrical, high-aspect ratio miniature components, edge chipping was encountered. This paper reports a new grinding method that uses "high table reversal speeds" for reducing the "grit cut load" and hence facilitates the microgrinding process. An arrangement that functions {{on the principles of}} four bar linkage with a sliding and rotating pair was devised. This arrangement was designed to reciprocate between 300 - 1000 strokes/min for a stroke length of 10 - 70 turn. As a result the table feed rate range was increased from the conventional 300 - 20000 mm/min to 5000 - 55000 mm/min. Process characterization of the new grinding method was observed for hard-brittle materials. A physical model was developed which links the process parameters with appropriate boundary conditions and the model was verified experimentally. The experimental model was used to explain the mechanism of grinding while employing high table reversal speeds. Process characterization includes grinding force, grinding-ratio, grinding wheel topography, surface finish and SEM study. Also, the process was applied to produce mold-insert which in turn was used for molding the micro-mechanical <b>cantilever</b> sensor <b>parts.</b> Deep slots of size: 1. 2 x 0. 1 x 1. 5 mm with an aspect ratio of 15 was successfully produced with this method. The new grinding device and method promote microgrinding through integration to an existing grinder and therefore reduces the additional cost on the capital resources. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of a family of}} silicon based integrated vibration sensors capable of sensing mechanical resonances over a broad range of frequencies with minimal signal processing requirements is presented. Two basic general embodiments of the concept were designed and fabricated. The first design was structured around an array of cantilever beams and fabricated using the ARPA sponsored multi-user MEMS processing system (MUMPS) process at the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC). As part of the design process for this first sensor, a comprehensive finite elements analysis of the resonant modes and stress distribution was performed using PATRAN. The dependence of strain distribution and resonant frequency response as a function of Young's modulus in the Poly-Si structural material was studied. Analytical models were also studied. In-house experimental characterization using optical interferometry techniques were performed under controlled low pressure conditions. A second design, intended to operate in a non-resonant mode and capable of broadband frequency response, was proposed and developed around the concept of a cantilever beam integrated with a feedback control loop to produce a null mode vibration sensor.

40|$|In Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), a microcantilever is raster scanned {{across the}} surface of a sample in order to obtain a {{topographical}} image of the sample's surface. In a traditional, optical AFM, the sample rests on a bulk piezoelectric tube and a control loop is used to control the tip-sample separation by actuating the piezo-tube. This method has several disadvantages [...] the most noticeable one being that response time of the piezo-tube is rather long which leads to slow imaging speeds. One possible solution aimed at improving the speed of imaging is to incorporate a thin piezoelectric film on top of the cantilever beam. This design not only improves the speed of imaging because the piezoelectric film replaces the piezo-tube as an actuator, but the film can also act as a sensor. In addition, the piezoelectric film can excite the cantilever beam near its resonance frequency. This project aims to fabricate piezoelectric microcantilevers for use in the AFM.

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has focused on}} machining dynamics due to the impact it lays upon productivity and quality. Models have been developed with an ever-increasing accuracy in order to predict the dynamic behavior of cutting tools under different circumstances. However, workpiece behavior during machining is also a current limiting factor which is dealt with by means of restricting product designers of using features with thin characteristics. For this reason, designed products will be often oversized due to machining technology restrictions related to dimensions of thin walls. The main objective of this work is to investigate the behavior of thin walls during milling in order to identify the challenges imposed by the process. Different strategies are tested and evaluated through force signals, finite element analysis (FEA), analytical models, and analysis of the machined <b>parts.</b> <b>Cantilever</b> walls with varying dimensions are tested and the height-to-thickness (H/t) ratio often found in literature as a guideline is discussed. Waterline, low stock, constant force, and passive damping strategies are evaluated and their applicability, advantages, and restrictions are discussed. The effect of cutting speed on cutting force is investigated from a force and excitation frequency standpoint. A method for prediction of resonance based on a frequency chart is proposed, for which variable speed tests are conducted. This variable speed approach is based on prediction of stable paths as machining progresses by means of the proposed chart. Validation of the frequency chart construction method is presented along with its applicability and restrictions considering a more complex geometry.

40|$|Microcantilevers {{have now}} been used {{successfully}} for over a decade. New assays are being developed and tested continuously but the technique has not arrived in hospitals and surgeries yet. The main obstacle was that a robust and reliable readout system which does not need intricate alignment before each measurement was not available. Therefore cantilever devices have only been used in university laboratories. The {{aim of the research}} presented in this thesis is to provide a diffractive optical readout for cantilever bending that is rapid, robust and easy to use. The diffractive readout discovered during my PhD involves a laser illuminating the entire <b>cantilever</b> and additionally <b>parts</b> of the chip base to which it is attached. The laser light diffracted from the cantilever contains information that allows a distinction to be made between tilting and bending of the cantilever. Additionally, measurements of the absolute tilting and bending can be performed and the time needed for aligning the cantilever chip in the laser beam is reduced to a minimum. This thesis describes the tools used to develop the diffractive readout and presents experimental results. First, a simulation was programmed to predict results and optimise experimental conditions. Second, an experimental setup was built from scratch and a new ow cell designed which was needed for transmission mode experiments. Third, test experiments in air were performed using a transmissive and a reflective diffraction approach. Fourth and finally, the applicability of the diffractive readout was shown by demonstrating that the binding of the antibiotic vancomycin to a glycopeptide could be measured successfully. I hope that the invention presented in this thesis will help to commercialise the cantilever setup and make it attractive for the use in hospital and surgeries speeding up diagnostic steps from days down to a few minutes. This thesis lays the cornerstone of the discovered, patented and tested optical diffractive readout technique for cantilever based biosensors.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the statics and dynamics of very thin wings of high speed airplanes. With the modern tendency towards sweepback, which is necessary for supersonic airplanes, the wing construction tend more and more to an ideal structure, hence for the static problem of this report, the wing is idealized to a thin <b>cantilever</b> elastic plate. <b>Part</b> I gives a general formulation of the fundamental equations of deformation of thin elastic plates and the direct methods of solution. For small deflection of plates, the equations and boundary conditions are derived from the three-dimensional equations of elasticity developed in power series of the thickness of the plate. It is shown that the classical Poisson-Kirchhoff theory is coincident with the first approximation in this development. These equations are then transformed into oblique coordinates for treating problems concerning swept plates. Since the problem of the cantilever plate is very difficult to solve from the standpoint of biharmonic analysis, emphasis is laid on the direct methods of solution which lead to useful approximate solutions with desired accuracy. Section 1. 21 discusses the relation between plate problems and equivalent variational problems. Section 1. 22 contains a systematic review of the Rayleigh-Ritz method of relaxation of boundary conditions, including the Trefftz method as one instance. Part II discusses the general aeroelastic problems of high speed airplanes. For airplanes accelerating or decelerating through the transonic region, the coefficients in the aeroelasticity equations are of transient nature. Such transient perturbations are new phenomena in aeronautics but are sufficiently important to warrant detailed investigation. A general mathematical treatment is given, though due to lack of aerodynamic data at present, no specific example is included. A general solution is obtained and this solution is expanded into a generalized power series which proves to be particularly useful when the transient perturbation is small. The present result includes the ordinary small perturbation theory for finite degrees of freedom as a particular case. Several results regarding small perturbations are given in section 2. 6. The next two parts give a detailed computation on the deflection of and stresses in cantilever plates. The deflection of rectangular cantilever plates is solved both by the Rayleigh-Ritz method and the method of relaxation of boundary conditions. For swept plates the Rayleigh-Ritz method is used. A theory of stress approximation without using the intermediate deflection function is developed in Part IV, and is applied to rectangular plates. ...|$|R

The design of this anemometer, and especially the packaging aspect of the design, is intended to enable measurement of turbulence in the high-temperature, high-vibration environment of a turbine engine or in any similar environment. The main structural components of the anemometer include a single-crystal SiC cantilever and two polycrystalline SiC clamping plates, all made from chemical-vapor-deposited silicon carbide. Fabrication of these components from the same basic material eliminates thermal-expansion mismatch, which has introduced spurious thermomechanical stresses in cantilever-type anemometers of prior design. The clamping plates are heavily oxidized to improve electrical insulation at high temperature. A cavity that serves as a receptacle for the clamped end of the cantilever is etched into one end of one clamping plate. Trenches that collectively constitute a socket for a multipin electrical plug (for connection to external electronic circuitry) are etched into the opposite end of this clamping plate. Metal strips for electrical contact are deposited on one face of the other clamping plate. Piezoresistive single-crystal SiC thin-film strain gauges are etched in the n-type SiC epilayer in a Wheatstone-bridge configuration. Metal contact pads on the cantilever that extend into the clamping-receptacle area, are obtained by deposition and patterning using standard semiconductor photolithography and etching methods. The cantilever and the two clamping plates are assembled into a sandwich structure that is then clamped in a stainless-steel housing. The Wheatstone- bridge carrying SiC cantilever with the metal contact pads on the piezoresistors is slid into the receptacle in the bottom clamping plate. The top clamping plate is brought into contact with the bottom plate so that the narrow section of the metal strips on the top clamp plate aligns with the metal contact pads on the <b>cantilever.</b> When the <b>parts</b> are clamped together, the metal strips provide electrical connections between the Wheatstone-bridge contact points and the sides the trenches that constitute the socket for the multipin electrical plug. Hence, to connect the Wheatstone bridge to external circuitry for processing of the anemometer readout, one need only insert the plug in the socket. In operation, the cantilever end of the stainless-steel housing is mounted flush with an engine wall and the unclamped portion of the cantilever is exposed into the flow. The cantilever is deflected in direct proportion to the force induced by component of flow parallel to the engine wall and perpendicular to the broad exposed face of the cantilever. The maximum strain on the cantilever occurs at the clamped edge and is measured by the piezoresistors, which are located there. The corresponding changes in resistance manifest themselves in the output of the Wheatstone bridge...|$|R
