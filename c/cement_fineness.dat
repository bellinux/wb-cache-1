The effects of clinker alkali content, aggregate reactivity, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution concentration on the mortar expansion test results were also studied. In this study, high and low alkali portland cement clinkers were selected and ground with gypsum in a laboratory ball mill to three fineness levels: 300, 400, and 500 m 2 /kg (Blaine). Moderately- and highly-reactive aggregates were tested with these cements according to ASTM C 1260. In addition to the standard 1 N NaOH solution, a 0. 5 N NaOH soak solution was also used. The results show that mortar-bar expansion was promoted with increased <b>cement</b> <b>fineness</b> regardless of clinker alkali, aggregate reactivity, or soak solution normality.

The rate of hydration and most cement properties depend on the fineness of the cement particles. The research indicated that increasing <b>cement</b> <b>fineness</b> increase the rate of heat generation. The advantage of increasing the fineness is in the increase of the early age strength of cement. Previous research has indicated that for a rapid development of strength high fineness is necessary. Research indicated that an increase in fineness of cement slightly improves the workability of concrete mix, but its likely to have a detrimental effect on loss of workability as cement with a higher rate of hydration will loose workability more rapidly. In addition, excessive heat of hydration in hot dry conditions is likely to have a damaging effect and may well lead to thermal cracking unless proper curing techniques are followed, which agree with Sudan environment.

In this study the use of ground coarse gasification ash as cement extender is investigated. The effect of grinding time on the particle size distribution (PSD) of gasification ash (GA) and Portland cement (PC) clinker was investigated.

40|$|Heat of {{hydration}} is {{a property}} of Portland cement and {{a direct result}} of the chemical reaction between cement and water. The amount of heat released is dependent upon the cement mineralogical composition, curing temperature, water to cement ratio, and <b>cement</b> <b>fineness.</b> High temperature resulting from heat of hydration (thereon referred to as HOH) of cement can affect the hydration process, and consequently the kinetics of development of the mechanical properties of concrete. One of the main reasons triggering the interest in HOH of cement is its implication in thermal cracking of concrete. The high temperature gradient between the inner core and the outer surface of a concrete element is known to result in large tensile stresses that may exceed tensile strength, thus leading to early–age thermal cracking in mass concrete. This dissertation initially addresses accurately predicting the heat of HOH of Portland cement at seven days based on the heat flow data collected from isothermal calorimetry for a time interval of 0 - 84 h. This approach drastically reduces the time required to identify the seven day HOH of Portland cement. The second part of this study focuses on <b>cement</b> <b>fineness</b> and its critical role on the heat generated by Portland cement during hydration. Using a matrix of four commercially available Portland cements, representing a wide range of mineralogical composition, and subjecting each of the as-received cements to several grinding increments, a linear relationship was established between <b>cement</b> <b>fineness</b> and heat of hydration. The effect of <b>cement</b> <b>fineness</b> and mineralogical composition on HOH of Portland cement was then related through a mathematical expression to predict the HOH of Portland cement based on its mineralogical composition and fineness. Three expressions were proposed for the 1, 3 and 7 day HOH. The findings indicate that the equations developed, based on cement main phase composition and fineness, can be used to identify cements with high heat of HOH that may cause thermal cracking in mass concrete elements. Also, the equations can be used to correlate the HOH with the other properties of Portland cement for quality control and prediction of chemical and physical properties of manufactured Portland cement and concrete. Restrained shrinkage experiments results on mortar specimens prepared with cements of variable phase composition and fineness indicate that interaction of C 3 A and sulfate source is the prime phenomenon followed by <b>cement</b> <b>fineness</b> as the second main factor influencing concrete cracking. In order to minimize this effect, the third part of this study focused on studying alternatives that can lower the heat generated by concrete on hydration through the incorporation of nanomaterials; namely, graphene nanoparticles. The results indicate that incorporation of graphene a as replacement for Portland cement improves thermal diffusivity and electrical conductivity of the cement paste. Consequently, the use of graphene can trigger improvement of the thermal conductivity of concrete elements thus reducing the cracking potential of concrete. Measurements of HOH of graphene-cement paste, at w/c= 0. 5, using isothermal conduction calorimetry, indicate that incorporation of graphene up to 10 % increases the length of the induction period while reduces the magnitude of the alite main hydration peak due to the filler effect. Furthermore, increasing the w/c ratio from 0. 5 to 0. 6 and graphene content from 1 % to 10 % (as a partial replacement of cement) increases the 7 day HOH of Portland cement by 50 J/g. Isothermal conduction calorimetry heat flow curves show that incorporation of graphene particles up to 10 % does not have significant effect on interaction of aluminates and sulfates sources since the time of occurrence of the C 3 A sulfate depletion peak is not affected by graphene substitution up to 10 %. Full factorial statistical design and analysis conducted on compressive strength data of mortar specimens prepared at two w/c ratios, using cements of different finenesses and graphene content indicates that the quantity of graphene and the physical interaction due to variable w/c, graphene and <b>cement</b> <b>fineness,</b> have the smallest P-value among all the samples, representing the most significant impact on compressive strength of mortar samples. It appears that in graphene cement paste composites, addition of 1 % graphene results in 21 % reduction of Young’s modulus. Increasing the graphene content from 1 % to 5 % and/or 10 % does not show significant effect on Young’s modulus. Similar trends can be observed in the hardness of graphene cement paste samples. In conclusion, partial replacement of Portland cement with graphene nanoparticles in concrete mixtures is a good alternative to lower the cracking potential in mass concrete elements...|$|E

To this end, two criteria needed to be met; a minimum compressive strength of 20. 68 MPa (3000 psi) in no later than 12 hours, and a drying shrinkage of less than 0. 06 % at 28 days after curing. The evaluations included both air-entrained, and non-air-entrained concretes. The cement types chosen for this study included Type III and Type V Portland cement and “Rapid Set” − a Calcium Sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement. In addition, two blended concretes containing different ratios of Type V Portland cement and CSA cement were investigated. The evaluation of the studied concretes included mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strength) and transport properties (absorption, rapid chloride penetration– RCPT, rapid chloride migration– RMT, and water permeability). Additionally, dimensional stability (drying shrinkage) and durability (corrosion of steel, frost resistance, and abrasion resistance) were investigated. Evaluations were conducted based on cement type and common cement factor. Fresh property tests showed that in order to provide a comparable workability, and still remain within manufactures guideline for plasticizer, the water-to-cement ratio was adjusted for each type of cement utilized. This resulted in the need to increase the water-to-cement ratio as the Blaine <b>Fineness</b> of the <b>cement</b> type increased (0. 275 for Type V Portland cement, 0. 35 for Type III Portland cement, and 0. 4 for Rapid Set cement).

The addition of air-entrainment had beneficial effect on workability for the lower cement factors. Increasing trends for peak hydration heat were seen with increases in cement factor, <b>cement</b> Blaine <b>Fineness,</b> and accelerator dosage. Evaluation of hardened properties revealed opening times as low as 5 hours for Type V Portland cement with 2. 0 % accelerator per cement weight and further reduction in opening time by an hour when accelerator dosage was increased to 2. 8 % by cement weight. When Type III Portland cement and Rapid Set cement were used, the opening time reduced to as low as 4. 5 hours and 1 hour, respectively. The results for Type V Portland cement concretes showed that as cement factor increased so did mechanical properties until the cement factor exceeded 504 kg/m 3 (850 lb/yd 3), at which point the peak heat of hydration exceeded 46. 1 °C (115 °F) and the mechanical properties decreased. Other evaluations on the studied High Early-Age Strength Type V Portland cement concretes revealed increases in absorption, rapid chloride penetration, water permeability, drying shrinkage, corrosion resistance, and resistance to wear with increases in cement content. On the other hand, rapid chloride migration and frost resistance decreased with increasing cement factor. Increasing the accelerator dosage resulted in an increase in all properties of the HES Type V cement concretes except for frost resistance, which decreased. The addition of air-entrainment had adverse effects on compressive strength, absorption, and rapid chloride migration; while showing lower values for rapid chloride penetration. Curing had positive effects on all hardened properties of the studied HES concretes containing Type V cement. When examining the studied Type III Portland cement concretes, it was seen that an increase in cement content led to decreases in mechanical properties. It is noted that the peak heat of hydration for these concrete exceeded the threshold of 46. 1 °C (115 °F). In addition, increases in cement factor also resulted in decreases in rapid chloride migration, frost resistance and resistance to wear. Increases in cement content resulted in increases in absorption, rapid chloride penetration, water permeability, drying shrinkage, and corrosion resistance. The use of air-entrainment imparted decreases in compressive strength and rapid chloride penetration, increases in absorption, and negligible effects on rapid chloride migration. Extending curing period resulted in beneficial effects on all properties of the studied Type III cement concretes. The studied CSA cement concretes had slightly decreasing strength trends as cement content was increased. Concretes containing CSA cement produced the lowest opening time (one hour) and the highest peak hydration heats of all concretes studied. While its corrosion and frost resistance reduced as cement content increased, the absorption and rapid chloride penetration increased with increasing cement content. For drying shrinkage, opening time curing showed more volume change with increasing cement content, whereas extending curing to 24 hours and 28 days resulted in reduction of drying shrinkage. Increasing cement factor had minimal effects on water permeability and abrasion resistance. Air-entrainments reduced compressive strength, but increased absorption and rapid chloride penetration. Rapid chloride migration was found to be incompatible with CSA cements concretes. All hardened properties of the studied CSA cement concretes improved once curing age was extended to 24 hours and 28 days. When considering the results of the HES blended cement concretes, as Type V cement content increased, 28 -day compressive strength, flexural strength, drying shrinkage (opening time and 24 -hour), corrosion resistance, and resistance to wear increased. Conversely, 24 -hour compressive strength, absorption, rapid chloride penetration, 28 -day rapid chloride migration, water penetration, 28 -day drying shrinkage, and frost resistance reduced with an increase in Type V Portland cement of the High Early-Age Strength blended cement concretes. Reductions in compressive strength and absorption occurred for both studied blended cement concretes when air-entraining admixtures were used. Longer curing provided favorable results for properties of all studied blended cement concretes...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{applicability}} of the ultrasonic wave transmission method to estimate the initial setting time of an arbitrary cement paste is discussed. Ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements were fully automated and measured continuously. The Vicar Needle Test was used {{in order to determine the}} initial setting time of cement pastes. Different cement pastes were prepared in order to check the influence of the water/cement ratio, type of cement, curing temperature, <b>cement</b> <b>fineness,</b> and some clinker compositions, on the relationship between the initial setting time and ultrasonic pulse velocity. It was found that the initial setting time of an arbitrary cement paste can be estimated very accurately by the time the first inflection point appears on the ultrasonic pulse velocity curve. Moreover, it can be estimated quite accurately by the time the ultrasonic pulse velocity reaches a fixed value, close to the value of the ultrasonic pulse velocity in water...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to develop Artificial Intelligence Models to predict the 28 -days {{compressive}} strength of Portland cement (CCS). Two models, Artificial Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic were created using 4 input parameters of Portland cement that comprise both the physical and chemical characteristics. C 3 S, C 2 S, Alkali, and <b>Cement</b> <b>fineness,</b> were used as input variables to predict one outcome of compressive strength. Early strength prediction in the production process instead of waiting 28 days for the test to be completed could significantly {{improve the quality of}} the cement and reduce the cost associated with the waiting period. Data collected from literature was applied to predict the compressive strength of Portland cement. A rectangular mold of cement and water was created and kept in a temperature of 20 ??? with 90...|$|E
40|$|Curing {{techniques}} and curing duration have crucial {{effects on the}} strength and other mechanical properties of mortars. Proper curing can protect against moisture loss from fresh mixes. The objective of this experimental work {{is to examine the}} compressive strength of ordinary Portland cement mortars (OMs) under various curing regimes and <b>cement</b> <b>fineness.</b> Six different curing methods including water, air, water heated, oven heated, air-water, and water-air were applied to the specimens and also six groups of mortars were used. The results showed that the highest and lowest compressive strengths are attributed to the specimens of OPC mortar water cured using grounded OPC for duration of 6 h (OM-G 6 -wc) and OPC mortar air cured under room temperature with oven heated after demoulding of the specimens at 60 Â°C for duration of 20 h (OM-OH-ac), respectively. The maximum levels obtained of compressive strengths at 7, 28, and 90 days are 57. 5, 70. 3, and 76. 0 MPa, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA) is {{obtained}} as a by-product from cogeneration combustion boilers in sugar industries. Bagasse ash is mainly composed of reactive silica {{and can be}} used as pozzolanic material in concrete. Previous studies have reported that the utilization of SCBA as pozzolanic material in concrete can significantly improve its performance. A comprehensive investigation of durability performance of bagasse ash in concrete is not available in existing literature. In all previous studies, raw bagasse ash was ground to <b>cement</b> <b>fineness</b> and directly used in the concrete for the performance evaluation, without suitable characterization. Development of SCBA-based Portland pozzolana cement and its influence on the durability performance of concrete are discussed in this article. Durability performance was investigated by five different methods in this study. The methods used were rapid chloride penetration test (RCPT), chloride conductivity test, water sorptivity test, and Torrent air permeability test. The results from this study show that use of SCBA in concrete significantly enhances its durability performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{parameters}} affecting {{the properties of}} Portland limestone cements are investigated. Portland limestone cements of different fineness and limestone content have been produced by intergrinding clinker, gypsum and limestone. Two kinds of clinker of different chemical composition, mineralogical composition and strength development and three limestones, with different contents of calcite, dolomite, quartz and clay, have been used. It is concluded that the appropriate choice of the clinker quality, limestone quality, % limestone content and <b>cement</b> <b>fineness</b> {{can lead to the}} production of a limestone cement with the desired properties. Limestone cements, having up to 10 % limestone content and fineness up to a limit value, develop almost the same compressive strength, as the corresponding pure cements. The limestone cements, generally have lower paste water demand than the relative pure cements and the water demand decrease is mainly affected by the clinker type and limestone quality. In any case the properties of the limestone cements are affected by the interaction of the two components rather than their individual properties. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The novel {{low carbon}} scheme for {{manufacturing}} cement and concrete proposed {{in this paper}} combines three processes. First, a Portland-like cement is made at reduced temperature and cooled so that it self-pulverises to a powder of <b>cement</b> <b>fineness</b> {{without the need for}} grinding. Second, CO 2 enriched gas is extracted from the cement kiln flue, and this may be used without further refinement in a third part of the process to activate this cement (which is only poorly hydraulic) in the production of precast concrete products. Considerable energy savings are anticipated, and additional sustainability gains arise from the closed loop manufacturing process. Proof of principle has been demonstrated and a preliminary estimate made of CO 2 emission reduction: scale-up challenges are still to be addressed. The initial focus is on the production of precast concrete, where there is strong customer demand and regulatory pressure for low embodied carbon cements, together with a need for greater process efficiency. Other potential applications are foreseen in areas such as environmental engineering and non-structural concrete...|$|E
