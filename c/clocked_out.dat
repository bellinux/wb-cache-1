50|$|The {{simplest}} SSI slave interface uses a retriggerable {{monostable multivibrator}} (monoflop) {{to freeze the}} current value of the sensor. The current frozen values of the slave are stored in Shift registers. These values are <b>clocked</b> <b>out</b> sequentially when initiated by the controller. The design is being revolutionized with the integration of microcontrollers, FPGAs and ASICs into the interface.|$|E

50|$|In general, as {{mentioned}} earlier, it {{is a point}} to point connection from a master (e.g. PLC, Microcontroller) to a slave (e.g. rotary encoders). The master controls the clock sequence and the slave transmits the current data/value through a shift register. When invoked by the master, the data is <b>clocked</b> <b>out</b> from the shift register. The master and slave are synchronized by the common clock of the controller.|$|E
5000|$|In early computers, shift {{registers}} {{were used}} to handle data processing: two numbers to be added were stored in two shift registers and <b>clocked</b> <b>out</b> into an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) with the result being fed back to the input {{of one of the}} shift registers (the accumulator) which was one bit longer since binary addition can only result in an answer that is the same size or one bit longer.|$|E

50|$|Note that {{digital systems}} do not suffer {{from many of}} these effects at a signal level, though the same {{processes}} occur in the circuitry, since the data being handled is symbolic. As long as the symbol survives the transfer between components, and can be perfectly regenerated (e.g., by pulse shaping techniques) the data itself is perfectly maintained. The data is typically buffered in a memory, and is <b>clocked</b> <b>out</b> by a very precise crystal oscillator. The data usually does not degenerate as it passes through many stages, because each stage regenerates new symbols for transmission.|$|E

After a busy, uneventful evening at work, Maitland <b>clocked</b> <b>out</b> at 11:20 p.m. She told her co-workers she needed to get home and rest before working the next day at her second job in St. Albans. By all accounts Maitland was alone in her vehicle when she left.|$|E
50|$|With the {{manufacturing}} of new high power LEDs, came pulsed LED/triggered three CCD camera systems. Flashing the LED light source {{for a very}} short time span gives the full frame CCD camera a stop action of the film, allowing continuous film motion. With CCD video cameras that have a trigger input, the camera now can be electronically synced up to the film transport framing. There are now a number of retail and home made Pulsed LED/triggered camera systems. An array of high-power multiple red, green and blue LEDs is pulsed just as the film frame is positioned in front of the optical lens. The camera sends the single, non-interlaced image of the film frame to a digital frame store, where the electronic picture is <b>clocked</b> <b>out</b> at the selected TV frame rate for PAL or NTSC or other standard. More advanced systems replace the sprocket wheel with laser or camera based perf detection and image stabilization system.|$|E

5000|$|Next to Duncan, {{several other}} gold miners took {{claims in the}} area of Skippers Point where they {{remained}} working on them until the early 1900s. The remains of their water races, holding dams, sluicings and tailings of the established claims are still obvious today. A huge sluiced basin of the Skippers Sluicing Company's claim, right below Mount Aurum Station's Homestead and Skippers School, is very much visible today, even though it is completely covered by trees. Like Charlestown, Skippers Point had an initial population of about 1,000 people but stabilised to about 200 around 1864. At one stage, there were six hotels at Skippers Point, but like Charlestown, their life was short. Today, only the Mount Aurum Station's Homestead and Skippers School as well as the cemetery are visible. This cemetery contains some interesting headstones. Of more recent times is the delightful inscription on the grave of Lorraine Borrell: [...] "my time is up, Iâ€™ve been <b>clocked</b> <b>out.</b> The judge has tapped the gavel.

30|$|Three {{different}} handshake modes {{handling the}} trigger/busy signals are available, {{one of them}} being the no-handshake mode, in which the TLU issues a fixed-length pulse on the trigger line with the busy line being disregarded. In simple handshake mode, the assertion of a trigger is replied by the integrated DAQ systems by asserting a signal on the busy line. The TLU then de-asserts the trigger and waits for the busy line going low. The trigger data handshake mode uses the same scheme as in the simple handshake mode, but additionally the current trigger data are transferred on the trigger line: after the trigger has been de-asserted, the trigger number is <b>clocked</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{four-channel}} magnet-power-supply ramp controller {{has been}} designed and deployed at the new ALPHA (Advanced Electron Photon Facility) at the Indiana University Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter (IUCEEM). The first application is a power-supply controller.
