5|$|During {{the race}} to develop an oral polio vaccine several large scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had {{determined}} that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest. Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one {{million people in the}} Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). The results of these human trials have been controversial, and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses have, however, have been conclusively refuted. By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> evolved due to lack of adequate information, often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility. The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.|$|E

Several Brown-organized <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> {{been studied}} for their effectiveness; {{these include the}} effort to secure the {{confirmation}} of Judge Clarence Thomas, and the independent campaigns against Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton. The anti-Dukakis effort produced the famous “Willie Horton” commercial.|$|E
25|$|Many of the <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> {{focused on}} large corporations. Fast food {{companies}} such as KFC, Wendy's, and Burger King have been targeted. In the animal-testing industry, PETA's consumer boycotts have focused on Avon, Benetton, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Chesebrough-Pond's, Dow Chemical, General Motors, and others. The group's modus operandi includes buying shares in target {{companies such as}} McDonald's and Kraft Foods in order to exert influence. The <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> delivered results for PETA. McDonald's and Wendy's introduced vegetarian options after PETA targeted them; Petco stopped selling some exotic pets; and Polo Ralph Lauren said {{it would no longer}} use fur. Avon, Estée Lauder, Benetton, and Tonka Toy Co. all stopped testing products on animals, the Pentagon stopped shooting pigs and goats in wounds tests, and a slaughterhouse in Texas was closed down.|$|E

25|$|Anti-corruption {{efforts have}} been on the agenda of {{successive}} Chinese leaders, though the effectiveness of these <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> varied.
