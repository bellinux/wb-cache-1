40|$|International audienceThe {{estimation}} of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial equipments {{can be realized}} on their most critical components. Based on this assumption, the identified critical component must be monitored to track its health state during its operation. Then, the acquired data are processed to extract relevant features, which are used for RUL estimation. This paper presents an evaluation method for the goodness of the features, extracted from raw monitoring signals, for health assessment and prognostics of <b>critical</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>components.</b> The evaluation method is applied to several simulated datasets as well as features obtained from a particular application on bearings...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSome {{technical}} aspects of two Spanish cooperation projects, funded by DPI and Innpacto Programs of the R&D National Plan, are discussed. The objective is to analyze the common belief about than the ultrasonic testing in MHz range is not a tool utilizable to detect internal flaws in highly attenuating pieces made of coarse-grained steel. In fact high-strength steels, used in some safe industrial infrastructures of energy & transport sectors, are difficult to be inspected using the conventional “state of the art” in ultrasonic technology, due to their internal microstructures are very attenuating and coarse-grained. It is studied if this inspection difficulty could be overcome by finding intense interrogating pulses and advanced signal processing of the acquired echoes. A possible solution would depend on drastically improving signal-to-noise-ratios, by applying new advances on: ultrasonic transduction, HV electronics for intense pulsed driving of the testing probes, and an “ad-hoc” digital processing or focusing of the received noisy signals, in function of each material to be inspected. To attain this challenging aim on robust steel pieces would open the possibility of obtaining improvements in inspecting <b>critical</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>components</b> made of highly attenuating & dispersive materials, as new composites in aeronautic and motorway bridges, or new metallic alloys in nuclear area, where additional testing limitations often appear...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{emerging}} technologies {{contains some}} of the most prominent ongoing advances, innovations and developments in a variety of engineering field to advance surface property by using modern technology. Because for higher productivity and efficiency across the entire spectrum of manufacturing and engineering industries has ensured that most modern day components/ parts are subjected to day by day increasing harsh environments in routine operations. All the <b>Critical</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>components</b> of the machines are, therefore, prone to more rapid degradation as the parts fail to withstand the aggressive operating conditions and this has been affecting the industry’s economy to a very high extent. The prime objectives are to develop essential surface properties with an economical process. Today the investigation explores the coating potential of industrial wastes. Fly-ash emerges as a major waste from thermal power plants. It mainly comprises of oxides of iron, aluminium, titanium and silicon along with some other minor constituents. Fly-ash premixed with illmenite and quartz which are minerals of low cost available in plenty are excellent for providing protection against resistant to erosion and abrasive wear. In this wide research world Plasma spraying is gaining acceptance for development of quality coatings of various materials {{on a wide range of}} substrates. Use of the industrial wastes of such kind as coating material minimizes the plasma spray coating deposition cost, which posed to be the major obstacle to the wide spread purpose due to high cost of the spray grade powders. Fly-ash+quartz+illmenite (weight percentage ratio: 55 : 25 : 20) is deposited on copper and mild steel substrates by atmospheric plasma spraying, at operating power levels ranging from 10 to 20 kW and after that characterization of the coatings is carried out. The properties/ quality of the coatings depend on the operating condition, process parameters and materials used. The plasma spraying process is controlled by interdependent parameter, co-relations and individual effect on coating characteristics. The size of the particles of raw material used for coating is characterized using Malvern Instruments a Laser particle size analyzer. Coating interface adhesion strength is calculated using a method of coating pull, confirming to ASTM C- 633 standard. Deposition efficiency is a key factor that determines the techno economics of the process, evaluated for the deposited coatings. Coating thickness of the polished cross section is measured, using an optical microscope...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{crack growth}} is {{dependent}} on material properties and loading parameters. <b>Critical</b> areas of <b>industrial</b> <b>components</b> are often subjected to complex stresses, either because multiaxial loads are applied or because residual stresses {{are present in the}} material. In plane stresses are taken into account through mode I, II and III stress intensity factors. Out of plane stresses are usually not included in fatigue crack growth models. However, experimental evidences of the influence of out-of plane stresses on fatigue crack growth are reported in the literature. This paper is centered {{on the role of the}} T-stress during mode I fatigue crack growth. The effect of a T-stress on fatigue crack growth is studied through its effect on crack tip blunting. As a matter of fact, fatigue crack growth is characterized by the presence of striations on the fracture surface, which implies that the crack grows by a mechanism of blunting and re-sharpening. From a mechanical point of view, this means that forward and reverse plasticity occurs within the crack tip plastic zone. The presence of a T-stress modifies significantly the evolution of plastic deformation at crack tip and thus plastic blunting. In the present study, crack tip blunting is a global scalar variable, which is calculated using the finite element method as the average value of the permanent displacement of the crack faces over the whole K-dominance area. Experimental measurements have also been conducted using cross-correlation of image...|$|R

But also explicit bindings between component interfaces and component implementations can be defined. A type system for components is introduced enabling a formal definition of exchangeability and interoperability of components. Using this type system, tools are able to decide which components may be exchanged by others and which components fit together. They can also support the creation of new components from existing ones by checking a new assembly for consistency...|$|R
