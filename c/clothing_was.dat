5|$|<b>Clothing</b> <b>was</b> {{historically}} {{made from}} woven raffia. The fibers would be combed into strands that were knotted {{together to form}} cords, which were then woven into panels. These panels were stitched together to create prayer rugs and clothing. Women and men historically wore long raffia smocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of silk through sericulture was profitable for both small-time farmers and large-scale producers. Silk <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> {{too expensive for}} the poor, who wore clothes most commonly made of hemp. The rural women usually wove all the family's clothes.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Ming style <b>{{clothing}}</b> <b>was</b> {{forced on}} Vietnamese {{people by the}} Nguyễn dynasty. The tunics and trouser clothing of the Han Chinese on the Ming and Qing tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. However, Han-Chinese clothing is assembled by several pieces of clothing including both pants and skirts called Qun (裙) or chang (裳) which {{is a part of}} Hanfu garments throughout the history of Han Chinese clothing. The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were close fitting and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. The Chinese clothing in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn. The Chinese Ming dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Han dynasty <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> referred to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (Nguyen The Tong). Chinese clothing started influencing Vietnamese dress in the Ly dynasty. The current Ao Dai was introduced by the Nguyen Lords.|$|E

5|$|Desha {{continued}} on to San Antonio, where {{he lost a}} substantial amount of money playing Monte Bank. He decided to return to San Felipe. Meeting two Americans and a Mexican cigar maker travelling that way, with their permission, he traveled with them. After his return to San Felipe, the citizens began to suspect Desha of murdering Early. A few days after Desha's arrival, Early's <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> found in a nearby creek. Scattered nearby, a search party located skeletal remains believed to be Early's.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, food and <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> brought to towns isolated by the storm. In Culiacán, churches, schools, and a baseball stadium served as temporary shelters for displaced persons. Rescue workers also searched for bodies of victims of both Lidia and the subsequent Hurricane Norma, which hit the same area a few days later. Due to the damage wrought by both Lidia and Norma, the Governor of Sinaloa, Antonio Toledo Corro, declared his state a disaster area. He also asked the Mexican Federal Government for aid.|$|E
5|$|Durran's costumes {{also helped}} emphasise social {{rank among the}} {{different}} characters; Caroline Bingley for instance is introduced in an empire silhouetted dress, clothing that would have then been {{at the height of}} fashion. During her interview, Durran opined that all the women wear white at the Netherfield Ball due to its contemporary popularity, an idea that Wright credits as his reason for hiring her. All of the costumes were handmade, as <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> at the time. However, costumes and hairstyles were adjusted to appeal to contemporary audiences, sacrificing historical accuracy.|$|E

50|$|Many {{kinds of}} <b>clothing</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} to be ironed before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> in this category (for example, dress shirts and suits). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> permanent press, having been treated with a coating (such as polytetrafluoroethylene) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.|$|R

5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It {{was the color of}} the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's blood-stained shirt, tie {{and jacket}} {{are now in}} the {{possession}} of the Los Angeles County District Attorney. Controversy arose in 2010 when Kennedy's <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> transported to the California Homicide Investigators Association conference in Las Vegas, where they were included in a temporary public display of never-before-seen artifacts from crime scenes related to prolific serial killers and infamous murders, such as the Black Dahlia murder and the killing of Hollywood actress Sharon Tate. The items and Kennedy's clothing were subsequently removed from the exhibit, with the LAPD apologizing to the Kennedy family.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE regular {{commerce}} began between the Romans and Asia, marked by the Roman appetite for silk cloth coming from the Far East, which was then resold to the Romans by the Parthians. The Roman Senate {{tried in vain to}} prohibit the wearing of silk, for economic reasons as well as moral ones. The import of Chinese silk resulted in vast amounts of gold leaving Rome, {{to such an extent that}} silk <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> perceived as a sign of decadence and immorality.|$|E

5|$|Bezen Perrot enacted {{operations}} in January 1944. It was initially employed on guard and surveillance duty around German installations. It {{took part in}} the arrests of Jews, Service du travail obligatoire evaders and resistance fighters. Their knowledge of the Breton language proved to be a prized possession, enabling the German authorities to intercept arms drops and infiltrate Breton resistance networks who used it to encode their communications. In March, their civilian <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> replaced with the uniforms of Waffen-SS, lacking any Breton insignia and they were armed with submachine guns, operating in conjunction with the French collaborationist Selbstschutz Polizei.|$|E
5|$|Director Colin Campbell was {{concerned}} with the film's realism. He had sets constructed to represent the streets of Cairo, Baghdad, and Damascus, and used animals from the Selig Zoo. Scenes set in the Arabian and Sahara Deserts were filmed in the deserts of California. The Arab characters' <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> genuine, and the actors portraying those roles were required to remain dressed in-character throughout the several days of desert filming to ensure they would appear more natural in the imported garments. Much of the film, including the desert scenes, was hand tinted. Production costs exceeded $35,000, the equivalent of over $ in present-day terms.|$|E
5|$|In a status-conscious society {{like that}} of the Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> supposed to reflect a society in good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E

5|$|One day at harvest time, {{according}} to William of Newburgh {{during the reign}} of King Stephen (1135–1154), the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children, a brother and sister, beside one of the wolf pits that gave the village its name. Their skin was green, they spoke an unknown language, and their <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> unfamiliar. Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne. Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came across some raw broad beans, which they consumed eagerly. The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour. The boy, who appeared to be the younger of the two, became sickly and died shortly after he and his sister were baptised.|$|E
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} {{the food}} that one consumed and the clothes that one wore according to status and social class. <b>Clothing</b> <b>was</b> made of hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants might choose to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. <b>Clothing</b> <b>was</b> made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and {{both men and women}} of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
50|$|In Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism, {{a useful}} {{distinction}} between liturgical vestments and clerical <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> that vestments {{are required to}} be blessed before being worn. Conversely, clerical <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> not, and is regarded as daily wear.|$|R

5|$|The driver's <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> {{color-coded}} {{in accordance}} with his faction, which would help distant spectators {{to keep track of}} the race's progress. According to Tertullian, there were originally just two factions, White and Red, sacred to winter and summer respectively. As fully developed, there were four factions, the Red, White, Green, and Blue. Each team could have up to three chariots each in a race. Members of the same team often collaborated with each other against the other teams, for example to force them to crash into the spina (a legal and encouraged tactic). Drivers could switch teams, much like athletes can be traded to different teams today.|$|E
5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short fatigue and dress cap that was easy to manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its drawbacks, however. It provided little weather protection, and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of hard wear. The Infantryman design cap was sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown cap, with or without the branch of service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were trimmed in red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the much}} darker tone of Final Fantasy XIII-2 {{compared}} to its predecessor, Kamikokuryo decided on surrealism {{as the main}} theme for the graphics. The works of Salvador Dalí and Giorgio de Chirico were used as visual references and helped Kamikokuryo {{strike a balance between}} photorealism and fantasy-like surrealism. Unlike Final Fantasy XIII, the game had a much tighter schedule allowing for little pre-production. Kamikokuryo hence used photographs instead of self-drawn pictures to explain his setting ideas to the other staff members. For example, a photograph of ruined buildings in the Cuban capital Havana inspired the look of Valhalla. Character design duties were split up: Nomura designed the faces of the new and returning main characters while their <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> done by other artists. Kamikokuryo drew the final version of Lightning based on a silhouette sketch and suggestions by Nomura. Yusuke Naora took charge of Serah's, Noel's and Caius' costumes, while Hideo Minaba worked on Yeul, Alyssa and the adult version of Hope in the same capacity. Mog was designed by Toshitaka Matsuda after he had received a request for a cute and mascot-like Moogle character.|$|E

50|$|The {{general rule}} is {{that the cost of}} <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> {{deductible}} as a business expense only if: (1) the <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> of a type specifically required as a condition of employment, (2) it is not adaptable to general usage as ordinary clothing, and (3) it is not so worn. The court held that the question of whether <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> adaptable to general usage is to be approached with an objective test, rejecting the subjective test employed by the tax court below.|$|R
