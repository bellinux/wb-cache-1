40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in evaluating RC structures is estimating the strength of beam-column joints under cyclic loading. This {{is due to the}} lack of a clear formula to rely on. Behavior of the <b>cyclically</b> <b>loaded</b> beam-column joints is very complex and several mechanisms control it. Furthermore, several parameters are known to have significant effect on the shear capacity of the joint namely: joint shear reinforcement, concrete compressive strength, joint aspect ratio and column axial stress. The contribution of each of these parameters noticeably varies for each of the proposed formulae in the literature. This paper aims to evaluate some of the existing joint shear capacity formulae of <b>cyclically</b> <b>loaded</b> joints per ACI and AIJ, and subsequently optimize these formulae using genetic algorithms technique (GAs).

40|$|Apoptosis (programmed cell death) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a histopathologic feature of tendinopathy. While the precise mechanism(s) that triggers the apoptotic cascade in tendon cells has not been identified, it has been theorized that loss of cellular homeostatic tension following microscopic damage to individual tendon fibrils could be the stimulus for initiating the pathologic events associated with tendinopathy. To determine if loss of homeostatic tension following stress deprivation could induce apoptosis in tendon cells, rat tail tendons were stress-deprived or <b>cyclically</b> <b>loaded</b> (3 % strain at 0. 17  Hz) for 24  hours under tissue culture conditions. Caspase- 3 (an upstream mediator of apoptosis) mRNA expression was evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and caspase- 3 protein synthesis was identified using immunohistochemistry. Apoptotic cells were identified histologically using an antibody for single-stranded DNA. Stress deprivation for 24  hours resulted in an increase in caspase- 3  mRNA expression when compared to fresh controls or <b>cyclically</b> <b>loaded</b> tendons. Stress deprivation also increased the percentage of apoptotic cells (10. 59 % ±  2. 80) compared to controls (1. 87 % ±  1. 07) or <b>cyclically</b> <b>loaded</b> tendons (3. 73 % ±  0. 87).

40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study on the}} fine {{structural}} distortion due to the two previously observed types of degradation in <b>cyclically</b> <b>loaded</b> single osteons (i. e., stiffness degradation and pinching effect) are presented. Fully calcified longitudinal and alternate osteons were isolated from 350 -μm-thick longitudinal sections of human femoral cortical bone. The samples were prepared from 500 -μm-long central cylindrical portions of an osteon, whose two ends were penetrating into rectangular lugs for fixation to an electromechanical device that <b>cyclically</b> <b>loaded</b> the samples. This device was connected to a microwave micrometer and a recorder. The structural distortions induced by cyclic loading were investigated by high- and low-angle X-ray diffraction on conventional and synchrotron radiation sources. Cyclic loading results in a reduction in the degree of orientation of apatite crystallites, especially in longitudinal osteons, in which the most abundant longitudinal lamellae are not protected against buckling by transverse lamellae as they are in alternate osteons. In contrast, the degree of orientation of collagen fibrils {{does not seem to be}} affected by cycling loading in the two osteon types, possibly because the disorientation of collagen fibrils is, within limits, a reversible process. Finally, the contrast between the disorientation of inorganic crystallites and the apparently unaltered distribution of collagen fibrils suggests that the degradation of <b>cyclically</b> <b>loaded</b> osteons may be due to a separation of the crystallites from the fibrils...|$|E

To better understand the behavior of cohesive soils subjected to cyclic loading, beginning in early 1960 's, a rather substantial body of experimental work has been performed. This has involved different types of soils, tested at different values of overconsolidation ratio, and subjected to different cyclic loading histories. This paper compiles the most important findings of the aforementioned experimental work on cohesive soils.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Devices that arepinned to the tibia to tensionananterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) graft produce joint reaction loads {{that in turn}} can affect themaintenance of graft initial tension after tibial fixation and hence knee anterior–posterior (AP) load-displacement. However, {{the effect of these}} devices on AP load-displacement is unknown. Our objectives were to determine whether tensioning by device versus tensioning by hand causes differences in AP load-displacement and intraarticular graft tension for two commonly used tibial fixation devices: a bioresorbable interference screw and a WasherLoc. AP load-displacement and intraarticular graft tension were measured in 20 cadaveric knees using a custom arthrometer. An initial tension of 110 Nwas applied to a double-looped tendon graftwith theknee at extensionusing a tensioning device pinned to the tibia and a simulatedmethod of tensioning by hand.

Unidirectional, 24 -ply specimens of S 2 /SP 250 glass/epoxy were tested using Kapton inserts of four different thickness - 13, 25, 75, and 130 microns, at the midplane at one end, or with tension or shear precracks, to simulate an initial delamination. To determine G(sub c), the fatigue fracture threshold below which no delamination growth would occur in less than 1 x 10 (exp 6) cycles, fatigue {{tests were conducted}} by <b>cyclically</b> <b>loading</b> specimens until delamination growth was detected. Consistent values of model 1 fracture toughness, G(sub Ic), were measured from DCB specimens with inserts of thickness 75 microns or thinner, or with shear precracks. The fatigue DCB tests gave similar values of G(sub Ith) for the 13, 25, and 75 microns specimens. Results for the shear precracked specimens were significantly lower that for specimens without precracks. Results for both the static and fatigue ENF tests showed that measured G(IIc) and G(IIth) values decreased with decreasing insert thickness, so that no limiting thickness could be determined.

40|$|It {{is a well}} {{established}} experimental fact that slippage of reinforcement may sometimes {{play an important role}} in the response of <b>cyclically</b> <b>loaded</b> reinforced concrete (RC) structures, especially in cases of beam-column subassemblages. In the past, analyses with 2 D plane or 3 D solid finite elements that assume a nonlinear bond-slip relationship to describe an arbitrary response of the interface have only been performed using elements connecting concrete nodes with discrete reinforcement nodes. This modeling exhibits restrictions in the bar topology, which can be removed only with embedded reinforcement formulations. In the present work, a 3 D solid element, based on a simple smeared crack one-parameter model that describes concrete's triaxial stress-strain behavior is extended for cases of <b>cyclically</b> <b>loaded</b> RC structures, allowing embedded reinforcement slippage. This modeling is combined with an existing bond-slip mathematical description to give stable numerical results.

40|$|Expansion {{joints and}} {{bearings}} of conventional bridges are easily damaged and this commonly incurs high maintenance costs. The {{concept of the}} integral bridge was to reduce the maintenance costs by removing those joints. However, the thermally induced expansion-contraction of the bridge superstructure is transferred through the integral bridge’s abutments {{due to lack of}} expansion joints. Seasonal thermal cyclic displacement of the integral abutment <b>cyclically</b> <b>loads</b> the bridge backfill material. It has been observed that the lateral earth pressure behind an integral abutment increases {{as a result of the}} cyclic loading. Previous studies attribute this increase in lateral pressure to the densification of the backfill material. Granular flow was suggested to have occurred displacing the particles to form a denser and therefore stiffer matrix. An alternative suggestion was that the particles reoriented to form a stiffer matrix that wasn’t necessarily denser. The objective of this research is to explore the behaviour of integral abutment backfill at a micromechanical level by utilising the discrete element method (DEM) and possibly verify these suggested causes of earth pressure build-up behind an integral abutment. DEM models of four granular materials consisting of different particle shapes were tested with 100 cycles of strain. The results indicate that densification occurred for all samples, but the build-up of horizontal pressure did not occur for the more rounded samples. It was further suggested that the particle shape in combination with the change in coordination number closely replicate the behaviour of the sample’s horizontal stress. Particle reorientation and displacements were observed to be small for samples of non-circular particles. Particle activity is concentrated in the smallest particles within the material. It is concluded that the build-up of horizontal stress is caused by the increase in particle contacts due to particle reorientation and not densification.

40|$|Objective: Despite new {{developments}} in the management of osteoporotic fractures, complications like screw cutout are still found in the fixation of proximal femur fractures even with biomechanically proven better implants like proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). The purpose of this cadaveric study was to investigate the biomechanical stability of this device in relation to two common positions (center-center and inferior-center) of the helical blade in the femoral head in unstable trochanteric fractures. Materials and Methods: Eight pairs of human cadaveric femurs were used; in one group [center-center (C-C) group], the helical blade of PFNA was fixed randomly in central position both in anteroposterior and lateral view, whereas in the other group it was fixed in inferior one-third position in anteroposterior and in central position in lateral view [inferior-center (I-C) group]. Unstable intertrochanteric fracture was created and each specimen was <b>loaded</b> <b>cyclically</b> till <b>load</b> to failure Results: Angular and rotational displacements were significantly higher within the C-C group compared to the I-C group in both unloaded and loaded condition. Loading to failure was higher in the I-C group compared to the C-C group. No statistical significance was found for this parameter. Correlations between tip apex distance, cyclic loading which lead to femoral head displacement, and ultimate load to failure showed a significant positive relationship. Conclusion: The I-C group was superior to the C-C group and provided better biomechanical stability for angular and rotational displacement.

The qualitative study concentrated on observing the impact on resin strength of varying electrolyte concentrations and varying di-vinyl benzene contents, during the loading phase. The phenomenon of osmotic shock in addition to resin cracking and swelling is clearly observed. A further qualitative study bore out the change in resin rigidity as the resin is artificially degraded through repeated loadings and regenerations performed by using a specially constructed device that <b>cyclically</b> <b>loads</b> and regenerates resin up to 1000 times in a three week period. Loss of resin rigidity was observed under these circumstances and was measured by means of observing changes in degree of swelling/contraction and changes in translucence. Quantitative study of the resin was limited to its characterisation through measurement of the equilibrium through the Mass-Action Law, capacity and resin kinetics. A study, of existing kinetic rigorous modelling methods {{and in particular the}} extensively published challenge of the multiple mechanism adsorption process, was undertaken. A rigorous model, that divorces the external and internal mass-transport parameters from the traditionally utilised lumped parameter, is proposed. All kinetic measurements were performed in a 1 litre closed circuit (finite system) consisting of a variable-pump, a five mL zero length column (ZLC) and a reservoir, allowing for the insertion of probes and sample extraction. An original method of model simulation for the purposes of fitting to kinetic data was developed and consists of determining the resin surface concentration from flux data assuming the applicability of Newton's Law of Cooling to the ionic flux through the external laminar layer. Simulation of flux inside the resin was achieved by assuming an internal homogeneous environment and the applicability of the Nernst-Plank equation that combines transport effects of both Fick's Law of Diffusion and inter-ion electrical forces to the flux of both the adsorbing and desorbing ions simultaneously, during the transient adsorption process...|$|R
