40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a different approach}} of previously reported method to determine absorption and emission cross-sections (σa and σe), and dopant concentration in Erbium doped optical fibers (EDOFs) with low background loss (α). We call this new method as variant input single <b>cutback</b> <b>method</b> (VISCM). There is technical similarity between VISCM and conventional <b>cutback</b> <b>method</b> (CCM) for determination of cross-sections, but in former pump and signal powers are not used together. We numerically verify the effect of different parameters such as input power, background loss, and EDOF amplifier cutback length on the cross-sections using VISCM and CCM. We also present the simulation results of maximum gain and optimum length using obtained cross-sections by two methods. We show that the VISCM presents more accuracy than that of CCM in any conditions. In the presence of α, both CCM and VISCM give not actual but pseudo values for the σa and σe. Using pseudo parameters values obtained by VISCM for α < 10 dB/km, the error of maximum gain and optimum length of designed EDOF is shown negligible...|$|E

40|$|An all-solid microstructured fiber {{based on}} two thermallymatched {{silicate}} glasses with a high index contrast has been fabricated for the first time. The microstructured cladding was shown to be essentially unchanged during fiber drawing. Fiber attenuation was measured as 5 dB/m at 1. 55 µm by the <b>cutback</b> <b>method.</b> High nonlinearity 230 W- 1 km- 1 has been predicted and experimentally demonstrated in this fiber at 1. 55 µm. In addition, modeling predicts that near-zero dispersion can be achieved between 1. 5 - 1. 6 µm in this class of high nonlinear fiber...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a direct fault {{tolerant}} control (DFTC) technique, where by "direct" we mean that no explicit fault identification is used. The technique will be presented for the attitude controller (autopilot) for a reusable launch vehicle (RLV), although in principle it {{can be applied to}} many other applications. Any partial or complete failure of control actuators and effectors will be inferred from saturation of one or more commanded control signals generated by the controller. The saturation causes a reduction in the effective gain, or bandwidth of the feedback loop, which can be modeled as an increase in singular perturbation in the loop. In order to maintain stability, the bandwidth of the nominal (reduced-order) system will be reduced proportionally according to the singular perturbation theory. The presented DFTC technique automatically handles momentary saturations and integrator windup caused by excessive disturbances, guidance command or dispersions under normal vehicle conditions. For multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems with redundant control effectors, such as the RLV attitude control system, an algorithm is presented for determining the direction of bandwidth <b>cutback</b> using the <b>method</b> of minimum-time optimal control with constrained control {{in order to maintain the}} best performance that is possible with the reduced control authority. Other bandwidth cutback logic, such as one that preserves the commanded direction of the bandwidth or favors a preferred direction when the commanded direction cannot be achieved, is also discussed. In this extended abstract, a simplistic example is proved to demonstrate the idea. In the final paper, test results on the high fidelity 6 -DOF X- 33 model with severe dispersions will be presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a silicon photonic platform using thin buried oxide silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates using localized substrate removal. We show high confinement silicon strip waveguides, micro-ring resonators and nanotapers using this technology. Propagation losses for the waveguides using the <b>cutback</b> <b>method</b> are 3. 88 dB/cm for the quasi-TE mode and 5. 06 dB/cm for the quasi-TM mode.

Different laser powers and scan rates were employed and optimized to avoid surface ablation. The best results were obtained at a laser power of 95 mW {{and at a}} scan speed of 10 mm/min, where a refractive index change of 1. 5 × 10 − 3 was estimated and an attenuation loss of 3. 3 dB/cm was measured using the <b>cutback</b> <b>method.</b> A morphological investigation of the glass end facets was performed {{in order to assess}} the surface effect of the laser exposure...|$|E

The fabrication of Nd, Yb and Yb/Er doped phosphate glasses will be reported together with the characterization of their thermal and optical properties.

Preform fabrication by means of rotational casting will be discussed and compared to traditional rod in tube technique in particular regarding the interfaces between core and 1 st cladding and between 1 st and 2 nd cladding.

40|$|The modal {{content of}} 7 and 19 cell Kagomé anti {{resonant}} hollow core fibers (K-ARF) with hypocycloid core surrounds is experimentally investigated through the spectral and spatial (S 2) imaging technique. It is {{observed that the}} 7 and 19 cell K-ARF reported here, support 4 and 7 LP mode groups respectively, however the observation that K-ARF support few mode groups {{is likely to be}} ubiquitous to 7 and 19 cell K-ARFs. The transmission loss of the higher order modes (HOMs) was measured via S 2 and a <b>cutback</b> <b>method.</b> In the 7 cell K-ARF it is found that the LP 11 and LP 21 modes have approximately 3. 6 and 5. 8 times the loss of the fundamental mode (FM), respectively. In the 19 cell it is found that the LP 11 mode has approximately 2. 6 times the loss of the FM, while the LP 02 mode has approximately 2. 6 times the loss of the FM. Additionally, bend loss in these fibers is studied for the first time using S 2 to reveal the effect of bend on modal content. Our measurements demonstrate that K-ARFs support a few mode groups and indicate that the differential loss of the HOMs is not substantially higher than that of the FM, and that bending the fiber does not induce significant inter modal coupling. A study of three different input beam coupling configurations demonstrates increased HOM content and a non-Gaussian profile of the output beam if poor mode field matching is achieved. </span...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} original nanostructured optical fibers based on the SiO 2 -SnO 2 -(Yb 3 +) system. Two different processes have been developed and compared: the sol-gel chemical method associated to the " inverse dip-coating " (IDC) and the " powder in tube " (PIT) process. The microstructural and optical properties of the fibers are studied according to the concentration of SnO 2. X-Ray Diffraction as well as Transmission Electron Microscopy studies show that SnO 2 crystallizes into the cassiterite phase as nanoparticles with a diameter ranging from 4 to 50 nm {{as a function of}} tin oxide concentration. A comparative study highlights a better conservation of SnO 2 into the fiber core with the PIT approach according to the refractive index profile and X-Ray analysis measurement. The attenuation evaluated by the classic <b>cutback</b> <b>method</b> gives respectively values higher than 3 dB/m and 0. 2 dB/m in the visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) range for the PIT fiber whereas background losses reach 0. 5 dB/m in the VIS range for IDC fibers. The introduction of ytterbium ions into the core of PIT fibers, directly in the first chemical step, leads to a laser emission (between 1050 and 1100 nm) according to the fiber length under 850 nm wavelength pumping. Luminescence studies have demonstrated the influence of the tin oxide nanostructure on the rare earth optical properties especially by the modification of the absorption (850 to 1000 nm) and emission (950 to 1100 nm) by discretization of the bands, {{as well as on the}} IR emission lifetime evaluated to 10 µs...|$|E
40|$|The Russian Federal Nuclear Center-All Russian Research Institute of Technical Physics, {{located in}} the Nuclear City of Snezhinsk, east of the Ural {{mountains}} and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories have been investigating the possibility of establishing a commercial optical fiber manufacturing facility. These discussions began {{in the summer of}} 1998. At that time three samples (single mode and multi-mode) of optical fiber were left at the Sandia National Laboratory. Sandia measured two of the segments and sent them to LLNL. The optical loss at 1550 nm and 1300 nm were higher than commercially available fiber. The measurements were complicated because the geometry of the fibers also did not meet specification. Since the core was not adequately centered coupling of optical energy into the fiber being tested varied widely depending on which end of the fiber was used for insertion. The results of these measurements were summarized in the informal report dated June 11, 1999, which was hand carried by Dr. Paul Herman during his July 1999 visit. During the July visit a 1. 2 -km long section of graded-index multimode fiber, ITF 47, was given to Herman. We had requested samples longer than the earlier ones (which were {approx} 0. 1 km long) in order that a <b>cutback</b> <b>method</b> could be used for the transmission measurements. The optical loss using the cutback technique and the transmission spectral measurements in the 600 - 1700 mn region are reported. Also physical measurements are reported of the fiber's diameter, concentricity, ellipticity and tensile strength (proof test). The test results are summarized in Table 1, ''Comparative Data for Multi-mode Optical Fiber. '' The table includes the values from the Industrial specification TIA/EIA 402 AAAB, the commercial specification for Corning's 50 / 125 CPC 6, the values measured on ITF- 47 and provided by C- 70, and LLNL's values for ITF- 47 as well as the multimode values from the June 1999 samples...|$|E
40|$|Fibers {{and fiber}} lasers {{are widely used}} in {{photonics}} {{as well as in}} medical applications. Hence, research on fiber lasers utilizing glasses activated with rare-earth (RE) ions has been of great interest. One of the most studied fiber laser glass is Erbium-doped silicate glasses. However, low solubility of Er 3 + ions in silicate glasses results in Er−Er cluster formation for higher concentrations. Phosphate glasses are able to accommodate a larger amount of rare earth dopants compared to silicate glasses because of their two dimensional structure, which makes these glasses prospective candidates for different applications ranging from telecommunication systems, upconverters, fibers, optical amplifiers and solid-state lasers. In this thesis, we explored the possibility of using RE-doped phosphate-based glasses for planar waveguides and fiber lasers. Er 3 + and Yb 3 + codoped phosphate glasses were prepared using melt quenching method with different concentration of ZnO and Y 2 O 3 and these glasses were optimized for thin film deposition and fiber drawing. From the thermal properties of the glasses, all the investigated glasses are expected to have a good thermal stability against crystallization which is a crucial property when depositing the glass into films and also when drawing it into fiber. The changes in the structural properties induced by the changes in the glass composition were studied with infrared and Raman spectroscopies. Based on the optical and luminescence properties of the glasses, the RE sites are not expected to be strongly affected by the change in the glass composition. The glass with composition (49 P 2 O 5 - 39. 2 SrO- 9. 8 Na 2 O- 0. 5 Er 2 O 3 - 1. 5 Yb 2 O 3) (in mol%) was selected for film deposition and preform casting. Thin film was deposited using e-beam evaporation. However, films contained no heavier RE atoms and they suffered serious spallation and delamination upon aging. Nevertheless, single core fiber with a 115 µm diameter was successfully drawn from a 10 cm long preform with 1 cm diameter. Losses were estimated using <b>cutback</b> <b>method</b> and found to be 0. 1 – 0. 4 dB·cm- 1 at 700 nm. Emission spectra from fiber showed a broadband centered at 1. 5 µm and the bandwidth measured greater than 70 nm. The broad luminescence source is highly demanded in several applications such as LIDAR or optical coherence tomography. The spectral hole-burning effect was observed in the phosphate fiber with the length exceeding 3 cm, which could be interesting for ultra-high density optical data storage...|$|E
30|$|Morphology of the NP {{precursor}} {{and of the}} NPs in the preform core was {{studied by}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM), performed with a microscope FEI Tecnai G 2 - 20 Twin using a 200 -kV acceleration voltage. For the sample preparation, either a suspension of NP precursor {{or a piece of}} preform core grinded into a fine powder was directly deposited onto a 200 -mesh Cu grid previously coated with a thin carbon membrane. These samples were then metalized with a vaporized carbon layer. Doped NPs were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (PW-XRD) using a Bruker D 8 Advance diffractometer using Cu-K radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 45 kV and 40 mA, 0.0046 ∘ 2 θ step size, and 0.5 s step time over a range of 10 to 80 ° 2 θ. The composition of the core of the preform was determined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The emission spectra of the fabricated fibers were recorded at room temperature with a Horiba Jobin-Yvon IHR 550 spectrometer coupled with a nitrogen-cooled multi-channel InGaAs detector. The near infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) was collected transversely a few centimeters after the injection point, using a continuous-wave 980 nm emitting laser diode as the excitation source. Background optical losses were measured by the <b>cutback</b> <b>method</b> with an optical fiber analyzer (PK 2210 from Photon Kinetics). Typically, fiber lengths of about 100 and 2 m were used to record the two transmission curves. Er 3 +-related absorption bands were recorded using a white light pump source together with an optical spectrum analyzer. The fiber under test (less than 5 m in length) was spliced at both ends to single-mode pigtails. Laser properties were characterized in an all-fiber laser configuration [22]. A 974 -nm pigtailed laser diode was spliced to a high-reflectivity fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with a wavelength centered at 1530 nm. This fiber was then spliced to the Er 3 +-doped fiber sample under test, and the laser cavity was hence constituted by the FBG and a cleaved end facet. The output beam was measured with a powermeter. Note that a long-pass filter was used to stop the residual pump beam. The experimental setup was calibrated {{in order to determine the}} losses induced by lens and filter. It has to be noticed that fibers compared in laser configuration were designed in order to have the same opto-geometrical characteristics: numerical aperture in the 0.2 – 0.27 range, mode field diameter of about 4 μm, and cut-off wavelength in the 1130 – 1140 -nm wavelength range. Non-saturable absorption as a function of optical power was characterized for the fiber equivalent length of about 32 -dB small signal absorption. A tunable laser source was used to adjust the probe wavelength to the fiber absorption peak wavelength (1531.2 nm). The probe beam was amplified by an EDFA and then varied by use of a variable optical attenuator. A tunable band-pass filter was used to remove the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) generated in the EDFA. The transmission curves of the EDFs were recorded as a function of the input power (Pin) varying from about − 30 to 20 dBm. The output power (Pout) and the corresponding transmission value were corrected from splice losses and from characteristics of wideband coupler placed just before the EDF in the experimental setup [23].|$|E
