5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E

500|$|Many other {{diseases}} of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] Individuals with pre-renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have kidney dysfunction due to decreased {{blood flow to the}} kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium. [...] Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. [...] Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine. [...] As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics. [...] Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of hyaline casts or muddy-brown casts in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of <b>cellular</b> <b>material,</b> as the kidneys have not been directly injured. [...] Some viral infections of the liver, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the glomerulus of the kidney. [...] Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy, caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design {{isotropic}} periodic microstructures of <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> using the bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. The goalwas to determine the optimal distribution of material phase within the periodic base cell.

The deformation of <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> under compression is not uniform, i. e., localization occurs. Many subjects concerning deformation and energy absorption are not well understood.
