50|$|Mechanically {{interlocked}} molecular architectures (MIMAs) are {{molecules that}} are connected {{as a consequence}} of their topology. This connection of molecules is analogous to keys on a key <b>chain</b> <b>loop.</b> The keys are not directly connected to the key <b>chain</b> <b>loop</b> but they cannot be separated without breaking the loop. On the molecular level the interlocked molecules cannot be separated without the breaking of the covalent bonds that comprise the conjoined molecules. Examples of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures include catenanes, rotaxanes, molecular knots, and molecular Borromean rings. Work in this area was recognized with the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Bernard L. Feringa, Jean-Pierre Sauvage, and J. Fraser Stoddart.|$|E
50|$|Regarding the {{previous}} paragraph, {{the chain of}} an iCVT forms an open loop on its variator pulley that partially covers its variator pulley such that an open section, which is {{not covered by the}} chain, exist. This is similar to a sprocket of a bicycle where there is a section of the sprocket that is covered by its chain, and a section of the sprocket that is not covered by its chain. During one complete rotation, the toothed section of the variator pulley of an iCVT passes by the open section and re-engages with the chain. Here if the transmission diameter of the variator pulley does not represent an integer number of teeth, improper re-engagement between the teeth of the variator pulley and its chain will occur. Also, the transmission diameter of the variator pulley cannot be changed while the toothed section of the variator pulley is covering the entire open section of its <b>chain</b> <b>loop.</b> Since this is similar to where a plate is glued across the open section of a <b>chain</b> <b>loop,</b> which does not allow expansion or contraction of the <b>chain</b> <b>loop</b> as required for transmission diameter change of the variator pulley. Therefore, the transmission diameter of the variator pulley has to be changed one increment during an interval where the variator pulley rotates from an initial position where a portion of the toothed section of the variator pulley is positioned at the open section of the <b>chain</b> <b>loop</b> but not covering the entire open section, to the final position where the toothed section of the variator pulley passes by the open section of the <b>chain</b> <b>loop</b> and is about to re-engage with the chain. Since it takes less than one full rotation to rotate the variator pulley from its initial position to its final position mentioned in {{the previous}} sentence, the transmission diameter of the variator pulley has to be changed one increment within less than one full rotation.|$|E

50|$|Prong collars are {{a series}} of metal links that fit {{together}} by connecting through blunt, prongs that point inward toward the dog's neck. The design of the prong collar incorporates a <b>chain</b> <b>loop</b> connecting the ends of the prong series, such that it has a limited circumference (a martingale), unlike choke chains, which do not have a limit on how far they can constrict on a dog's neck. The leash attaches to this chain section. The limited traction of the martingale chain combined with the angle of the prongs prevents the prongs moving close enough to pinch. The collar is designed to prevent the dog from pulling by applying pressure at each point against the dog's neck. There are also prong collars that buckle and do not restrict.|$|E
40|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are characterized}} by repetitive synchronous neuronal bursting activity.

Using this simulated loop model, one can demonstrate that an external stimulus that normally can initiate repetitive activity can terminate the bursting activity when applied to a <b>chain</b> <b>loop</b> of sub-networks, which has actively propagating bursts. The ability of external currents to terminate activity is dependent upon loop length and the timing of the applied external stimulus.

40|$|Ph. D., Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 2006. Objectives. Autoantibodies to the 65 kDa isoform of {{glutamic acid}} decarboxylase (GAD 65 Abs) are {{accepted}} markers for type 1 diabetes and, together with autoantibodies to insulin (IAA) and a protein tyrosine phosphatase-like islet cell antigen (IA- 2), predict the disease. IAA are often the first autoantibodies detected in type 1 diabetics and can be present {{before the onset of}} clinical diabetes. These autoantibodies and their epitopes are however not well characterized. We explored the use of monoclonal antibodies and their recombinant Fab (rFab) as reagents for epitope analysis. Methods and Results. Four rFab specific for insulin were cloned from murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 1 E 2, HB- 126, HB- 123, HB- 127, and one rFab specific for GAD 65 was cloned from human mAb IgG antibody DP-D (derived from autoimmune disease patients), to characterise insulin and GAD 65 autoantibodies present in the sera of patients with type 1 diabetes. Only rFab 126 and DP-D showed insulin and GAD 65 specific binding, respectively in radiobinding assays. In competition experiments with sera positive for autoantibodies to insulin the rFab 126 significantly reduced the binding to 125 I-insulin by sera of type 1 (n= 35) and type 1. 5 diabetes (or LADA) (n= 14) patients (p< 0. 0001). There was no difference in the competition pattern in IAA positive type 1 diabetes patients (n= 35) and IAA positive type 1. 5 diabetes patients (n= 14). The insulin epitope that the rFab binds to was mapped using competitive radiobinding assays with two monoclonal antibodies (mAb 1 and mAb 125) whose epitopes are on the B chain and A <b>chain</b> <b>loop</b> of insulin, respectively. We found the epitope of this recombinant antibody to be located on the A <b>chain</b> <b>loop</b> of the insulin molecule. The 3 -dimensional structure of rFab 123, 126 and DP-D were determined using an automated homology modelling programme. Using the computer programme ‘PatchDock’ we attempted to further map the epitope that rFab 126 binds to on insulin. Of the three models generated, only one supported our findings that rFab 126 binds to the A <b>chain</b> <b>loop</b> of insulin. The binding of GAD 65 Ab in 61 type 1 diabetes patients to GAD 65 was analyzed by competitive radioimmunoassays with rFab DP-D to ascertain disease-specific GAD 65 Ab binding specificities.

40|$|Abstract—There is a significant, {{established}} code base in {{the scientific}} computing community. Some of these codes have been parallelized already but are now encountering scalability issues due to poor data locality, inefficient data distributions, or load imbalance. In this work, we introduce a new abstraction called <b>loop</b> <b>chaining</b> in which a sequence of parallel and/or reduction loops that explicitly share data are grouped together into a chain. Once specified, a <b>chain</b> of <b>loops</b> {{can be viewed as}} a set of iterations under a partial ordering. This partial ordering is dictated by data dependencies that, as part of the abstraction, are exposed, thereby avoiding inter-procedural program analysis. Thus a <b>loop</b> <b>chain</b> is a partially ordered set of iterations that makes scheduling and determining data distributions across loops possible for a compiler and/or run-time system. The flexibility of being able to schedule across loops enables better management of the data locality and parallelism tradeoff. In this paper, we define the <b>loop</b> <b>chaining</b> concept and present three case studies using <b>loop</b> <b>chains</b> in scientific codes: the sparse matrix Jacobi benchmark, a domain-specific library, OP 2, used in full applications with unstructured grids, and a domain-specific library, Chombo, used in full applications with structured grids.
