5|$|For any graph G = (V,E), we may {{define a}} matroid {{on the edges}} of G, in which a set of edges is {{independent}} if and only if it forms a pseudoforest; this matroid is known as the bicircular matroid (or bicycle matroid) of G. The smallest dependent sets for this matroid are the minimal connected subgraphs of G that have more than one cycle, and these subgraphs are sometimes called bicycles. There are three possible types of bicycle: a theta graph has two vertices that are <b>connected</b> <b>by</b> three internally disjoint paths, a figure 8 graph consists of two cycles sharing a single vertex, and a handcuff graph is formed by two disjoint cycles <b>connected</b> <b>by</b> a path.|$|E

5|$|One Ferugliotherium tooth {{is thought}} to be a first upper molariform (MF1). It is almost {{rectangular}} and bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. There are five cusps in the middle row, which is oriented obliquely, four cusps in one of the rows {{on the side of the}} tooth, and two or three in the other row on the side. As in the lower molariforms, the cusps are <b>connected</b> <b>by</b> transverse ridges and separated by furrows. LACM 149371, the enigmatic possibly ferugliotheriid tooth from Peru, is a triangular tooth bearing six or seven cusps, which are <b>connected</b> <b>by</b> crests and surround two deep fossae (basins) and a third shallower fossa.|$|E
