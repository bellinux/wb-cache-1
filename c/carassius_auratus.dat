5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (<b>Carassius</b> <b>auratus)</b> appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} surveys found that {{introduced}} fish species, in particular European carp (Cyprinus carpio), goldfish (<b>Carassius</b> <b>auratus)</b> and eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki), dominate waterways within the park. Introduced fish species {{pose a threat}} to native fish species as predators, competitors, disease carriers and through modification of habitat and are thought to be a significant contributor to reductions in native fish species abundance in the Murrumbidgee catchment. Predation by European carp may also contribute to the decline in the southern bell frog population in Lowbidgee.|$|E

The key features of C. <b>auratus</b> <b>carassius</b> hybrids are their bisexual structure, males and diploid females fertility, and the limited reproduction capacity of tri- and tetraploid females. The cyto- and morphometric descriptions of hybrid forms and paternal species are given, and the phenodeviations that are much more frequently discovered within hybrids are analyzed...|$|R

First imported into Europe around 1728, it was much fancied by Chinese nobility as early as 1150AD and after it arrived there in 1502, also in Japan.

Lead induced an increase in nuclear heterochromatin and alterations in mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex ultrastructure.

40|$|The {{presence}} of immunoreactive pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) -derived peptides (adrenocorticotropin hormone, beta-endorphin, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) and of cytokine-like molecules [interleukin (IL) - 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, IL- 2, IL- 6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha] was demonstrated in periodic acid-Schiff-positive epithelial {{cells in the}} thymus of the goldfish (<b>Carassius</b> c. <b>auratus)</b> using immunocytochemical procedures. POMC-derived peptide- and cytokine-like molecules were localized in the same cell type. Lymphocytes were negative for all the above mentioned molecules.

40|$|The {{effect of}} acute lead {{intoxication}} (5 mg l- 1) {{on the structure}} and function of the gills in <b>Carassius</b> <b>carassius</b> var. <b>auratus</b> was studied. The gills absorbed Pb very quickly and the storage increased progressively in the longest treated specimens. Light and electron microscopy observations on gill filaments from unexposed fish showed in organization similar to that described for other teleosteans. Gill histological and cytological alterations induced by lead were detected after 24 h of treatment and became more evident after 48 h. The salient changes were the following: 1) free parts of secondary lamellae increased in length and had irregular outlines; 2) an increased number of mucocytes, prevalently distributed over the superficial layer of the primary epithelium; 3) chloride and epithelial cell ultrastructure were particularly damaged; the degenerating chloride cells were more numerous; 4) K+-NPPase activity was not particularly affected; on the contrary, Ca 2 +-ATPase increased particularly in chloride cells...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} fungal infections in four species of carps including goldfish, <b>Carassius</b> (C.) <b>auratus</b> L.; silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys (H.) molitrix Richardsons; rahu, Labeo (L.) rohita Hamilton and Ctenopharyngodon (C.) idella Valenciennes. Nine specimens of each species were studied for the presence of fungal infections. Infected fishes showed clinical signs such as fungal growth on skin, fins, eyes, eroded fins and scales, hemorrhages on body surface and abdominal distension. The specimens from infected organs of fish were inoculated on each, malt extract, Sabouraud dextrose and potato dextrose agars. The fungal colonies of white, black, green, grey and brown colors were observed in the agar plates. Slides were prepared and stained with 0. 05 % Trypan blue in lactophenol. C. auratus showed the highest infection rate (44. 4 %) followed by H. molitrix and L. rohita (11. 1 % each). Five fungal species viz. Aspergillus (33. 3 %), Penicillium (22. 2 %), Alternaria (27. 7 %), Blastomyces spp (11. 1 %) and Rhizopus (5. 5 %) were isolated. Posterior part of the fish had significantly (P= 0. 05) higher (62. 5 %) infection as compared to anterior part (37. 5 %). The caudal fin with 31. 25 % infection was the single most affected area. This study showed that most of the fungi isolated from fishes are considered as normal mycoflora, yet many fungi can cause natural infections in ponds and aquarium...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} {{experimental}} lead pollution on gut endocrine cells have been determined in the goldfish Carassius <b>carassius</b> (L.) var. <b>auratus</b> by immunocytochemical reactions. In the mucosa and submucosa, only vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- and 5 -HT-like immunoreactive nerve fibers were observed. Endocrine cells displaying immunoreactivity against gastrin, CCK 8, metenkephalin, bombesin, neuropeptide Y, pancreatic polypeptide, substance P, secretin, somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide antibodies were detected. No immunoreactivity against glucagon, insulin and 5 -HT antibodies was revealed in the endocrine cells. Some modifications appeared evident in the endocrine cells 48 - 96 h after lead intoxication, and can be summarized as follows: 1) discharge of secretory granules (secretin- and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like peptides), up {{to the extent that}} the cells appeared to be depleted of secretory material; 2) increase of immunoreactivity in the endocrine cells (met-enkephalin- and pancreatic polypeptide-like peptides) or in the frequency of positive cells (met-enkephalin-like peptide); 3) no variations (gastrin-, CCK 8, bombesin-, somatostatin- and substance P-like peptides). The alterations were not enhanced by long term treatment. Nerve fibers did not show modifications...|$|R

50|$|Tong and his {{researchers}} {{began to}} work in the 1970s on issues about the relative importance of the nucleus and cytoplasm for development, issues not directly addressed by his earlier experiments. The subjects he chose for the follow up studies were again organisms form <b>Carassius</b> <b>auratus</b> and Rhodeus sinensis. Tong transplanted the nucleus of an embryonic cell from Rhodeus sinensis into a <b>Carassius</b> <b>auratus</b> egg, for which the nucleus had been removed. The researchers found that some of the resultant clone cells in the juvenile fish had traits previously found just in Rhodeus sinensis. In 1973, Tong published these results, arguing that both the nucleus and cytoplasm of the zygote codetermine the trait of the organism.|$|E
