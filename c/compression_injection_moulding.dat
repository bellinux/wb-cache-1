The increase in toughness differed not only between <b>compression</b> and <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> samples, but also between samples with different position in an <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> bar, and injected with different temperature during the <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> process.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the lightweight}} potential of long fibre-reinforced and local continuous fibre-reinforced foam <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> components. Using the LFT-D foam process and breathing mould technology, long glass fibre-reinforced polypropylene foams were manufactured with a constant weight {{per unit area}} and varying density reductions. As the area moment of inertia increases with the wall thickness to the third power, in these investigations small density reductions were sufficient to increase the flexural rigidity by several hundred percent compared to a compact reference sample. The fibre length advantage generated by the direct process (<b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> compounding) also meant that even at higher density reductions the ductility was not reduced by the foaming. In order to achieve even better mechanical properties, foam <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> can be combined with local continuous fibre reinforcement. To demonstrate the existing potential, sandwich integral foam components with local continuous fibre-reinforced facing were in-situ produced in an <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> and characterised. Fully consolidated tape blanks and self-reinforced PP fabrics were positioned {{on both sides of the}} cavity and heated. Afterwards a gas-loaded melt was injected between them. A short embossing stroke generated sufficient interfacial adhesion between the facing layers and the core material, and the foaming process was initiated by the pressure drop resulting from the precision opening of the <b>injection</b> <b>compression</b> <b>mould...</b>|$|R
40|$|Amorphous {{fluorocarbon}} polymers {{are attractive}} materials for optical applications {{because of their}} high transparency at wavelengths up to 3 mu m due {{to the absence of}} C-H bonds. DuPont's amorphous fluoropolymer Teflon AF has been available since 1989, and Teflon AF films can be fabricated by spin, spray, or dip coating from solution or by use of <b>compression</b> or <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> from the melt. An alternative and promising route for processing fluorocarbon films is the use of a low-pressure plasma. This technique can be employed for plasma polymerization of suitable fluorocarbon monomers and for controlled etching of fluorocarbon materials. In the present work, we present the characteristics of plasma-polymerized tetrafluoroethylene layers with a refractive index of approximately 1. 4. Reactive ion etching in an N 2 O plasma is used for patterning these layers, and also the spin-coated Teflon AF films with a refractive index of around 1. 3.

Os efeitos da concentração (5 - 25 % em peso) e granulometria (1200 a 180 mm) dos resíduos nas propriedades mecânicas destas blendas, foram avaliados e as suas superfícies de fratura examinadas. Ficou evidenciado que a resistência à tração tende a diminuir e a resistência ao impacto aumentar conforme o teor de borracha aumenta e a granulometria diminui. A análise morfológica das superfícies de fratura confirma estes resultados. As amostras obtidas pelo processo de injeção apresentaram maior uniformidade e, consequentemente, melhores propriedades mecânicas.

Melt mixed composites are composed of different MWCNT materials (0 - 5 wt. %) and a maleic anhydride-modified isotactic polypropylene (iPP-MA) matrix. MWCNT modification included ball milling and reactive ball milling of the as-synthesised MWCNT material. Structure-property-relations were studied by means of spectroscopic and microscopic methods, X-ray scattering, thermal analysis, tensile testing, and modelling of the MWCNT reinforcement effect. Percolation thresholds and reinforcement efficiency of the MWCNT materials originated from their different length and primary agglomerate structure. The crystalline morphology of the iPP-MA resulting from the incorporated MWCNTs and the applied processing conditions dominated the isotropic and anisotropic mechanical behaviour of the composites. Furthermore, the state of MWCNT macroscale dispersion stemmed from the size of their primary agglomerates and determined the ductility of the composites, whereas the stiffness was influenced by the MWCNT structure. In summary, it was shown that the MWCNT structure as well as the conditions during composite processing significantly determined the structure-property-relations in the iPP-MA/MWCNT composites...|$|R

The former show longer duration performance, {{on the other}} hand they induce high pressure drops during operation. The latter have preferable fluid dynamic performance but do not display high durability. The potential of Polymeric Heart Valves (PHVs) is to combine the haemodynamic properties of biological valves with the durability of mechanical valves.

Methods and Materials: Total 120 specimens (65 × 10 × 3 mm 3), 40 specimens of each material (Valplast, Meliodent <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> and <b>injection</b> <b>moulding)</b> were immersed in denture cleansers having different PH; Valclean (Acidic), Clinsodent (Basic) and Polident (Neutral) as well as Distilled Water.

A flexural 3 -point bending test {{was carried out by}} using an Instron universal testing machine after 6 months of soaking. Data were analyzed using SPSS software Results: Maximum effect on colour stability was noted with Clinsodent followed by Valclean. Least color changes were observed after immersion in Polident. Colour difference was increased significantly as the immersion time increased. For both Meliodent and Nylon resins, statistically significant change in flexural strength occurred with immersion in all denture cleansers. Clinsodent has greater effect as compared to Valclean and Polident.

Design/methodology/approach: Powder metallurgy, powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding,</b> sintering, microstructure examination, symulation of <b>injection</b> <b>moulding.</b> Findings: Simulation of powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> was preceded by the rheological tests, which made obtaining possible of the data indispensable for modelling, pertaining to the polymer-powder slurry viscosity. The portion of particles reinforcing the composite is usually lower than powder portion in mixtures used for forming and next binding agent degradation and sintering. The big powder portion is often the reason for the high viscosity of the mixture and problems with its forming.

Most polymers may be used, including all thermoplastics, some thermosets, and some elastomers. <b>Injection</b> <b>moulding</b> industry is used to create many things such as milk cartons, packaging, bottle caps, automotive dashboards, pocket combs, and most other plastic products available today. Parts made from blow moulding are plastic, hollow, and thin-walled, such as bottles and containers that are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. These study is about the process, equipments, materials and applications involve <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> and blow moulding technology. At the same time it’s also discuss about the advantage and disadvantage of both manufacturing technology...|$|R
