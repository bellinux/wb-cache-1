5|$|Saffron {{made its}} way to the New World when {{thousands}} of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to Americain a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia <b>commodities</b> <b>exchange</b> was set equal to that of gold.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{quantities}} of cotton {{began to be}} used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton fustians, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance. The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The Bridgewater Canal, Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at Worsley to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton. Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns. A <b>commodities</b> <b>exchange,</b> opened in 1729, and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce. In 1780, Richard Arkwright began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill. In the early 1800s, John Dalton formulated his atomic theory in Manchester.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the first}} legal {{arrangements}} in the Ottoman Empire {{were carried out}} in 1886, {{it is known that}} some attempts were made before this date to establish a <b>commodity</b> <b>exchange</b> in İzmir. It is also known that the building belonging to a tradesman called Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi was used as “the grain exchange” just before the 1890s. The arguments to establish a modern <b>commodity</b> <b>exchange</b> based on a legal status and conforming to certain rules were brought forward in the early 1890s. In 1891, two different <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges</b> were attempted to be established by two different tradesmen, however, the General <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange</b> regulations specified only one <b>commodity</b> <b>exchange</b> in each city.

25|$|Europeans {{introduced}} saffron to the Americas when immigrant {{members of}} the Schwenkfelder Church left Europe with a trunk containing its corms. Church members had grown it widely in Europe. By 1730, the Pennsylvania Dutch cultivated saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the Philadelphia <b>commodities</b> <b>exchange</b> was equal to gold. Trade with the Caribbean later collapsed {{in the aftermath of}} the War of 1812, when many saffron-bearing merchant vessels were destroyed. Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes.
