25|$|As {{with metal}} casting and stereotyping, a mold is first formed from the model. Since {{electrotyping}} involves wet chemical processes and is done near room temperature, the molding material can be soft. Materials such as wax, gutta-percha (natural latex), and ultimately ozokerite were used. The mold's surface is made electrically conducting by coating it very thinly with fine graphite powder or paint.

25|$|The surface plasmon {{polariton}} (SPP) is an electromagnetic {{surface wave}} that travels along an interface between two media with different dielectric constants. It exists under {{the condition that}} the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as is the case for the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium below the plasma frequency. The wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property called evanescence. Since the wave is on the boundary of a lossy conductor and a second medium, these oscillations can be sensitive to changes to the boundary, such as the adsorption of molecules by the <b>conducting</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

Mainly based on the electro-induced polymerization of dissolved electro-active monomers on metallic or semiconducting surfaces, it finds applications in various fields including biocompatibility, protection against corrosion, lubrication, soldering, functionalization, adhesion, and template chemistry.

25|$|Electrotyping is {{activated}} by electric currents that flow between anode wires {{that are also}} immersed in the solution and the wire connected to the coated mold (the cathode). For copper electrotyping, a typical aqueous electrolyte contains copper sulfate (CuSO4) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and the anode is also copper; the arrangement is illustrated in the figure. The electric current causes copper atoms to dissolve from the anode's surface and to enter the electrolyte as copper ions (Cu++ in the figure). Copper ions are {{taken up by the}} mold's <b>conducting</b> <b>surface</b> at the same rate at which copper dissolves from the anode, thus completing the electrical circuit. When the copper layer on the mold grows to the desired thickness, the electric current is stopped. The mold and its attached electrotype are removed from the solution, and the electrotype and the mold are separated. An animation of the electrotyping process was produced in 2011 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other metals besides copper can be electrotyped; similar procedures apply, but each different metal needs its own anode and electrolyte chemicals.|$|E
500|$|The force acts on the charged {{particles}} themselves, hence charge {{has a tendency}} to spread itself as evenly as possible over a <b>conducting</b> <b>surface.</b> The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them. [...] The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances. In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force, the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together.|$|E

40|$|The {{polarization}} {{of the electromagnetic}} vacuum is examined {{in the neighborhood of}} dielectric and <b>conducting</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the energy associated with this polarization is shown to depend on a cutoff related to the microstructure of the boundary. The appearance of the cutoff permits the vacuum energy to be expressed in terms of a surface tension and certain higher shape tensions. For the case of a dielectric boundary the surface tension reproduces the Schmitt-Lucas formula which accounts reasonably for the observed surface tensions of many materials. The curvature tension is also calculated and it seems the effect of this energy may well be accessible to experimental verification. For the case of perfectly <b>conducting</b> <b>surfaces</b> the first four shape tensions are calculated.

A thinner rod was now {{connected}} with the negative conductor {{in place of the}} larger one (1468.), its termination being gradually diminished to a blunt point, as in fig. 124; and it was beautiful to observe that, notwithstanding the variation of the brush, the same general order of effects was produced. The end gave a small sonorous negative brush, which the approach of the hand or a large <b>conducting</b> <b>surface</b> did not alter, until it was so near as to produce a spark. A fine point opposite to it was luminous at a distance; being nearer it did not destroy the light and sound of the negative brush, but only tended to have a brush produced on itself, which, at a still less distance, passed into a spark joining the two surfaces.|$|E
6000|$|... 1425. The brush is {{the next}} form of {{disruptive}} discharge which I shall consider. There are many ways of obtaining it, or rather of exalting its characters; and all these ways illustrate the principles upon which it is produced. If an insulated conductor, connected with the positive conductor of an electrical machine, have a metal rod 0.3 of an inch in diameter projecting from it outwards from the machine, and terminating by a rounded end or a small ball, it will generally give good brushes; or, if the machine be not in good action, then many ways of assisting {{the formation of the}} brush can be resorted to; thus, the hand or any large <b>conducting</b> <b>surface</b> may be approached towards the termination to increase inductive force (1374.): or the termination may be smaller and of badly conducting matter, as wood: or sparks may be taken between the prime conductor of the machine and the secondary conductor to which the termination giving brushes belongs: or, which gives to the brushes exceedingly fine characters and great magnitude, the air around the termination may be rarefied more or less, either by heat or the air-pump; the former favourable circumstances being also continued.|$|E
60|$|The most {{familiar}} exemplification {{of the phenomenon}} to be investigated is the following. Around the prime conductors of an electrical machine the atmosphere to some distance, or any <b>conducting</b> <b>surface</b> suspended in that atmosphere, {{is found to be}} in an electric condition opposite to that of the prime conductor itself. Near and around the positive prime conductor there is negative electricity, and near and around the negative prime conductor there is positive electricity. When pith balls are brought near to either of the conductors, they become electrified with the opposite electricity to it; either receiving a share from the already electrified atmosphere by conduction, or acted upon by the direct inductive influence of the conductor itself: they are then attracted by the conductor to which they are in opposition; or, if withdrawn in their electrified state, they will be attracted by any other oppositely charged body. In like manner the hand, if brought near enough to the conductor, receives or gives an electric discharge; now we have no evidence that a charged conductor can be suddenly discharged unless by the approach of a body oppositely electrified. In the case, therefore, of the electric machine, it appears that the accumulation of electricity in an insulated conductor is always accompanied by the excitement of the contrary electricity in the surrounding atmosphere, and in every conductor placed near the former conductor. It does not seem possible, in this case, to produce one electricity by itself.|$|E
