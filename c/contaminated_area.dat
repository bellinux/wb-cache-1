5|$|It is {{not known}} what human organs are {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous {{to the environment and}} humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the <b>contaminated</b> <b>area</b> should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E

25|$|People {{who lived}} in the PFOA <b>contaminated</b> <b>area</b> around DuPont's Washington Works Washington, WV {{facility}} were found to have higher levels of PFOA in their blood from drinking water.

Individuals who drank more tap water, ate locally grown fruits and vegetables, or ate local meat, were all associated with having higher PFOA levels. Residents who used water carbon filter systems had lower PFOA levels.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} legal issues concerning <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas</b> (land and water areas polluted by industrial or other human activities). It focuses on legal obligations {{on the various}} parties who {{have been involved in}} the activities causing the pollution, or in other ways are connected to such areas. Certain prerequisites determine the examination. First, the overriding aim is to discuss a legal basis for efficient remediation of <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas</b> that, as regards this specific environmental problem, could contribute to a sustainable development in the future. Secondly, as the problem with <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas</b> is immense, legal solutions must be subject to the limits of national economy. Thirdly, any proposed obligation must conform to the "Polluter Pays Principle" and must also be accepted as just and fair by the society. Fourthly, presumably the problems with <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas</b> will remain for a substantial period. Thus, on one hand the study concerns the liability of the polluter to remediate contamination in a way that eliminates the risks for man and the environment in the future. On the other hand, the discussion relates to the responsibilities of others than the polluter - typically the landowner - to prevent contaminants spreading into the surroundings. Fifthly, the discussions are based on the idea that public environmental authorities should possess efficient legal remedies in order to impose requirements on polluters and landowners to investigate and remediate <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas.</b> The methodology used in the study is environmental legal and comparative. Legal issues are defined and solutions are proposed taking into account both the specific environmental conditions and the results from a comparison of legal rules for <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas</b> in a number of European countries. The study includes two parts. The first part describes and analyses the legislation concerning <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas</b> in four different countries: Sweden, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (England and Wales) and Denmark. It also presents briefly the legislation in this area in some other European countries and the EC White Paper on environmental liability. The second part analyses and discusses certain typical legal "key-issues" related to the problem with <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas.</b> It first approaches certain basic legal issues related to the specifies of contaminated areas: the scope of legislation for <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas,</b> the ambition of environmental measures, the use of environmental quality standards ("trigger values"), the function and legal effects of registration, finally, the content and scope of the legal duties to investigate and remediate. After that follows a discussion of certain, especially important issues related to the management of contaminated areas: the difference between a public law perspective and a private law perspective, the liabilities and responsibilities of a polluter and a landowner and, finally, legal complications related to old pollution, in particular the question if a person could be held liable for pollution that occurred before a legal requirement to remediate <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas</b> entered into force (retroactivity) ...|$|R

25|$|In contrast, the Sydney Olympic Games of 2000 {{provided}} an opportunity to improve a highly <b>contaminated</b> <b>area</b> known as the Homebush Bay site. A study commissioned by the New South Wales Government Olympic Coordination Authority, which {{was responsible for the}} Games’ site preparation, looked at soil contamination prior to the Games. The work assessed soils that had been previously impacted by waste and identified areas that could pose a risk to the environment. Soil metal concentrations were found to be high enough to potentially contaminate groundwater. After risk areas were identified, a remediation strategy was developed. Contaminated soil was consolidated into four containment areas within the site, which left the remaining areas available for recreational use. Also, the contained waste materials no longer posed a threat to surrounding aquifers. Sydney’s winning Olympic bid provided a catalyst to undertake the “greenest” single urban remediation ever attempted in Australia.|$|E

2500|$|Bioremediation is a {{technique}} that uses microorganisms in order to remove or extract certain waste products from a <b>contaminated</b> <b>area.</b> [...] Since 1991 bioremediation has been a suggested tactic to remove impurities from water such as alkanes, perchlorates, and metals. [...] The treatment of ground and surface water, through bioremediation, with respect to perchlorate and chloride compounds, has seen success as perchlorate compounds are highly soluble {{making it difficult to}} remove. [...] Such success by use of Dechloromonas agitata strain CKB include field studies conducted in Maryland and the Southwest region of the United States. [...] Although a bioremediation technique may be successful, implementation is not feasible as there is still much to be studied regarding rates and after effects of microbial activity as well as producing a large scale implementation method.|$|E
40|$|Background: Radiation has {{negative}} effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately {{from the effects of}} radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in maleskewed adult sex ratios. Methodology/Principal Finding: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas,</b> implying that adult survival rates were reduced in <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas,</b> and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas.</b> In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas</b> where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most <b>contaminated</b> <b>areas</b> because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for area...|$|R
