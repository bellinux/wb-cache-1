40|$|Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) {{combines}} {{two techniques}} providing increased separation capacity and enhanced capability for chemical identification. One {{of the most}} important methods for chemical identification is library search, which searches for an unknown mass spectrum in a library of known mass spectra to produce a list of potential matches ordered by match quality. Applications of compound identification include environmental monitoring, forensics, security, food and medicine. ^ This dissertation presents a new information-theoretic mass spectral library search technique for compound identification in GCxGC-MS and other MS applications. The method is based on a similarity measure between an unknown spectrum and a library spectrum involving the probability distribution functions of <b>the</b> intensities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> library and <b>the</b> noise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> data. The new method characterizes the library with an array of probability distribution functions of intensities as a function of mass-to-charge ratio. Each probability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution function characterizes the fraction of spectra <b>in</b> <b>the</b> library having that intensity value at the given mass-to-charge ratio. The instrument noise is modelled with parameters estimated by statistically analyzing within individual GCxGC-MS peaks the intensity variations at each mass-to-charge ratio. ^ Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the new information-theoretic mass spectral library search technique. In simulation experiments, random spectra from the NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library were corrupted with synthetic noise to generate random test spectra. Then, the corrupted spectra were submitted as unknowns for the library search using different search techniques. Experiments evaluated search performance with additive signal-independent noise, signal-dependent noise, (Johnson) colored noise, and spectral noise (from another spectrum selected randomly from the library). Other experiments evaluated search performance for real GCxGC-MS data. Search techniques were evaluated for many trials under each experimental condition by the Average Rank of <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> match <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordered</b> list of potential matches returned by the respective search techniques. ^ The new information-theoretic mass spectral library search technique performs better than NIST MS Search and Probability Based Matching (PBM) for all noise models; that is, the new search technique ranked <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> spectrum higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordered</b> list of potential matches than NIST MS Search and PBM for all noise models. In experiments with real data from GCxGC-Time-of-Flight-MS instruments and GCxGC-Quadrupole-MS instruments, the noise parameters were estimated by statistical analysis of mass spectral variations in multiple spectra of GCxGC-MS peaks and the weighted mean spectra of the peaks (added to the library as <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> match). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> experiments with real data, the information-theoretic mass spectral library search technique worked better than NIST MS Search and PBM in most cases. ^ Keywords. information theory, library search, compound identification, mass spectrum, noise model, similarity measure. ...|$|R
40|$|A good {{indicator}} {{of whether a}} person really knows the context of language {{is the ability to}} use <b>in</b> <b>correct</b> <b>order</b> <b>the</b> appropriate words <b>in</b> a sentence. <b>The</b> “scrambled ” words cause a meaningless and ill formed sentences.

This paper presents an approach for repairing word order errors in text by reordering words in a sentence and choosing the version that maximizes the number of trigram hits according to a language model. The novelty of this method concerns the use of an efficient confusion matrix technique for reordering the words. The comparative advantage of this method is that works with a large set of words, and avoids the laborious and costly process of collecting word order errors for creating error patterns. 1...|$|R

40|$|Several {{techniques}} {{have been introduced}} to display meso-structure surface details to enhance the appearance of complex surfaces. One strategy is to avoid altogether costly semi-transparency in interactive contexts. However when dealing with hierarchical surface representations (important to filtering) and complex light transfers, semi-transparency must be treated. We propose a method that combines in a novel way multiple techniques from hardware rendering and volume visualization in order to render on current graphics hardware semitransparent meso-structure surface details stored in a 3 D texture. The texture is mapped to an outer shell defined by tetrahedra extruded from the surface triangular mesh.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the effect of hearing the {{learning}} materials during sleep on the verbal learning. Ss of the experimental group heard verbal materials which were sounded by a tape-recorder during sleep, state of which was monitored by EEG. The materials were 10 nonsense syllables. At 30 minutes after the presentation of the materials Ss were awaked and were asked to memorize the materials. The materials were presented repeatedly and Ss tried to recall them after each presentation, until Ss could reach the criterion of the learning which was set as all correct responses continuing for 2 trials. Procedures of the control group were the same as that of the experimental group except no sleep. The results were as followings. 1. It was confirmed by EEG that Ss of the experimental group showed the middle sleep state or the deep sleep state before the presentation of the materials, and that the presentation of the materials changed their sleep state into the α wave or the light sleep state. In numbers of trials to reach the criterion, there was no significant difference among three groups, that is, the control group, some of the experimental group who reported having heard something during the sleep, and the others of the experimental group who reported having heard nothing during <b>the</b> sleep. 2. <b>In</b> numbers of trials to reach the criterion, there were no differences between the experimental group and the control group. 3. There was a tendency that the mean rate of <b>correct</b> responses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>order</b> of <b>the</b> experimental group was higher than that of the control group. But there was no differences between <b>the</b> two groups <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mean rate of correct responses regardless of <b>the</b> <b>order.</b> 4. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> experimental group differences between the rate of <b>correct</b> responses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>order</b> and that regardless of <b>the</b> <b>order</b> were almost constant through the learning process, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group those increased with progress of the learning.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} & submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, June 2007 GFreeway traffic congestion {{has become a major}} problem worldwide. Freeways are designed to represent the arterial connections within and between major cities around the world, thereby providing rapid flow of traffic. Unfortunately, with the increasing congestion, the travel times increase drastically and freeways can no longer serve the purpose for which they were established. With such congestion, come various serious additional problems such as pollution and high rates of accidents. This leads to big losses in time, fuel, and billions of dollars annually. Building new highways is not always a practical solution for this problem. However, seeking alternative solutions that provide more efficient operation of existing freeways can reduce congestion and introduce new services. In this respect, one of such alternatives is taking advantage of rapid advances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence to provide an advanced monitoring scheme for freeway traffic. Vehicle detection is <b>the</b> main phase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> freeway monitoring process. It has many applications in many fields such as military and civilian applications. In this thesis, artificial intelligence techniques are used to solve <b>the</b> main challenges <b>in</b> this phase. These challenges are moving vehicle shadow and occlusion between moving vehicles. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used as effective tools to solve these difficulties simultaneously. In this respect, image processing is carried out using ANN techniques to design and implement <b>the</b> proposed system. <b>In</b> this respect, offline evaluation is implemented for both frontal and lateral images. Lateral application gives the best results, so that the lateral location is chosen for real time application. Real time applications for the proposed system were implemented on two of the busiest freeways. The first freeway is King Fahd highway <b>in</b> Riyadh; and <b>the</b> other is Jeddah-Makkah highway. The results were satisfactory with promising performances. The system achieved a high <b>correct</b> detection rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 98 %. This helps in implementing new services; thus enabling the system to expand in both hardware and software without significant adjustments. This thesis is useful to applied planners, researchers, designers and freeway monitoring operators. This work was implemented by integrating hardware and software components. It opens up new horizons for traffic monitoring researchers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Master of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Fingerprints have provided a crucial source of forensic evidence {{for well over a}} century. Their power lies in an inherent ability for human identification and individualisation, which is based on two fundamental properties: uniqueness and lifelong permanence. Latent fingermarks represent by far the most evidentially common and challenging form of deposition, whereby an invisible copy of the unique friction ridge fingertip pattern is left as an amalgamated secretory residue on any surface that is touched. Dry powder dusting, the first and most iconic method for visualising or developing these deposits, was developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter part of the 19 th Century. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> period since, a great number of additional techniques, utilising physical, chemical and optical interactions in isolation or combined, have been devised for the same purpose. By selecting <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> technique <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>order,</b> it is now possible to extract significant print details from an unprecedented variety of surfaces. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> UK, such operational choices are recommended via Home Office issued protocol tables, which offer an optimum guide based on substrate type, substrate properties and fingermark conditions. Development technique specificity has improved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last half-century alongside increased biochemical understanding of residue composition, however, the shear variety of potential deposition substrates that exist within a heavily industrialised world inevitably causes disparities in efficiency, even within single protocol classifications. These effects are compounded by the enormous potential for pre- and post-deposition residue composition variation, relating to donor factors (age, sex, diet, lifestyle, etc.) and time dependant changes (environmental, biological, etc.) respectively. As a result, routine technique application can cause sub-optimal development. This research utilises high resolution imaging and analysis techniques to demonstrate how subtle surface chemistry and topography features can selectively influence routine technique efficiency within a single protocol classification (smooth, nonporous plastics). Titanium dioxide, a widely used white pigment, has been shown as prevalent in a range of polymers following SEM and EDX analysis, either in a patchy or ubiquitous distribution. SEM analysis demonstrates a strong interaction between the pigment and carbon powder suspension, which causes detrimental overdevelopment effects in off-ridge areas. ToF-SIMS mapping of a Formica substrate places a significant amount of patchy distributed titanium dioxide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top 30 nm of the surface. Mapping also indicated the presence of an aluminosilicate pigment coating; however, it’s involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possible surface potential or surface energy interaction mechanism is unknown The effects of linear surface features, which have previously been implicated in off-ridge cyanoacrylate overdevelopment on two operationally relevant polymers, were also analysed by creating a silicon wafer model for micro-FTIR analysis. Fingermark residues, including hydroxyl groups, have been shown to migrate significant distances along induced scratches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> model substrate over a 48 hr period. It is likely that observed overdevelopment along large valley-like features (uPVC) and scratches (polyethylene) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> operationally relevant polymers is caused by a similar migration of residues.
