It is known that a family of polyphase Golay sequences of length 2 ^m organizes in m!/ 2 <b>cosets</b> of a q-ary generalization of the first-order Reed-Muller code, RM_q(1,m). In this paper a more general construction technique for <b>cosets</b> of RM_q(1,m) with low PMEPR is established. These <b>cosets</b> contain so-called near-complementary sequences. The application of this theory is then illustrated by providing some construction examples. First, it is shown that the m!/ 2 <b>cosets</b> of RM_q(1,m) comprised of Golay sequences just arise as a special case. Second, further families of <b>cosets</b> of RM_q(1,m) with maximum PMEPR between 2 and 4 are presented, showing that some previously unexplained phenomena can now be understood within a unified framework. A lower bound on the PMEPR of <b>cosets</b> of RM_q(1,m) is proved as well, and it is demonstrated that the upper bound on the PMEPR is tight in many cases. Finally it is shown that all upper bounds on the PMEPR of <b>cosets</b> of RM_q(1,m) also hold for the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) under the Walsh-Hadamard transform...|$|R
