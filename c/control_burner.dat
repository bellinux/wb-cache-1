(Engineering Management) Abstract: Oxygen {{concentration}} {{measurements are}} used in different applications including energy conservation, pollution reduction and process quality control. The use of these applications is through many different technologies of instruments. Zirconia-based Oxygen Analyzers however, are commonly used for combustion <b>control,</b> <b>burner</b> optimization and {{to increase the efficiency}} of boilers and industrial heaters in order to achieve fuel conservation. In this instance, I will be exploring the ZR 22 G of Yokogawa. The ZR 22 G is like any other instrument in that; there is a possibility of failure during operation. Therefore using of logistics engineering elements and reliability techniques ensures that the ZR 22 G is supported effectively thought out its life cycle. The purpose of this dissertation is to determine the possible causes of oxygen concentration fluctuating greater or lower by 0. 5 % on ZR 22 G compared to a portable oxygen meter, and identify the risks associated with the unit reading higher or lower than the true value and determine the logistic footprint (life cycle support system) of the zirconia oxygen analyzer. The mini dissention uses a qualitative and quantitative approach, a structured questionnaire as well as an analysis of literature. The FMECA and FTA models established that a lower reading than true value is caused by indirect and direct human engagement with the unit and the use of combustible materials during the process. The FMECA and FTA models established a higher reading than true value is also a result of direct or indirect human engagement with the unit, Fly ash and the use of combustible materials during the process. It was established that the risk associated with the failure mode of the unit causes hazards and creates a costly environments. In addition, it was established that incorrect reading of the unit output can cause the process operator to actor incorrectly. Preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance are maintenance activities that are required to support the unit thought-out its life cycle. Furthermore, the use of the convection tube method decreases the effect of fly ash by prolonging the blockage of the ZR 22 G zirconia sensor. The benefit of this mini dissention is to provide users of the ZR 22 G with a guide which will assist in finding fault in the ZR 22 G moreover make them aware of risk associated with the unit not performing optimally...|$|E
40|$|This project {{led to an}} {{improved}} understanding of the mechanisms of dross formation. The microstructural evolution in industrial dross samples was determined. Results suggested that dross that forms in layers with structure and composition determined by the local magnesium concentration alone. This finding is supported by fundamental studies of molten metal surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that only magnesium segregates to the molten aluminum alloy surface and reacts to form a growing oxide layer. X-ray diffraction techniques that were using to investigate an oxidizing molten aluminum alloy surface confirmed {{for the first time}} that magnesium oxide is the initial crystalline phase that forms during metal oxidation. The analytical techniques developed in this project are now available to investigate other molten metal surfaces. Based on the improved understanding of dross initiation, formation and growth, technology was developed to minimize melt loss. The concept is based on covering the molten metal surface with a reusable physical barrier. Tests in a laboratory-scale reverberatory furnace confirmed the results of bench-scale tests. The main highlights of the work done include: A clear understanding of the kinetics of dross formation and the effect of different alloying elements on dross formation was obtained. It was determined that the dross evolves in similar ways regardless of the aluminum alloy being melted and the results showed that amorphous aluminum nitride forms first, followed by amorphous magnesium oxide and crystalline magnesium oxide in all alloys that contain magnesium. Evaluation of the molten aluminum alloy surface during melting and holding indicated that magnesium oxide is the first crystalline phase to form during oxidation of a clean aluminum alloy surface. Based on dross evaluation and melt tests it became clear that the major contributing factor to aluminum alloy dross was in the alloys with Mg content. Mg was identified as the primary factor that accelerates dross formation specifically in the transition from two phases to three phase growth. Limiting magnesium oxidation on the surface of molten aluminum therefore becomes the key to minimizing melt loss, and technology was developed to prevent magnesium oxidation on the aluminum surface. This resulted in a lot of the work being focused on the control of Mg oxidation. Two potential molten metal covering agents that could inhibit dross formation during melting and holding consisting of boric acid and boron nitride were identified. The latter was discounted by industry as it resulted in Boron pick up by the melt beyond that allowed by specifications during plant trials. The understanding of the kinetics of dross formation by the industry partners helped them understand how temperature, alloy chemistry and furnace atmosphere (burner controls [...] e. g. excess air) effected dross formation. This enables them to introduce in their plant process changes that reduced unnecessary holding at high temperatures, <b>control</b> <b>burner</b> configurations, reduce door openings to avoid ingress of air and optimize charge mixes to ensure rapid melting and avoid excess oxidation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new, efficient technique for computing first-order spatial dependence of a furnace flame. The technique, called the moving boundary flame model, creates dynamic state variables that track {{the size of}} the flame within the furnace. The approximation is appropriate for full plant training simulators, control system analysis, and engineering analyses in which a higher fidelity model than a point reactor model is needed. In comparison to the point reactor models, the one dimensional spatial dependence should improve the accuracy of distributed quantities such as heat transfer and reaction rates over the range fuel and air flow conditions that exist in normal and abnormal operation. The model is not intended to replace detailed multi-dimension flow models of the furnace. Although the flame model is a first principles model, the accuracy depends on data from a more detailed combustion simulation or experimental data for volume-averaged parameters such as the turbulent mixing coefficient for fuel and air, radiative and conductive heat transfer coefficients, and ignition and extinction conditions. These inputs can be viewed as tuning parameters used normalize the moving boundary model to a more accurate model at a particular operating point. The expected application for the model is dynamic system analysis for <b>burner</b> diagnostics and <b>controls.</b> <b>Burner</b> diagnostics and <b>controls</b> are expected to be areas for major development to reduce emissions and improve efficiency of commercial fossil fuel power plants...|$|R

40|$|Control of {{emissions}} of nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}) from coal combustion systems {{is becoming a}} major design and retrofit consideration. Most NO{sub x} in coal combustion systems comes from nitrogen in the fuel, rather than from nitrogen in the air. Practical emission <b>control</b> strategies include <b>burner</b> design strategies (e. g., low NO{sub x} burners), overfire air, reburning, selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) using reduction agents such as NH{sub 3 } or urea, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The order listed also reflects the order of increasing costs for implementation. It is therefore most economically desirable to perform burner modifications to reduce NO{sub x} emissions rather than other control measures. Low-NO{sub x} burners work {{on the principle that}} devolatilized nitrogen species will form N{sub 2 } rather than NO{sub x} under locally fuel-rich conditions with sufficient residence time at appropriate temperatures. The amount and form of nitrogen released during devolatilization influence the degree of NO{sub x} reduction attainable using burner design strategies for a given coal.
