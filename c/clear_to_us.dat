5|$|Following their {{defeat at}} the hands of the North Vietnamese Air Force, Colonel Robin Olds learned that Seventh Air Force {{intelligence}} had watched North Vietnamese MiG fighters practicing their new tactics for ten days prior to the battle of 23 August, but had not passed that information on to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing and other units. Thus, it soon became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>U.S</b> commanders that the reason the North Vietnamese repeatedly stood down their fighter force was because they were working on their new tactic. In the first half of 1967, the North Vietnamese had realized they could not directly confront U.S. fighters in air-to-air combat, so they changed their procedures for the deployment of their numerically inferior MiG units. To take advantage of the MiG-21’s speed and small size, pilots flying the type were instructed to intercept targets only at high speed behind or above U.S. strike formations.|$|E
5000|$|Terence Irwin writes: When Aristotle {{explains}} {{in general terms}} what he tries to do in his philosophical works, {{he says he is}} looking for [...] "first principles" [...] (or [...] "origins"; archai)::In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, {{all the way to the}} elements. It is clear, then, that in the science of nature as elsewhere, we should try first to determine questions about the first principles. The naturally proper direction of our road is from things better known and <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> things that are clearer and better known by nature; for the things known <b>to</b> <b>us</b> are not the same as the things known unconditionally (haplôs). Hence it is necessary for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> progress, following this procedure, from the things that are less clear by nature, but <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> towards things that are clearer and better known by nature. (Phys. 184a10-21)The connection between knowledge and first principles is not axiomatic as expressed in Aristotle's account of a first principle (in one sense) as [...] "the first basis from which a thing is known" [...] (Met. 1013a14-15). The search for first principles is not peculiar to philosophy; philosophy shares this aim with biological, meteorological, and historical inquiries, among others. But Aristotle's references to first principles in this opening passage of the Physics and at the start of other philosophical inquiries imply that it is a primary task of philosophy.|$|R

500|$|The next step, {{a hearing}} before the Georgia Supreme Court, was held on December 15. In {{addition}} to presenting the existing written record, each side was granted two hours for oral arguments. In addition to the old arguments, the defense focused on the reservations expressed by Judge Roan at the reconsideration hearing, citing six cases where new trials had been granted after the trial judge expressed misgivings about the jury verdict. The prosecution countered with arguments that the evidence convicting Frank was substantial and that listing Judge Roan's doubts in the defense's bill of exceptions was not the proper vehicle for [...] "carry {{the views of the}} judge." [...] On February 17, 1914, in a 142-page decision, the court denied Frank a new trial by a 4–2 vote. The majority dismissed the allegations of bias by the jurors, saying the power of determining this rested strictly with the trial judge except when an [...] "abuse of discretion" [...] was proved. It also ruled that spectator influence could only be the basis of a new trial if ruled so by the trial judge. Conley's testimony on Frank's alleged sexual conduct was found to be admissible because, even though it suggested Frank had committed other crimes for which he was not charged, it made Conley's statements more credible and helped to explain Frank's motivation for committing the crime according to the majority. On Judge Roan's stated reservations, the court ruled that these did not trump his legal decision to deny a motion for a new trial. The dissenting justices restricted their opinion to Conley's testimony, which they declared should not have been allowed to stand: [...] "It is perfectly <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> that evidence of prior bad acts of lasciviousness committed by the defendant... did not tend to prove a preexisting design, system, plan, or scheme, directed toward making an assault upon the deceased or killing her to prevent its disclosure." [...] They concluded that the evidence prejudiced Frank in the jurors' eyes and denied him a fair trial.|$|E

That combination—and ground support is a not insignificant part of a Shuttle cost—was a set of decisions that doomed low cost space transportation for that generation of vehicles." ...|$|E

Considering that our study focused almost entirely on inorganic materials, further studies are needed to confirm the use of organic materials (oily materials, plant or animal glues, etc.) in the preparation of Hexi painting.|$|R

2500|$|On 29 June {{the armed}} constabulary began arresting the ploughmen. Large squads pounced on the {{ploughing}} parties, who offered no resistance. Dozens a day were arrested, but their places were immediately taken by {{others who had}} travelled {{from as far away}} as Waikanae. Te Whiti directed that those of the greatest mana, or prestige, should be the first to put their hands to the ploughshares, so among the first arrested were the prominent figures Titokowaru, Te Iki and Matakatea. As Taranaki jails became full, ploughmen were sent to the Mt Cook barracks in Wellington. By August almost 200 prisoners had been taken. By then, however, the protest action seemed to be having some success, with Sheehan, the Native Minister, telling Parliament on 23 July: [...] "I was not aware ...what the exact position of those lands on the west coast was.

[...] A former Native Minister, Dr Daniel Pollen, also warned of the consequences of firmer government action against the Parihaka ploughmen: [...] "I warn my honourable friend that there are behind Te Whiti not two hundred men, but a great many times two hundred men." [...] All the prisons of New Zealand would not be big enough to hold them, he warned.|$|E
