Ray attempts to steal the key from Sabrina's discarded trousers and he sees that Sabrina is a trans woman. On the patio, Gerald points the gun into his mouth, as Eddie stumbles around in the lounge area, having accidentally pushed <b>chilli</b> <b>peppers</b> into his eyes. Ray hides under Sabrina's bed as she reenters the room; lying on a sex doll with both breasts and a penis, he is almost discovered. Eddie washes his face, and Gerald starts to play [...] "Without You". Sabrina makes her way downstairs, taking the holdall's key. Sabrina and Gerald dance.|$|E
500|$|Over the {{following}} seven days the besieged party faced constant musket fire, with fire from two artillery pieces after 28 July. When the party {{began to run}} out of water on 29 July, sepoys sneaked out of the building during the night, stole tools from their opponents and dug an [...] well in about 12 hours. When food began to run out, a small group was able to sneak out of the building on the afternoon of 30 July and return with some sheep that had been grazing within the compound. Although an attempt was made to smoke the men out of the house by making a large fire of furniture and <b>chilli</b> <b>peppers,</b> a last-minute shift in wind direction blew the smoke away from the house. Every evening, a voice loudly invited the Sikh sepoys in the house to slaughter the Europeans and join the mutineers, offering them 500 rupees each; it was met at first with sarcasm, and later by gunfire from the building. The mutineers and rebel forces did not attempt another charge on the building, although its occupants expected an attack at any moment during the siege.|$|E

40|$|Ventricina is a {{traditional}} sausage made from pork meat produced in the Abruzzi and Molise regions. The {{aim of this study}} was to detect the content of nitrates and nitrites in local cultivars of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper,</b> and their concentration in ventricina samples spiced with the same <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper.</b> Furthermore, it was examined whether, in the samples of ventricina with nitrate addition, the spicing with <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> could exceed the maximum added dose. The concentration of nitrates and nitrites in the organic <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> was 531. 0 ± 94. 6 mg/kg and less than 5. 0 mg, respectively, in the traditional <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> it was 394. 0 ± 39. 6 and less than 5. 0 mg, while in the commercial it was 325. 0 ± 115. 0 and less than 5. 0 mg. The determination of nitrites and nitrates was carried out by high performance ion chromatography. In ventricina samples produced without added sodium nitrate, nitrates and nitrites were below 5. 0 mg/kg at the case-filling time (t 0) and after 50 days of aging (t 50). In the samples of ventricina with added sodium nitrate, nitrate concentration values were 134. 0 ± 20. 9 mg/kg at t 0 and 129. 0 ± 15. 4 mg/kg at t 50, while the nitrites were below 5. 0 mg/kg at t 0 and 28. 8 ± 15. 8 mg/kg at t 50. Although in ventricina the amount of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> is quite relevant, it did not lead to a detectable concentration of nitrates. The maximum allowed amount was never exceeded...|$|R

40|$|In {{elephant}} range states human-elephant conflict (HEC) {{is considered}} a serious handicap {{to the possibility of}} peaceful coexistence between free ranging elephants and their neighbouring human communities. Among measures promoted to mitigate HEC, the use of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> as an olfactory repellent has been popularized as a passive form of deterrent. To extend its use, a gas dispenser was developed that employed ping-pong balls filled with chilli oil extract as projectiles. Following an initial test in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, in 2007, a further series of field tests was conducted in Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe over the 2009 – 2013 period to improve the dispenser and to separate off the specific effects of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper.</b> From > 300 attempts to deter problem elephants, it was possible to conclude that of the combination of noise, the impact of the projectile on the elephant and the release of a cloud of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper,</b> only the exposure to <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> functioned as an efficient deterrent. The paper discusses the problem of sourcing <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> in sufficient quantities, and describes an advanced prototype of the dispenser using an industrial moulding process. Successful integration of this new device with other more traditional mitigation approaches may increase human tolerance of elephants by teaching the latter to respect established boundaries and stay clear of farmed crops.

40|$|The {{majority}} of agricultural markets in African countries are inefficient and poorly integrated. This study therefore assessed {{the level of}} market integration and the trend analysis of selected vegetable crops in Oyo State. It also identified the leading market between rural and urban markets in Oyo state. Secondary data on the prices of fresh tomato, onion, <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper,</b> sweet pepper, and fresh pepper (2003 - 2011) were obtained from Oyo State Agricultural Development Programme and were analysed using trend analyses, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Granger causality test and index of market concentration. Results showed that the prices of onion, <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> and fresh pepper were non-stationary in their various level forms but stationary at first difference; while prices of fresh tomato and sweet pepper in urban markets were stationary at their level form at probability of 5 % respectively. The indices of market concentration for onion, sweet <b>pepper,</b> fresh <b>pepper,</b> <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> were less than one suggesting high short-run market integration, whereas fresh tomato achieved low short-run market integration. Further, urban markets were the leading markets for onion, <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> and sweet pepper, while rural markets were the leading markets for fresh tomato and fresh pepper...|$|R

40|$|This {{study showed}} that Colletotrichum acutatum penetrates the cuticle layer of Capsicum spp. fruits by forming a {{previously}} uncharacterized structure from appressoria. This unusual structure was localized in the cuticle layer. The structure, formed within 24 h post-inoculation (hpi), was a highly branched, well-differentiated hypha which penetrated the epidermal cell at 72 hpi. The novel structure, with abnormally thick walls (about 250 nm), often formed multiple branches in the affected <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper.</b> This dendroid structure, probably required for penetration, was formed exclusively in the cuticle layer of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> fruits and was not found when C. similar to acutatum was inoculated onto pepper petals, mango leaves, or fruits of tomato and aubergine. Colletotrichum acutatum produced similar dendroid structures within resistant <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> fruits, but eventually these structures turned dark brown and no further infection in the epidermal cells occurred, implicating the presence of inhibitors of the formation {{and development of the}} dendroid penetration structure in the resistant line...|$|R
