40|$|<b>Coral</b> <b>reefs</b> {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in coastal ecosystems and economics in Indonesia. The Government of Indonesia has released regulations and applied projects to manage <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> since 1978. Programs and actions to help <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> management have been carried out by national and international NGOs since early 1990 s. Unfortunately, destructive fishing practices were still continued and have increased since economic crisis in 1997. The aims of this paper are to describe the reasons of destructive fishing practices and to analysis the implementation of better fishing methods. The study shows that the lack of integrated programs among government agencies has led to the open access property right of <b>coral</b> <b>reefs.</b> The improvement of <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> uses can be implemented if de facto open access of property right of <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> is changed to the more responsible and acceptable common property right. The fishermen and fish traders, coral collectors and coral traders, and tourism operators in certain <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> area can be integrated in one institution to share the use rights and responsibilities of <b>coral</b> <b>reefs.</b> This strategy must be followed by redefinition of working mechanisms among institutions involved in <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> management...|$|R

When Keith reached the Gulf of Mexico and began re-intensifying, a hurricane warning was issued from Tuxpan to Matamoros in northeastern Mexico, with a tropical storm watch issued northward to Port Mansfield, Texas. About 3,000residents in Tamaulipas evacuated to 250shelters, and in neighboring Veracruz, about 175people left their houses before the storm struck. The threat of Hurricane Keith caused Mexican authorities to close most ports along the gulf coast, and many schools in the area were closed.|$|E

5|$|While {{stalling}} {{over the}} western Caribbean Sea, Mitch's strong winds produced strong waves, damaging local coral reefs.

5|$|After the storm, {{officials}} in Réunion declared a disaster {{area for the}} island. The government started an emergency relief fund to provide assistance to the affected families. The European Economic Community donated ₣1.42million francs ($222,000 1989USD) due to the storm. Residents on the island assisted each other by providing lodging and donating clothing. France sent 15,000ration kits, 1,500beds and blankets, and 20cisterns to the island {{in the aftermath of}} Firinga. In addition, 400troops and 50vehicles were dispatched from an insular military base in order to assist the affected populations. Within two days, crews in Réunion restored water access to about 20,000people. Conditions returned to normal in northern Réunion within about a day. In the southern portion, however, it took up to four weeks for life to return to normal. The significant amount of flooding damaged the <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> system due to excessive runoff. Due to dead animals being washed into the ocean, diving at the reefs was banned for several weeks. The waves had damaged the <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> system to such extent that there was no regrowth after seven years.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> which grew above the ocean surface.

30|$|Despite the {{important}} {{services provided by}} corals and the alarming rate on their decline, little documented baseline data exists on algal communities, which are essential tools in assessing the biological integrity of the <b>coral</b> <b>reefs.</b> Fertility and healthiness of <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> are reflected through productivity of phytoplankton (Saravanakumar et al. 2008). However studies on phytoplankton abundance and distribution in the <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> of Zanzibar is lacking. The lack of historical data on phytoplankton and water quality parameters {{have been shown to}} limit attempts to resolve the true impacts on the <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> (Johnstone et al. 1998).

5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E

50|$|In addition, a {{major concern}} for marine {{biologists}} is the effects of ecological collapse on the <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> (who based on fossil evidence are more vulnerable to extinction but also demonstrate greater resilience). An effect {{of global climate change}} is the rising sea levels which can lead to <b>reef</b> drowing or <b>coral</b> bleaching.

40|$|<b>Coral</b> <b>reefs</b> are {{important}} marine ecosystems that support extraordinary oceanic diversity. These living structures {{exist in the}} tropics and survive, in many cases, close to the upper limit of their thermal tolerance. Despite being highly complex ecologically and surviving and evolving for thousands to millions of years, <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> are highly susceptible to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Two natural disturbances in particular have significant effects on <b>coral</b> <b>reefs.</b> Tropical cyclones routinely impact areas throughout the tropical and subtropical portions of the world’s oceans, and El Nino Southern Oscillation periodically causes anomalous sea surface temperatures in various regions that support <b>coral</b> <b>reefs.</b> While <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> can recover from these natural occurrences, the presence of anthropogenic stressors frequently exacerbates the impacts and reduces or prevents recovery. Two events in particular, Hurricane Allen’s impacts to Jamaican <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> and the ENSO of 1998, illustrate this point very well. Because <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> may recover from these natural impacts {{in the absence of}} additional stressors, mitigation for these events must reduce anthropogenic activities that degrade the recovery ability of <b>coral</b> <b>reefs.</b> One measure, the creation of strategically placed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), can protect regions of high biodiversity to serve as “refugia” to repopulate degraded areas. Other measures include reducing anthropogenic activities like overfishing or coastal development that degrade reefs. Finally, more robust studies and modeling efforts can provide scientific support for enhanced public outreach as well as more strategic creation of MPAs...|$|R
