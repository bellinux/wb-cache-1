40|$|Cancer {{incidence}} during 1972 - 90 in Asian {{migrants to}} New South Wales, Australia, is described. Overall cancer incidence {{was lower than}} in the Australia born in most migrant groups, and this reached significance in migrants born in China/Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam and India/Sri Lanka, and in male migrants born in Indonesia. For the majority of cancers, rates were more {{similar to those in}} the Australia born than to those in the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> For cancers <b>of</b> the breast, colorectum and prostate, rates were relatively low in the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> but migrants generally exhibited rates nearer those of the Australia born. For cancers of the liver and cervix and, in India/Sri Lanka-born migrants, of the oral cavity, incidence was relatively high in the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> but tended to be lower, nearer Australia-born rates, in the migrants. For these cancers, environmental factors related to the migrant's adopted country, and migrant selection, appeared to have a major effect on the risk of cancer. For certain other cancers, incidence was more similar to that in the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> Nasopharyngeal cancer, and lung cancer in females, had high rates in both the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> and in migrants to Australia. Nasopharyngeal cancer rates were highest in China/Taiwan and Hong Kong-born migrants, and were also significantly high in migrants from Malaysia/Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines. Rates of lung cancer were significantly high in women born in China/Taiwan, and the excess was greater for adenocarcinoma than for squamous cell carcinoma. Melanoma had low rates in both the migrants and in the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> For these cancers, it was probable that genetic factors, or environmental factors acting prior to migration, were important in causation...|$|R
