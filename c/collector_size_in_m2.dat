40|$|A Solar Enhanced Natural Draft Dry Cooling Tower (SENDDCT) is an {{air-cooled}} hybrid {{cooling system}} that uses solar energy {{to enhance the}} cooling efficiency of natural draft dry cooling. In this paper, a three-dimensional numerical analysis was carried out using commercial software ANSYS FLUENT to investigate {{the effects of the}} introduction of a partial blockage on the cooling performance of the SENDDCT and to determine the upper limitation of increasing the solar <b>collector</b> <b>size</b> <b>in</b> the SENDDCT design with a fixed area of heat exchangers. In the simulations, the cooling capacities of SENDDCTs with the same geometric and operating parameters, such as the heat-exchanger areas and tower heights, except for different <b>collector</b> <b>sizes</b> and blockage ratios (the ratio of the blocked area to the area offered at the collector outer edge), were evaluated and a comparative analysis was performed. The results showed that for an SENDDCT with fixed heat-exchanger area, the upper limitation of increasing the solar <b>collector</b> <b>size</b> is that corresponding to a blockage ratio reaching 50 %, above which the heat dump capacity of the SENDDCT decreases with a further increase <b>in</b> the solar <b>collector</b> <b>size</b> owing to vortices generated {{at the back of the}} heat exchangers reducing the effective heat transfer area. In addition, with a distribution of small-unit heat exchangers, this effect can be significantly reduced...|$|R

Traditionally, the {{solar collectors}} have been manufactured in aluminum, copper and iron. However, under certain parameters {{in the number of}} risers and diameter of manifolds, it's possible to obtain the same thermal performance with polymer <b>collectors</b> of similar <b>size.</b> <b>In</b> addition, due to its high percentage of elongation, polymers can avoid the use of an antifreeze external valve to resist low environmental temperatures.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringDanny H. RogersCenter pivot {{irrigation}} systems {{are used in}} crop production across the state of Kansas. The American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) standard on uniformity testing of a center pivot system calls for collectors {{to be used to}} measure the water depth emitted by the irrigation system. The standard was designed without specially considering the low pressure sprinklers now commonly used on center pivot systems; the recommended collectors may not accurately measure the applied depth from these sprinklers. The <b>collector</b> <b>size</b> effect on measured water depth and measured depth variability was studied for spinning plate, fixed plate, and wobbling plate sprinkler systems. Five different <b>collector</b> <b>sizes</b> (C 2 (5. 5 cm), C 4 (10. 0 cm), C 6 (14. 8 cm), C 8 (20. 0 cm), and C 10 (27. 4 cm)) were studied using four 5 x 5 Latin squares. Each collector’s water depth was measured and statistically analyzed. Two analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of the <b>collector</b> <b>size</b> effect were reported. Past experimental results were compared to this experiment’s results. The ANOVA for the measured water depth reported no <b>collector</b> <b>size</b> effect for the spinning plate and wobbling plate systems. The ANOVA of the variability of measured depths showed significant differences between <b>collector</b> <b>sizes</b> for the spinning plate system but not for the wobbling plate system. Previous studies of spinning plate and wobbling plate systems reported acceptable variability for all <b>collector</b> <b>sizes.</b> Although some <b>collector</b> <b>sizes</b> measured significantly different mean depths, the numerical difference in mean depths was small. Any studied <b>collector</b> <b>size</b> could be used to measure the water depth of wobbling plate systems, but the C 4 collector is ideal. C 4 and C 6 collectors are ideal for measuring spinning plate systems. Significant differences between measured depths were reported for the fixed plate system. The C 10 measured significantly lower water depths than all other collectors, and the C 4 collector measured lower depths than the C 2 and C 8 collectors. The variability of mean depths was similar and high for all <b>collector</b> <b>sizes.</b> Previous experiments also indicated that different <b>collector</b> <b>sizes</b> measured different depths and had high variability of depth measurements for the fixed plate sprinkler systems. The distinct stream pattern provides a challenge for accurately measuring the water depth with these collector sizes; other methods of measuring uniformity should be considered for fixed plate sprinklers...|$|R

The present study investigates the effect of operating conditions {{on the performance of}} solar powered adsorption chiller for the climatic condition of Dhaka (Latitude 23 46 N, Longitude 90 23 E). A set of mathematical equations has been utilized to investigate the performance of the system numerically. Based on the solar radiation data, it is seen that at least 13 collectors (each of area 2. 42 m 2) are essential to achieve the required heat source temperature in the hot and humid months. It appeared during the investigation that the unit provides the cooling capacity around 10 kW at noon with base run conditions, while the system provide the solar COP around 0. 35. As the cycle time has a major effect on heat source temperature as well as on system performance, it is observed that there is an optimum cycle time for the <b>collector</b> <b>size.</b> Also, the performance of the chiller can be improved by controlling the chilled water flow rates. Therefore, it may be concluded that the <b>collector</b> <b>size</b> may be reduced by setting the optimum cycle time and the chilled water flow rate...|$|R
