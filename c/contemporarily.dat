5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} <b>contemporarily</b> and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E

25|$|In his Notes, Jefferson <b>contemporarily</b> {{described}} {{blacks as}} inherently (fixed nature) inferior to whites in critical reasoning and beauty, but superior in musical ability. Jefferson {{believed that the}} bonds of love for blacks were weaker than those for whites. According to one scholar, William Peden, this idea about fixed nature was Jefferson's rationalized justification for the racial caste of slavery.|$|E

25|$|The minimalistic {{form and}} low {{material}} costs {{as well as}} the ergonomic design of the garden furniture resulted in the Werkbund’s prize, called “Die gute Form” (the good shape). The creative possibilities of the new Eternit material led to the advertisement of a competition on garden furniture and plant containers, which was organized by the exhibition directors with collaboration from the German enterprise Eternit AG. <b>Contemporarily</b> shaped stools, pots and troughs were designed {{as a result of this}} competition.|$|E
25|$|Written {{just after}} or {{possibly}} <b>contemporarily</b> with Adomnán's Vita Sancti Columbae ("Life of Saint Columba"), the Anonymous Life {{is the first}} piece of Northumbrian Latin writing and the earliest piece of English Latin hagiography. This is an honour sometimes given to the anonymous Vita of Gregory the Great written at Whitby, though the date of 710 attributed to the latter by historian R. C. Love (in contrast to a date between 680 and 704) makes it later than the Anonymous Life of Cuthbert.|$|E
25|$|Buy Nothing Christmas is {{an ongoing}} protest and {{reaction}} to the commercialization of the North American Christmas season. It started unofficially in 1968, when Ellie Clark and her family decided to publicly disregard the commercial aspects of the Christmas holiday. <b>Contemporarily</b> a movement was created to extend Adbusters' Buy Nothing Day into the entire Christmas season. Buy Nothing Christmas first became official in 2001 when {{a small group of}} Canadian Mennonites created a website and gave the movement a name.|$|E
25|$|The {{triple jump}} (<b>contemporarily</b> hop, step and jump) {{resulted}} in a minor controversy surrounding the third Olympic spot behind Bowman and Romero; 1928 Olympic silver medalist Levi Casey placed third at the Trials, but the AOC instead selected Sol Furth, who placed fourth.

25|$|<b>Contemporarily,</b> it is {{commonly}} seen only at graduation ceremonies, but formerly academic dress was, {{and to a lesser}} degree in many ancient universities still is, worn daily. Today, the ensembles are distinctive in some way to each institution, and generally consist of a gown (also known as a robe) with a separate hood, and usually a cap (generally either a square academic cap, a tam, or a bonnet). Academic dress is also worn by members of certain learned societies and institutions as official dress.|$|E
25|$|Following Ferdinand's death, his elder son, Leopold II, succeeded him. Leopold was <b>contemporarily</b> {{acknowledged}} {{as a liberal}} monarch. Despite his merits, his subjects dismissed him as a foreigner. His affinity for Austria was equally unpalatable. In 1847, Leopold, {{following the death of}} the then-incumbent Duchess of Parma, Marie Louise of Austria, annexed the Duchy of Lucca. (A state created solely to accommodate the House of Bourbon-Parma until they could re-assume their Parmese sovereignty). The same year, a Tuscan state council was brought into being.|$|E

A variety of other contents have also been included with the balloons. Originally, these campaigns were organized by the governments and militaries of the Korean states. <b>Contemporarily,</b> however, they are mainly organized by South Korean non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that regularly involve themselves in balloon release events that aim to send materials censored in North Korea, as well as various other goods, to the North Korean people.|$|E
25|$|The {{attractions of}} Rockford are often of {{architectural}} significance. The Lake-Peterson House, constructed by alderman John Lake in 1873 and preserved by Swedish industrialist Pehr August Peterson, is a notable example of Gothic Revival. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, it is <b>contemporarily</b> {{used for the}} School of Medical Technology of the Rockford-based Swedish American Hospital. Further Swedish influence on Rockford during the Victorian era is represented in the Erlander Home Museum, {{the base of the}} Swedish Historical Society.

25|$|Diernhofer {{first used}} the name Streptococcus dysgalactiae in 1932, {{describing}} a streptococcus of veterinary origin. Subsequently, Frost reported {{the discovery of}} the human pathogen Streptococcus equisimilis in 1936. <b>Contemporarily,</b> though, Rebecca Lancefield devised a classification of streptococci based on their carbohydrate-antigens, and successively described streptococci belonging to group C (1933) and group G (1935). The correlation of group carbohydrate specificity with the proposed species S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis, however, were not explored in detail. The Lancefield classification soon became the preferred laboratory identification method for streptococci, and the names S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis fell into disuse. In 1980, they were even removed from the List of Approved Bacterial species. Three years later, though, DNA hybridization studies revealed extensive similarities between the entities Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus equisimilis, large-colony-forming group C and group G streptococcus of human origin, and certain large-colony-forming group C, G and L streptococci of animal origin. Accordingly, they were fused to one species, Streptococcus dysgalactiae. However, subsequent molecular investigations indicated heterogeneity within this new species, and in 1996 it was divided into S.dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis and S.dysgalactiae subspecies dysgalactiae.|$|E
25|$|Other Egyptologists, such as Toby Wilkinson and Rainer Stadelmann, {{identify}} Huni {{with the}} <b>contemporarily</b> well-attested king Horus-Khaba ("the soul of Horus appears"). Their identification {{is based on}} the circumstance that both kings' Horus names appear on incised stone vessels without any further guiding notes. It was a fashion that began with the death of king Khasekhemwy (end of 2nd dynasty) and ended under king Sneferu (beginning of the 4th dynasty). Thus, it was a very typical practice of the 3rd dynasty. Additionally, Stadelmann points to the Layer Pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan. This monument was possibly built by Khaba, since a nearby mastaba contained several stone vessels with his Horus name. Since the Turin Canon credits a reign of 24 years to Huni, Stadelmann argues that this time span would perfectly fit to finish the Layer Pyramid. Furthermore, Stadelmann points to the large amount of discovered mud seal impressions and stone bowls and the widespread finding spots throughout Egypt. In his opinion, the archaeological context also speaks for a longer-lasting reign. Thus, he identifies Khaba with Huni.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 2007 Palermo was {{involved}} in a controversial away Sicilian derby, suspended for 30 minutes during the second half and followed by violence outside the Catania stadium in which policeman Filippo Raciti was killed by a small explosive launched by a Catania hooligan. This was followed by a two-weeks stop to all football leagues and national team matches in the whole country. Successively to these events Palermo, then clearly third-placed, did not manage to achieve a single victory, and dropped down to sixth position in the Serie A. Club chairman Maurizio Zamparini became more critical of Guidolin and finally sacked him on April 23, 2007 following a 3-4 home defeat to third-last placed Parma which extended the run of poor results to 11 games without a single win. Assistant coach Renzo Gobbo and youth team coach Rosario Pergolizzi, appointed as caretaker coaches at Guidolin's place, led the team for two matches, a 2-1 away win at Livorno in their debut which ended the negative run and two further defeats, including an upset 3-2 away loss against last-placed team Ascoli, already relegated to Serie B at the time, which left the rosanero in seventh place, the last UEFA Cup spot, only three points above Atalanta. The events led Zamparini to revoke Guidolin's dismissal and call him back for the remaining two matches. Guidolin's return brought two victories, to Siena and Udinese, ending the season in fifth place, obtaining thus qualification to the UEFA Cup 2007-08 for the third consecutive time and breaking its previous record of 53 points of two years before. On May 31, 2007 Palermo chairman Maurizio Zamparini announced Stefano Colantuono as new rosanero coach for the 2007–08 season. The first two signings for the new season, midfielder Giulio Migliaccio from Atalanta and goalkeeper Samir Ujkani from Anderlecht, were announced on June 8. <b>Contemporarily,</b> team captain Eugenio Corini, whose contract was due to expire within a few days, announced he was going to leave Palermo. Palermo's moves in the summer market included notable signings such as Boško Janković and Fabrizio Miccoli to replace Andrea Caracciolo and David Di Michele, sold to Sampdoria and Torino respectively. A fairly unimpressive start in the season, including a shock UEFA Cup elimination against Czech minnows FK Mlada Boleslav, however convinced Zamparini to sack Colantuono after a crush 5–0 loss to Juventus, re-calling Guidolin {{at the helm of the}} rosanero. Guidolin's fourth spell as Palermo boss proved to be even more unsuccessful, as Palermo struggled in the league, falling down to thirteenth place with concerns of being unexpectedly involved in the relegation battle. A 3–2 home loss to Genoa, the third in a row for Palermo, followed by Guidolin's controversial attacks against the supporting fanbase and the club management, brought in to Colantuono being reinstated as rosanero boss on March 24, 2008.|$|E

500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeanine Basinger echoes similar sentiments on Turner's {{career in}} her book The Star Machine (2008), noting that Turner [...] "accepted limited roles and became a true sex symbol—an actress who played roles for which {{the meaning of the}} character came from a source other than the script, her own private life. She was cast only in roles that were symbolic of what the public knew—or thought they knew—of her life from headlines she made as a person, not as a movie character... Her person became her persona." [...] <b>Contemporarily,</b> she has also been frequently associated with film noir and the femme fatale archetype among scholars for her role in The Postman Always Rings Twice.|$|E
500|$|There were no {{contemporary}} censuses of London's population, but available records {{suggest that}} the population returned to its previous level {{within a couple of}} years. [...] Burials in 1667 had returned to 1663 levels, [...] Hearth Tax returns had recovered, [...] John Graunt <b>contemporarily</b> analysed baptism records and concluded they represented a recovered population. Part of this could be accounted for by the return of wealthy households, merchants and manufacturing industries, all of which needed to replace losses amongst their staff and took steps to bring in necessary people. Colchester had suffered [...] more severe depopulation, but manufacturing records for cloth suggested that production had recovered or even increased by 1669, and the total population had nearly returned to pre-plague levels by 1674. Other towns did less well: Ipswich was affected less than Colchester, but in 1674, its population had dropped by 18%, more than could be accounted for by the plague deaths alone.|$|E
500|$|Administration of the City of London was {{organised}} by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen {{and common}} councillors, {{but not all}} [...] of the inhabited area generally comprising London was legally part of the City. Both inside the City and outside its boundaries there were also Liberties, which were areas of varying sizes which historically had been granted rights to self-government. Many had been associated with religious institutions, and when these were abolished in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, their historic rights were transferred along with their property to new owners. The walled City {{was surrounded by a}} ring of Liberties which had come under its authority, <b>contemporarily</b> [...] called 'the City and Liberties', but these were surrounded by further suburbs with varying administrations. Westminster was an independent town with its own liberties, although it was joined to London by urban development. [...] The Tower of London was an independent liberty, as [...] were others.

500|$|Because of {{construction}} delays, {{the building was}} not ready for classes in September 1868, so the first classes {{of the high school}} were held at the nearby Franklin Township Hall while students in grades 1–8 remained at their old schoolhouses. [...] The new building opened on March 14, 1869 with the high school grades located in the southwest room of the second floor and the four primary grades on the first floor. [...] The third floor of the building was an open, multi-purpose room. [...] The school held its first graduation ceremony in July 1869 with a class of just one, a student named Anna Nutting. [...] Nutting later taught at the Union School and eventually became its principal, serving until 1888. [...] The Union School, which would later be known as Central School, served as the home of all Kent students until two additional elementary schools for grades 1–6 were constructed in the 1880s. [...] For most of the 1910s, all of the school buildings were overcrowded and the high school graduating classes had grown to nearly 40 students. [...] As a result, a new, separate high school building was built in 1922. [...] The Union/Central building remained in service mainly for grades K–7 until 1953, when it was closed after the completion of a new Central Elementary School on the same property. [...] It was razed in 1954.
