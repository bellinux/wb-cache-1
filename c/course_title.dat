5000|$|Recently, the {{increased}} complexity of many museums and cultural organisations has prompted {{the emergence of}} professional programs in fields such as public history, museum studies, arts management, and curating/curatorial practice. In 1992, the Royal College of Art established an MA course co-funded by the Royal College of Art and the Arts Council of Great Britain, the first in Britain to specialise in curating with a particular focus on contemporary art. The course is now funded by Arts Council England, and in 2001 the <b>course</b> <b>title</b> was amended to Curating Contemporary Art to more accurately reflect the content and primary focus of the programme. Similarly, a number of contemporary art institutions launched curatorial study courses {{as an alternative to}} traditional academic programs. Established in 1987, the École du Magasin is a curatorial training program based at the art center Le MAGASIN in Grenoble, France. Similarly, the Whitney Museum of American Art, through its independent study program, hosts a curatorial program as one of its three study areas, and de Appel arts centre has hosted a curatorial programme since 1994. Other institutions that run programs in curating include Norwich University of the Arts; The Courtauld Institute of Art, London, UK, Kingston University; Goldsmiths, University of London; Birkbeck, University of London; Chelsea College of Arts; University of the Arts London; California College of the Arts; University of Southern California; Bard College; School of Visual Arts; the École du Louvre; University of Rennes 2—Upper Brittany; OCAD University; and University of Melbourne.

40|$|Diversity {{awareness}} {{has enormous}} benefits, {{and universities in}} the United States increasingly require students to complete diversity-related courses. Prior {{research has demonstrated that}} students ’ initial attitudes toward these courses affect their subsequent engagement, as well as the quality of their learning experience; however, very little research has examined how these initial attitudes are formed. We conducted an experiment to examine this issue {{in the context of a}} women’s and gender studies course in psychology. Participants read one of two identical course descriptions that varied only the <b>course</b> <b>title</b> (i. e., Psychology of Gender versus Psychology of Women) and instructor gender. Participants perceived a women-titled course to be narrowly focused compared to an identical gender-titled course and were more interested in taking the gender-titled course. Instructor gender had no effects on any of the variables. Additionally, female participants had more positive attitudes toward the course than male participants, regardless of title. Exploratory mediation analyses indicated that the main effects of <b>course</b> <b>title</b> and participant gender were mediated by perceptions of course content. Implications for improving student experiences and interest in diversity-related courses are discussed...|$|E
